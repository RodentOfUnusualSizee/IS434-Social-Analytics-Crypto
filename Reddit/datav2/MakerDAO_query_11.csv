Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Assets within decentralized finance, namely crypto, are by far the best-performing investment class today. However, you can also lose all of your money if you’re not careful.

It’s not uncommon for a project to generate hype, only to collapse weeks later. That’s why it’s especially important for retail DeFi investors to 1. have a framework to analyze projects, and 2. apply this framework before jumping in. 

DeFi's decentralised nature lets anybody participate. It’s surprising how little technical expertise or cash is needed to bootstrap a project or token. The results can be catastrophic for investors who decide to invest without doing due diligence.

Luckily, the flipside of decentralization is that data is transparent and readily available. The data does not lie, so this is where an intelligent investor should first look.

When investigating a project, you can’t go wrong by starting with 3 metrics and 5 charts. 

* Total locked value

Chart 1: TVL Growth

Chart 2: TVL Distribution

* Market cap

Chart 3: MC/FDV Ratio

Chart 4: MC/TVL Ratio

* Token price &amp; allocation

Chart 5: Token Price Movement

&amp;#x200B;

[Monthly Total Number of DeFi ProtocolsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/mhrokaw1p5x71.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd045aa000d098653340b3f56e2a8423f95a2631)

**Total Value Locked (TVL)**

## Make sure the project has a stable TVL growth

TVL refers to the total value of assets deposited by users and locked into a protocol. More assets in a project locked means users have more confidence providing liquidity and collateral for the protocol’s economic activities. This both signal’s the market’s confidence in the project.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 10 Protocols TVL &amp; Market Cap ComparisonData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/u6bkrn95p5x71.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6091009b3d44e0a0e7a2bcfe6f654b054c14506)

As you can see, the top 10 protocols are of both huge values above $5 billion and stable TVL growth month-by-month. That indicates a project is continuing to maintain its vitality and strength.

On the other hand, when looking at weaker, less reputable projects, the picture is different. Huge TVL changes per day, with an unsustainable upward trend, usually followed by a significant drop the day after the rise.

&amp;#x200B;

[Unstable TVL ProjectsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/booakrc6p5x71.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=605867d5218e4d182116ecd838dc8ca98702492d)

## Pick projects whose TVLs are “middle-of-the-pack”

As is clear from the scatter chart below, projects are proliferating like crazy with an extremely uneven TVL distribution. There are currently over 500 DeFi projects, of which 33%have TVLs below $5 million.

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL Distribution of Protocols \(Excluding Top 10 TVL Protocols\)Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/xfmu7we7p5x71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16415aa054237ca657935a04abcbafb8edf60833)

This is one of the easiest ways to separate projects into 3 categories:

* Already “priced in” or overleveraged/overvalued 
* Completely new, unproven and risky
* Projects with potential

How should you balance risk with reward?

To be on the safe side and to prevent the risk of too small projects running away with their money, individual investors should try to select projects in the middle of the TVL range and above (around $20 million) when deciding who to invest in.

Those in the $1 million to $10 million range are suitable for seed rounds by investment institutions. Individual investors should avoid these because their future positioning and strategic direction is not clear.

While TVL projects in the $10 to 20 million range have found a suitable growth strategy and investors have access to data on this segment, in terms of stability, there is a risk of stunted growth in these projects and a high risk of weak growth or decline if growth is not sufficient.

TVL projects in the $20 million to $50 million range have, to some extent, found a clear fit in terms of product mechanics and growth, with community and technical support gradually becoming more sophisticated, and are a good choice if you want to achieve higher returns than the top protocols.

If your risk tolerance is low and your need for return is not too high, you can choose projects from the top protocols to invest in based on your preferred DeFi project category (e.g. DEX for providing liquidity, lending for lending, etc.)

Market Cap (MC) 

Market cap is the most accurate overall reflection of a project’s market value. 

This metric is calculated similarly to stocks in the traditional equity market, namely by multiplying the price of the token by the number of tokens in circulation and available for trading.

As the number of tokens is affected by circulation and supply and demand, the price of the token can change quickly. On the other hand, market cap tends to increase or decrease within a 20% range, with no sharp increases followed by precipitous crashes.

This stable quality makes market cap a good underlying indicator to evaluate projects and identify potential and worthwhile investments. 

## Avoid low MC/FDV ratios when looking for long-term holds

Fully diluted valuation (FDV) refers to the maximum supply of tokens multiplied by token price. In other words, it is equal to the market cap when all tokens have been released. 

If the MC/FDV ratio of a project's tokens is low, it means that a large number of tokens have not yet been released. This happens when 1) the protocol is newly live; 2) the total supply of the token is extremely large.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top Protocols Token MC\/FDV RatioData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/qs79wa49p5x71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b681d8f3b723826b0caa65d0376104c88c238067)

Investors should consider FDV carefully, focusing on the length of time the project has been online and the token supply schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

[Low Ratio of  MC\/FDV Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/r6j60y8ap5x71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e802665e6a75725f5fa25a19288ec724438c61)

Some examples of projects with low ratios are:

* Fruit : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.002%
* StakedZEN : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.077%
* Hanu Yokia : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.17%

The MC/FDV ratio allows investors to assess whether a token price is overheated.That’s because a low ratio indicates that the supply will eventually be higher than the actual demand once project owners release more tokens.  With the demand increasing rapidly, the price will likely drop as the market adjusts. 

Look at the chart below to see how top-ranked projects looked from a MC/FDV perspective. 

Projects with an MC/FDV ratio higher than 60% are better for long-term holding with price security almost guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price of Top ProtocolsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/9x9qam9bp5x71.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd0ede6627c8bb8f2c124dd9b47feef387d9991)

On the other hand, high MC/FDV ratio projects aren’t without drawbacks. They usually have higher entry prices. Though this isn’t always the case, analyzing the data will allow you to make better investments based on your goals. 

Curve (CRV), for example, has an MC/FDV of 11.86%. Lido, another lending project, has a lower MC/FDV at 5.54% *AND* a higher token price. So, when comparing the two, we can see that those looking for long-term DeFi lending projects to invest in should consider Curve over Lido. 

## Keep an eye out for projects with a low MC/TVL ratio

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 10 Protocols MC\/TVL RatioData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/ei7xdu2dp5x71.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a341fcfe92d3b6cfbc85661a872fc113405b13bb)

The current MC/TVL ratios of the top 10 TVL projects are almost without exception less than 1. This means that these projects are undervalued and worth investing in. Here’s why:

From an economic perspective, the higher the TVL of a project, the higher the MC should be because a high TVL indicates that investors have a high degree of confidence in the project’s economic utility. 

In other words, when investors lock in their tokens it means that they are utilizing the project rather than speculating. More utilization relative to speculation is usually a good sign. 

Therefore, investors should take a gook look at the MC/TVL ratio. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the valuation may be too high and the investability is low, while a ratio less than 1 indicates that the project is undervalued and the returns are primed to increase. 

Remember to always compare projects within the same categories for valid comparisons, and especially compare lesser known projects’ ratios from those of the top protocols.

Stable token price and reasonable token allocation mechanism

## Choose projects whose tokens are stable

Many people do DeFi investing backwards. 

They start by looking at token prices, then do research on the underlying project to justify their (often FOMO-driven) investment. 

Instead, you should have already investigated suitable projects using the metrics and indicators explained above. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 5 Protocols Token Price ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/of17hxeep5x71.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eff6e7c8c6cf4971369a081db972144a7be96b1)

After you’ve created a shortlist of projects you are interested in, screened for solid fundamentals, you can then look at the token prices. 

In crypto, “stable” is a relative term. 

At Footprint, we recommend being wary of price jumps and drops within 20%. Normally, the extreme change of price indicates an unhealthy market reaction to some news that might just be a pump.

If the token price remains relatively stable, the liquidity of the token is relatively stable also. Therefore, the possibility of damage to the project caused by a large number of individual investors selling tokens is reduced.

As with other metrics, this rule is best applied when comparing your different options on a visualization chart, as above. 

The data indicates that InstaDApp and MakerDAO are more resistant to the negative effects of a sell-off than Curve, for example.

## Summary: 5 Steps to Assess The Investability of a DeFi Project 

When looking for the next project to invest in, start with the fundamentals. Use data to compare projects within the DeFi projects you feel spanly about in your thesis. 

The takeaways:

* Stable TVL growth
* Mid-range TVL ranking or above, approximately $20M or higher
* MC/FDV ratio higher than 5%
* MC/TVL ratio less than 1
* Stable token price with monthly fluctuations under +/- 20%

For the above metrics, readers can access them directly in this featured [Footprint dashboard, entitled “How to Discover Valuable Project”](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/97bd7a34-8221-4eab-afe9-23b9a00567ec#name=How%20to%20Discover%20Valuable%20Projects%20). 

Furthermore, the tokenconomics and the team structure of a protocol are also key reasons to consider when investing.  If the percentage of tokens held by the team or foundation is too high, then there is a bigger chance that the project is a money grab.

This can easily lead to a situation where a core group of people can release tokens quickly in an attempt to “cash out”, leading to a serious dilution of the token price and an increased possibility of the tokens being sold off.  

DeFi, as a new investment market, has created more investment possibilities than traditional finance, with many worthwhile projects that are quite slept on.

However, opportunity and risk goes hand-in-hand. 

It’s important to remember that the DeFi market is inherently unpredictable, and that even the above indicators are no guarantees for long-term viability.

Oct, 2021, simon@footprint.network

Data Source：[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/008802de-e388-43d1-99fa-cf85928fbbdc/liquity-dashboard?days=past3months~&amp;name=liquity#secret=500CC586E554189EFFA21705990A5DEC)

For crypto investors, crypto loans are an effective and popular way to leverage the market if you’re going long on a DeFi project or token. 

However, while investors can find plenty of low-interest loans with various collateral options on established platforms such as Aave and Compound, there is a proliferation of new projects that claim to use innovative tools to provide better terms than these large protocols. 

Liquity is one such project. It claims to offer incredibly favorable loan terms for users, collateralized with ETH. The main purported advantages are:

* 0% interest
* Minimum collateral ratio of 110%. 
* Directly redeemable
* Liquidation loss of less than 10%
* Additional revenue through native token staking and deposit

With these claims, is Liquity too good to be true, or a truly innovative protocol with span fundamentals?

Let’s step back from the hype and examine the data. This article will help investors looking into the five claims above using analysis conducted with the Footprint platform.

**What is Liquity**

Aave and Compound, which allow users to **\[do x\]**, are currently market leaders in lending. But for those who want to do **\[y\]**, Liquity is a rapidly growing option. In March, the project got $6 million in Series A funding from **\[whom\]** and now has a TVL of about ETH400,000, or about $1.6 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

[ETH TVL（since May  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/3xa4ff79shx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=778972970402087ca6ed08dccf6e232464947bb6)

Liquity is primarily used as a lending pool where you can use ETH as collateral to receive its native stablecoin, LUSD. 

But, it also offers two other methods to help users earn additional revenue. 

1. You can deposit LUSD into a Stability Pool to get a percentage of users’ liquidated ETH from that pool in the form of Liquity’s token, LQTY. 
2. You can stake LQTY and receive about 15% when users borrow or redeem their loans. 

## Claim 1: 0% interest rate

That Liquity supports ETH only as collateral for borrowing and offers interest-free loans is claimed to be more capital efficient than other lending protocols. 

Firstly, Liquidity does in fact offer a 0% loan *in terms of interest rate*. 

However, this can be misleading as borrowers need to look at the combined borrowing rate, which is the sum of interest rates and borrowing fees.

In traditional finance, the interest rate is what the lender charges you as the price of the loan while the borrowing fee is set by, and goes partially to, the brokerage. This is similar in the world of DeFi lending, where the borrowing fee goes to the liquidity providers.

In Liquity,  the Borrowers are required to pay a so-called borrowing fee instead of interest rate. Such rate fluctuates between 0.5% - 5%, determined by the recent redeemed time and amount length and fixed cost amount.

Therefore, Liquity encourages borrowers to borrow for the long term, and does not make as much sense for short-term loans. 

## Claim 2: Minimum collateral ratio of 110%

Borrowers on Liquity must open a Trove, which is basically the protocol’s version of a Vault or CDP. 

You deposit a certain amount of collateral (in ETH) and can then withdraw LUSD based on that. The collateral rate must be higher than 110% and will be liquidated when it drops below 110%. 

As a quick explainer, here’s an example:

* You want to borrow 2 ETH, because you think the price will go up from the current hypothetical price of $4,000/ETH. 
* You need to deposit 2.2 ETH (valued at $8,800 in total) to get a loan of 2 ETH (valued at $8,000)
* Loans are paid in a USD-pegged stablecoin, so you’ll get 8,800 LUSD.
* If borrowing at exactly 110% collateral, your deposit worth $8,800 will be liquidated as soon as the price of ETH drops at all—i.e.below $4,000/ETH—and you will be left with just the loan valued at $8,000
* The extra buffer of 10%, or $800, is called the liquidation reserve

As you can imagine, the lower the minimum collateral rate, the more you can safely borrow based on the capital you have. While most lending platforms have minimum collateral rates of 150%**,** how can Liquity set theirs so low?

Firstly, both the borrowing rate and liquidation reserve are counted in the collateral. 

So, is the total borrowing amount is 2210 LUSD, the official collateral ratio will be 110% , but the actual borrowing amount is 2000 LUSD, and the collateral ratio becomes 121% (0.6710\*3622.92/2000\*100%) according to the actual availability.

Since the liquidation reserve is a fixed amount and will be paid back to the borrower upon repayment if liquidation does not occur, the liquidation reserve is not considered an expense when it is not liquidated. The borrower can reduce the actual collateral ratio that is driven up by the borrowing reserve by increasing the borrowing amount.

&amp;#x200B;

[Data source：https:\/\/eth.liquity.fi\/](https://preview.redd.it/ly82nwvashx71.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2198858f1f25b6b558c5dbb077d8a013d89897)

Secondly, Liquity will have a recovery mode, which will be activated when the total collateral ratio (TCR) of the system falls below 150% and all users with a collateral ratio below 150% will be liquidated, so there is an official reminder when borrowing that it is recommended to keep the collateral ratio above 150% to avoid being liquidated in the recovery mode.

Again, the user can also redeem LUSD for ETH at any time—an action known as redemption. In this situation, the system will start redeeming from the Trove with the lowest collateral ratio at that time, reducing the borrower's Trove by both collateral and debt, and while the user will not incur a net loss from the redemption, you will lose part of your ETH exposure. Therefore, in order to avoid redemption, you need to maintain a higher collateral ratio relative to others.

Therefore, although the minimum collateral ratio is 110% at the time of borrowing, it is safer to maintain a collateral ratio of at least 150% to ensure that the Trove is not liquidated or redeemed against. The data from Footprint Analytics shows that Liquity's TCR quickly returned to over 300% even after the liquidation and recovery mode during the May crash, and currently the TCR remains at around 300%. It can be seen that although the minimum collateral ratio can be 110%, the user will still choose to accept a higher collateral rate to ensure the security of the collateral, which requires the user to make a trade-off between a 300% collateral ratio and a higher capital utilization rate.

&amp;#x200B;

[TCR（since Apr  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/sdovik9cshx71.png?width=1148&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51892f25f45c8dd8e9cd799d15016f317f004aa1)

However, although the TCR is higher, the 110% minimum collateral rate has a correspondingly lower loss on being liquidated compared to other protocols with higher collateral rates, which is also explained in detail below.

## Claim 3: Directly redeemable

Users can redeem the collateral with LUSD at any time at its face value, as also mentioned above, but since redemptions are made at a fee of 0.5%-5%, again this fee will be adjusted depending on the time of the most recent redemption and the amount redeemed. Only when the amount of LUSD is less than $1, the user can redeem LUSD to take advantage of it, and the user can exchange LUSD with a price less than $1 for ETH with a value of $1.Therefore, it is up to the user to determine whether there is more room for arbitrage or more fees to be paid based on the prevailing LUSD price, however, according to Footprint Analytics, due to what Liquity founder Robert Lauko calls ""hard anchoring"" and ""soft anchor"" mechanisms, LUSD's price fluctuates between $0.99 and $1.02 on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

[LUSD Price（since Jul  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/ltfyvtjdshx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94b78f7136674a42c7c4bc32e06750957a137e17)

From the perspective of the redeemed, although they did not suffer a net loss at the point of redemption, most of the users of collateralized ETH loans are ETH believers and most believe that ETH is going to rise in the long run, and when the ETH in their Trove is reduced, it actually reduces the likelihood that their assets will increase in value later as ETH rises.

Thus the act of redemption, for those who want to arbitrage from it, only makes sense when the LUSD is less than $1 and the arbitrage gain is greater than the redemption fee; for the redeemed, the act of redemption is also not very popular. 

However, Liquity offers one more way to arbitrage through this mechanism, which also allows the price of LUSD to stabilize around $1 and keeps the overall total collateral rate at a high level by raising the Trove's CR which has the lowest collateral rate.

## Claim 4: Liquidation loss of less than 10%

When the collateral ratio is less than 110%, Liquity will have paid off the debt by liquidating the collateral and the borrower will have lost the collateral ETH and the liquidation will result in a net loss of 9.09% (= 100% \* 10/110) of the dollar value of the borrower's collateral.

However, do not forget that there is also a liquidation reserve of 200 LUSD at the time of borrowing, which will be available to the initiator of the liquidation in the event of liquidation.The liquidation reserve, although not required to be paid by the user at the time of borrowing, will be calculated in the debt and will be included in the calculation of the collateral rate of the Trove. Therefore, taking the amount deposited in the Trove above as an example, when the collateral rate drops below 110% due to price fluctuations and liquidation occurs, the value of the collateral being liquidated at that time is not 110% of the 2000 LUSD in the hands of the borrower in this case, but 110% of the total debt of 2210 LUSD.At this point, the borrower lost all the ETH and only 2000 LUSD is left. According to the price of ETH when it was liquidated, the actual loss rate of the borrower is 17.73% 

((0.671\*3622.92-2000)/(0.671\*3622.92)\*100%). 

Of course the actual loss rate calculated varies for different borrowing amounts, and higher borrowing amounts will reduce the loss rate pulled up by the liquidation reserve.

While the liquidation reserve factor may not make the loss rate of being liquidated as small as envisioned, Liquity's mechanism is a significant improvement over the 150% collateral ratio required by MakerDao, and provides borrowers with 40% more safety margin in the event of liquidation due to price fluctuations.

## Claim: Earn additional revenue with a LUSD deposit or LQTY stake

Liquity not only offers lending to borrow LUSD, but also offers a Stability Pool of LUSD to improve capital utilization and a pool to stake LQTY for revenue. LUSD deposited into the Stability Pool can earn ETH from liquidated users based on their share of the pool, as well as LQTY, the token that rewards Liquity; LQTY obtained from the Stability Pool can then be staked again to earn fees when users borrow and redeem.

The Stability Pool will gain ETH and LQTY, the gain of ETH is related to the case of being liquidated, and the LUSD deposited in the pool will be burnt at the same time as gaining ETH. Since the collateral ratio is 110% at the time of liquidation, the user will receive ETH corresponding to 110% of the value of USD while 1 LUSD is burnt, and the user will make 10% profit from it.If at this point the ETH continues to fall bringing the ETH that has just gained $1.1 in value down below $1, the user will suffer a floating loss.To prevent this possibility, B.Protocol provides Liquity's Stability Pool provider to auto-convert ETH back to LUSD and deposit it back into the Stability Pool, locking in liquidation profits for users and saving gas fee. However, if the user is a long-term bullish ETH believer, they may believe that the asset will eventually appreciate in value in the future.

However as a stablecoin it is more important to look at its use cases, the 600+ million LUSD currently minted is over 75% of the total in Liquity's Stability Pool, with less than 200 million flowing externally. Users who borrowed in Liquity go around and around still investing in Liquity, the use case of the whole system looks like a Russian Dolls and its sustainability is doubtful.

&amp;#x200B;

[Total Supply of LUSD（since Apr  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/wen3doteshx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff348f04c9727304b46b1ce068ce7e4d8ee0d7a7)

But Robert Lauko, founder of Liquity, responded on July 2 that the LUSD in the Stability Pool was a rational choice by users in light of the large number of LQTY incentives, and that subsequent LQTY token incentives would decline and users would change their behavior accordingly.

Another reward gained by the Stability Pool is LQTY. Since it is not a governance token, the only use case for LQTY is to capture the borrowing and redemption fees of the protocol, and LQTY can only gain more revenue when more borrowings and redemptions occur, so instead it is more beneficial to increase the value of LQTY when the whole system is less stable. As you can see the daily ETH and LUSD gained from staking LQTY is not that much at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gain from Staking LQTY（since Apr  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/qztulbtfshx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaf388cedd224888bb32dc20be6c2f8ad4128a5e)

Borrowing and redemptions increased in mid-May due to the volatility of the token price, and LQTY's ability to capture revenue had a rapid increase during this period. However, starting in June the total supply of LUSD also showed a decline in borrowing and redemptions by users, and LQTY's ability to capture both LUSD and ETH declined significantly.

As the incentive for LQTY tokens fades, the value of LQTY may be worth hoping for if LUSD can expand its use cases more externally to attract more users to borrow, and Liquid's TVL continues to trend upward.

## Conclusion

Digging into Liquity's claimed advantages, it’s clear that the innovations of lower collateral rate and automatic liquidation mechanism are the key components to help Liquity remain robust under the severe shocks of ""519"".

The above innovations also differentiates Liquity from its competitor MakerDao. Footprint Analytics will also analyze Liquity vs. MarkerDao comparatively in a subsequent article. Moreover, an increase of market share of LUSD since September indicates the probability of LUSD might become a widely used decentralized stablecoin.

Following a volatile September, the crypto market rebounded to an all-time high in October, with DeFi's TVL exceeding $250 billion and BTC pushing past $66K. 

&amp;#x200B;

[DeFi TVL ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/o4fh9zlm0ix71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ad782377729cdede902dc82523df3cfdd5d723f)

But with all eyes on rising token prices, it was easy to miss some trends and announcements that look likely to impact the market in Q4 significantly. 

* DeFi will be getting more regulated as countries announce sweeping cryptocurrency policies
* Bitcoin ETFs attract global attention, creating positive outlook as institutional investors buy in
* Lending market lacks clear leader as Curve and MakerDAO vie for top spot
* Numerous new public chains see big growth shortly after launching

Read how these developments and others will affect the crypto market in Footprint's October Monthly Report.

**Bitcoin futures ETF triggers new high for BTC**

With Grayscale announcing a series of plans to convert bitcoin funds into spot ETFs and digital asset investment firm Valkyrie listing its bitcoin futures ETF on NASDAQ, the price of BTC climbed from $48,000 to around $60,000. On Oct.20, BTC even reached a record high of $66,000. 

Investors now have very span support for the thesis that institutions will gradually purchase crypto assets. This means we can imagine a world where banks make massive whale purchases of BTC and other tokens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two aspects bolsters the DeFi TVL's growth in October :

**Lending market sees neck and neck competition among dominant platforms**

[The TVL ranking](https://www.footprint.network/topic/Chain/Blockchain) from Footprint Data shows that Aave and MakerDAO once surpassed [Curve](https://www.footprint.network/topic/Projects/Curve) in the middle of the month to become the projects with the highest DeFi TVL, but quickly fell back behind.

As of Oct. 31, Curve was still ranked number one on the network with $19.2 billion TVL. Curve's TVL grew by 34% for the month of October and its token price reached $4.7, the highest in almost a year. MakerDAO also had a 37.68% TVL growth rate.

The data indicates that the lending market is highly competitive—with picking a favorite for market leader nigh impossible. In other words, now is not the time to put all your eggs in one basket in your DeFi lending play.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Small but numerous chains eat away at Ethereum’s monopoly**

Since its inception, Ethereum held a near monopoly in the public chain space until Binance came onto the scene in February 2021, followed by Terra and Polygon. 

Data from the past month indicate a clear trend towards further fragmentation rather than consolidation. 

Footprint Data shows there are 11 public chains with a TVL growth of more than 100% in the past 30 days. Among them, Tron's growth rate was 1119%, bridging its TVL to $7.6 billion, making it the seventh chain. Other public chains such as Fantom, Arbitrum and Avalanche grew by more than 100%.

The result is that Ethereum’s market share went from 73% in August to 65% in October—and 8% drop in just 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

[Change of Market Share by Public ChainData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/f91tem0v0ix71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfe5c43fbbc8f4288f3556eb959b07dbb5b6fd4e)

# New kids on the crypto block in October

Newly launched chains beat expectations in October.  

The TVL of Secret grew 222% as tightening regulations around public chains make blockchain users refocus on privacy. PriFi—as it’s now called—will soon become the preferred choice for crypto, and Secret, the first Chain with privacy protection, will explode. (At least, so goes the reasoning of the chain’s supporters.) 

Another chain that shouldn’t be ignored is NEAR. While its 86% growth is slow compared to the month’s other breakouts, the chain’s team recently announced a huge $800 million ecosystem development fund to support NEAR-based development projects, institutions and individuals. Aurora, a NEAR-based solution to scale Ethereum dApp projects, also completed a $12 million funding round in October. 

Other public chains such as Sifchain, Harmony, and Celo each had over 200% growth in October and are also noteworthy. Although the new public chains are still nowhere near as popular as the Etherchain, market share continues to divide as they present new use cases and solve problems developers and users face with Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

With the introduction of national policies around crypto in the US, China, Australia and others in September, the market briefly became volatile but a record-breaking October demonstrated we’re still riding the bull for now. 

On a more long-term trajectory, the token price drop and regulations were followed by institutional support and buy-in for blockchain. While controversial amongst blockchain enthusiasts, this has created a perception of reduced market risk among established financial players. Is this the news that banks and investment firms, tired of seeing their returns blown out of the water by crypto traders, were waiting on as their signal to jump in?

By Sid Coelho-Prabhu

  


  
Cryptocurrency’s promise is to make money and payments universally accessible– to anyone, no matter where they are in the world.

  
The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Open Finance movement takes that promise a step further. Imagine a global, open alternative to every financial service you use today — savings, loans, trading, insurance and more — accessible to anyone in the world with a smartphone and internet connection.

  


  
This is now possible on smart contract blockchains, like Ethereum. “Smart contracts” are programs running on the blockchain that can execute automatically when certain conditions are met. These smart contracts enable developers to build far more sophisticated functionality than simply sending and receiving cryptocurrency. These programs are what we now call decentralized apps, or dapps.

  
You can think of a dapp as an app that is built on decentralized technology, rather than being built and controlled by a single, centralized entity or company. (Get used to this word, dapp, you’ll be seeing it a lot from here on out.)

  
While some of these concepts might sound futuristic–automated loans negotiated directly between two strangers in different parts of the world, without a bank in the middle– many of these dapps are already live today. There are DeFi dapps that allow you to create stablecoins (cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US dollar), lend out money and earn interest on your crypto, take out a loan, exchange one asset for another, go long or short assets, and implement automated, advanced investment strategies.

  
What differentiates these DeFi dapps from their traditional bank or Wall Street counterparts?

  
At their core, the operations of these businesses are not managed by an institution and its employees — instead the rules are written in code (or smart contract, as mentioned above). Once the smart contract is deployed to the blockchain, DeFi dapps can run themselves with little to no human intervention (although in practice developers often do maintain the dapps with upgrades or bug fixes).The code is transparent on the blockchain for anyone to audit. This builds a different kind of trust with users, because anyone has the opportunity to understand the contract’s functionality or find bugs. All transaction activity is also public for anyone to view. While this may raise privacy questions, transactions are pseudonymous by default, i.e. not tied directly to your real-life identity.Dapps are designed to be global from day one — Whether you’re in Texas or Tanzania, you have access to the same DeFi services and networks. Of course, local regulations may apply but, technically speaking, most DeFi apps are available to anyone with an internet connection.“Permissionless” to create, “permissionless” to participate — anyone can create DeFi apps, and anyone can use them. Unlike finance today, there are no gatekeepers or accounts with lengthy forms. Users interact directly with the smart contracts from their crypto wallets.Flexible user experience — don’t like the interface to a certain dapp? No problem — you can use a third party interface, or build your own. Smart contracts are like an open API that anyone can build an app for.Interoperable — new DeFi applications can be built or composed by combining other DeFi products like Lego pieces — e.g. stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and prediction markets can be combined to form entirely new products.

  
DeFi is now one of the fastest growing sectors in crypto. Industry observers measure traction with a unique new metric — “ETH locked in DeFi”. At the time of writing, users have deposited over $600 million worth of crypto into these smart contracts.

  
Intrigued? Let’s take a closer look at just a few of the popular DeFi dapps out there that you can try today. You’ll need a cryptocurrency wallet with a built-in dapp browser (like Coinbase Wallet) to connect to these dapps. You can also use most of these dapps on desktop by selecting the Coinbase Wallet option and scanning a QR code.

  


  
It’s still early days for dapps, so DeFi users should do their research on new products and services. Like any computer code, smart contracts can be vulnerable to both unintended programming mistakes and malicious hacks.

  
Stablecoin and Decentralized Reserve Bank: MakerDAO

  
Maker is a stablecoin project where each stablecoin (called DAI) is pegged to the US Dollar and is backed by collateral in the form of crypto. Stablecoins offer the programmability of crypto without the downside of volatility that you see with “traditional” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

  
You can try creating your own DAI stablecoin on the Maker Oasis dapp. Maker is more than just a stablecoin project, though–it aspires to be a decentralized reserve bank. People who hold a separate but related token, MKR, can vote on important decisions like the Stability Fee (similar to how the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee votes on the Fed Funds rate).

  
Another stablecoin with a different architecture is USD Coin (USDC), where every USDC token is backed by one US dollar held in an audited bank account.

  
Borrow and Lend: Compound

  
Compound is a blockchain-based borrowing and lending dapp — you can lend your crypto out and earn interest on it. Or maybe you need some money to pay the rent or buy groceries, but your funds are tied up in your crypto investments? You can deposit your crypto to the Compound smart contract as collateral, and borrow against it. The Compound contract automatically matches borrowers and lenders, and adjusts interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand.

  
Other popular borrow/lend dapps are Aave and dYdX. Aggregators like LoanScan track borrow/lend interest rates across the various dapps, so you can shop around for the best rates.

  
Automated Token Exchange: Uniswap

  
Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange run entirely on smart contracts, letting you trade popular tokens directly from your wallet. This is different from an exchange like Coinbase, which stores your crypto for you and holds your private keys for safekeeping. Uniswap uses an innovative mechanism known as Automated Market Making to automatically settle trades near the market price. In addition to trading, any user can become a liquidity provider, by supplying crypto to the Uniswap contract and earning a share of the exchange fees. This is called “pooling”.

  
Other popular Decentralized Exchange platforms (DEXes) include 0x, AirSwap, Bancor, Kyber, IDEX, Paradex and Radar Relay. All have slightly different architectures.

  
Prediction Markets: Augur

  
Augur is a decentralized prediction market protocol. With Augur, you can vote on the outcome of events, except you put ‘skin in the game’ by attaching a value to your vote. Prediction market platforms like Augur and Guesser are nascent, but offer a view into a future where users can make better predictions by tapping into the wisdom of the crowd.

  
Synthetic Assets: Synthetix

  
Synthetix is a platform that lets users create and exchange synthetic versions of assets like gold, silver, cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies like the Euro. The synthetic assets are backed by excess collateral locked into the Synthetix contracts.

  
No-loss savings games: PoolTogether

  
The composability of DeFi lends itself to infinite new possibilities. PoolTogether is a no-loss game where participants deposit the DAI stablecoin into a common pot. At the end of each month, one lucky participant wins all the interest earned, and everyone gets their initial deposits back.

  
So what’s next for DeFi?

  
Money and finance have been around in one form or the other since the dawn of human civilization. Crypto is just the latest digital avatar. In upcoming years, we might see every financial service that we use in today’s fiat system being rebuilt for the crypto ecosystem. We’ve already seen asset issuance and exchange, borrowing, lending, custody, and derivatives built for crypto. What’s next?

  
The first generation of DeFi dapps rely heavily on collateral as a safeguard. That is, you need to already own crypto and provide it as collateral in order to borrow more crypto. More traditional unsecured borrowing and lending will need to rely on an identity system, so that borrowers can build up credit and increase their borrowing power, much like today’s SSN and FICO scores. Unlike today’s identity and credit systems however, a decentralized identity will have to be both universal and privacy-preserving.

  
We’re also seeing innovation in the insurance space. Many of today’s DeFi loans are overcollateralized (meaning that loans seem inherently safe because of the generous cushion of assets held in reserve). But the black swan for DeFi is smart contract vulnerabilities. If a hacker finds and exploits a bug in the open source code for a dapp, millions of dollars could be drained in an instant. Teams like Nexus Mutual are building decentralized insurance that would make users whole in the event of smart contract hacks.

  
Another trend we’re seeing is better user experience. The first generation of dapps was built by blockchain enthusiasts for blockchain enthusiasts. These dapps did a great job of demonstrating exciting new DeFi possibilities, but the usability left something to be desired. The latest iterations of DeFi apps are prioritizing design and ease of use in order to take open finance to a wider audience.

  
In the future, we expect that crypto wallets will be the portal to all your digital asset activity, just like an internet browser today is your portal to the world’s news and information. Imagine a dashboard that shows you not just what assets you own, but how much you have locked up in different open finance protocols–loans, pools, and insurance contracts.

  
Across the DeFi ecosystem, we’re also seeing a move towards decentralizing governance and decision-making. Despite the word “decentralized” in DeFi, many projects today have master keys for the developers to shut down or disable dapps. This was done to allow for easy upgrades and provide an emergency shutoff valve in case of buggy code. However, as the code becomes more battle-tested, we expect developers will give up these backdoor switches. The DeFi community is experimenting with ways to allow stakeholders to vote on decisions, including through the use of blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

  
Something magical is happening in the open financial system — crypto is bringing money online, and we’re seeing a quantum leap in what’s possible when it comes to the functionality of money. It’s a rare opportunity to see an entirely new industry blossom from scratch. The DeFi space will at first play catch up with today’s financial services industry. But over time, it’s hard to even fathom what innovations will come about when the power to build financial services is democratized to anyone who can write code.

 This week, we are starting with a crazy sale in the NFT market, and then talk about Bitcoin, DeFi and Coinbase’s direct listing.

  
Beeple Crashes MakersPlace By Selling NFT Art for $1

  
NFT artist Beeple crashed the crypto art marketplace MakersPlace on 28th Feb.

  


  
At $1 a piece, and limited to only 105 pieces on the blockchain, Beeple’s latest drop was feverishly anticipated.

  
Unfortunately, the traffic the immensely popular digital artist brought to MakersPlace completely crashed the website, leading to “504 Gateway Time-out” notifications for anyone hoping to snap up the limited edition. Most of the 105 editions remain unsold.

  
Knowing that the crash was unfair on fans who’d gone onto the website at the right time, Beeple will sell the remaining editions of The 5000 Day Selects via a raffle. All collectors who showed up on time with a registered and verified MakersPlace account will be considered for the raffle.

  


  
MakersPlace’s volume didn’t go up much on 28th Feb due to the crash. And the popularity of this sale was completely reflected by the active users, which increased sharply on that day and broke ATH 2K, of course exceeding the website’s capacity. Users continued to rush to the platform, wishing they would be picked for the later raffle.

  
JP Morgan Favors Bitcoin?

  
Strategists at Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan have suggested that a 1% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against fluctuations in traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.

  
According to Bloomberg, JP Morgan strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho stated in a note to clients: “In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.”

  
Although Bitcoin has slid a bit these days, it is up 60% since the beginning of this year. A long list of major investment institutions has entered the market in 2021, including Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, Tesla, and MicroStrategy.

  
All About DeFi

  
1inch Expands to Binance Smart Chain

  
1inch, the DEX aggregator, is now live on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), hedging its bets on Ethereum’s ability to handle more transaction volume.

  
1inch users will now get access to PancakeSwap (CAKE), BakerySwap (BAKE), Venus (XVS), BurgerSwap (BURGER), and other BSC-based DEXs and lending protocols. This can help users avoiding the high gas fee on Ethereum.

  
(The black dot line represents 1INCH token price)

  
1INCH token price increased by 6.7% in the past 24 hours. It shows a similar trend as its users and transactions.

  
You can search Binance Smart Chain on [dapp.com](https://dapp.com)  to check all the DeFi, DEX, and many other products. Next week, we will list Binance Smart Chain and support tracking all the dapps and tokens live on the blockchain. You can monitor the projects’ TVL, volume, users, etc, as well as all the tokens on BSC for your trading analytics including active wallet address, holders, value locked, etc.

  
To celebrate the listing, new campaigns are also on the way. Stay tuned for good news next week!

  
Grayscale Adding 23 Cryptocurrencies?

  
Digital asset manager Grayscale is considering 23 cryptocurrencies for new investment products, revealing the shortlist of cryptocurrencies that it’s choosing from in a press release.

  
The list of 23 cryptocurrencies includes several high market cap coins, some DeFi coins and a few VC-backed projects.

  
The most well-known projects are Polkadot and the blockchain platform EOS. VC-backed products include decentralized file storage platform Filecoin and Bitcoin-based smart contract platform Stacks. It also includes Chainlink, an oracle network that underpins many decentralized apps.

  
DeFi coins include lending platform Aave, synthetic asset platform Synthetix, stablecoin provider MakerDAO and yield farming platform [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance).

  


  
Aave

  


  
MakerDAO

  
(The black dot lines represent token prices)

  
Aave and MakerDAO have had great on-chain performance in the past 7 days. Their active users, transactions and volume all increased. Aave’s 7d volume increased by 86.41% and MakerDAO’s 7d volume increased by 69.35%.

  


  
[Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)

  
(The peak volume on 5th Feb is due to the Yearn Finance hack)

  
Synthetix

  
(The black dot lines represent token prices)

  
However, [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)  and Synthetix seem to have total difference data performance. Both projects’ active users, transactions and volume decreased. [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)’s  7d volume decreased by 37.89% after the hack on 5th Feb. While Synthetix’s 7d volume decreased by 33.46%.

  
It’s important to track a DeFi or DEX’s on-chain data, because the token price possibly correlates to its performance.

  
Coinbase Going Public, Its Stock Keeps Rising Ahead of Listing

  
Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly-traded company through a direct listing, not an initial public offering.

  
Early reports suggest the company will be worth around $104 billion. That figure has led Bloomberg and Axios, among others, to note that the cryptocurrency giant’s public listing will be the most valuable of any U.S. tech company since Facebook.

  
Coinbase shares to be debut on the Nasdaq in the coming weeks, FTX allows you to trade Coinbase’s stock shares before listing by issuing a pre-listing futures contract market.

  
Since Coinbase posted its S-1 regulatory filing, pre-listing shares on FTX are going up in price. The shares, under the representation of CBSE tokens, now trades at about $402 in FTX. When it was originally issued last December, it was worth just $239. The price went up by 68.2%. Before you trade Coinbase stocks, don’t forget to get a $30 fee voucher here.

  
Besides Coinbase, you can trade over 40 tokenization stocks on FTX.

  


  
Apart from FTX, you can trade stocks and earn interest from stocks in the crypto world by staking real stock shares in Mirror Protocol, an innovative synthetic + mining DeFi protocol, for a rather high APY. So far, the pools in Mirror Protocol support many leading global companies’ stocks including Tesla, Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, Apple, etc. (This DeFi Protocol Becomes Whales’ Next Target?)

Is Aave destined to stay the top DeFi lending platform?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Footprint_Analytics/comments/qn54ef/is_aave_destined_to_stay_the_top_defi_lending/,FootprintAnalytics,1,2021-11-05 14:38:38,0,/r/Footprint_Analytics/comments/qn54ef/is_aave_destined_to_stay_the_top_defi_lending/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

 Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Crypto lending has become one of DeFi's most promising use applications, ushering in an influx of dozens of platforms, tools, apps and participants all claiming to revolutionize how tokens are loaned and borrowed. 

According to Footprint, the number of platforms in the DeFi lending category grew by 263% to 69 since December 2020, setting a record TVL of $48.44 billion, accounting for 21.04% of all DeFi platforms and networks' entire TVL. 

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL of Different CategoriesData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/98d8thpk2qx71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e39b83f4fe0c7ca743b23e727f9bad2095a323b)

The most important lending platforms to have emerged are Aave, MakerDAO and Compound—they dominate the category in terms of TVL. However, while **Compound** used to be the span favorite, the 519 Crypto Market Crash reshuffled the leaderboard and Aave took the lead.

As indicated in the chart below, MakerDAO and Compound have performed poorly in recent months. 

Therefore, many people are wondering whether Aave is on top because it’s a particularly span platform or because its competitors temporarily fell behind. The answer determines your assessment of Aave locking in your tokens in the long term, and also who to watch for insights about the future of crypto lending.

When we look at the data, it becomes clear that Aave has several span advantages that indicate it will continue to be a market leader in DeFi lending. Namely, it is highly secure, innovative, and has recently launched Aave Pro, which gives it an enormous head start as traditional finance starts to buy into crypto. 

**Project Background**

Aave, formerly known as ETHLend, was launched on Ethereum in November 2017. The platform's initial mode of operation was similar to that of P2P~~—~~with the online platform matching borrowers and lenders through smart contracts in a peer-to-peer fashion. But the development model was soon adjusted after market reaction was subdued.

In 2019, the project completed a brand upgrade and was renamed to Aave (or “ghost” in Finnish), and went live in January 2020. This version provides liquidity by establishing a pool of funds and focuses on solving the problem of inefficient aggregation of lending needs. Users deposit collateral assets and then borrow assets within the collateral rate without a need for matching. 

In the succeeding months, the platform achieved the following milestones:

* July 2020: received $4.5 million from ParaFi and $3 million in strategic funding with participation from Framework Ventures and Three Arrows Capital. It also released its economic proposal, Aavenomics, which included the conversion of the original token Lend to AAVE and the issuance of an additional 3 million tokens, a security module, lending incentive, among others.
* October 2020: secured $25 million in funding led by Blockchain Capital and Standard Crypto, in addition to receiving approval from the U.S. SEC to register as an Ether Trust.
* February 2021: completed its V2 upgrade then launched the AMM marketplace the following month, allowing liquidity providers to pledge LP tokens from Uniswap and Balancer for loans
* April 2021: offered token incentives to borrowers and lenders through its liquidity mining programme
* May 2021: deployed and launched the Polygon chain
* July 2021: launched a new product for institutional clients Aave Pro
* October 2021: deployed and launched Avalanche.

**Economic model**

&amp;#x200B;

[Aave Economic Overview Data source: Aave Docs](https://preview.redd.it/op142pep2qx71.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323aae55486571260a7f9ce3a5805c31bfa9c83a)

Aave's economic model, which went live in July 2020, has three main uses for the token AAVE, namely community governance, safety module building and ecosystem rewards.

* Community Governance: Users holding the platform token AAVE can participate in community governance, such as participating in voting on the protection of the platform ecosystem, updates to the safety module mechanism, new feature iterations, etc. One AAVE token is equivlanet to one vote.
* Safety Module Construction: Users can pledge their token AAVE holdings into a security pool, which is used to protect against risk events such as contract breach risk, liquidity risk (liquidation risk arising from insufficient collateral coverage), and prophecy machine risk (caused by network congestion or market crash and where the prophecy machine cannot update the price or the price is provided incorrectly).
* Ecosystem Rewards: Token rewards given to borrowers and lenders, equivalent to liquidity mining.

Aave has put a lot of effort and innovation into security, not only by incorporating a safety module as part of the ecology and thus providing a safety cushion for risky events, but also by rewarding those who find security vulnerabilities. These proactive initiatives continue to support Aave's breakthrough development.

**Flash Loan**

&amp;#x200B;

[Flash Loan Borrowed Amount Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/tej99lvq2qx71.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cba31688ccddc70894aa7f68f273fb987fc461)

Aave also has a first-of-its-kind advantage over other lending platforms through Flash Loan. The product has a certain threshold for users and is suitable for developers with some programming skills. It is characterised by the ease with which users can obtain loans without the need to pledge any assets. They would have to simply return the borrowed funds within the same block (about 15 seconds). If they are unable to repay the loan in the same block, the transaction is revoked without any impact on the user. But, if the loan is successful, they are charged a 0.09% fee.

As of this writing, Flash Loan has surpassed $9.8 billion in cumulative lending volume and is expected to surpass $10 billion by the end of October. Although the entire crypto industry is in a recovery phase after the 519 Crypto Market Crash and Flash Loan's transaction volume has declined, there is no denying the explosive growth of the product, building a span momentum to support Aave to overtake Compound and MakerDAO.

**Asset classes and interest rates**

&amp;#x200B;

[Aave’s Deposit APY and Borrow APY Data source: Aave  website](https://preview.redd.it/hzp2c94s2qx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6fef32120110661620031bfc4ace40c7e40e40)

The V1 and V2 versions support 31 types of assets in single token pledges, mainstream cryptocurrencies and emerging cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,the AMM version supports LP token pledges for Uniswap and Balancer, with 16 types of assets. This differentiated strategy satisfies the lending needs of multiple groups, attracts more users to participate and retain, and also accelerates the expansion and influence of the platform, laying the foundation for achieving a bend in the road.

The strength of the asset range has allowed Aave to expand its pool of funds and has given it more scope to create unique interest rate advantages. First, the overall borrow APY is lower than other platforms (capital utilisation in the same dimension), with liquidity subsidy for depositors and borrowers (although this is not an Aave initiative). Second, it is a pioneering interest rate swap that allows users to choose between a variable borrow APY or stable strategy borrow APY. If they choose a higher rate, they can switch to a lower rate strategy, giving them access to lower cost funding in a more volatile and decentralised market.

**Aave Pro**

The success of Aave's V2 trial of the credit delegation model where loans can be obtained without collateral paved the launch of the Aave Pro project, which integrates DeFi with traditional finance and provides a new gateway to DeFi for offline investment institutions. 

It caters to individual investors who have very limited funds compared to institutional investors. In addition to this, DeFi has experienced explosive growth for over a year, but has not lasted as long as before.

The OTC funds are more often pooled in the hands of institutional investors. As an electronic money institution licensed by the FCA in the UK, Aave can ensure the safety of funds in a more compliant and secure dimension to allow institutional investors to participate and promote the good development of the whole ecosystem.

Aave Pro is different from the original V1, V2 and even AMM. For one, Aave Pro is only developed for OTC institutional investors, with only four assets launched - USDC, BTC, ETH and AAVE. Second, Aave Pro is a private pool, which is completely separate from the Aave protocol pool, so that the risks are completed independently. 

Third, participating investment institutions need to pass the KYC verification of Fireblocks, assess the credit rating through KYC information, and adopt different collateral rates according to different credit ratings, which greatly reduces the security of funds.

**Summary**

Aave took the lead in lending because of its team instead of coincidence. Not only processing a tightened control over security and compliance, Aave team also continually sought out breakthroughs and innovation in DeFi lending.  With the launch of Aave Pro in particular, Aave has gradually opened a gap with the top lending platforms, and is set to usher in a new round of development for DeFi in a new direction.

The need to be alert and buy such a hyped coin on time is necessary, information is power here, and early access to update is money, profit and possible X100.  

That is where a notification inside a wallet address comes in, a stitch in time that saves mine, not only a notification but a customed notification coming through Json payload specified to individual preferences. This decentralized notification protocol is called EPNS.  The EPNS protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain with the prospect of including other blockchains. A user( wallet owners) interact with the EPNS protocol through creating a channel or subscribing to it, users who create a channel do that with a fee, this is shared among subscribers. EPNS also reward those who interact on its chain, thereby gaining users retention while providing an update to projects and coins.


EPNS has been in various partnerships in recent times, the $PUSH token recently listed on Kucoin with PUSH/USDT and PUSH/BTC pairs put EPNS on the crypto market map. The EPNS protocols also partner with Proof Of Humanity protocol to enable more decentralized features of Web 3.0. This partnership aims to boost an ecosystem of how humans interact with their community through a governed trust by verifying and establishing a governance system built on trust. This collaboration is set to bring a monumental element to the web3 stack.  PoH and EPNS aimed to bring identity certification to the blockchain and foster users experience on Web3.0.

Proof Of Human (PoH) verification comes in different categories, Submission, Challenge, Vouching and Registered, in making verification faster on PoH, EPNS is making notification come in during this process thereby hastening the process. This enables PoH users to have a real-time update on how their verification is going, removal or acceptance of the verification process while giving the users opportunity to know the reason their verification was declined. EPNS notification is becoming a must-have for any blockchain project that aims to carry along its users on its network. Incoming is Airdrops on-time notification and Universal basic Income and new certificate to verified users on PoH.


In bringing the full prospect of DeFi to all in the crypto space, MakerDao came up with a decentralized way of generating its coin called Dai against locked assets. This has a long term effect of keeping token value intact and also enabling decentralization in another dimension. MakerDao protocol when it comes to governance need utmost update among its voters, in doing this MakerDao is partnering with EPNS to bring its PUSH notification onboard, thereby making governance through voting come at a faster rate by speeding up the network proposal. Effective communication and increased participation in project governance with voting come with the effect of EPNS notification. In achieving a full state of decentralization, the MakerDao voting protocol comes into two tiers, the first tier is created to initiate consensus among community members, while the second tier is for executive poll voting in the governance for technical changes proposed on the platform. In keeping an eye on this voting, EPNS helps to keep all members of the community on alert on the progress of voting. Aside from boosting the total community-driven ecosystem, MakerDao and EPNS collaboration bring about less dependency on social media for new projects.

EPNS has come to stay as the best notification system, capable of being integrated across multiple networks, chains and protocols. The list is endless of its advantage in the educational sector, medical and engineering fields. The limitless power of the blockchain makes EPNS a go-to in keeping crypto users on par with news, updates around them."

This collaboration is set to bring a monumental element to the web3 stack.  PoH and EPNS aimed to bring identity certification to the blockchain and foster users experience on Web3.0.

Proof Of Human (PoH) verification comes in different categories, Submission, Challenge, Vouching and Registered, in making verification faster on PoH, EPNS is making notification come in during this process thereby hastening the process. This enables PoH users to have a real-time update on how their verification is going, removal or acceptance of the verification process while giving the users opportunity to know the reason their verification was declined. EPNS notification is becoming a must-have for any blockchain project that aims to carry along its users on its network. Incoming is Airdrops on-time notification and Universal basic Income and new certificate to verified users on PoH.


In bringing the full prospect of DeFi to all in the crypto space, MakerDao came up with a decentralized way of generating its coin called Dai against locked assets. This has a long term effect of keeping token value intact and also enabling decentralization in another dimension. MakerDao protocol when it comes to governance need utmost update among its voters, in doing this MakerDao is partnering with EPNS to bring its PUSH notification onboard, thereby making governance through voting come at a faster rate by speeding up the network proposal. Effective communication and increased participation in project governance with voting come with the effect of EPNS notification. In achieving a full state of decentralization, the MakerDao voting protocol comes into two tiers, the first tier is created to initiate consensus among community members, while the second tier is for executive poll voting in the governance for technical changes proposed on the platform. In keeping an eye on this voting, EPNS helps to keep all members of the community on alert on the progress of voting. Aside from boosting the total community-driven ecosystem, MakerDao and EPNS collaboration bring about less dependency on social media for new projects.

EPNS has come to stay as the best notification system, capable of being integrated across multiple networks, chains and protocols. The list is endless of its advantage in the educational sector, medical and engineering fields. The limitless power of the blockchain makes EPNS a go-to in keeping crypto users on par with news, updates around them."

Epic Cash (EPIC): Why is this project so massively undervalued?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/qpryng/epic_cash_epic_why_is_this_project_so_massively/,timcostello,1,2021-11-09 08:58:55,8,/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/qpryng/epic_cash_epic_why_is_this_project_so_massively/,NaN,"**Please note this is NOT financial advice. I am not advising you in any way, this is simply opinion. Do not place trades based on what is written here. Please do your own research.**

With that being said, I did buy $3,000 worth of it after what happened to me over that last couple of months.

I stumbled on this project and I am wondering **WHY** and **HOW** this is still so undervalued. I added it to my CoinGecko watchlist seemingly by accident in August 2021, and every so often I would see it at $0.30, or $0.45. It being on 1 exchange I thought that might be why, but I have seen other coins on 1 or 2 exchanges with a billion market cap! Thinking nothing of it (***since I have 79 different coins in my “under $1” watchlist***) I never really looked deep into it. Until. It went to $3.75! Now this random coin had my attention, after accidentally adding it to one of my watchlists. Why did I leave this random coin in my watchlist? Maybe since the watchlist was an “under $1” and none of the ones I had been watching ever go above $1. 

Still at its ATH, it was at most a 40M market cap!!! It is currently at 32M! The telegram community seems to be quite small with only 1500 members. There is a small subreddit, youtube, and facebook following as well. With that being said, they went from $0.30 to $3 with relatively nothing. If I had invested what I did; back then? I would have had 10,000 shares!!! Instead I have around 8X less than that. Forward looking only, let's look at the potential of this project. For example sake, let's just play around with the market cap.

***With a market cap of 130 Million&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would = $10***

***With a market cap of 1.3 Billion&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would= $100***

Every so often a project goes under the radar and eventually makes its way to the Top 100; silently. This could be one of those projects. Epic Cash started 2 years ago (September 2, 2019) with a Fair Launch; not many projects can claim this. It is a Grassroots type movement in the sense that it gains 1 person at a time, slowly accumulating a strong movement.  It does not pay for listings, influencers, or marketing. That is why it is on **ONE** exchange currently, Vitex DEX. The current market cap is around 35M, with a circulating supply of 13.1M, giving it a current share price of $2.50.

Anyway, I ended up researching the project and would like to compile some of the interesting things about it. 

1.  **Privacy** features and **Size** of blockchain. Both of which have what is called MimbleWimble to thank. MimbleWimble sounds hilarious, and I still do not fully understand it. What I do know is, it does not require the storage of data that other blockchains do, therefore making it lightweight (around 1.97GB at time of writing this, [explorer.epic.tech](https://explorer.epic.tech/)) AND!! It has a very interesting origin story, similar to Bitcoin!

Link to MimbleWimble Origin Story:

2. **Epicenter**. The entire ecosystem Epic developers and community are trying to create. Similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stable coin, Epicenter is their version.  With EPIC being the store of value (like ETH in the ETH/MKR/DAI system) So, EPIC/ECR/EUSD is EpicenterDAO’s version of ETH/MKR/DAI. ECR is like MKR and EUSD is the stable coin like Dai. For more information go here:

[https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract)

3. **MINING!** It just went through a halving event on October 30th 2021. Maybe that’s why it spiked a little? Regardless, it can be mined through a normal desktop computer (Macbook's are harder from what I have learned). Just like BTC back in the day. There are 3 more halving events from now until 2028 when the supply of Epic matches the supply of Bitcoin, known as the Singularity event in the Epic Cash White Paper. ([https://epic.tech/whitepaper](https://epic.tech/whitepaper)/) 

(Compared to BTC block time of 10 minutes and block reward of 6.25 BTC) 

Epic Coins Mined Per Day: 5,760 EPIC

Block Reward: 4 EPIC

Block Time: 60 seconds

I'm not a miner but if you are reading this and you have extra hardware or looking for a new coin to mine I’d suggest this. When it goes from 5,760 EPIC per day to 2880 in two years, who knows what the price of 1 EPIC will be. 

4. **Community!** Ever since I found out about Telegram for crypto groups, they have **NOT** been all that constructive. However, the Epic Cash Telegram (@epiccash) is actually fun, not toxic, and full of very smart people, some of  whom mined BTC and XMR in the early days. If you have ever heard of Kadena, they call themselves the Kadenians, in Epic Cash they are the Freemans. Max Freeman the founder of Epic is easily contactable in Telegram and will happily answer your questions. He also has been recently attending Youtube live streams in order to educate people about crypto and Epic. Just search “Max Freeman Epic Cash” on Youtube and start diving into the knowledge!

***Defining Characteristics of Epic Cash (some written by me and others compiled through Epic community Telegram and Official Website*** [***epic.tech***](https://epic.tech/)***):***

* **Scarce** \- Circulating supply of 13.1 million coins. Max supply 21M
* **Open Source -** No patent or company controlling the tech. 
* **Censorship Resistant** \- No one can interfere with EPIC transactions.
* **Fair Launch** \- No ICO(Initial Coin Offering), No premine, No Venture Capital, No Corporations, No government affiliations. (**WOW!!**)
* **Mineable (3 algorithms)** \- Mine with CPU (RandomX), GPU (ProgPoW), and ASIC.
* **Fungibility** \- 1 Epic = 1 Epic. No Tainted Coins. 
* **Speed** \- “While Bitcoin requires six 10-minute blocks to achieve complete transaction confirmation, Epic transactions occur within a single block confirmation as soon as a 1-minute block has been mined. This makes Epic Cash transactions smooth, continuous, and executed much faster than in previous generations of blockchain technology.”
* **Universally Accessible** \- Anyone, anywhere can participate regardless of their location, identity documentation, or ability to afford the price of entry. EPIC is truly money for everyone, today. 
* **Scalability** \- Currently 1.9 GB, estimated to be 25GB with BTC throughput. 📷
* **Private Banking** \- This is a big one. Epic is part of the Epicenter Ecosystem, with ECR as the governance token, and EUSD as the stablecoin, Epic holders have the ability to control their own wealth independently without intrusion. Check out this link below to learn more. (similar to MakerDAO and Dai if familiar with this)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68) 

* **Team Wallets** \- There are NO Team Wallets for Epic Cash! Everyone had to buy their coins on the open market.
* **Coin Lockup** \- Not applicable to Epic Cash as there are no team tokens. This is 100% Proof of Work!
* **Privacy** \- “*The Epic Cash blockchain safeguards the anonymity of Epic holders and users by protecting the details of transactions from third parties, and is designed to be both untraceable and invisible to surveillance through Dandelion++ Protocol.”*(Epic Cash website) 
* **Proof of Work -** “A decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody gaming the system” (Investopedia)
* **Egalitarian -** *Relating to or believing in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.* I admit I had to look this word up.

Mimblewimble Gem ($EPIC) Epic Cash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mimblewimble/comments/qpuu5b/mimblewimble_gem_epic_epic_cash/,timcostello,1,2021-11-09 11:35:26,1,/r/Mimblewimble/comments/qpuu5b/mimblewimble_gem_epic_epic_cash/,NaN,"Please note this is NOT financial advice. I am not advising you in any way, this is simply opinion. Do not place trades based on what is written here. Please do your own research.

With that being said, I did buy $3,000 worth of it after what happened to me over that last couple of months.

I stumbled on this project and I am wondering WHY and HOW this is still so undervalued. I added it to my CoinGecko watchlist seemingly by accident in August 2021, and every so often I would see it at $0.30, or $0.45. It being on 1 exchange I thought that might be why, but I have seen other coins on 1 or 2 exchanges with a billion market cap! Thinking nothing of it (since I have 79 different coins in my “under $1” watchlist) I never really looked deep into it. Until. It went to $3.75! Now this random coin had my attention, after accidentally adding it to one of my watchlists. Why did I leave this random coin in my watchlist? Maybe since the watchlist was an “under $1” and none of the ones I had been watching ever go above $1. 

Still at its ATH, it was at most a 40M market cap!!! It is currently at 32M! The telegram community seems to be quite small with only 1500 members. There is a small subreddit,youtube, and facebook following as well. With that being said, they went from $0.30 to $3 with relatively nothing. If I had invested what I did; back then? I would have had 10,000 shares!!! Instead I have around 8X less than that. Forward looking only, let's look at the potential of this project. For example sake, let's just play around with the market cap.

With a market cap of 130 Million&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would = $10
With a market cap of 1.3 Billion&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would= $100

Every so often a project goes under the radar and eventually makes its way to the Top 100; silently. This could be one of those projects. Epic Cash started 2 years ago (September 2, 2019) with a Fair Launch; not many projects can claim this. It is a Grassroots type movement in the sense that it gains 1 person at a time, slowly accumulating a strong movement.  It does not pay for listings, influencers, or marketing. That is why it is on ONE exchange currently, Vitex DEX. The current market cap is around 35M, with a circulating supply of 13.1M, giving it a current share price of $2.50.

Anyway, I ended up researching the project and would like to compile some of the interesting things about it. 

1.  Privacy features and Size of blockchain. Both of which have what is called MimbleWimble to thank. MimbleWimble sounds hilarious, and I still do not fully understand it. What I do know is, it does not require the storage of data that other blockchains do, therefore making it lightweight (around 1.97GB at time of writing this, explorer.epic.tech) AND!! It has a very interesting origin story, similar to Bitcoin!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zeydt/mimblewimbles_story/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

2. Epicenter. The entire ecosystem Epic developers and community are trying to create. Similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stable coin, Epicenter is their version.  With EPIC being the store of value (like ETH in the ETH/MKR/DAI system) So, EPIC/ECR/EUSD is EpicenterDAO’s version of ETH/MKR/DAI. ECR is like MKR and EUSD is the stable coin like Dai. For more information go here:

https://epicenter.epic.tech/what-is-epicenter/

https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract

3. MINING! It just went through a halving event on October 30th 2021. Maybe that’s why it spiked a little? Regardless, it can be mined through a normal desktop computer (Macbooks are harder from what I have learned). Just like BTC back in the day. There are 3 more halving events from now until 2028 when the supply of Epic matches the supply of Bitcoin, known as the Singularity event in the Epic Cash White Paper. (https://epic.tech/whitepaper/) 

(Compared to BTC block time of 10 minutes and block reward of 6.25 BTC) 

Epic Coins Mined Per Day: 5,760 EPIC
Block Reward: 4 EPIC
Block Time: 60 seconds

I'm not a miner but if you are reading this and you have extra hardware or looking for a new coin to mine I’d suggest this. When it goes from 5,760 EPIC per day to 2880 in two years, who knows what the price of 1 EPIC will be. 

4. Community! Ever since I found out about Telegram for crypto groups, they have NOT been all that constructive. However, the Epic Cash Teleram (@epiccash) is actually fun, not toxic, and full of very smart people, some of  whom mined BTC and XMR in the early days. If you have ever heard of Kadena, they call themselves the Kadenians, in Epic Cash they are the Freemans. Max Freeman the founder of Epic is easily contactable in Telegram and will happily answer your questions. He also has been recently attending Youtube live streams in order to educate people about crypto and Epic. Just search “Max Freeman Epic Cash” on Youtube and start diving into the knowledge!


Defining Characteristics of Epic Cash (some written by me and others compiled through Epic community Telegram and Official Website epic.tech):

Scarce - Circulating supply of 13.1 million coins. Max supply 21M
Open Source - No patent or company controlling the tech. 
Censorship Resistant - No one can interfere with EPIC transactions.
Fair Launch - No ICO(Initial Coin Offering), No premine, No Venture Capital, No Corporations, No government affiliations. (WOW!!)
Mineable (3 algos) - Mine with CPU (RandomX), GPU (ProgPoW), and Asic miner.
Fungibility - 1 Epic = 1 Epic. No Tainted Coins. 
Speed - “While Bitcoin requires six 10-minute blocks to achieve complete transaction confirmation, Epic transactions occur within a single block confirmation as soon as a 1-minute block has been mined. This makes Epic Cash transactions smooth, continuous, and executed much faster than in previous generations of blockchain technology.”
Universally Accessible - Anyone, anywhere can participate regardless of their location, identity documentation, or ability to afford the price of entry. EPIC is truly money for everyone, today. 
Scalability - Currently 1.9 GB, estimated to be 25GB with BTC throughput. 
Private Banking - This is a big one. Epic is part of the Epicenter Ecosystem, with ECR as the governance token, and EUSD as the stablecoin, Epic holders have the ability to control their own wealth independently without intrusion. Check out this link below to learn more. (similar to MakerDAO and Dai if familiar with this)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68 

Team Wallets - There are NO Team Wallets for Epic Cash! Everyone had to buy their coins on the open market.
Coin Lockup - Not applicable to Epic Cash as there are no team tokens. This is 100% Proof of Work!
Privacy - “The Epic Cash blockchain safeguards the anonymity of Epic holders and users by protecting the details of transactions from third parties, and is designed to be both untraceable and invisible to surveillance through Dandelion++ Protocol.”(Epic Cash website) 
Proof of Work - “A decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody gaming the system” (Investopedia)
Egalitarian - Relating to or believing in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. I admit I had to look this word up.

***With a market cap of 130 Million&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would = $10***

***With a market cap of 1.3 Billion&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would= $100***

Every so often a project goes under the radar and eventually makes its way to the Top 100; silently. This could be one of those projects. Epic Cash started 2 years ago (September 2, 2019) with a Fair Launch; not many projects can claim this. It is a Grassroots type movement in the sense that it gains 1 person at a time, slowly accumulating a strong movement.  It does not pay for listings, influencers, or marketing. That is why it is on **ONE** exchange currently, Vitex DEX. The current market cap is around 35M, with a circulating supply of 13.1M, giving it a current share price of $2.50.

Anyway, I ended up researching the project and would like to compile some of the interesting things about it. 

1.  **Privacy** features and **Size** of blockchain. Both of which have what is called MimbleWimble to thank. MimbleWimble sounds hilarious, and I still do not fully understand it. What I do know is, it does not require the storage of data that other blockchains do, therefore making it lightweight (around 1.97GB at time of writing this, [explorer.epic.tech](https://explorer.epic.tech/)) AND!! It has a very interesting origin story, similar to Bitcoin!

Link to MimbleWimble Origin Story:

2. **Epicenter**. The entire ecosystem Epic developers and community are trying to create. Similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stable coin, Epicenter is their version.  With EPIC being the store of value (like ETH in the ETH/MKR/DAI system) So, EPIC/ECR/EUSD is EpicenterDAO’s version of ETH/MKR/DAI. ECR is like MKR and EUSD is the stable coin like Dai. For more information go here:

[https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract)

3. **MINING!** It just went through a halving event on October 30th 2021. Maybe that’s why it spiked a little? Regardless, it can be mined through a normal desktop computer (Macbook's are harder from what I have learned). Just like BTC back in the day. There are 3 more halving events from now until 2028 when the supply of Epic matches the supply of Bitcoin, known as the Singularity event in the Epic Cash White Paper. ([https://epic.tech/whitepaper](https://epic.tech/whitepaper)/) 

(Compared to BTC block time of 10 minutes and block reward of 6.25 BTC) 

Epic Coins Mined Per Day: 5,760 EPIC

Block Reward: 4 EPIC

Block Time: 60 seconds

I'm not a miner but if you are reading this and you have extra hardware or looking for a new coin to mine I’d suggest this. When it goes from 5,760 EPIC per day to 2880 in two years, who knows what the price of 1 EPIC will be. 

4. **Community!** Ever since I found out about Telegram for crypto groups, they have **NOT** been all that constructive. However, the Epic Cash Telegram (@epiccash) is actually fun, not toxic, and full of very smart people, some of  whom mined BTC and XMR in the early days. If you have ever heard of Kadena, they call themselves the Kadenians, in Epic Cash they are the Freemans. Max Freeman the founder of Epic is easily contactable in Telegram and will happily answer your questions. He also has been recently attending Youtube live streams in order to educate people about crypto and Epic. Just search “Max Freeman Epic Cash” on Youtube and start diving into the knowledge!

***Defining Characteristics of Epic Cash (some written by me and others compiled through Epic community Telegram and Official Website*** [***epic.tech***](https://epic.tech/)***):***

* **Scarce** \- Circulating supply of 13.1 million coins. Max supply 21M
* **Open Source -** No patent or company controlling the tech. 
* **Censorship Resistant** \- No one can interfere with EPIC transactions.
* **Fair Launch** \- No ICO(Initial Coin Offering), No premine, No Venture Capital, No Corporations, No government affiliations. (**WOW!!**)
* **Mineable (3 algos)** \- Mine with CPU (RandomX), GPU (ProgPoW), and ASIC.
* **Fungibility** \- 1 Epic = 1 Epic. No Tainted Coins. 
* **Speed** \- “While Bitcoin requires six 10-minute blocks to achieve complete transaction confirmation, Epic transactions occur within a single block confirmation as soon as a 1-minute block has been mined. This makes Epic Cash transactions smooth, continuous, and executed much faster than in previous generations of blockchain technology.”
* **Universally Accessible** \- Anyone, anywhere can participate regardless of their location, identity documentation, or ability to afford the price of entry. EPIC is truly money for everyone, today. 
* **Scalability** \- Currently 1.9 GB, estimated to be 25GB with BTC throughput. 📷
* **Private Banking** \- This is a big one. Epic is part of the Epicenter Ecosystem, with ECR as the governance token, and EUSD as the stablecoin, Epic holders have the ability to control their own wealth independently without intrusion. Check out this link below to learn more. (similar to MakerDAO and Dai if familiar with this)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68) 

* **Team Wallets** \- There are NO Team Wallets for Epic Cash! Everyone had to buy their coins on the open market.
* **Coin Lockup** \- Not applicable to Epic Cash as there are no team tokens. This is 100% Proof of Work!
* **Privacy** \- “*The Epic Cash blockchain safeguards the anonymity of Epic holders and users by protecting the details of transactions from third parties, and is designed to be both untraceable and invisible to surveillance through Dandelion++ Protocol.”*(Epic Cash website) 
* **Proof of Work -** “A decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody gaming the system” (Investopedia)
* **Egalitarian -** *Relating to or believing in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.* I admit I had to look this word up.

Unlike MakerDAO and Synthetix using off-chain oracles, I use Solidity's `block.basefee` as my oracle. Unlike regular gastokens, you can't burn it to release gas. Instead, you must sell your synthetic gastokens for Ethereum, which is used to pay the basefee.

I'm asking because it sort of sounds like a chicken and egg scenario, Keepers in the early days seemed like they needed to lock a bunch of eth to be able to make sure they have enough DAI on the ready to participate in collateral auctions.

Did it just start off this way, where DAI was always used for liquidations/collateral auctions, and that DAI was only extracted from a Keeper locking in their ETH onto a vault?"
The Mystery behind Stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qr0zai/the_mystery_behind_stablecoins/,HaloJames100,1,2021-11-11 02:37:02,4,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qr0zai/the_mystery_behind_stablecoins/,DISCUSSION,"STABLECOINS AND THE MYSTERY BEHIND THEM

If you’ve been around the crypto scene for a while then chances are, you’ve come across the word “stablecoin” several times and no, they do not have anything to do with horses or real stables. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency which attaches its value to a different class of asset to keep its price stable. This asset class could be gold, metals, or fiat currency. 


Now, everybody loves top-of-the-class cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, bitcoin, and the rest of them. The ability to make payments without third parties is all the rave and while it may seem like there’s nothing unattractive about cryptocurrency, there is; and it's a major wrinkle in the scheme of things for crypto. What is this? Unpredictability. The price of cryptocurrencies, in general, has a history of volatility and unpredictability, which puts the average crypto owner on edge by just watching the market.

Think about investing all one's savings into a particular coin and wake up to find the price has taken an overnight plunge all because someone like Elon Musk made an ambiguous tweet. Quite the bummer right? 

In comparison, the price of stablecoins is parallel to that of the asset class they're linked to. This includes gold, U.S dollars, and so on. However, this does not disprove the fact that the value of currencies such as dollars also reduces when certain factors come into play. The difference here is that with cryptocurrencies, the changes are more drastic.

Instead of exposing investments to these vulnerabilities, stablecoins manage the prospect of price volatility by embedding the value of Cryptocurrencies in fairly consistent assets.


How does the whole caboodle work?
Stablecoins usually have a backup party that facilitates a sort of reserve for assets regulating that stablecoin to be stored. By this, we mean that one million euros or U.S dollars in your conventional bank can be equivalent to one million units of stablecoin to be backed by one million euro/dollar worth of fiat currency. Do you get it now? I'm sure you do.

This fiat currency stored away in the reserves simply functions as collateral for the stablecoin. Cashing out on tokens, therefore, means the same amount would be deducted from the fiat currency reserve.

We will now go into a brief analysis of stablecoin collaterals. The same way stablecoins come in variety is the same way stablecoin assets are diversified.
Precious metals: think of all the great stuff when it comes to metal commodities: silver, gold, etc. These are the type of metals considered valuable enough to be collateral for stablecoins.

Fiat: As you probably guessed, fiat currency is one of the most popular of all the stablecoin collateral. Other fiat currencies steadily becoming more popular are the Turkish lira and BiLira.

Other investments: Here, we have Tether's USDT which used to be backed 1 unit of USDT per dollar until recently when its collateral mix changed. 
Interestingly, Tether stated in 2021 that half the company reserves are in rated A-2  commercial paper. Note that A-2 is the second-best grade available for a corporate borrower from credit rating agencies. 
On the other hand, Circle's USDC lists verified investments that are yet to be categorized with accounts at insured federal banks.

 Cryptocurrencies: these include all the regular cryptocurrencies you know such as bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on.
Stablecoins are not less popular than other coins in the crypto space and as a matter of fact, they possess a host of very common coins which we will now look at to help you identify them as you navigate and interact on Crypto platforms.  


USD Coin
USD Coin was launched in 2018 and is jointly administered by Coinbase and Circle using the Centre Consortium.
USD Coin like Tether used to be linked to the U.S dollars before it switched to a more varied mix of collateral assets. Before this, it had a circulating supply of over $26 million. Circle predicts that it would hit $190 billion by 2023.
Circle has recently sealed a funding round worth $440 million with big industry names such as Fidelity Management and Research Company, FTX, and Digital Currency Group.
The company recently announced its plan to go public using a SPAC merger deal with Concord Acquisition Corp worth $4.5 billion.

Diem
A unique detail of Diem stablecoin is that it was birthed by Facebook and it has had an unprecedented impact under its former name, Libra even before it was launched.
The dying trend has even sent powerful governments such as China making efforts to create and explore digital currencies as inspired by crypto due to the size and influence of Facebook.
The initial plan for Diem was for this stablecoin to be backed by a cornucopia of currencies. This plan has since been diverted from developing different stablecoins backed individually by a separate coin.
In January 2021, the Diem dollar was launched.

Tether
One of the oldest and most popular stablecoins, USDT was launched in 2014 and holds the highest value in the market. With Tether USDT, money can be moved efficiently between exchanges every time cryptocurrency prices change on two exchanges.

Dai
On the Ethereum blockchain, Dai is a stablecoin that runs on MakerDAO. This stablecoin was created in 2015 and is linked to the U.S dollar while being backed by Ether.

Feel like you're going to burst from all this info? There's more! And while it may seem like stablecoins are faultless, this is sadly not the case. When it comes to coins, 

Do stablecoins have any drawbacks? Yes, they do, but these drawbacks are not the same as that of other cryptocurrencies. One such risk is counterparty risk which does not assure one of the entities possesses the collateral they claimed to have. 

Do stablecoins have a 1-1 backing? These questions remain unanswered. With stablecoins, reserves can be insufficient for redeeming every unit of stablecoins.
The nature of cryptocurrency is such that it can replace third-party companies entrusted with user funds. Because of this auspice, third parties can control transactions. What stablecoins contribute to this game is the additional capacity to control transactions.

Now that you have ""stable"" knowledge of stablecoins, it's up to you to decide whether you'll be getting onto the bandwagon or not. And if you do, you'll know what you're getting into!"

RAMP DEFI 2.0 OPTIMIZE YOUR YIELDS!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qrif6n/ramp_defi_20_optimize_your_yields/,GemHunterSince2014,1,2021-11-11 18:31:37,2,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qrif6n/ramp_defi_20_optimize_your_yields/,STAKING,"Greetings Cryptopians!

If you have not heard about RAMP DEFI i will try to cover as much as possible in this post so that all readers have a better understanding of what it is and how to optimize the platform for higher yields.

RAMP DEFI is a DeFi project focusing on **unlocking value** from your **staked capital** to be used as you wish.

It currently operates on **BSC**, **Polygon** and **Ethereum** ( more chains to be integrated soon i.e **Polkadot** &amp; **Solana** )

In this example i am drawing out i have some CAKE tokens that i am currently holding. I can stake my CAKE with an APY of **40,779**% ( **my staking rewards are being paid out every hour** ) and now i am entitled to take out a loan on my staked capital and use it as collateral if i wish to do so with RAMP DEFI´s own stable coin **rUSD.** 

I cannot take a loan that exceeds **70%** of my staked value, and doing so is regarded VERY HIGH RISK so i do not recommend on taking a loan that exceeds **30%** of your value. That is to keep your liquidation price relatively low. So i am taking a loan ( called minting ) on my CAKE for a interest rate of **2%**.

I can now use my **rUSD** as i please i can swap it to **BUSD** for example if i wish to, or any other token ( **there is a swap function on the site** ) the possibilities are endless since the borrowing APY is lower than your staking APY your actual loan pays of itself!!

&amp;#x200B;

But in this case I am going to provide liquidity on the rUSD-BUSD pool on pancakeswap then stake my LP token on the RAMP platform and enjoy the current APY of **30.427%**!

So to put it simple. I am borrowing money on my staked capital for an interest rate of **2%** and putting that money to work in another vault for **30%** APY. 

So if you are a holder like me and you wish to unlock some capital from your assets this is the BEST way to do it right now hands down.

&amp;#x200B;

**RAMP is still under development and some of the things in the pipeline is the following:**

\- *RAMP DEFI 2.0 to be released soon*

*- Liquidation protection function under development*

*- Automated loan repay function under development (* ***your interest can be used to pay of your loan*** *)*

*- Insurance via Nexus Mutual in discussion (* ***BIG*** *)*

*- ETH minter under development*

*- rUSD borrowing program (****60M incentive program****)*

*- rUSD stability program (****60M incentive program****)*

*- Solana chain under development*

*- Dot chain under development*

*- New single and LP vaults*

*- Significant exchange listing discussions  (* ***HINT COINB...*** *)*

&amp;#x200B;

**All the deployed contracts have been audited by several auditing firms and have never been compromised.**

&amp;#x200B;

The team is **NOT** anon and have experience from working on/with **Binance**, **Microsoft**, **BNP Paribas** etc.

I am 100% positive that RAMP DEFI will succeed over time and become one of the TOP DeFi projects the coming years after looking back on how much they have done and how much stuff they have in the pipeline. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently sitting on a marketcap of 107 million only!

Comparing it to some of our competitors like AAVE, MAKERDAO and Abracadabra.Money

That is sitting well over 1 billion in marketcap we have very bright times ahead of us!

I recommend you all to DYOR as always. Do not invest blindly into anything that people throw at you!

I firmly believe that the technology behind crypto, and many popular projects have already built infrastructure and systems that have significant value, the same way the internet has value or gaming items do. You may or may not believe that the entire world can change its ways and move to crypto, but at the very least after this you hopefully will agree that crypto has its place in creating a more open alternative to some systems.

Since I'm invested in crypto myself, I want to make it very clear that if I mention any specific crypto projects, it isn't financial advice, nor are positive or negative mentions a reason to invest in them. Do your own research if you do want to invest into crypto, but any coins or tokens that get mentioned will simply be in this thread with the purpose of providing an example.

My goal here is to educate on the premise of how blockchains and crypto work, so that people understand, besides the millions of scams that do exist, there are great projects working on great things, and maybe some of you might be inclined to try out some projects without even expecting any gains!

**So first of all, what are blockchains?**

Blockchains are simply distributed ledgers and computing systems. Now those are two fancy words that essentially mean they are systems, spread across the globe, running on many computers and servers, that track data, as well as allow their users to perform any tasks defined within their specifications. This can be as simple as adding two numbers, or handling a *smart contract* that only pays out insurance money if certain requirements are met. We'll get back to these later.

The benefit of having all the data, and code, running on a distributed system, is that everything is transparent. This doesn't always mean that I can read how much of a certain crypto got sent or received from each wallet, but the code can verify that you're allowed to perform certain transactions, and this is done by multiple people to ensure that trust doesn't need to really exist, since a large portion of people running and validating the network need to agree. This makes blockchains trustless.

**How does crypto play into this?**

Cryptocurrencies are coins or tokens built on top of blockchains. It's very important to understand the difference between a cryptocoin, and a cryptotoken. 

Each blockchain needs a way to incentivize those distributed computers and servers I mentioned. Since they're running the computational tasks, and storing all the data on the ledger, they get paid in a cryptocoin. For the Bitcoin network this is BTC, for Ethereum it's ETH, etc. Those fees are usually paid when a transaction is ran on the network, so i.e. if I send from my wallet to yours some ETH, then a transaction fee must be paid and a part of which gets paid to the miners that enabled this transaction to go through, the rest of the transaction fee is destroyed, making ETH deflationary in this case.

There's a lot more that can go into the economics of a cryptocoin, or token. Some of it I might bring up later. In any case, now to the tokens.

Tokens are representations of real-world assets, or completely digital assets, built on top of a blockchain. As they aren't used to pay transaction fees, and aren't built natively on the blockchain they reside on, we call them tokens instead of coins. This could even be something like a house deed, or the ownership certificate of a vehicle, etc. These tokens don't even need to only exist on one blockchain. They can be coded to exist on multiple, such as Solana, Ethereum and Cardano.

Now, not all blockchains make it possible to create a token on their network. Each blockchain has its own approach, often giving the creator of a token a reason to pick one or the other blockchain for their project. 

**How can tokens help us?**

Well, a big use-case I see in blockchain technology right now is the use of tokens, which is why it's getting a dedicated section. As I mentioned, tokens are just assets, either representing something in the real-world, or entirely digital. I can tokenize my house deed, as I mentioned, or generate a bunch of even tickets with the right blockchain. Then sell the whole thing digitally, in a trustless and low-fee manner compared to traditional centralized systems.

Those are just some examples I wanted to quickly mention on how tokens can actually have real-world use. On top of that, think about the games we play. LoL accounts, among others, can be sold for thousands of dollars because of the items they possess. Now, some might call it a bubble, or simply dumb, but it shows, that we humans are capable of attributing arbitrary value, to the oddest of things. The same can be seen in certain artwork (IMO, but those buying the art probably see it in a very different light) and playing cards for soccer/football or Pokémon. 

All those, more playful, systems, can be tokenized and gamified on blockchain as well. I can write a smart contract that generates a very specific set of cards, which are used in a PvP game, and the better a card's attributes are, the higher likelihood it has in winning a tournament. That's a very basic, and general example of what I'm trying to explain, but hopefully it makes sense.

**What are smart contracts?**

Smart contracts are what really make blockchains as capable as they are today, IMHO. A very straightforward explanation is that a smart contract is some code, that only does something when certain parameters are met. That's why it's called a smart contract, because it only executes its main task, after the contract is signed so to speak. Depending on the blockchain you're working on, smart contracts will have different capabilities, but there are some crazy use-cases for them that I bet some of you will find interesting.

This is where we get a bit more technical. To really understand how great a smart contract can be, you need to know that this code gets deployed on a blockchain by whoever created it, and gets a wallet address of its own just like you or I would on which it can accept transactions or even send them. This means smart contracts can interact with the crptocoins and tokens I mentioned earlier. A smart contract can also keep track of data, kind of like an Excel sheet on the blockchain, that is fully transparent and open. It's trustless, like I said, because you can view the code before interacting with it, to ensure that it truly will do what its creator claims it should. 

Because smart contracts have the capabilities I mentioned above, they can be used to validate the authenticity of certain assets. As I mentioned above, those gaming cards would be created by a smart contract, and since the smart contract only does exactly what it's told to do, people can verify that the card is real, by checking if its original creator was the smart contract that runs the game. 

On top of that, smart contracts can be used for more than just games. They can be used for voting, open and publicly ran insurances, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), liquidity and swapping protocols, lending protocols, etc.

All those get even more technical. A decentralized autonomous organization, is exactly what it sounds like. A company that doesn't have a CEO, or anyone running its operations. Everything that happens in that company is executed via code. If the smart contract is supposed to change, to e.g. support new features or use-cases, then people would first have to vote on it. The voting systems are always different as well, but a popular example is MakerDAO, which created its own token that people can hold to get voting rights. So essentially anyone can make business decisions by holding the token. This is a popular approach in crypto governance in general.

Liquidity, swapping and lending protocols have to do with DeFi. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, and is a whole new world of taking over the tasks from traditional banks, and putting them on the blockchain. Instead of earning interest through the middleman, who takes a cut, you add your liquidity to a liquidity pool on the blockchain, and make far higher returns. This can even be done with stablecoins, which are essentially coins or tokens pegged to a fiat currency value, so you don't have to worry about the volatility of crypto.

Swapping protocols allow people to trade between currencies without a middleman as well. Instead of a centralized exchange buying millions of crypto so that they have the liquidity when you want to buy it, a DEX (decentralized exchange) will use smart contracts to have the community pool this liquidity, and anyone that adds liquidity, just like with the above mentioned lending protocols, makes a good amount of fees for the risk and effort. I must add that the risk is usually extremely low with well-established DEXes.

I could go on about crypto all day. But the last two things I want to mention, is that crypto really could help some third-world countries, but even first-world countries in a meaningful way. The Cardano developers have been partnering with African nations to introduce better ways in tracking education data, voting turnouts, etc. using blockchain. These systems will be somewhat closed, as they probably will be ran by the government, but they will be leveraging the same blockchain technology we see here in the public system.

On top of that, there are blockchain projects working on early implementations of UBI. If we can ensure that everyone only signs up to said blockchain once, then we can pay out a certain basic income rate which is something some first-world countries direly need in this time of automation. 

**Touching on the Metaverse.**

I just want to make a quick note on the Metaverse, as recently it has been a controversial topic with Facebook's rebranding and the parabolic price action of related cryptocurrencies. I think it's interesting, and again, just like traditional games are able to put certain value on items, the Metaverse wants to build a decentralized digital world. So whether you like it or not is up to you, but it's kind of like playing VRChat on steroids. Along with the financial incentives, people are just going to do what they can to get in early. So maybe it's something for you!

That's all for my explanation on cryptocurrencies. I've written a previous thread going over some of the [myths about blockchain technology and crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pjjevn/crypto_isnt_just_a_trading_game_or_a_gamble_and/), if you guys are interested. My approach has always been to try and educate people. I don't want to change your minds, if everything I wrote here still has you convinced that crypto isn't for you, that's okay. But I hope everyone makes an informed decision, instead of following influencers and politicians, since they always have a stake, that will go against most of us here."
Markets Roundup: Ethereum Burn Rate Surges as DeFi Tokens Post Mixed Performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qsf747/markets_roundup_ethereum_burn_rate_surges_as_defi/,TheDefiantNews,1,2021-11-13 00:41:37,1,/r/defi/comments/qsf747/markets_roundup_ethereum_burn_rate_surges_as_defi/,NaN,"*A weekly recap of DeFi market action from* [*Sam Haig*](https://twitter.com/samuel_haig)

DeFi assets saw a mixed performance this week, with roughly half of the sector’s leading protocols suffering drawdowns by both TVL and token. Still, sector-wide TVL and market cap have continued trending into previously uncharted territory.

##### Market Cap Moves

According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi), the combined capitalization of DeFi tokens has continued to press into new all-time highs this past week, currently sitting at a record of $173.7B equal to 16% more than  the previous high from early May.

Terra (LUNA) remains at the top of the rankings with a nearly $22.9B market cap, followed by Chainlink (LINK) with $15.5B, and Uniswap (UNI) with $12.8B.

##### Top Gainers

*Two top DeFi tokens gained by more than triple digits this week, while a further seven tokens posted significant gains of between 25% and 50%.*

Keep3r (KP3R) + 217.4%

Loopring (LRC) + 175.3%

Lido DAO (LDO) + 50.1%

Liquity (LQTY) + 48.2%

Frax Share (FXS) + 47.6%

##### Biggest Losers

*More than half of the sector’s top 100 tokens by market cap suffered drawdowns for the week.* 

Popsicle Finance (ICE) – 40.7%

Spell Token (SPELL) – 28.8%

Ampleforth (AMPL) – 28.8%

Trader Joe (JOE) – 25.9%

KeeperDAO (ROOK) – 23%

##### TVL

According to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/), the total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector also posted new highs this week, tagging $275B for the first time on Nov. 9 before retracing to $268B.

More than two-thirds of DeFi capital is locked on the Ethereum network, which posted a record TVL of $182B on Nov.10 before retreating  to $179.5B.

Binance Smart Chain’s TVL saw modest growth this week, representing $21B in locked capital. However, BSC’s TVL is still down 35% compared to its May high of $32.4B, suggesting that rival EVM-compatible networks have amassed some of the liquidity previously on Binance Smart Chain.

Solana ranks third with $14.1B after posting a record high of $15.2B on Nov. 9, followed by Terra with $10.8B down from $11.5B, and Avalanche at a new high of $10B. Fantom also ranks sixth with $5.3B after hitting a new high of $6.1B, while Polygon ranks seventh with $5B — down more than 50% from its June record of $10.5B. 

All other networks host a combined DeFi TVL of $22.3B.

Curve currently ranks as the single-largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $20.7B across seven different networks, followed by MakerDAO with $19.5B on just Ethereum, and Aave with $16.1B across three chains.

Nearly half of the 100-largest protocols saw capital outflows for the week.

##### Burn Rate

Ethereum’s burn rate has increased by nearly nine times over the past fortnight, with 88,641 Ether (roughly $407.7M) having been destroyed in the past seven days according to [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money/).

Uniswap v2 was the largest burn source destroying 13,672 ETH ($62.9M), followed by wallet transfers with 9,596.5 ETH burned ($44.1M), and Tether with 5,636 ETH ($25.9M).

Uniswap v3 also ranked fourth by burn rate with 4,377 ETH ($20.1M), closely followed by OpenSea with 4,017 ETH ($18.5M), and Ethereum Name Service with 2,691 ETH ($12.4M).

##### Layer 2 Growth

According to [L2beat](https://l2beat.com/), Leading layer-two Arbitrum saw its TVL largely trend sideways at $2.7B this week, tagging a new high of $2.8B on Nov. 9.

Second-layer derivatives protocol dYdX ranks as the second-largest L2 by DeFI TVL with $967M despite a 4% drawdown, while rollups network Optimism ranks third with $325M after posting a record of $341M this past week.

##### Fees

Leading DEX Uniswap’s fee generation [surged](https://cryptofees.info/) this week, with the protocol driving $9.1 million worth of fees each day on average. Compared to just two weeks ago, Uniswap’s fees have nearly doubled.

Aave was the second-ranked DeFi dApp by fees with a daily average of $2 million, followed by SushiSwap with $1.8 million. By contrast, the entire Bitcoin network drove roughly $1 million in fees each day."

Another reason why L2s are going to explode and revolutionize Ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qt1irj/another_reason_why_l2s_are_going_to_explode_and/,busterrulezzz,1,2021-11-13 21:43:00,389,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qt1irj/another_reason_why_l2s_are_going_to_explode_and/,DISCUSSION,"It seems like there's not a day going by without a top post complaining about high gas fees on Ethereum. I totally agree with the core critic : retail investors are being priced out of the network. Nobody - except whales - can afford to pay 200$ for a simple swap.

But those days will soon be over.

A lot of people already know about Layer-2, the ""execution"" layer of Ethereum. They have names like Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync. But most of the times, when I mention those services, people are still not satisfied. UX isn't great, bridging to L2 costs money, and there are no liquidity on a lot of pairs there.

That's about to change!

This week, MakerDAO introduced Maker Wormhole, a solution that will let users **bridge DAI between mainnet and L2 instantly** and with ridiculously low fees (a fraction of a penny). The official launch is scheduled for Q1 2022, and it should work first on Arbitrum/Optimism, and then be deployed on other L2s. Even better, this Wormhole doesn't require any liquidity at all! DAI will be burnt and minted on each side of the transaction by an oracle.

This will have a huge implication for all Ethereum L2s : no more waiting times for withdrawing, frictionless transfers of capital between layers, and extremely low fees to get started on L2s. And this is just one of the many exciting projects that are in the works for the Ethereum ecosystem. Those are not distant vaporware ; it's happening right now, before our eyes. And I think a lot of people around here still don't realize how close we are to this revolution.

(Here are [more details](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introducing-maker-wormhole/11550) for those interested.)"

Everyone who has been in Cryptocurrency for a while knows that Reddit is one of the main hubs for Cryptocurrency information and communities (along with Twitter and Telegram).  However, with Reddit's search function not being ideal, and many communities having a variety of different names, it is hard to find any communities you may be looking for.

Below is a master-list of all CryptoCurrency Communities that have a significant presence on Reddit.  This list also includes ""Community Feed"" links, which carry a feed of all communities within a particular listing category.

This list will be updated as new communities are found or created.  Please comment below if there is a community you do not see listed.

Oct, 2021,vincy@footprint.network

Data Source：[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/9819c526-4bc6-4b58-9f30-70ee2401994a/aave-vs-compound-dashboard)

Despite its platform being launched in just 2020, Aave (AAVE) outgrew its established competitor Compound (COMP) and multiplied its market cap eightfold within half a year. In an industry with plenty of fast ascents and precipitous falls, many wondered whether the platform had the staying power to remain a central institution in DeFi lending . 

Nearly 2 years later, Aave is still going span, especially in relation to its one-time close rival. 

This article will take a closer look at the two platform’s strengths and weaknesses and explain why Aave was able to overtake Compound.

**Aave and Compound TVL Compared**

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics： TVL \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/f8h8p1ijfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e386bfc1aaac1af81fdf4debd7d4ebeab12c9eb)

As of Oct. 20, the DeFi market has surpassed $200 billion in total locked-in value (TVL) at $241.575 billion, with Aave’s TVL gaining the largest share at $18.89 billion. This is followed by lending protocols Curve ($18.01 billion), MakerDAO ($16.4 billion) and Compound ($12 billion).

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Latest changes to the ranking of the top 10 TVL platforms](https://preview.redd.it/21c2ormkfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e549794d93469f3b1ecde9ecfe7db9213f8181d0)

In the lending space, Aave's TVL has been way ahead of Compound in the last six months. This can be attributed to its model, which is similar to traditional finance, and ability to operate in Financial Conduct Authority-encrypted assets.

**Comparison of Market Cap**

As of Oct. 20, Aave continues to dwarf Compound in the DeFi lending and borrowing industry with a market cap of over US$4 billion versus the latter’s $1.97 billion. 

There are two other metrics that indicate Aave’s span position in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave VS Compound Market Cap \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qw2ryvrlfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9b83cd712b4ec7e0fa662fedb20e3bcd508f6a)

First, its circulating supply of 82% is higher than Compound’s 61%, indicating less inflationary pressure. 

Second, Aave has not had any major security incidents, indicating better security mechanisms likely favoured by depositors. 

**Aave’s deposit volumes dominate**

Aave's deposit volume of approximately $21 billion has remained higher than Compound's estimated $18 billion. Compound previously went live with subsidised lending and mining (disguisedly raised deposit returns and lowered lending rates to compete with Aave). Today, Aave has turned to lending and mining, coupled with Polygon's deposit and lending subsidies. Compound's rate advantage has largely disappeared as a side-effect of Aave's ecosystem bargaining power.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave VS Compound Deposited Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/cvm50yumfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3905bf49ce749fca4785daefd1400a1a01dad643)

The Aave team continues to focus on innovation while being highly risk-aware, and adjusts the direction of the product in a timely manner when issues arise, making the platform more secure.

**Can Aave users lend out more assets than Compound?**

Data for the previous month shows that Aave's borrowing balance has levelled off above $8.2 billion per day, which is still higher than Compound’s borrowing balance of $5-7 billion, with little overall volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave vs Compound Borrowed Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/galyhuynfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b3d7e77bdc38d4b1511927b2aef32bd4c705db)

Aave supports a wider variety of tokens, allowing users to lend out more assets and have more liquidity available. Some of Aave's rate agreements are also considered more innovative and have some advantages over Compound, such as unsecured flash loans, rate swaps and line of credit mandates. But on the downside, it comes with relatively high lending rates and loan fees.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Footprint Analytics：Aave's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/7zmxrlxofpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f2ac0af00f9ad43ef9485bf6b65715a40967d1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Compound's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/jek2itypfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e505296989245dd7a1eb2a9e34e5da801f12932a)

Aave and Compound support a variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as DAI, USDC and USDT, and non-stablecoins such as WBTC and UNI. With Aave, users mainly pledge ETH to lend USDC, DAI and USDT.  With Compound, users pledge ETH to lend DAI and USDC. While the supply of DAI and USDC is about the same, the former has more demand than the latter.

It is also worth noting that  Aave is one of the few licensed projects and is freely convertible in the United Kingdom.

**Differences in liquidation**

There are currently two traditional liquidation methods: the auction format of MakerDao and the liquidation method of Aave and Compound, which operate on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Compound sets a liquidation line of 75% as well as a borrowing rate that triggers liquidation when 100% is reached. However, only 50% of its assets will be liquidated. 

Aave, on the other hand, has a 5% safety cushion, mitigates risk, especially for new users.

Note: While the two liquidation methods have some efficiency issues, Liquity is a more innovative liquidation mechanism that differs from the traditional methods of MakerDao, Aave and Compound, as discussed in the article [Footprint: Can Liquity's mechanism really catch up from behind?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyTQi_HplDLXmXx7E9s-EEsqu32HrJxdCbCK66COCKM/edit#heading=h.lgi4s1f3dx3m) 

**Conclusion**

In summary, Aave continues its dominance over Compound, mainly due to  the following points:

* Aave has been more aggressive in innovation and business expansion, having more types of tokens released on its platform and gaining relative traction on unsecured flash lending, automated market makers, line of credit mandates, and with the traditional finance industry.
* On 19 October 2021, Aave TVL hit an all-time high that was made possible by the team behind the company whose focus is on safety, risk management and product strategy.
* Aave has progressed much  faster in terms of compliance to mitigate risk.

Data Source：[Footprint MakerDao VS Liquity Dashboard](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/1be91349-d915-4058-a66c-506ba5204fb3/maker-dao-vs-liquity-dashboard#secret=33356F9DF3D653EEC7E97247D099EB8F)

No topic makes crypto investors more nervous than stablecoins.

While stablecoins have opened the world of  DeFi lending and yield farming, they also threaten to bring it all down due to questionable asset reserves and opaque operations. 

At least, that’s the narrative with the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether. But are all stablecoins in the same boat?

Most people, even seasoned DeFi investors, are unaware how stablecoins work under the surface. Fewer understand the unique mechanisms behind every stablecoin. 

In this article, we’ll look at two mid-sized stablecoins to see how they go about the same goal—creating a stable, usable USD peg—in very different ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Market Cap of Stablecoin（Since Aug,2020） Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/vx6gg2tj1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45cfa087f26cf9472bbacb36632a0a4cd16ee337)

Launched in 2018, MakerDao created a stablecoin by locking up ETH to mint DAI. As a first-generation decentralised stablecoin, DAI still occupies the first seat among decentralized stablecoins due to its first-mover advantage, despite having suffered bad debts in March 2020.

A question on the centralization of stablecoins was widely raised that most stablecoins are centralized stablecoins formed with fiat collateral.  This became the initial motivation for Liquity to create LUSD in 2021.

According to Footprint, MakerDao’s TVL is about 7.6 times that of Liquity, while DAI's market cap is nearly 12 times that of LUSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL of MakerDao VS Liquity（Since 2021）  Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/61lpxwwk1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36a58dc8109a816c4bae8c94fd9652c3ab6de12)

But Liquity, as a latecomer to the over-collateralized stablecoin market, has had to learn from its predecessor. Its team engineered many of its mechanisms to address the pain points users of MarkerDao have. 

Note: For a more in-depth background of Liquity, read Footprint’s report, [*Can Liquity's mechanism really catch up from behind?*](https://www.footprint.network/news/articles/61834cbe42270900104d590e/footprint-can-liquitys-mechanism-really-catch-up-from-behind) 

This article will compare Liquity’s and MakerDao’s lending process, use cases, token patterns, and liquidation mechanisms.

**Comparison 1：The Lending Process**

**Collateral**

Before users can lend, they need to lock up their assets. Compared to Liquity, which can only lock up ETH, MakerDao allows multiple collaterals and supports centralized stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, TUSD, and tokens such as LINK, YFI, COMP, and Uniswap's LP token.

Liquity regards LUSD as a decentralized stablecoin, with ETH as collateral, to be truly decentralized. On the other hand, USDT is a centralized institution, but the resulting stablecoin produced is still centralized.

MakerDao had also supported only ETH as collateral until March 2020, but the plunge in ETH token price in the same month accelerated MakerDao's decision to support multiple collateral decisions online, opening up USDC to allow DAI to restore liquidity.

Multiple collaterals are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can diversify the protocol risk and adjust the supply and demand of DAI through stablecoins such as USDT. On the other hand, stablecoins with USDT as collateral also have numerous risks, such as being sued by the SEC for having inadequate reserve supervision. At the same time, the rise and fall of other tokens are also highly correlated with ETH.

It is impossible to say whether MakerDao or Liquity is more secure, but in terms of user choice, MakerDao has more diversified options.

**Fee and Minimum Collateral Ratio**

MakerDao receives a stability fee at the time of lending, which varies depending on the asset and different minimum collateral ratios (MCR).

For example, ETH has three pools with MCR from low to high of 130%, 145%, and 170%, corresponding to a stability fee of 5%, 2%, and 0.5%, respectively. Except for some stablecoins and LP Token, which have lower MCR, the pools of other tokens have MCR above 130%. The higher the collateral ratio (CR), will lower the capital utilization ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

[Data source：https:\/\/oasis.app\/](https://preview.redd.it/dqmroxon1xz71.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592cd784e648feb4acadb79700985b9d59747778)

For users at Liquity, the MCR is only 110%, with no increasing borrowing rate over time. While Liquity still has a borrowing fee between 0.5% and 5%, this one-time fee does not increase over time. This feature makes Liquity users more inclined to use their borrowings for the long term and not rush to pay them back, making Liquity's TVL relatively stable. And as users with LUSD will also hold it for a long time, it induces a rise in the supply of the USD-pegged stablecoin.

MakerDao users looking into increasing daily repayable fees must find higher interest rate investment options to cover the stability fees or need to pay back DAI as soon as possible to put the constant interest accrual on the debt on a halt.

**Comparison 2：The Use of Stablecoins**

The stablecoins minted by MakerDao and Liquity through collateral are DAI and LUSD, respectively, and there is a clear difference between the two in terms of usage.

MakerDao supports allowing DAI holders to earn DAI Savings Rate (DSR) on their DAI holdings by depositing them into a savings account. When the DSR rises, it stimulates more holders to deposit DAI, which influences an increase in DAI demand.

MakerDao governs the supply and demand of DAI through stability fees and DSR. Still, these adjustments are based on the judgment of MakerDAO members, and it comes back to the question of whether MakerDao is decentralized enough.

Liquity provides a stability pool for LUSD holders, allowing users to deposit LUSD into the pool to earn collateral ETH and LQTY rewards for others being liquidated. The amount of revenue depends on how many people will be liquidated. The more unstable the market is, the more the price of ETH drops rapidly, increasing the revenue of the stability pool.

&amp;#x200B;

[Liquity’s Core Model    Picture source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/8rbgndxo1xz71.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef2c6972a1ded553210e5d548c05ecab1c2e19f6)

From an external use case perspective, numerous protocols currently support DAI. And over 60% of LUSD holders are always in Liquity's stability pool and do not move outside of Liquity itself. While the percentage of LUSD in Curve, SushiSwap, and OlympusDao is growing, it is still lower in value than DAI.

**Comparison 3：The Token Pattern**

The tokens of MakerDao and Liquity are distributed as MKR and LQTY, with the main differences being their issuance and usage.

In terms of token issuance, there is no fixed amount of MKR supply, and it largely depends on the overall MarkerDao debt situation. In the event of a $5.3 million shortfall in MakerDao's collateral ETH when the global cryptocurrency market crashed in March 2020, MakerDao replenished DAI by issuing and auctioning newly minted MKR, thereby covering the bad debt incurred by burning DAI. Conversely, when the surplus of the protocol exceeds a certain threshold, the MKR will be burnt.

LQTY is not involved in the liquidation, and its supply is only 100 million. It is mainly derived from rewards for depositing LUSD in its stability pool, and users can stake their LQTY to share other users’ borrowing and redemption fees. LQTY is mainly used to motivate users to deposit their lent LUSD in its stability pool to improve the liquidation mechanism, which explains why over 60% of LUSD is still in Liquity's system.

&amp;#x200B;

[Circulating Supply（Since Sep 2021）   Data source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/l1p3fcxp1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad3c589fc1e62b36db4c29772e9f36913be4defe)

In terms of token usage, MKR is a governance token that uses MKR to vote on protocol parameters (e.g., stability fees, debt caps, MCR) and other essential ecosystem elements (e.g., funding working groups, grantmaking, etc.) However,  early and large investors hold most MKRs, which puts MakerDao in a centralized spiral.

LQTY is not a governance token, and its use case is only to help holders capture revenue, so the difference between the two token prices can be seen by as much as 400 times. The circulating supply of the token LQTY steadily increases until it is fully released, while the circulating supply of MKR will remain largely stable along with the market.

**Comparison 4：The Liquidation Mechanism**

The liquidation mechanism is the core of the stability of any lending system, and there are clear differences between MakerDao's and Liquity's liquidation mechanisms.

MakerDao, which has undergone the ordeal caused by the plunge of ETH in March 2020, has refined its liquidation mechanism by switching from the original English auction model to a Dutch auction with initial asking prices ranging from high to low. 

However, it is still an auction model with a six-hour time limit. MakerDao needs to have enough users holding DAI to participate in the event of liquidation. However, it has already strengthened the regulation of DAI circulation by introducing a stablecoin collateral and issuing MRK.

When a user falls below the MCR, anyone can initiate a liquidation operation on Liquity. The platform rewards the originator with a liquidation reserve of 200 LUSD deposited by the borrower at the time of borrowing plus 0.5% of the liquidated collateral to cover the gas fees. The LUSD used for liquidation comes from Liquity's stability pool, and, in return, holders of the stability pool will receive a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral ETH.

This model is profitable for both the liquidation originator and the liquidators holding LUSD in the stability pool, and liquidation occurs without waiting six hours, which will be executed as soon as the 110% collateral ratio is reached.

Even if significant assets need to be liquidated when the LUSD in the stability pool is depleted, a secondary liquidation mechanism called ""reallocation"" will occur. For a borrower who needs to be liquidated, the system will redistribute the debt and collateral from his Trove to other borrowers’ Troves. At which point, the higher the CR, the more debt and collateral the borrower will receive as additional net gain, even if his CR has been reduced.

In addition, Liquity has set up a *Recovery Mode* to ensure that it has sufficient collateral to cover its risks. When the system’s total collateral rate (TCR) falls below 150%, liquidation of all Troves with less than 150% CR will be liquidated. The *Recovery Mode* is a deterrent to users with low CR, keeping Liquity's TCR currently at around 280%.

&amp;#x200B;

[The TRC of Liquity（Since Apr 2021）  Data source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/9cvgls4r1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c247d79423df51550e0c2a6095bccae2e2134e72)

**Conclusion**

Footprint's comparison of the differences between the two protocols is summarised in the table below：

&amp;#x200B;

[MakerDao VS Liquity   Picture source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/2q4tpc7s1xz71.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccb2796d95b609207e805b17ad186119bc9cbbf)

Liquity can be said to be standing on the shoulders of giants, setting up mechanisms that target MakerDao's pain points everywhere. But it is not conclusive that Liquity's mechanism can beat MakerDao since both are the product of continuous optimization according to the market at different times. As the earliest stablecoin lending protocol, MakerDao has already established a firm foothold in the market through its first-mover advantage.

MakerDao and DAI still hold a massive advantage over Liquity in terms of size. Recently, MakerDao has also been expanding its use cases, proposing to make DAI a clean money and developing use cases to solve real problems in the real world.

As a front-runner in decentralized stablecoins, MakerDao has been criticized for its involvement in centralization, but its forward-looking and more ambitious strategic perspective is an advantage. However, Liquity will need to continue building a solid foundation in expanding the use cases for LUSD or develop more differentiation in the stablecoin segment, such as its strategy for long-term borrowing.

When is DeFi 2.0 starting on tezos?,https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/qvl8ed/when_is_defi_20_starting_on_tezos/,greeneye44,1,2021-11-17 07:28:25,1,/r/tezos/comments/qvl8ed/when_is_defi_20_starting_on_tezos/,DeFi ,"Tezos is catching up with 5 years of ethereum development (MakerDAO DAI, Uniswap etc) but now we have 6 DEX that all have the same issues of distributing their token to bring liquidity (except quipuswap that has not opened farms yet)  


Finematics did a great video of DeFi 2.0 with protocols such as Tokamak or OlympusDAO.   
I am not an expert and I haven't used them to understand how it improves protocol sustainability (vs users just moving funds to chase the best yield), but it does seem interesting!!

Which protocols actually distributes their fees?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qvvfrf/which_protocols_actually_distributes_their_fees/,karthur26,1,2021-11-17 17:20:18,6,/r/defi/comments/qvvfrf/which_protocols_actually_distributes_their_fees/,NaN,"Hi everyone, I'm trying to research into different protocols and which ones actually share their profits with holders?

Here's what I've found, please correct me if I'm representing anything wrong:

* **Ethereum**: fees from the blocks are burned, sometimes more but usually less than the block rewards. https://watchtheburn.com/
* **Uniswap**: 0.3% trading fees in v2 go to the reserves for LPs, and v3 has swap and pool fees, of which none goes to token holders. https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/fees
* **Sushiswap**: 0.3% fee where 0.25% goes to LP and 0.05% goes to a pool that buys SUSHI and gives it to xSUSHI holders (SUSHI stakers) https://help.sushidocs.com/products/sushiswap-exchange https://analytics.sushi.com/bar (they note that xSUSHI holders are getting ~10% APY)
* **Pancakeswap**: 0.25% trading fee, 0.17% of which to LP, 0.03% to treasury, and 0.05% buys CAKE and burned.
* **MakerDao**: they charge a ""stability fee"" ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% APY and then this fee goes to burn MKR tokens https://makerdao.world/en/learn/vaults/stability-fees/
* **Curve Finance**: 0.04% fees on pools, half goes to LP and half goes to veCRV holders (CRV stakers). https://curve.fi/rootfaq


My thesis is that tokens that distribute profits (in the form of buyback or burning) will attract more investors and also long term price sustainability. Burning the tokens would benefit all holders, whereas buy/distribute would only benefit the recipients (ie xSUSHI).  The buy and burn can also be countered by huge mints that cause supply inflation and therefore dilutes the token value.

Overall, this is pretty gloomy imo of tokens that would actually generate meaningful value and distribute.  Any others I should be looking at?"

Its USP are POS, forkless, has  performed 8 major updates in the last 3 years, on chain governance.

The  use of the blockchain with dapps really started in April this year, the  number of contract calls is increasing fast (can break ATH this month).

The top dapps are hicetnunc.art/ or objkt.com/(2 NFT places), you can find the dapps by use on dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/tezos

Tezos  is really looking to be a blockchain to be used rather than a L1 token  to hold. It is also used by the european central bank experiments,  voting platform in some cities, STO (security token offering), NFTs so  could be the backend of mainstream adoption IMO.

The post is specifically about Tezos DeFi It's being built as we speak but we can already identify projects on mainnet like

• app.youves.com/ or kolibri.finance/ similar to makerDAO (input collateral &amp; borrow a algo stablecoin),

• app.crunchy.network/ that is DeFi as a service, everyone can add a farm paying CRUNCH token, also a launchpad

• The DEXs: 5 of them quipuswap.com/, plentydefi.com/, or spicyswap.xyz/#/app are the most famous ones

Now  whats interesting in the analysis, I have compared the Fully Diluted  Market Cap of the top DEX of each chain and normalised it by the L1 FDMC  (since the more money in a blockchain token, the more money invested in  the ecosystem too)

I will be using coinmarketcap data for this

• UNISWAP (25B) and ETH (556B) -&gt; ratio 4.5%

• CAKE (4.5B) and ETH (103B) -&gt; ratio 4.4%

• JOE (1.3B) and AVAX (63B) -&gt; ratio 2.1%

• SRM (72B) and SOL (121B) -&gt; ratio 60% ?!

• SPIRIT (272m) and FTM (8.5B) -&gt; ratio 3%

• QUICK (400m) and MATIC (17.4B) -&gt; ratio 2.3%

Now let's look at tezos.... (no data on CMC since the quipuswap API is not fully operational yet)

• QUIPU (28m) and TEZOS (5.3B) -&gt; ratio 0.49%

•  PLENTY (46m) and TEZOS (5.3B) -&gt; ratio 0.87% See the huge difference  with the other chains! And Plenty offers &gt;100 APR% for single  staking

If  you have insights on why only tezos DeFi would behave this way compared  to other chains, let me know please! Maybe because of the lack of  visibility due to CMC not listing the tokens yet?"

**17th November 2021, Mahe, Victoria, Seychelles — Cardano and Avalanche-powered DeFi ecosystem** [**ADA Finance**](https://adafinance.io/) **has been announced as the winner of the highly anticipated “Best DeFi project of the Year” award at the 2021 AIBC Summit in Malta.**

The win took place on November 16th, in unison with the addition of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who has joined the project as an investor. These big announcements have synchronized perfectly for ADA Finance, with the project’s IDO just one month away in mid-December, 2021.

**Best DeFi Project of the Year**

Cross-Dual-Chain DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has beaten some serious industry contenders to take the highly coveted prize of the “Best DeFi Project of The Year” award at Europe’s premier event for blockchain, AI, and emerging tech, AIBC Summit, Malta.

ADA Finance is the first Cardano-based project to win the award, beating other highly revered projects, including community-focused DeFi token Safemoon, and PoW/DPoS hybrid consensus ABEYFoundation. 

These recent achievements have put the spotlight on ADA Finance, with the project now joining the ranks of the awards previous winners, MakerDAO, and AI-powered DeFi portfolio project SingularityDAO. 

**Roger Ver &amp; Other Big Names Join the Party**

The success of ADA Finance has caught the attention of Bitcoin investor and blockchain advocate Roger Ver. Known widely as “Crypto Jesus”, Ver was an early investor in Bitcoin back in 2011, and the previous CEO of Bitcoin.com.

Known for his past involvement in successful blockchain projects, Ver has invested in Ripple,  (XRP) Kraken, Shapeshift, and Bitpay. More recently Ver has shifted his focus to the DeFi market with a sizable investment in decentralized oracle service provider XFai. 

The project has also landed an A-list Influencer line-up alongside Ver, including YouTube sensation Carl “The Moon” and other notable names Crypto Banter, and MMCrypto. With a star-studded line-up bullish on the already successful project, all focus is now on the platform’s ADAFI token IDO in mid-December. 

**First Publicly Released Code on Cardano**

ADA Finance has chosen to take the innovative route of [releasing its code on a public repository](https://github.com/ADA-Finance/cardano-staking-smart-contract), becoming the first ever project built on Cardano to do so. The code is released under the GNU General Public License. This means that anyone can fork the code, as long as they also make their own staking code public. 

ADA Finance is initiating this movement for the entire Cardano ecosystem, hoping that more projects will follow. This pioneering move speaks to the heart of the Cardano philosophy, and promotes openness and trust across both Cardno and the greater blockchain industry, with trust, fairness and potential for massive growth just some of the resulting benefits. 

In addition, ADA Finance has recently announced an Academy Program with Bitdegree to help create awareness for Cardano blockchain development, and help to foster further involvement from the wider coding community. The program will also help to build a strong, sustainable ecosystem and grow talented, fully certified smart contract developers as Cardano grows as a layer one project. 

With the “Best DeFi Project of the year” award as a springboard, a highly innovative blockchain, Academy Program, industry support, pioneering Cardano philosophy, and upcoming IDO, ADA Finance looks to be a contender for the hottest DeFi project going into 2022, and beyond.

**17th November 2021, Mahe, Victoria, Seychelles — Cardano and Avalanche-powered DeFi ecosystem** [**ADA Finance**](https://adafinance.io/) **has been announced as the winner of the highly anticipated “Best DeFi project of the Year” award at the 2021 AIBC Summit in Malta.**

The win took place on November 16th, in unison with the addition of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who has joined the project as an investor. These big announcements have synchronized perfectly for ADA Finance, with the project’s IDO just one month away in mid-December, 2021.

**Best DeFi Project of the Year**

Cross-Dual-Chain DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has beaten some serious industry contenders to take the highly coveted prize of the “Best DeFi Project of The Year” award at Europe’s premier event for blockchain, AI, and emerging tech, AIBC Summit, Malta.

ADA Finance is the first Cardano-based project to win the award, beating other highly revered projects, including community-focused DeFi token Safemoon, and PoW/DPoS hybrid consensus ABEYFoundation. 

These recent achievements have put the spotlight on ADA Finance, with the project now joining the ranks of the awards previous winners, MakerDAO, and AI-powered DeFi portfolio project SingularityDAO.

How the fuck are these two things vastly different projects. Feel like a moron but also curious how legally they've not sued eachother into oblivion for very clear confusion on the part of consumers conflating the two. Google and youtube search recommendations pre-fill alot of my questions trying to compare the two but no results come up comparing them, so clearly I'm not the only one. And typing either one in CMC gives the same results. 

Should I sell my DAO and get MKR like I originally wanted? Is anyone here even vested into DAO?

Maker Delegate GFX Labs Would Like Your Vote!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qxhjok/maker_delegate_gfx_labs_would_like_your_vote/,PaperImperium,1,2021-11-19 22:38:08,13,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qxhjok/maker_delegate_gfx_labs_would_like_your_vote/,NaN,"Many of you know me as PaperImperium, one of the original slate of delegates at MakerDAO. I have now transitioned to help build the GFX Labs governance team, which means starting over with a new delegation contract. [I am here to ask for your delegated MKR votes!](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet)

Please feel free to ask any questions in the comments, but here are three common ones to get us started:

**Why did you switch to work for GFX Labs instead of remaining a solo delegate?**  
One of the continuing problems at Maker is that votes are increasingly complex and nuanced. Delegates have consistently not had access to expertise on a number of topics. One of the most glaring is that Maker has no legal expertise in-house to guide delegates. Without any formal legal advice on contentious topics such as the recent vote to integrate Deco Protocol into Maker, delegates were forced to seek out informal opinions from a variety of sources -- former SEC attorneys, crypto-specific counsel intimately familiar with Maker, and general personal attorneys. Being part of GFX Labs ensures that I and my colleagues who cover other protocols for GFX have access to professional legal, economic, and technical expertise to avoid potentially catastrophic mistakes when delegates are left to Google their way to whether something presents legal, economic, or technical risk to Maker. I firmly believe over time most delegates on large protocols will be part of teams that can provision professional resources -- GFX Labs and Gauntlet are likely the first two of many.

**What is your stance on burning?**  
The buy-and-burn mechanic is core to Maker's value proposition. While it is normally good policy to avoid buybacks when a business is in a growth stage, Maker has the unique quality of being able to source capital extremely cheaply without the need for dilution. Because of its unique position of being systemically important to the DeFi ecosystem, Maker does have a responsibility to maintain adequate reserves in the Surplus Buffer to cover at least a year of (rapidly growing) contributor expenses and cover any bad debt that may be liquidated at a loss. However, having at least a small burn ongoing at all times not only offsets the (rapidly growing) obligations to vest MKR alongside (rapidly growing) contributor salary expenses, but it also ensures there is a healthy ecosystem of keepers to sell MKR to burn at reasonable prices. 

**What can you do to add value to Maker?**  
For those unfamiliar with me, I regularly interface with US and international regulators, lawmakers, and traditional finance actors. This includes but is not limited to education efforts with our harshest critics like Senator Warren's advisors, providing industry understanding to regulators such as the CFPB, and negotiating a central role for Maker in financing the government-issued, tokenized bonds.\* With the addition of my personal relationships to the resources and expertise in governance services already in GFX Labs, I fully expect that there is much more value to deliver than passively voting on polls.

\*This agreement is subject to approval by Powell, Legarde, and host central banks. Decision whether or not to green light this program is expected by the end of December 2021.

**I encourage you to delegate a portion of your MKR to GFX Labs' delegate contract to best provide an advocate for a Maker that can grow and flourish for years to come.

43.   **Monero (XMR):** Monero’s goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.
44.   **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.

I have a bunch of questions about MakerDAO that I haven't really had success answering from the docs and was hoping someone here may have made a nicer, more friendly guide.

1) What happens when the value of collateral decreases? Both when it decreases but is still over collateralised (100% &lt; x &lt; 150%) and when it becomes under collateralised (x &lt; 100%)

2) At what point does a Keeper step in and sell the vault to prevent further loss?

3) How does MakerDAO prevent bad actors? Say ETH tanks and the vault is now under collateralised. If the actor never comes back and makes away - what happens?"

DeFi: A comprehensive guide to decentralized finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r09uii/defi_a_comprehensive_guide_to_decentralized/,KofiOlut,1,2021-11-23 17:52:21,11,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r09uii/defi_a_comprehensive_guide_to_decentralized/,GENERAL-NEWS,"After Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, a robust industry blossomed, stemming from the asset, its concept and its underlying technology. The crypto and blockchain space boasts different niches in which projects and companies develop solutions for various use cases. 

One such niche is the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which was created as an alternative to traditional financial services. More specifically, DeFi is comprised of smart contracts, which in turn power decentralized applications (DApps) and protocols. Many of the initial DeFi applications were built on Ethereum, and the majority of the ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) remains concentrated there. 

At its core, Bitcoin (BTC) carries qualities touted as pillars of decentralization. DeFi, however, expands on those qualities, adding additional capabilities.

## What is DeFi?

A subcategory within the broader crypto space, DeFi offers many of the services of the mainstream financial world in a fashion controlled by the masses instead of a central entity or entities. 

Lending may have started it all, but DeFi applications now have a number of use cases, giving participants access to saving, investing, trading, market-making and more. Decentralized finance’s ultimate goal is to challenge, and eventually replace, traditional financial services providers. DeFi often harnesses open-source code, giving anyone the opportunity to build on preexisting applications in a permissionless, composable manner. 

“Finance” is easy to understand, but what is “decentralization?” In short, decentralization means that no chief body controls something. To an extent, banks and other financial institutions have power over your funds. These entities can freeze your assets, and you are at the mercy of their hours of operation and cash reserves.

The decentralization aspect of DeFi is not only a dispersal of power but also a dispersal of risk. For example, if a company holds all of its customer data in one spot, a hacker needs only to access that particular site for a vast amount of data. In contrast, storing that data across several locations or removing that single point of failure could improve security.

## DeFi vs. traditional finance

For this comparison, commercial banks will be used as an example. In the traditional world, you may use financial institutions to store your money, borrow capital, earn interest, send transactions, etc. Commercial banks carry a lengthy, proven history of performance. Commercial banks can provide insurance and have security measures in place to ward off and protect against theft. 

On the other hand, such establishments hold and control your assets to a degree. You are limited by banking hours for particular actions, and transactions can be cumbersome, requiring settlement times on the back end. Additionally, commercial banks require specific customer details and identifying documents for participation.

DeFi is a segment that comprises financial products and services that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection and operates without the involvement of banks or any other third-party firms. The decentralized financial market doesn’t sleep, and therefore, transactions take place 24/7 in near real-time, while no intermediary has the power to stop them. You can store your crypto on computers, in hardware wallets and elsewhere, and gain access at any time.

Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies hold these characteristics due to the underlying technology that backs these assets. Thanks to DeFi’s dependence on blockchain technology, transactions are completed faster, cheaper and — in some cases — more securely than they would with human intervention. Decentralized finance seeks to use crypto technologies to solve a plethora of issues that exist in the traditional financial markets.

https://preview.redd.it/ap3mp2umhb181.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b194edf1a1c463e0ffa7101cdab5ac77f0cb51a

Overall, DeFi gives participants the opportunity to access borrowing and lending markets, take long and short positions on cryptocurrencies, earn returns through yield farming, and more. Decentralized finance has the potential to be a game changer for the 2 billion unbanked people in the world, in particular, who don’t have access to traditional financial services for one reason or another. 

DeFi solutions are built on various blockchains, with the ecosystems composed of participants interacting in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion, facilitated via distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, which keep the systems in check. Such results are not bound by geographic borders and do not require identifying documentation for participation. 

The framework for this financial system functions according to programmed rules. Instead of using an intermediary such as a bank to borrow capital, you would send amounts of a specific cryptocurrency to a secure digital location — a smart contract — as collateral for your loan, receiving a different asset in return. Your collateral assets would then sit locked up until you send back the loan amount.

Though you may or may not interact in a straightforward P2P manner when using DeFi solutions, the spirit of the process is P2P, in that third parties are replaced with technology not ruled by a central authority.

## What makes up DeFi?

DeFi boomed in 2020, bringing an influx of projects into the cryptosphere and popularizing a new financial movement. Since Bitcoin essentially holds many DeFi characteristics, no firm start date exists for the inception of the DeFi sector, other than Bitcoin’s launch in 2009. 

Following 2017, however, a number of ecosystems — such as Compound Finance and MakerDAO — gained prevalence, popularizing additional financial capabilities for crypto and DeFi. In 2020, the DeFi niche really took off as additional platforms surfaced, in line with folks harnessing DeFi solutions for strategies such as yield farming.  

### Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) 

DEXs allow users to trade digital assets in a noncustodial way without the need for an intermediary or third-party service provider. Although they comprise only one element of the DeFi sector, DEXs have been a part of the overall crypto industry for years. They offer participants the ability to buy and sell digital currency without creating an account on an exchange. 

DEXs let you hold assets away from a centralized platform while still allowing for trading at will from your wallets via transactions that involve blockchains. Automated market makers, a type of DEX, became prevalent in 2020 and use smart contracts and liquidity pools to facilitate the purchase and sale of crypto assets.

DEXs are typically built on top of distinct blockchains, making their compatibility specific to the technology on which they are developed. DEXs built on Ethereum’s blockchain, for example, facilitate the trading of assets built on Ethereum, such as ERC-20 tokens. 

Using DEXs requires having compatible wallets. In general, self-custody crypto wallets let you control your assets, and some of them are compatible with DEXs. However, this type of asset storage puts more responsibility on you for the security of your funds. Additionally, certain DEXs may have fewer features and higher associated financial fees than centralized exchanges.

DEXs have come a long way in terms of liquidity and accumulating a regular user base, which continues to grow. As DEXs become more scalable — that is, faster and more efficient — their trading volumes are expected to increase even more.

### Aggregators and wallets

Aggregators are the interfaces by which users interact with the DeFi market. In the most basic sense, they are decentralized asset management platforms that automatically move users’ crypto assets between various yield-farming platforms to generate the highest returns.

Wallets are locations for holding and transacting digital assets. Wallets can store multiple different assets, or just a single asset, and can come in an array of forms, including software, hardware and exchange wallets. Self-hosted wallets — wallets for which you manage your own private keys — can be a key component of DeFi, helping facilitate various DeFi platform uses, depending on the wallet. Exchange-based wallets, in contrast, govern your private keys for you, giving you less control, but also less security responsibility.

### Decentralized marketplaces

Decentralized marketplaces represent a core use case for blockchain technology. They put the “peer” in peer-to-peer networks in that they allow users to transact with one another in a trustless way — that is, without the need for an intermediary. The smart contract platform Ethereum is the top blockchain facilitating decentralized marketplaces, but many others exist that allow users to trade or exchange specific assets, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

### Oracles/prediction markets 

Oracles deliver real-world off-chain data to the blockchain via a third-party provider. Oracles have paved the way for the prediction markets on DeFi crypto platforms, where users can place bets on the outcome of an event, ranging from elections to price movements, for which the payouts are made via a smart contract-governed automated process.

### Layer one

Layer one represents the blockchain that the developers choose to build on. It is where the DeFi applications and protocols are deployed. As discussed, Ethereum is the main layer-one solution in decentralized finance, but there are rivals, including Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Tezos, Solana and Cosmos. These solutions will inevitably interact with one another as the DeFi space matures. 

Having DeFi sector solutions run on different blockchains has a number of potential benefits. Blockchains may be forced to improve speed and lower fees, based on the performance of competing blockchains, creating a competitive environment that potentially results in improved functionality. The existence of different layer-one blockchains also leaves more room for development and traffic, instead of everyone trying to pile onto a single layer-one option.

## Use cases 

To help answer the question “What is DeFi?” it helps to explore its use cases. Whether you want to lend or borrow, trade on DEXs, stake your digital assets, or something else — even game — there are new ways to satisfy those needs. Below is a list of some of the key use cases for decentralized finance.

### Lending platforms 

Lending and borrowing have become some of the most popular activities in DeFi. Lending protocols allow users to borrow funds while using their own cryptocurrency as collateral. Decentralized finance has seen massive amounts of capital flow through its ecosystem, with lending solutions commanding billions of dollars in total value locked, or TVL — the amount of capital held locked in any solution at a given time.

### Payments and stablecoins

In order for DeFi to qualify as a financial system, comprising transactions and contracts, there must be a stable unit of account, or asset. Participants must be able to expect that the bottom will not fall out in the value of the asset they are using. This is where stablecoins come in. 

Stablecoins bring stability to the activities that are common in the DeFi market, such as lending and borrowing. Considering that stablecoins are generally pegged to a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar or euro, they don’t exhibit nearly as much volatility as cryptocurrencies and therefore are desirable for commerce and trading.

### Margin and leverage 

The margin and leverage components take the decentralized finance market to the next level, allowing users to borrow cryptocurrencies on margin using other cryptocurrencies as collateral. In addition, smart contracts can be programmed to include leverage to potentially ramp up the user’s returns. The use of these DeFi components also increases the risk exposure for the user, especially considering that the system is based on algorithms and there is no human component if there is a problem.  

## DeFi-native activities 

Liquidity pools are a necessary tool for many decentralized exchanges to facilitate trading. They provide trading liquidity for buyers and sellers, who pay a fee for their transactions. To become part of a pool, liquidity providers can send specific funds to a smart contract and receive pool tokens in return, earning passive profit based on the fees traders pay when they interact with that pool. Pool tokens are the key to getting your deposited funds back.

Sometimes known as liquidity mining, yield farming is another activity in the DeFi space, involving searching for profit via various DeFi projects through participating in liquidity pools. While there are intricacies to yield farming, there is one key reason that market participants are flocking to this phenomenon: It allows you to use your crypto holdings to earn even more crypto.

By yield farming, users lend out their crypto to other users and earn interest that is paid in crypto — usually “governance tokens” that give liquidity providers a say in the operation of the protocol. It is a way for investors to put their crypto to work to enhance returns and is a key innovation in the DeFi market. Yield farming has been dubbed the “Wild West” of DeFi, with market participants hunting down the best strategies that they then often keep close to the vest so as not to tip their hand to other traders and lose the magic.

## DeFi risks?

For all its promise, the decentralized finance space remains a nascent market that is still experiencing some growing pains.

DeFi has yet to reach wide-scale adoption, and in order for it to do so, blockchains must become more scalable. Blockchain infrastructure remains in its early form, much of which is clunky to use for developers and market participants alike. When using some platforms, transactions move at a snail’s pace, and this will continue to be the case until scalability improves, which is the idea behind the development of Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2. Fiat on-ramps to DeFi platforms can also be painfully slow, which threatens to hold back user adoption.

DeFi has grown significantly. Given its youth and innovation, the legal details around DeFi have likely not yet fully materialized. Governments across the globe may aim to fit DeFi into their current regulatory guidelines, or they may construct new laws pertaining to the sector. Conversely, DeFi and its users may already be subject to specific regulations.

In terms of adoption, it is uncertain how exactly things will pan out in the future. One potential outcome might include traditional finance adopting aspects of DeFi while retaining elements of centralization rather than DeFi completely replacing mainstream financial options. Any entirely decentralized solutions, however, may continue to operate outside of mainstream finance."
Mint DAI with ETH plus yield,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r0jsqu/mint_dai_with_eth_plus_yield/,dreamsofsteel,1,2021-11-24 02:32:40,3,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r0jsqu/mint_dai_with_eth_plus_yield/,NaN,"Just learned about MakerDAO so forgive me if this is a stupid question. I have many of my assets earning yield in cefi options like Gemini Earn, Celcius, etc.

The stability fee for locking ETH is only 2.5% and I can earn 8% on DAI in Gemini Earn. Is that just free money assuming I don't get liquidated or am I missing something here? Is the stability fee just taken from the collateral periodically to cover the costs?"
ADA Finance Wins “Best DeFi Project of the Year”,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoinvstr/comments/r0lw4s/ada_finance_wins_best_defi_project_of_the_year/,bull1tz,1,2021-11-24 04:04:43,0,/r/cryptoinvstr/comments/r0lw4s/ada_finance_wins_best_defi_project_of_the_year/,NaN,"
   
   
Cardano and Avalanche-powered DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has been announced as the winner of the highly anticipated “Best DeFi project of the Year” award at the 2021 AIBC Summit in Malta. 

The win took place on November 16, in unison with the addition of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who has joined the project as an investor. These big announcements have synchronized perfectly for ADA Finance, with the project’s IDO just one month away in mid-December, 2021.

Best DeFi project of the year
-----------------------------

Cross-Dual-Chain DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has beaten some serious industry contenders to take the highly coveted prize of the “Best DeFi Project of The Year” award at Europe’s premier event for blockchain, AI, and emerging tech, AIBC Summit, Malta.

ADA Finance is the first Cardano-based project to win the award, beating other highly revered projects, including community-focused DeFi token Safemoon, and PoW/DPoS hybrid consensus ABEYFoundation. 

These recent achievements have put the spotlight on ADA Finance, with the project now joining the ranks of the awards previous winners, MakerDAO, and AI-powered DeFi portfolio project SingularityDAO. 

Roger Ver and other big names join the party
--------------------------------------------

The success of ADA Finance has caught the attention of Bitcoin investors and blockchain advocate Roger Ver. Known widely as “Crypto Jesus”, Ver was an early investor in Bitcoin back in 2011, and the previous CEO of Bitcoin.com.

Known for his past involvement in successful blockchain projects, Ver has invested in Ripple, (XRP) Kraken, Shapeshift, and Bitpay. More recently Ver has shifted his focus to the DeFi market with a sizable investment in decentralized oracle service provider XFai. 

The project has also landed an A-list Influencer line-up alongside Ver, including YouTube sensation Carl “The Moon” and other notable names Crypto Banter, and MMCrypto. With a star-studded line-up bullish on the already successful project, all focus is now on the platform’s ADAFI token IDO in mid-December. 

First publicly released code on Cardano
---------------------------------------

ADA Finance has chosen to take the innovative route of releasing its code on a public repository, becoming the first-ever project built on Cardano to do so. The code is released under the GNU General Public License. This means that anyone can fork the code, as long as they also make their own staking code public. 

ADA Finance is initiating this movement for the entire Cardano ecosystem, hoping that more projects will follow. This pioneering move speaks to the heart of the Cardano philosophy, and promotes openness and trust across both Cardano and the greater blockchain industry, with trust, fairness, and potential for massive growth just some of the resulting benefits. 

In addition, ADA Finance has recently announced an Academy Program with Bitdegree to help create awareness for Cardano blockchain development, and help to foster further involvement from the wider coding community. The program will also help to build a strong, sustainable ecosystem and grow talented, fully certified smart contract developers as Cardano grows as a layer one project. 

With the “Best DeFi Project of the year” award as a springboard, a highly innovative blockchain, Academy Program, industry support, pioneering Cardano philosophy, and upcoming IDO, ADA Finance looks to be a contender for the hottest DeFi project going into 2022, and beyond.

I guess diversifying across types of collateral could be emulated by splitting a fund across different coins... but that would raise risk.

Request For Input: Where To Notify Users When Collateral Is Offboarded?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2sjob/request_for_input_where_to_notify_users_when/,PaperImperium,1,2021-11-27 01:38:03,18,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2sjob/request_for_input_where_to_notify_users_when/,NaN,"Hello, MakerDAO community. Over the last few weeks, quite a few smaller collateral types (AAVE, COMP, BAL, ZRX, LRC, various UNI LP tokens, etc) have been off boarded due to failure to justify their oracle costs.

Unfortunately, I have heard *several times* from vault users who were liquidated without even understanding why. This represents a poor user experience, obviously, and potentially exposes users to unexpected taxable events or even losses if a leveraged position is forcefully liquidated.

While offboarding small, unprofitable, thinly used vault types is still the correct business decision, I support taking every reasonable step to mitigate vault users from being unexpectedly left with unsupported vault smart contracts.

**My question to you: What channels do you use that would alert you to a change like this (aside from the MakerDAO Forum and this subreddit)?** Feel free to include communication channels that are both affiliated and unaffiliated with MakerDAO.

Thank you."

A Dao.

Dao’s are pretty easy to understand.

The Dao is an organizational structure. Everybody within the Dao has a voting right. No centralism, no egoist decision making. If you and your partners decide to set up a Dao, everyone who has the permission can decide how to spend the 500.000€ that the investor gave to you crazy madackers.

Why do I think it is worth talking about DAO´s?  
Corporate structures are deeply embedded in our culture. Different countries have different ways of working. This is normal. But now, we have an international way of decision making. Why is that something new? You could just do a whatsapp group and decide your stuff in there no?

You could, but every decision is in the end simply written in a group. Someone then has to activate whatever was decided on and can still think: Fuckit this is better for me.

Why do I think DAO´s will change corporate structures?

One thing I learned in my life is:  
Synergies are more than Energies.  
We can achieve more together. Value is the most important aspect of an organization. The Value is what a company's success and attractiveness are measured on. AND WE CAN SIMPLY MAXIMIZE VALUE BY MINIMIZING EGOISTIC THINKING.  
Companies are transforming and they are re-structuring/digitalizing nearly all of their processes. The new way to **digitalize and restructure** companies **organizations** will give a huge advantage to the ones that understand how to use DAO´s to maximize the outcome of value in their organization. Just like: MakerDao

How does a DAO set-up work?

1. And most important: Choose the rules.

A Dao is based on the smart contract it operates. Therefore, you will need to decide on how to vote. What to vote for. What decisions will the DAO take? Investment Clubs can choose if and how much to invest into the new crazy toothbrush project. Most of the investment clubs setting up a Dao would choose shares This means: the people you choose to be part of the DAO will be the people deciding the DAO.

(Smart contracts are used to create automation of processes on the blockchain. This means, they are the way to use the blockchain and its benefits. Basically a smart contract enables the building of apps on the blockchain. Ethereum were the first ones to come up with smart contracts. You can create automated transactions or else/if functions. This is used for insurance for example: Ryskex, a blockchain backed insurance company. More expensive. But 100% safe. A code takes care that in the case something happens - something else that was pre coded will happen. This is what a smart contract is.)

2. Once you set up the rules of the DAO, you will need to enable the people to vote. Whatever it is you decided on to use the DAO for, that is where you need to start getting the people involved. The developers of the First DAO believed they could eliminate human error or manipulation of investor funds by ensuring that the decision making is completely decentralized. And even though this is true, it is only decentralized to the point where people who are part of the decision chain can vote. So how does a vote work?

Yes Ser

Benefits of DAOs

Despite potential security concerns, DAOs offer a number of benefits to consumers and users, including:

* Transparency. Users on a DAO can clearly see the code that governs the network as well as any transactions that take place on the blockchain. This provides users with a high level of transparency when compared to a centralized network.
* More efficient organization. Instead of using a central trusted third party to execute operations on the network, DAOs use predefined code and conditions to automatically carry out these contracts. This eliminates many of the costs and security risks that come with relying on a third party.
* An autonomous structure. DAOs offer investors a unique opportunity to submit proposals and ideas for [improving the organization](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/21/02/ac19557809/dao-maker-reinventing-community-through-innovation). Thanks to the autonomous structure of the DAO, any investor can submit a proposal, regardless of their stake in the network. Submitting proposals also costs money, which improves the quality of proposals submitted by ensuring that users making the submission have a stake in their submission.

Of course there also risks to the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

The DAO exposed many risks associated with the structure of these organizations. Some of the largest risks include:

* Security risks. A DAO’s code is clearly visible and difficult to edit once the system is in operation. This makes it easier for hackers to exploit bugs and loopholes in the code, which was one of the factors that contributed to The DAO’s massive hack in 2016.
* Lack of governmental precedence. As a developing technology, there is no government precedence concerning DAO operation, and the legal status of this type of tech is still unclear. This presents future risks to developers hoping to implement a DAO.

Dao´s are a new way of operating and will create great opportunities for companies restructuring/digitalizing in this new Era. What are your thoughts on Dao´s?

Only people who will not trust the idea of sharing decision making will not profit from DAO´s.  
Our organization called Degen-House is looking to restructure as a Dao. Join our Discord if you want to meet researchooooooors and get some info on the Defi-world and DAO´s of course. We are a research center, so only join if you will contribute information and want to grow with us.

I am currently discovering and actually using DeFi (really happy about it). I HODL'd throughout the beginning of the year, mainly BTC and ETH.  


But I am now lending out stablecoins (USDT, USDC, and would love to lend out DAI but need to figure out MakerDao for that), some ETH tokens on AAVE (Matic network). Of course, I see WBTC on Balancer and Yearn with appealing APY/APRs and then I wonder: ""What are the pros and cons of wrapping my BTC and lending that out?"" and after that the question: ""How would I wrap it best and easiest?""  


These are the questions I have and I am hoping Reddit brings users with experience in this matter instead of articles to help me out here.   


Kind regards,

Herb"

10 Cryptocurrencies Expected to have Top Market Capitalizations in 2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoneyNews/comments/r4wsk8/10_cryptocurrencies_expected_to_have_top_market/,hamzartail123,1,2021-11-29 22:17:39,0,/r/CryptoMoneyNews/comments/r4wsk8/10_cryptocurrencies_expected_to_have_top_market/,NaN,"The market for digital currency (also known as cryptocurrency) is now growing at a rapid pace. When talking about Defi, it is altogether a different arena that has also witnessed huge growth and demand over the years. In early September 2021, Defi pulse reported about US$97.779 billion for its Defi protocols but at the time of writing Defi, protocols are locked in at US$88.4 billion. This article lists the 10 cryptocurrencies that are expected to have a top market capitalization in 2022.

1.Bitcoin

Created in 2009 by someone under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) has become a household name all over the world. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transaction distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Bitcoin promises lower fees than traditional payment methods and is operated by a decentralized system as it’s not backed by a government or any commodity.

2.Ethereum

Ethereum is currently in the second position after Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. ETH also has the great potential to outgrow Bitcoin in the coming years. It is also dominating all financial transactions and payments in all sectors. It is also expected to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022. Most of the investors are looking towards ETH for obtaining good results in the coming days. It is the best cryptocurrency known for empowering thousands of decentralized applications to ensure there is a fairer financial system.

3.Cardano

Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. Some of the investors predict that Cardano has the potential to become the next Bitcoin that deals with smart contracts. It is less harmful to the environment than bitcoin and Ethereum.  Many investors who choose to acquire Cardano in 2022 will do so in the belief that it would overtake Ethereum as the leading blockchain for defi and NFTss. This is one of the top cryptocurrencies expected to have a top market capitalization in 2022.

4.Solana

Solana is one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy to gain from the digital wallets of crypto investors. It is the best cryptocurrency that is known for its effective, censorship-resistant blockchain, and fast for global adoption. It is likely to witness a spike in the coming years. In 2021 Solana piqued the interest of investors. Its token increased by more than 300% in September alone propelling it to the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of just over 56 billion dollars. It is predicted that its price could rise to 46%.

5.BinanceCoin

Binance Coin is used worldwide for discounted trading fees and payments for various services making the transactions seamless. Cryptocurrency investors can likely obtain good benefits from this one of the cryptocurrencies to buy in 2022 that leads in the crypto market. Binance is the world’s number one cryptocurrency platform where Binance Coin is used to pay fees on this exchange platform.

6.Polkadot

Polkadot is commonly known as DOT which is a blockchain network of theParahchain variety. It has several connected blockchains within its functions allowing all to work together. Polkadot is very much similar to Ethereum in allowing the developers to create smart contracts and build apps. And so it becomes the other best cryptocurrency with a high market capitalization in 2022.

7.Aave

Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto. Aave was originally known as ETHLend when it launched in November 2017, but the rebranding toAave happened in September 2018. AAVE provides holders with discounted fees on the platform, and it also serves as a governance token giving owners a say in the future development of the protocol. This is another crypto coin expected to have a top market cap in 2022.

8.Dogecoin

As a meme coin, dogecoin stirred quite a fuss in the market in 2021. The image of the Shiba Inu dog as the DOGE avatar has attracted a lot of investors as it is quite adorable.
