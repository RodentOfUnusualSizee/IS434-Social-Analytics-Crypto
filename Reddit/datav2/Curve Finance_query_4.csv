the way university is designed is unacceptable and an embarrassment to education,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/mhemzl/the_way_university_is_designed_is_unacceptable/,SumsArentDumb,1,2021-04-01 04:13:25,1,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/mhemzl/the_way_university_is_designed_is_unacceptable/,NaN,"Firstly, I would like to emphasize that it is at least where I live and that this is biased on my university experience. I would also like to stress than I am emotionally fine and healthy, I just wanted to express an opinion of mine. 

I wouldn't say that I'm the perfect student by any stretch of the imagination, but how I have been treated and how poor my education experience was in university was a complete nightmare. Here I my list of complaints:

\-It is unreasonable for the standard of courses per semester to be 5 or 6 for full time. It should be 4. I recognize that not all programs and required courses are as demanding or as difficult as others, and you could compensate for difficulty, but the majority of the science-based courses are like crying children; where they constantly compete for your undivided attention. The only reason the course amount is this high is purely because of the university's greed--it is the maximum amount of courses a student can take and still be possible. They make more money at the expense of their students' well-being and future--disgusting. Most of the time, 5+ courses means giving a required amount of time more than a full time job if you also take into account the HW, studying, lectures, and so on. If the amount were to decrease: students are given more time to learn and intake it into their long-term memory , students are under a lot less stress and are able to have lives at one of the most important time of their life (something university says they promote), students would be able to reasonably get a part-time job and/or prepare or set up other opportunities outside their university lives that will affect their future, students are able to allocate as much time as they need into their courses, and there is less likelihood for courses to corner one into bad marks because of bad timing. 

\-It is unreasonable for university to require some programs to have so many electives. The majority, like 60-70% of the courses I have taken in university have been in the required elective slot. I understand the need for some elective slots, but it doesn't need to be this many. I have had the worst experiences with elective courses, many being harder and more demanding than my actually courses. Elective courses are just courses that are either required for some other program or are random first year courses not many people taking them cares about. I don't understand the argument that your university course should be well rounded and that is what electives give because university is meant to prepare you for the future and your career path even if is it less direct than college. Less required electives = less required courses = students can have a life or take more rounded life.  Instead of requiring us to take this amount of electives, slash that amount and offer the option to still take those elective courses for an additional amount. This makes the price of a university degree to be more affordable (a huge problem now) while offering the same opportunities as before. In the first place, they should even be this need to have students take everything under the sun. Everyone should go into university having a general idea of where they want to go otherwise it would be a waste of everyone's time, money, and effort. It should just be the required courses and some other interesting courses or additional optional courses of the field you plan to go into. 

\-If there is to be elective courses, make courses that people might be interested in but not want to go into professionally and don't just make another course that people will feel miserable about but have to take to fill their elective requirements. There should be more science based elective courses or niche sub-fields that people may fall in love with in many different fields. Make an elective courses about paying taxes and personal finance and many life skills outside of school. University should put more value into what they teach, and we shouldn't have to take these meaningless experiences. Remember we are paying for this, and you have to ask yourself: were these course worth THIS MUCH in the long run.

\-There should be a mark amount minimum for midterms. I have had midterms out of 15 marks worth 20%+ of my final grade. Despite being math professors, I would like to ask for them to actually do the math here. This is fundamentally unfair. The chances are either that you did really bad or really good, and the different between both are small by nature. Smart teachers use decimal values to get around this, but even so, you are basically just using a test out of a higher mark total anyway. Even tests out of 20 marks are unfair. The minimum mark total should be 2x the final grade weight. It doesn't help that many TAs and Professors have a \~/\~, 1/\~, 0/\~ mentality for each question out of \~ marks. This is particularly due to have many papers a TA has to mark and they don't have the time and energy to think thought how many points an answer should get. Here is also where the higher mark total helps out. A higher mark total for each question gives the TAs the ability to give marks freely when finding particular things and effort instead of purely judging based on overall correctness. That being said, some TAs can be way to harsh and still mark mostly for correctness :(

\-Sort of on line with the previous, but there should not be 50 minute tests worth large portions of one's final grade. Most, if not all, Professors don't know how to write a 50 minute test with so much content to cover and worth so much. I have had 10 page 50 minute tests, but even the 4 page ones just feel a little unreasonable. If you don't know the answer to a question, you are done, you have to move on or the time with eat you. The mentality of this test design is wrong; instead of trying to prove you learned, your are constantly trying to justify why you shouldn't be failed. Getting good marks on tests could be a matter of guessing which of the many approaches on first sight works. Essentially guess and check. Professors and TAs cannot fairly determine whether the answers can be reasonably done on time because they have years of experience over the students in the class in a particular subject and naturally faster. It doesn't help that, essentially in my math classes, many things in the class are proofs and are therefore not covered in review or in class. Sometimes, I have some content that I genuinely don't think was covered in class at all. If you thing this is exaggeration, just over 1 in every 3 math tests I have done (50 minutes cause of course it is) have been curved because everyone does badly. Since tests are worth stuff a large percentage, and they are by design unfair, I have no control over my final grade. This is WRONG. Of course, you should always be able to pass if you work hard enough or are gifted, by I would say that your final grade is 70% you (what you can control) and 30% luck (what you can't control). If a particular course doesn't have the booking power, or TA power, to have a test over 50 minutes, they shouldn't have tests at all. Having tests in class is laziness and perhaps a money saver for the university not to hire more TAs.

\-Science courses shouldn't have so much emphasize on tests. I have had tests worth 50%+ of my final grade. If the test is written badly, contains only one thing and its something you don't know, or you are having a bad day, they means you could fail and it not be fully your fault. This is not cool. Not test should be worth more than 40% of your final grade, and they should be content throughout the course to help you learn as well as to contribute to your final grade. Adding to what I said before, each course can guarantee that students have enough time to allocate to it if they reduce the course load. Not only would forcing additional mark-able stuff throughout a course help with a student's final grade, but also with their ability to learn the course content. Projects and Assignment shouldn't be seen as just a means to mark a student, but as way for the student to learn during its completion.

\-I feel university is approaching academic dishonesty in the wrong way. University has a cheating problem not because people are getting increasingly less honest or just because of increasingly accessible available online resources, but because their system is increasingly less fair and everyone is being pushing into it. I firmly don't believe that the university experience was as hard as it was for the professors and staff running the system than it is for us now. This is counter-intuitive because we have more resources than ever, and it should be easier since most people need a proper education than in the past to actually get a job.  While I do thing it is particularly because of the vast amount of people they need to 'filter out'  and new technology and concepts that need to be learned now, and actually thing they have made university just 'harder' over the years. I feel students are being overwhelmed and pressured by university, as well as by society, more then ever before. Many students are taught to cheat otherwise they will be crushed. This is a further problem to people that don't cheat (like myself), and they will be sent further to the bottom of the curve and would then also be pressured to cheat as  well. People don't cheat, mostly, because it is easy to, but because it is becoming increasingly difficult not to. Again, a way to help solve this problem is by reducing the work load by reducing the course load.

\-The way tests are approached is also a bit wrong. Why are open book tests so strange? My testing experience as been so much better during (2020-2021) because of this policy. I remember tests where I would forgot a single formula out of a page of 50, and that one formula was the only mainly tested one (no kidding). I feel like in the real world, in a career, if you need to know a formula, repeated application of it will help you memorize it. Even if you do forget, you can freely search it up at any time. What are these memorization tests teaching you? You shouldn't assess resources in the real world? You should just feel bad about yourself for not knowing something? If it's concepts you want me to remember, just test me on that concept. Testing one on a concept has then think and apply that concept, and that isn't even something you probably have on the formula sheet. Seriously, is there one reason why this blind test design makes more sense than one about application and understanding? 

\-I also believe, if there is a test to be had, there should be a requirement to have known: the content covered on the test (what chapters in a text book or what particular subjects/theorem/whatever), the structure of the test, and various practice questions list to prepare for the test. Bonus points to an actual example test. In fact, now here is a big one for me, include the solutions for said practice problems/practice test.  It doesn't need to be the same questions. In fact, give detailed answers to practice problems in general. I HATE textbooks that don't even have a solution to anything. I even saw one that said something like: ""It wouldn't be in the spirit of learning"". REALLY? How am I suppose to know whether I did the question correctly? How am I suppose to know whether I have learned the content? Learning is not simply to know automatically the solution. Most importantly, if I don't know how to get the answer at all, how am I supposed begin to understand how to approach such questions? Sometimes the best way for one to truly begin to learn something is by working through an example themselves, more than one of them, and this can begin by observing multiple solutions to specific examples to understand the general. Pattern recognition is one of our greatest strengths to learn, one could say its in the very 'spirit of learning'. Seeing the solution, we can work through the question the best we can, and whenever we get stuck we can look there. If it is something we don't understand, we can then do additional research where we need it. Seeing a solution can help us see where we need additional work in order to fully understand what was done there. 

\-if there is to be practice problems for tests, they should be as hard or harder than the test questions. Please don't give people this false security that they know enough only to punch them in the face. How are they supposed to fully study for the test if they are put to believe that they have a solid enough understanding of the material. This is cheap and unfair to the students, and the solution isn't just for them to 'study harder'. 

\-Lecture notes (or slides) should be required to be submitted online before the lecture time and date. This is so if a student missed a class, or have a hard time following the class, they can digest it at there own time. Some people even prefer to look at it on their computer or printed sheets to follow along with at class. This decision would also accommodate for multiple learning preferences.

\-If a lecturer is known to have illegible handwriting or a strong accent, they should present using a power point or something similar instead of a chalkboard. This shouldn't offend any professor, since this is not about them but about the students listening to them. I might even say that professors themselves should be able to speak clearly, but that might be going to far. 

I had a few more things to say, but this is REALLY long. I'm glad to have said all of this and I am not checking for grammar. Overall, for education we pay for, university is not that great. It may be worse than high-school in terms of quality of learning... and high-school is free. 5/10 wouldn't recommend."

As a thirty year old guy with some poor life choices behind me, I'm excited to move onwards and upwards but, where did I go wrong in the first place?

Finance was never drummed into me as a child, teenager or young adult. I don't know how it might work wherever in the world you are but for me, it's a noticeably underrepresented part of life when it comes to education. I would have benefited vastly from a financial and economic module or class whilst I went through high school. Still, it doesn't exist as part of the curriculum here in England and that is totally criminal.

Crypto, as you may have seen, has started to creep into daily life and is no longer something people think only happens in computers located in people's basements. It's in the media constantly and people are learning much more about it. High profile celebrities from all walks of life are involved and, as a result, younger ears are hearing more and more. 

Today at work, an 18 year old apprentice worker held a conversation with me about crypto, and how he was considering splitting his savings between his bank savings and some stable coins. It blew my mind in a good way. I look back at how I and so many other people in my age group treated their finances in our late teens and early twenties and I'm just so glad that crypto is helping teach younger people more about economics and finance.

I know a lot of people who have been in the crypto game a while hold reservations about younger audiences and the inexperienced but I welcome a younger generation who can build their lives on a foundation of knowledge that crypto is helping to form. Good for them!"

I'm currently a sophomore, attending what's apparently a 'target' school for larger firms. However, I seem to be overlooked/rejected from everywhere I apply to. The problem is that I didn't really know I wanted to go into finance until earlier this year, so I feel very behind on the curve compared to a lot of my classmates.

I don't have past experience interning anywhere (again, my fault but also I just wasn't sure what I really wanted to do), and currently due to covid and also my lack of experience I can't even break into the school clubs related to finance let alone get leadership in these positions. Am I fucked? And if not, what can I do to maximize my chances of getting something either this summer or next summer?

(Adding a few more of these for those that read DDs)

Most people that have been doing this for awhile know there are relationships between gold, silver, the 10 year, and the USD. Here, I’d like to show you some examples of these relationships and walk those a little newer through the nuances, and what conclusions the metals guys draw from these relationships. Interestingly enough – some of these are correlated, until they are not. Some of these are negatively correlated, until they are not. Let’s take a look at some examples of relationships and discuss.

**The big one – REAL rates and gold.** This is the grand daddy of all of the relationships you must understand. How this is supposed to work is that gold yields zero percent interest. If your 10 year rates are 3% and your inflation is 2%, this gives you (3-2) a REAL yield of 1%. If this is GREATER than 0, people will put their money into the 10 year. If your 10 year is 1.7%, like now, and inflation is 4.7%, that would give you a -3% REAL yield, and people would put their money into gold.

If you look at the REAL rates, in this chart, you see valleys that are a few months past gold’s peaks.

&amp;#x200B;

You see peaks in this in 2008, 2011, mid 2016, and 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/et38eurtq0r61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2d3e111ae34d3709f431fd6a92271267ce6991d

So one could make the argument that as real rates are declining, gold rises in anticipation of a valley. However, when trying to find good inflation data, or any charts that track REAL rates against gold – simple people like myself don’t have this tool.

What many do is sort of track the 10 year as a proxy for this whole thing. If you overlay the 10yr with gold, you can see an inverse relationship – MOST of the time, with the exception of the periods in blue below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nxqj84huq0r61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab0f4a4fb62ed2013d4eb552744bf85105419f44

&amp;#x200B;

Making a QUICK decision, just seeing the 10yr move can make the paper pushers come in and out of gold. The big assumption here though is that inflation is a stagnant and permanent 2% or the like. Meaning, the ONLY variable moving in the REAL yield is the 10yr. The main problem with this is that there are two prices then – the paper price on the COMEX and then the REAL physical price of bullion people take possession of.

This then gets a little more screwy. Within the REAL physical price, I would thus contend there exists two more prices. The dealer prices and the consumer prices. That is, the price at which a dealer sells is different than a price at which a consumer sells. Why?

If you are a COMMODITY like silver, and you are being paid the price of your commodity, you make millions of ounces and sell it at the price the banks tell you. They finance you, to an extent, so if you rock the apple cart, they can make life very unpleasant for you. So you sell your product at the price they hold you hostage at, and this goes to refiners, who then have it go to the bullion banks and mints in large bars, or dealers in smaller bars, coins, rounds, etc. The DEALER price, in times of high demand – can go up with a higher premium. This separates it from the paper price. But we have one layer further, which is perhaps the fear element. This is the consumer price which is now far higher than the dealer price. As long as dealers are able to get supply from mines at “spot”, this system of three prices will work – for now.

· Spot price – derived from paper products and may trade rapidly with high frequency trading. Physical possession of metals within this exchange is very limited – and of which perhaps less than 1% of all silver “sold” actually changes possession. This is a “derivative” price. I’d also contend this is where the “commodity” price of silver is.

· Dealer price – based off of spot price, plus dealer premiums. A mine gets its price, the refiner gets its cut, and with various mark ups and profits, dealers then have premiums passed on to the customer. In times of tight supply, this drives premium prices up, not necessarily spot price.

· Consumer price – this is the price the consumer would let the silver go at. What Miles Franklin and many other dealers are reporting are that sales are great, but their inventories are not coming from consumers selling back. This price, I’d contend, is where the free discovery of the “monetary value” of silver is. Maybe a person buys silver at $32 per ounce with the dealer premium, but they aren’t willing to sell until $40. I’d say the greater the fear of what the next year may hold, the greater that dollar amount is to the holder. If they fear currency collapse inside of 3 months, that price of silver, for them, might be $300 per ounce. They could take that fiat and pay off their house and have no debt. If you cannot pay that ransom, they aren’t selling. This price is variable, and the more fear, the higher this price is – meaning dealers will not get inventory back from consumers in a high fear situation.

So if we know gold and the 10yr can be negatively correlated, a lot – and gold perhaps leads the negative REAL rates, how does silver play into this? If you simply add silver to the chart, take a look at the close correlation to gold. You can thus also see silver moves mostly inverse to the 10yr.

&amp;#x200B;

So does this mean if interest rates go up, that gold and silver will go down?

No.

Take a look at the interest rates from 1971 to 1983.

So if we have gold in that same time period, AND if it was inverse, we’d expect it to decline with a sharp valley at the end?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ksc9rh7yq0r61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beed8f1a82b234451e118df331ff09a539dd7e65

If you can see – gold went up WITH the 10yr for a decade, until such a point that the 10yr was raised up enough to overtake inflation. At which time, perhaps the 10yr was 15% and the rate of inflation was 10%. This meant that a real yield of 5% was better than gold at 0%. When the 10yr finally gets to a point, gold then collapses.

***Edit*** – *thanks to a commenter to point me at QUANDL for tradingview charts. Take a look at the 10 year and gold going back 13 years. If there ever was a doubt of the drive of gold, please…take a look at this. This is about as inverse as you get.*

&amp;#x200B;

By extension, if you think gold and silver are then correlated, then silver and the real yield must be correlated. Add silver to this…

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wuvx4e70r0r61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc6f35f8c665d0153680cfc3367072bb9ceb55b

Now, let’s take a look at inflation rates in the 1970s.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o3mjrfu0r0r61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70931d630a175c0534f865837279f6dad2f404a8

So – everyone right now saying the 10yr is going up, is not good for gold and silver is missing one giant piece of the puzzle. The other part of the REAL RATE which is inflation.

Currently, the government would love to tell you inflation is at 1.7%. This is called the CPI rate, and this has been messed with so many times over the years. We are now told the government is “looking” for inflation, and trying to make up for “inflation deficits”.

The problem with that is many estimate inflation is actually much higher. The 10yr is going up because….people know this and are seeing inflation. They realize that if inflation is 2.5% and the 10yr is 1%, it’s stupid to lose 1.5% of your money every year. They sell and put into gold, so to speak. As this 10yr rate increases, it is potentially showing LESS negative yield, at which the paper hands get out of gold and go back to the 10yr. I believe the Fed is calling this “transitory” due to their belief that this is all temporary supply chain issues due to COVID and prices will recede and normalize. They could be right.

BUT…remember, if inflation is continuing to rise, the 10yr is a trailing indicator. If there was no inflation, why would they need to continuously buy bonds, which depress the 10yr rate?

The CPI you see is a 12 month trailing indicator, and based off of measurements many don’t agree with. In the Fed’s defense, they want to show lower inflation. IF they can demonstrate lower inflation, and convince you of that magic trick, then rates don’t have to go up.

Day by day, less are getting fooled.

At [shadowstats.com](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts), they show a different picture of what inflation is.

If using the 1990 measurements, you are looking at perhaps 5% inflation today. If the 10yr is at 1.6, that’s a -3.4% real rate.

If using the 1980 measurements, you are perhaps 9% today. That’s a -7.4% real rate.

But what if the dollar goes way up or way down? It depends….sometimes there’s a correlation, sometimes not. I think when gold and silver are jewelry and industrial components, they can run in the same direction. However, when they are looked at as money, this is when you can have the divergence.

If you look at the massive performance of gold versus the dollar over the last 12 years, you don’t see a lot of correlation.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at the massive rise up in gold from 2009 to 2011, with the dollar going sideways.

On a short scale of the last year, let’s look over the last 2 years:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60pfrhzar0r61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd1143dba4545b7ef92310238f2c9eb6daad7b8

You see the dollar going sideways, and gold rising. Gold then did have a shift up when the DXY dropped in July 2020. But…you can see the dollar slid since then, and has slightly recovered – but you see gold on an 8 month slide, many times moving WITH the USD.

**Conclusions of these relationships**

· Gold and silver are highly correlated. They are money, and have been money for 5,000 years. The COMEX created in 1974 has suppressed these prices for many years as a commodity. Occasionally, their identity as money is revealed, and this price then is re-discovered.

· I don’t put a ton of stock in the relationship between the DXY and gold/silver. At times it is there, at times it is not. It is more important to look at REAL RATES. That being said, gold is the anti-currency I’ve heard. I wish I could give credit, maybe David Morgan? If you are having less faith in the dollar, you may move to gold. Or, perhaps a portion of your cash to hedge against the worst. If the value of your cash goes down, the value of your gold in USD goes up. If the value of your gold goes down, the value of your USD goes up. Maybe. Depends how the correlation looks, that day.

· The 10yr can be a short term proxy to ballpark if gold or silver should be going up or down **in times of stagnant inflation** – that is, inflation moving sideways. The only item that moves is the 10 year. Problem is, no one is trusting this is stagnant inflation.

· The 1970s showed that during times of extreme inflation, the 10yr moved WITH gold and silver. This is because the rates of inflation were higher than the 10yr.

· **Real yields are the ULTIMATE indicator of gold and silver prices**. When this price is not congruent with actual real rates, a price explosion is imminent as paper prices take months or years to catch up to the divergence.

· Consumers appear to be performing price discovery on “monetary” metals by FEELING inflation

· Consumer demand for silver has overtaken industrial demand in 2020 and looks to be much higher in 2021

· Paper price divergence from dealer price, which is diverging from consumer price. This three tier price system is about to break up, and hard. This will cause backwardation of epic proportions and create massive opportunities for arbitrage if paper price does not naturally correct, and soon

· Bond yields are being capped by the fed by buying $180b in bonds monthly. This is unofficial yield curve control, as the 10yr is not being allowed to catch up to inflation. **This has created NEGATIVE REAL RATES that the fed is trying to obscure.**

· Metals will continue to be transferred at discount rates until production of industry is disrupted or paper price makes significant gains. Obscure stockpiles all over the world have been drawn from (unallocated??), and it appears that reduction in derivatives such as unallocated going to cash may create another massive way of either physical buying or PSLV investment.

· Gold and silver prices most definitely can rise with rising 10yr rates. However, it appears at some point the 10yr rates may be capped while inflation runs relatively unchecked.

· $3T infrastructure package in play as well as more stimulus packages, perhaps “monthly”. This is not the sign of a healthy economy and this is becoming clear and apparent to even 5 year olds. DXY could go down with this, and this could then have gold go up.

· It appears that interest rates will never be allowed to rise, again, until a reset of debt occurs.

· The tools that stopped inflation in the 1980s can no longer be used, today, without default on debt. Potentially, this means inflation can be an escalating situation, and cannot be stopped. This is how a hyper-inflation mechanism is formed. Creating more debt to address debt.

· It is not a matter of *if*, but *when* metals start to melt up. I feel both gold and silver have had nice handles form and launch into orbit could be any hour of any day now.

· Metals will take the front page of every newspaper in the world. Panic buying not that long after. This is where an “elevated” inflation takes place, as people draw money from savings and out from under the bed to convert to real and tangible goods. Escalated amounts of dollars competing for limited supplies creates massive mark ups of goods.

· Currency collapse is not far after this. It is possible we can circle the drain for another 4 months or 10 years, it depends how insane this gets with money printing and at what point public perception changes.

**Conclusions for MY investment thesis** – not investment advice for you, by the way!

· The 10yr/inflation equation drives gold, which, in turn, heavily correlates with silver. The DXY sometimes moves with gold and silver, and sometimes doesn’t. Keep an eye on the 10yr, but keep it in context with the rates of inflation, don’t just treat it standalone. The importance of the 10yr moving up is:

o Signs of a raging economy on fire OR

o Signs of massive inflation where rate increases can slow the economy

· Big picture to keep in mind is that the only relationship with the DXY and gold that matters, to ME, is an indication of a failing currency will have citizens running to gold, silver, real estate, and any other hard assets. There may be times when this goes up and down – but this is a paper price relationship I’m observing. Meaning, the DXY can go from 92 to 95 in a day, and anyone who bought gold at home is not running to their coin shop to cash it in.

· There may be a time in the distant future where gold and silver are highly overvalued relative to other things. That day is most certainly not today, nor probably in the next few years.

One would then have to use critical thinking. If the economy was on fire and all was well, why would the fed then do QE and buy bonds? This is to create “full” employment as part of their mandate, so they say. They cannot seem to find inflation, yet the 10yr wants to continue higher. Commodities prices are surging, up 20-60% in a year. You can then observe more bonds being bought by the fed and rates going down.

This is telling me that inflation is most definitely higher than the 1.7% reported, and since artificial manipulation of the rates is at play, it’s telling me there is a significant negative rate already there.

With this, investors are continuing to pile into the physical bullion while the paper price has diverged from the “consumer” price. As this gap widens, either the paper price has to catch up or else massive backwardation happens and continuous opportunities for arbitrage exist.

All of this leads to me to believe we are looking at a decade like the 1970s where inflation is highly expected. We cannot stop inflation with rate increases, this time, however. In the 1970s, gold increased 24x and silver increased 29x. While most people aren’t very patient in waiting for things to develop, my investment thesis is to have my pieces set up on the board and let it develop. There are some opportunities here and there to try and time things with options, but overall, metals for me is the place to be in a high inflation environment."

I think we can all agree cryptocurrency is a pretty awesome concept, but most of the posts about price I see discuss charting, new crypto developments, the amazing use cases and so on. But I think there are some broader global trends we need to look at, the macroeconomic factors that drive the economies around us. I want to spark a discussion about what a recession will do to cryptocurrency.  
 

Skip to the second part if you do not need to hear the preamble.  
 

**Part 1**  
 

First off, let me explain my position so nobody gets it into their head I am a crypto hater. 

So I live between three countries at the moment and exchanging money is a huge hassle every time for a few key reasons.   
 

1. It takes time. Technologies like TransferWise ([Wise](https://wise.com/)) have sped up the process significantly, most of the time I can have money from Europe to Oceania in a matter of hours, instead of days, or even weeks with traditional transfers. Plus it can be done for a few bucks, it’s cheap. However, pretty damn annoying, when I add money to TransferWise, my bank(s) add a two-week money hold. So, if I send 1000 bucks today, they hold an additional 1000 bucks for two weeks. Understandably this is inconvenient as hell.

2. Costs, again exchanging money or sending abroad through banks is almost always a rip-off, they might offer cards which let you do it for “free” but their exchange rate is usually 3% off the real rate, so they are charging you there. 

3. Sending money to other people is painful if they are outside your country, or often even inside your country. The other week I loaned a friend some money for an apartment deposit, and we thought about sending it in crypto but usually EU banks are reasonably fast. Thought what the hell, fiat is fine. 8 business days later and the money has not cleared.

So, using a crypto like Stella, for example (I know there are others), makes it so fast and easy for people like me to shift money around as needed, send to other people etc. The delays come when exchanging to fiat as they have to go through the bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

The use case for cryptocurrency is there, decentralized, you can pay in some places, there are bitcoin ATMs around, whatever. Great. There are also a million other great uses for blockchain tech.  
 

Whether that is a reason it should increase in value, or not, that is not an argument I am getting in to. My point was just that I am pro cryptocurrency but later this year I will be looking at the global economy and perhaps planning an exit entirely for the time being.  
   
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 

 **Part 2**  
 

Now what I wanted to discuss was that we are not all here buying crypto because we believe it is useful, there are plenty of people holding for regular use no doubt. But most of us are buying crypto because we are investors, and we want to make some money from this awesome technology right.  
 

Previously in 2017 we saw a huge bull-run that came crashing spectacularly down, and it happened on its own. There was not some huge economic meltdown or global recession that spurred it. Crypto was in its own bubble. It still is somewhat today, but I think today, the difference is that we now have huge institutional interest in crypto currencies. Something like 40% of crypto is held by 1000 crypto wallets. With about 2300-2400 accounts which are whales. I read [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-whales-the-key-facts-figures-you-need-to-know-2021-1) a couple months ago so it could be more now, or less. But I would bet more given we had a dip in-between and another bull run. I would also bet that this 40% figure is probably not even representative of all the big crypto investors. I am sure with institutional money, they are dividing it up into many wallets to avoid the risk of the whole investment being stolen, or the codes lost, risk management right.  
 

Anyway, the point here is that institutions are following the global economic trends because they are affected by it big time. When there is a market snap, they are almost always the first to get out with their money, then the banks probably short everything, and make money on the way down. If the general market is going down, you can bet that they will be pulling their liquidity out from cryptocurrencies as fast as they can to cover anything they need to In the case of a market collapse. 

This, in my opinion, means that crypto is not in the same little safe (or dangerous) bubble which it was in before. It is getting tied closer to global economies and will be at risk in a crash.  [BTC and stocks are linked more closely than ever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-02/bitcoin-s-rising-correlation-with-stocks-debunks-haven-narrative) \- Bloomberg.

The alternative scenario is that crypto is seen as a store of value and investors will flock to it like gold in uncertainty, but I am not sold on this theory yet despite some big names like [Mark Cuban](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/mark-cuban-bitcoin-is-a-store-of-value-that-is-more-religion.html) saying as much. It is possible though.  
 

So moving forward to macroeconomic events that may be in the wind for us. Bull run probably is not over for now, and there is a ways to go, and a logarithmic growth curve of Bitcoin shows we are not at the same level of the run as we were in 2017. [Logarithmic Growth Chart (LookIntoBitcoin)](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-logarithmic-growth-curve/)

So forgetting the charts, for now, let us look at some of the most important macro events we have going on now affecting crypto.

1. A global pandemic, fear, anxiety, joblessness, etc., recession.

2. Mass stimulus by governments rights across the globe promoting spending - [Biden trillion dollar stimulus](https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/bidens-proposed-2-trillion-stimulus-will-spill-over-into-canada-but-it-could-also-hurt-our-competitiveness) (2021)

3. A huge chunk of the world, sitting at home, on their computers, with not a lot to  spend their money on - [UK Spending drop as new lockdowns hit (2021)](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-economy-idUSKBN2B1001)

4. Simpler than ever processes to set up wallets on exchanges etc. and adoption by big companies, which is driving media and interest into crypto. - [Paypal introduces crypto](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357246/paypal-buy-with-bitcoin-litecoin-ethereum-crypto-checkout) 

5. Typical investments like stocks getting absolutely wrecked by the pandemic, driving people to seek other returns. - [Investors seek sake haven from Covid-19](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/12/bitcoin-back-over-10000-dollars-amid-coronavirus-concerns) (2020)

6. Bond yields being low for a long time. - [Treasury yield lowest in 234 years (2020)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-year-treasury-yield-plunged-to-its-lowest-in-234-years-says-deutsche-bank-11596214464)

These large events, in my opinion, are part of the reason crypto is thriving at the moment, outside of the usual reasons people go into crypto. I mean what are you going to spend your money on when you cannot go out, cannot party, cannot travel. This is not the case everywhere, but it is/was in most of Europe, Asia and plenty of places in the US. 

Now, before corona hit many speculated, we were due for a global recession, the bond yield had inverted [Link (March 2019)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (so short-term bonds had more yield than long term, which makes little sense as generally the longer period of time = more risk) -  [Link](https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_bonds.moneymag/index9.htm). This inversion is seen as a major indicator for an impending recession - [Reuters on why inverted yields mean recession](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer-idUSKBN1ZR2EX). My old finance professor comes to mind. What happened? Corona hit, and we had a recession. With massive stimulus globally to try and keep the world turning. Now with vaccine penetrations growing, hopefully by the end of the year developed countries will have people getting out and about again.   
 

This poses a few possible outcomes and problems in my mind, with some that will directly, and indirectly affect cryptocurrencies. They are not mutually exclusive, nor are they collectively exhaustive, and the complexity of these interactions are   
 

1. Stimulus will end, those unemployed are now screwed in many countries. They simply will not have money to spend on crypto, or on other things to make the economy go around, so the institutions can post profits and afford to invest in crypto.  
 

2. Just because everyone is vaccinated, this does not mean the recovery is going to magically rebound. It will take a long time for people to find jobs again. Job hiring in itself is time consuming and not instant. Further, many jobs people had previously won’t even exist, or not for a time. Think about brick-and-mortar stores, many have switched to online purchasing and there is a good chance they will stick with it. All those retail workers, people in restaurants, etc., they might not find work in their career anymore, at least not immediately. Sure, now we will need more delivery drivers, people building websites, and people in other areas, but reskilling takes time, some people in those jobs previously do not own cars, have no tech experience, or are older and it is hard for them to get reskilled and hard to get hired again. Another issue is that many of the brick-and-mortar businesses simply do not exist anymore. Buying premises, getting business running again will take a really long time, especially after so many were so low on cash in the last 12 months, where does the investment come from?  
 

3. When people are vaccinated, they will be dealing with the above problems, but they will also be spending money out in the real world. I can imagine this summer if things are opened up (Northern hemisphere) will be a crazy time of partying, joy, and activity. Money may not be going into crypto, it may be going into the real world. 

4. If there is money going into the real world, we might see a boom in the traditional investment areas which were so unprofitable during the Covid-19 pandemic. This means that crypto is less attractive as an asset for institutions and individuals as there is money to be made elsewhere more safely and with less speculative volatility, real profits from well-known and established companies recovering big time post-pandemic.

5. Austerity measures globally to cut debts. There are plenty of conservative governments who will wish to implement austerity measures to bring down huge national debts following covid-19. Honestly, I am not sure what cause-effect relationships come from this. But if somebody wants to discuss it, go ahead.

 

So, to wrap this up. I pose you with the ideas posted and would like to see some discussion on what you think are the consequences of macroeconomic factors globally on crypto this year. Do you trust the charts to follow the pattern of the previous bull run?   
 What do you think could be a driver of growth or decline in crypto this year?  When do you feel the biggest change will come?

Let me just say preface this by saying that I ❤️ Ethereum. I have always been fascinated by its potential as to decentralized finance and smart contracts (and potentially revolutionary impact on our shitty financial system). It could do so much more than Bitcoin. By way of interesting side note, the original Bitcoin code included the capability for smart contracts but after a major exploit was found in that code that allowed the creation of tons of extra Bitcoin and required a hard fork to undo the damage, the smart contract code in Bitcoin was turned off. That decision to not permit smart contracts paved the way for Ethereum. But just as Ethereum rose in prominence to challenge Bitcoin, so have other smart contract platforms risen to try to challenge Ethereum. None are close to Ethereum in terms of actual useful projects up and running mainly because the vast majority of smart contract devs want to build on Ethereum. 

LAUNCH OF BINANCE SMART CHAIN

But Binance, a company headquartered ostensibly in Malta (although its founders are Chinese and it has undeniable ties to China) that runs a large very centralized cryptocurrency exchange, has launched its own decentralized* smart contract platform. (*Note: Binance Smart Chain or BSC bills itself as decentralized but given that Binance itself is very centralized and appears to be responsible for a lot of the development on BSC, it is not clear how truly decentralized Binance Smart Chain is.)

A NOTE ON DECENTRALIZATION

The use of the term decentralization in this context refers to the method of control of a smart contract platform. A centralized platform is controlled by a single entity or person (or group of related entities or group of persons) - for example, Binance's exchange is centralized. It is controlled by a small number of entities who are in turn controlled by a small number of individuals and investors. A decentralized platform, in contrast, is controlled by holders of its governance tokens, who are typically the users of the platform. Various proposals are put up for a vote and the tokenholders can vote on them. At a centralized platform like Binance or Coinbase, decisions are not made by users of the platform. Read more about [decentralization versus centralization](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/why-does-depositing-crypto-on-decentralized-finance-platform-xykdenp).

As I mentioned the vast majority of smart contract development is occurring on Ethereum, which has been around for over five years. But Binance has managed in a relatively short period of time to create a serviceable smart contract platform called Binance Smart Chain. When I first heard about BSC, I was quite skeptical. I didn't like the concept of a centralized entity like Binance basically masquerading as decentralized and winning over a large share of the market. (Similar concerns to some of my issues with [venture capital and DeFi](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/three-reasons-to-be-very-wary-of-venture-capital-in-defi-xwqozgk).) Because Binance itself is centralized and has a lot of money to throw around, it can move a lot faster to play catch up. In a pretty short amount of time BSC has lapped many smart contract competitors and has made significant strides in catching up to Ethereum.

I am not directly addressing whether Binance Smart Chain is truly decentralized because I honestly don't know. But use of BSC does benefit Binance itself (for one thing you need to use BNB, Binance's token, to pay fees on Binance Smart Chain) and it brings people into the Binance ecosystem, which again benefits the centralized (and, in my opinion, often predatory) Binance. In some ways, it does not matter whether BSC is decentralized or not if it brings significant benefit to an entity that we know is centralized. That's not even to mention the fact that many people have asserted that Binance is essentially a Chinese company, regardless of the fact that it is incorporated, and its headquarters are located, outside China. If this is true, then Binance, like other Chinese companies, may be expected to do the bidding of the Chinese government. That may be an ethical concern for some people. 

INITIAL EXPERIENCE AND OPINION ON BINANCE SMART CHAIN

In spite of my hesitation I was drawn into trying BSC by a few events. The first was the airdropping by Ellipsis Finance (BSC's clone of Curve) of EPS to holders of Curve's veCRV. I set up Binance Smart Chain on my Metamask wallet and seeded my wallet with some BNB (Binance's token, which you need to pay fees on BSC). Then I headed over to Ellipsis and claimed my EPS token based on having veCRV in my corresponding Ethereum wallet. They drop the EPS once a week so you have to repeatedly return to claim it (perhaps to create a habit?). And I can't lie - the process was very simple and, most notably, cheap, compared to Ethereum. 

Of course BSC can be cheap specifically because it has centralized elements. It doesn't have miners. Ethereum is taking steps to reduce its fees but with thousands of devs and miners it is not as simple a process as it is for Binance. That being said, aside from picking up my airdropped EPS, withdrawing it with a 50% penalty so that I can stake it to earn a lot more EPS (the tokenomics leave my head spinning), there is not too much else going on on Ellipsis at this point. There is, I think, one pool where you can swap BUSD (Binance's stabelcoin) for a few other stablecoins, and there is a place where you can buy EPS. Compare that to Curve which has around 30 different pools where you can swap a large variety of stablecoins as well as equivalent coins (e.g., renBTC for wBTC or stETH for ankrETH, etc), and Curve recently created crv.finance where DeFi protocols can create their own additional pools for swapping.

When compared to Curve, there is very little you can actually do on Ellipsis besides collect EPS and earn a metric ton more EPS plus a little BUSD if you lock it. The economic value you get at this stage mainly comes from other people deciding to withdraw their EPS at a penalty so that they too can lock it and make money from later withdrawers.

(Similar concerns to some of my issues with [venture capital and DeFi](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/three-reasons-to-be-very-wary-of-venture-capital-in-defi-xwqozgk).) Because Binance itself is centralized and has a lot of money to throw around, it can move a lot faster to play catch up. In a pretty short amount of time BSC has lapped many smart contract competitors and has made significant strides in catching up to Ethereum.

I am not directly addressing whether Binance Smart Chain is truly decentralized because I honestly don't know. But use of BSC does benefit Binance itself (for one thing you need to use BNB, Binance's token, to pay fees on Binance Smart Chain) and it brings people into the Binance ecosystem, which again benefits the centralized (and, in my opinion, often predatory) Binance. In some ways, it does not matter whether BSC is decentralized or not if it brings significant benefit to an entity that we know is centralized. That's not even to mention the fact that many people have asserted that Binance is essentially a Chinese company, regardless of the fact that it is incorporated, and its headquarters are located, outside China. If this is true, then Binance, like other Chinese companies, may be expected to do the bidding of the Chinese government. That may be an ethical concern for some people. 

INITIAL EXPERIENCE AND OPINION ON BINANCE SMART CHAIN

In spite of my hesitation I was drawn into trying BSC by a few events. The first was the airdropping by Ellipsis Finance (BSC's clone of Curve) of EPS to holders of Curve's veCRV. I set up Binance Smart Chain on my Metamask wallet and seeded my wallet with some BNB (Binance's token, which you need to pay fees on BSC). Then I headed over to Ellipsis and claimed my EPS token based on having veCRV in my corresponding Ethereum wallet. They drop the EPS once a week so you have to repeatedly return to claim it (perhaps to create a habit?). And I can't lie - the process was very simple and, most notably, cheap, compared to Ethereum. 

Of course BSC can be cheap specifically because it has centralized elements. It doesn't have miners. Ethereum is taking steps to reduce its fees but with thousands of devs and miners it is not as simple a process as it is for Binance. That being said, aside from picking up my airdropped EPS, withdrawing it with a 50% penalty so that I can stake it to earn a lot more EPS (the tokenomics leave my head spinning), there is not too much else going on on Ellipsis at this point. There is, I think, one pool where you can swap BUSD (Binance's stabelcoin) for a few other stablecoins, and there is a place where you can buy EPS. Compare that to Curve which has around 30 different pools where you can swap a large variety of stablecoins as well as equivalent coins (e.g., renBTC for wBTC or stETH for ankrETH, etc), and Curve recently created crv.finance where DeFi protocols can create their own additional pools for swapping.

When compared to Curve, there is very little you can actually do on Ellipsis besides collect EPS and earn a metric ton more EPS plus a little BUSD if you lock it. The economic value you get at this stage mainly comes from other people deciding to withdraw their EPS at a penalty so that they too can lock it and make money from later withdrawers.

Let me just say preface this by saying that I ❤️ Ethereum. I have always been fascinated by its potential as to decentralized finance and smart contracts (and potentially revolutionary impact on our shitty financial system). It could do so much more than Bitcoin. By way of interesting side note, the original Bitcoin code included the capability for smart contracts but after a major exploit was found in that code that allowed the creation of tons of extra Bitcoin and required a hard fork to undo the damage, the smart contract code in Bitcoin was turned off. That decision to not permit smart contracts paved the way for Ethereum. But just as Ethereum rose in prominence to challenge Bitcoin, so have other smart contract platforms risen to try to challenge Ethereum. None are close to Ethereum in terms of actual useful projects up and running mainly because the vast majority of smart contract devs want to build on Ethereum. 

LAUNCH OF BINANCE SMART CHAIN

But Binance, a company headquartered ostensibly in Malta (although its founders are Chinese and it has undeniable ties to China) that runs a large very centralized cryptocurrency exchange, has launched its own decentralized* smart contract platform. (*Note: Binance Smart Chain or BSC bills itself as decentralized but given that Binance itself is very centralized and appears to be responsible for a lot of the development on BSC, it is not clear how truly decentralized Binance Smart Chain is.)

A NOTE ON DECENTRALIZATION

The use of the term decentralization in this context refers to the method of control of a smart contract platform. A centralized platform is controlled by a single entity or person (or group of related entities or group of persons) - for example, Binance's exchange is centralized. It is controlled by a small number of entities who are in turn controlled by a small number of individuals and investors. A decentralized platform, in contrast, is controlled by holders of its governance tokens, who are typically the users of the platform. Various proposals are put up for a vote and the tokenholders can vote on them. At a centralized platform like Binance or Coinbase, decisions are not made by users of the platform. Read more about [decentralization versus centralization](https://www.publish0x.com/decentralizedfinance/why-does-depositing-crypto-on-decentralized-finance-platform-xykdenp).

As I mentioned the vast majority of smart contract development is occurring on Ethereum, which has been around for over five years. But Binance has managed in a relatively short period of time to create a serviceable smart contract platform called Binance Smart Chain. When I first heard about BSC, I was quite skeptical. I didn't like the concept of a centralized entity like Binance basically masquerading as decentralized and winning over a large share of the market.

At first it seems like it is a no brainer to send some sUSD into the pool in exchange for DAI or USDT. But you look at the assets within the Synthetix ecosystem and everything is trading at a premium. So there really is no arbitrage opportunity if you do not already have sUSD because you have to ""enter"" the network, and you are going to pay 1% more than is ""reasonable"" to obtain any Synthetix asset. And if the premium on sUSD becomes really enticing, like suppose $1.05, it seems like people will rush to buy a Synthetix asset they do not have and add it to the pool, increasing demand and price further."

My goal here is to provide **thinking tools to assess the DD**, mentally prepare ourselves for the MAOSS🚀, if so, and shield ourselves🦧 from all the FUD🐍. This is inspired by u/rensole’s 🦍 Accounting for Bias notice on 03-30. Now get your crayons out of your mouths and noses cause I’m about to sprinkle some wrinkles on you. 🧠

First of all, know that these are USEFUL tricks your mind plays on you to save time and resources in a given situation. Once acknowledged, it’s a trade-off that you may choose to refuse to make to have a slower but more accurate assessment. Second of all, not all of them are biases but all of them are relevant concepts.

**Dunning-Kruger Effect**

Inflating the assessment of your own skills and failing to recognize your own incompetence. This picture speaks for itself. Never forget there are things you know, there are things you know that you don’t know, and THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON’T KNOW THAT YOU DON’T KNOW!

**Availability heuristic**

The immediate examples/outcomes that come to your mind are deemed more likely. If I ask an ape what is the most common sport, they will answer HODLing, but little does he know, it is football/soccer. This is also exactly what the medias are using as FUD : by spamming medias article about GME losing value, they are making it more AVAILABLE to the mind of the common reader and creating an illusion of a higher probability.

**Confirmation bias**

[**https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation-bias.asp**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation-bias.asp)

You probably know that one. It’s when you seek information, facts and opinions, that confirm your preconceived ideas and reject and ignore the information that does not coincide with it. I’ll define it here as both **conscious** (actively looking for the information you need to quiet your doubts / find any reason to reject information to quiet your doubt) and **unconscious** (not questioning what you agree with / not considering and even forgetting what you don’t agree with)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Illusory correlation / false association**

Perceiving a relationship between two variables when there are none. This is magnified by salient events, aka events that tend to capture our attention by their novelty or rareness (or media attention).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Anchoring and adjustment**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring-and-adjustment.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring-and-adjustment.asp)

“Anchoring and adjustment is a cognitive heuristic where a person starts off with an initial idea and adjusts their beliefs based on this starting point.”

This is relevant in this context because we are scrambling for information in order to predict an unprecedented situation. Just think about the DD comparing the VW squeeze price (anchoring) with GME based on differences in short interest (adjustment) and trying to come up with a number.

Some numbers that were thrown had a psychological impact even if the DD was faulty (I’m thinking about that 131k projection back in February). Two month ago, 1000$ was the goal because 5$ was the anchor. Now, 483$ is the anchor, the projections are more anchors, and the adjusted goal is in the millions. Medias are spamming /will be spamming lower numbers to fight these anchors/adjustments.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Affective heuristic**

Making an assessment based on how we are emotionally feeling at the moment. “Don’t like it? Probably wrong, we’ll assess it from there.” (This is dangerous) Also the more important the decision, the more this particular one is important and pervasive. Research has shown that you cannot DECIDE to ignore the emotion since it backfires with an amplified effect. Just don’t trade when you are in a bad mood

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**In-Group Bias**

Favoring the view of an ape just because it’s an ape and not based on their argument. Also called Hive-Mind.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Value VS Utility**

This one isn’t a bias it’s more of a concept but it’s so relevant right now.

Would you prefer a lottery with 9/10 chance to win 100,000$ or 1/10 chance to win 1,000,000$ ? The answer should be the second option if you want more money, because statistically speaking it’s a better bet (do it 10x you have 1M vs do it 10 times you have 900k) **Now that’s not how your brain works**. Under normal circumstances, how much is a million dollars for you? How much is 100k? Chances are they are different but the average ape here will classify them both under the same category in their head that is labeled (“fuckton of tendies”). Ok maybe not, but only because I exaggerated the spread. **Let’s put it that way** : the more the amount (Value), the less relevant each dollar becomes because wtf are you use it for anyway? (Utility).

&amp;#x200B;

[Utility curve](https://preview.redd.it/wx9kr0ks98r61.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de352101833921997f346be5c787328ad2a0b29f)

**Perspective theory**

Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky worked on this theory from the viewpoint of behavioral finance from the 1980s and won a Nobel in 2002. They took the concept of utility developed by Bernouilli (18th Century mathematician/physician) and expanded it. I’ll talk about a few of their points here.

**First**, UTILITY DEPENDS ON YOUR CURRENT STATE. **How** much is 1m to you? A fuckton. How much is a million to Ken Griffin? It’s not even worth his golden NYC toilet. That’s exactly why money has more UTILITY in the hand of apes than in the hands of the 0.1%. That’s also why when you will see the unrealized gains in your account during the squeeze and wondering when to sell, you need to REASSESS FROM YOUR NEW STATUS OF RICH PERSON, because if THEY can be rich why the fuck not you? Think big.

**Second**, this applies to short-term thinking, not long-term thinking, which rely on two different neural networks. When you will see the unrealized gains and make an assessment for a decision, THINK OF THE BIG PICTURE! See the whodle process as an ongoing transition from your current status to a new type of life. See how you don’t care about the dips right now? That’s because you’re in a long-term thinking, keep that.

**Third and fourth**, YOU ARE MORE AVERSE TO LOSSES THAN YOU SEEK GAINS and YOU OVERESTIMATE LOWER PROBABILITIES AND UNDERESTIMATE HIGHER PROBABILITIES. Why the fuck do you think your mind is thinking about what could go wrong when that insurance seller is trying to sell you a home insurance or that banker trying to sell you a fixed rate mortgage? Why does it do that even if you know the likelihood is very small? And why do you think people are YOLOing thousands on GME 800 calls for the next day and buying lottery tickets? Assess your investment from a perspective

&amp;#x200B;

**Factor of persuasions / belief**

We will look at 2 elements that factor in to the making of beliefs : **quantity of information** and **attention**. Different combinaisons of these lead to different level of effectiveness in changing someone's belief, or your own.

Say somebody gives you **little information**, well it's hard to be convinced.

Say someone throws **a lot of information** in a post and you're **not attentive**, you don't care to read it but since they made efforts it gives you the impression that the message is important... This is you when you updoot a DD post without reading it. Be careful with DD when doom-scrolling.

Say someone throws **a lot of information** in a post and you just popped an adderral (**attentive)**! Well in that case, the DD better be good to convince you. If it is, it will, if not, it won't

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Please note that they are the main one that I can think about right now and this is in no way exhaustive and may not be academia-level accurate.

I’M CALLING APES on a discussion on **how they think these apply to GME** and **how we can learn from them** in order to solidify our thinking while avoiding the slippery slopes of irrational thinking

Now go and read / write DD! 💎✋🦧

I currently work in the IT space as a Robotic Process Automation developer. I use a piece of software that automates repetitive tasks. I am 25 years old, live in the UK, and currently earn £55,000. I have been thinking about a career and am thinking about the accounting route. I am considering the change for the reasons.  


* I have job/career anxiety. Within the IT industry, the pace of change is so rapid that I constantly feel that I am behind the curve, and I worry that the industry/software that I am using will soon be out of favor. I have also worked in some IT Teaching roles and the thing that stood out to me was the age of some of the students (30+). It feels like in the IT industry you are constantly having to learn new technologies and what you are working with today may well be redundant in 5/10 years. I would prefer a job where the core of it stays the same, so I am working towards a fixed target rather than a moving one. I feel like the core/fundamentals of accounting have been pretty much the same for a long time. If I do a quick job search for the software I use in my current role I get returned 65 jobs. If I type in accountant, however, I get 14,000 results.
* Whilst studying A-levels and Physics at university I always enjoyed the Mathematical and statistical side of things.

I understand that I would have to take a pay cut as I would effectively be starting from the bottom, however, this is not a major concern for me. I would rather £40k a year with a guaranteed job than 60k and having constant anxiety about job security, in my future career

**I have the following questions which I would be keen to get your opinions on;**

Q1) I have read a few articles which paint a gloomy picture for accounting due to automation, Cloud accounting software, AI, etc. What are your opinions on this? (In my current role I am automating quite a few Accounting and Finance processes, although these are mainly lower-level activities (data entry, AP processing, reconciliations))

Q2) Is 25 too late to start studying to be an accountant? and what the best path forward for me, whilst I am still working in IT. It looks as though AAT would be a good starting point?

Q3) Would you recommend a career in accountancy in 2021?"

The meme coins that have already been pumped and dumped are being blindly shilled so you can catch a falling knife.

This doesn’t have to be the case. What if this week's moonshot was a token with an established customer base, a steadily growing market cap, and already in use? I’m here to push forward STPT, the Standard Tokenization Protocol token, as this week’s buy. 

Many of you have been burned the last couple of weeks by buying some of the tokens winning or placing high in these polls. STPT has also made the top 10 two weeks in a row and guess what? We are riding a steady wave upwards, supported by strong, useful, and already-adopted use cases. 

STPT market cap: US$121,536,962\* (29.35% increase from this time last week!)

24h volume: US$41,174,933\*

Current price: US$0.10450 (18.60% increase from this time last week!)\*\*

STPT’s market cap and price are steadily increasing towards the breakout point. TA indicates that once an hourly candle closes above $0.133 it’s GAME OVER and your chance to get in before it goes parabolic is gone.

Now, about those use cases. STP has been rolling out exciting, new developments both inside the STP ecosystem and beyond, and they show no sign of slowing down. For example, in order to reach a larger audience and broaden its vertical markets, STP has entered into some promising partnerships:

* To expand into the fast-growing NFT sector, STP recently acquired part of Piction Network. Piction is a peer-to-peer digital assets platform directly connecting creators and users to eliminate the need for expensive intermediaries (middlemen sucking up value without adding any). STP will help with NFT integration into the Piction Network platform which will introduce a whole new market for its users and community. With Piction Network, STP is looking to pave the way for new business.
* By investing in Cobak, STP has entered into a strategic partnership with the popular cryptocurrency platform. With over 300,000 users, Cobak is the one of the largest blockchain communities in Korea. With this collaboration, STP network expands their presence on the Asian markets. In addition, STP network and Cobak, together with other industry-leading projects, have joined forces to form the Korean Polkadot Alliance (KPA) with the objective to facilitate and accelerate the development of the Polkadot ecosystem in Korea.
* STP also entered into a partnership with [Travala.com](https://Travala.com) allowing consumers to finance their holiday with STPT. [Travala.com](https://Travala.com), which recently joined forces with [Expedia.com](https://Expedia.com) and [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), is a leading blockchain-based travel agency. This partnership will allow exposure of STPT to a rapidly growing user base and add an exciting real-life use to STPT.
* The successful integration of its stablecoin, USTP, with the Curve Finance platform, a decentralized exchange running on Ethereum designed to easily swap different stablecoins with low fees and minimal slippage, provides a USTP/USDT liquidity pool. In the future STP network is planning more integrations with leading DeFi platforms to expand their presence in Decentralized Finance.

As you can see, STPT sets itself apart from the rest of the crowd. This promising project with low market cap, real-world applications, and recent, organic growth should be an obvious choice!

04/05/2021 Morning Forecast-Markets are implying a move of 1.12%+/-(up/down) on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have realized a move of 0.92%+/-(up/down). The difference between what market makers are implying and what has been realized has tightened. The spread widened to 317 (17.86-14.69) basis points. The put/call gamma imbalance has been reset but is likely to favor more call buying. However, a tightening spread decreases left-tail risk and reduces the potential for spikes in realized volatility. Realized volatility has decreased recently below 15. This is favorable for narrower and smaller moves up or down on the index. I expect a decreasing trend over the 2nd Quarter during April, May, and June. The current market environment is favorable for traders looking to sell convexity via short straddles, strangles, call overwriting, put writes, and other short vol strategies to capture alpha. The MOVE index hovers around 65 to 68 (or movement of 4 basis points daily in Treasury yields.)  However,  economic growth upgrades and rising inflation expectations are pushing up real yields, which is raising discount rates. The rise in yields could have a negative effect on long-duration assets, such as Technology Stocks and Longer-Term Bonds. The S&amp;P is expected to move close to 1.32% up/down this week, which means the S&amp;P could rise 14.5% or fall 11% above its 200 DAY Moving average (3,553.29.) The S&amp;P traded above its 50-day moving average (3,887.97) last week. Full Year S&amp;P Earnings are expected to total 175 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P at 22x's earnings, which equates to an earnings yield of 4.5% &amp; an inflation-adjusted real earnings yield of 1.92% (using 5-year TIPs Break-evens for inflation 2.58.) Analysts are anticipating earnings in 2022 of 201 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P forward earnings for 2022 at 19.6x's or a Yield = 5.1% &amp; Inflation Adjusted 2.53%

 Forecasters are rushing to up-grade nominal and real growth expectations for the full year in 2021. The highest number of Private Forecasters and those from Federal Open Market Committee members are close to 7% on a Real basis. If this rate of growth is realized it would add 1.3 Trillion Dollars of Real Output to the US Economy ($18.78 Trillion = 20.00  Growth of 1,314 Billion.) The Corona Virus subtracted 3.5% of Real Economic Output from the US Economy in 2020. In 2021 the US Economy would need to grow at least 3.62% to break even on a Real basis (3.5% = 1/(1-0.035.) For the 1st quarter of 2021 current estimates of nominal growth are 300 Billion and a Real Economic output of 130 Billion. These forecasts have already been surpassed. The US is on pace to generate a little under 500 Billion Dollars of Nominal Economic Output in the 1st Quarter. At the current pace If it held through the full year,  would generate close to 3 Trillion Dollars of Economic Output. While this is exciting, I do not think this pace is sustainable or likely to culminate in those size gains. However, I do believe a nominal gain of 1.5 Trillion to 2.2 Trillion in Economic Nominal Output is possible in 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/fs78vzffbdr61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4525607ec32cfe5a05f7ce6cbefdc3907ffa7d15

Full Year Economic Output estimates have increased significantly following the passage of stimulus. The median forecast was anticipating close to 1.2 Trillion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 800 Billion Dollars in real economic output for 2021. The current pace of nominal growth as of this morning would generate a total of 2.9 Trillion Dollars for 2021; Personal Consumption of 2.03 Trillion Dollars, Gross private domestic investment of 519 Billion Dollars, Net exports of goods and services -89 Billion Dollars, Government consumption expenditures, and gross investment 523 Billion Dollars. A major acceleration in growth is positioning the US to capture more than 1/3 of Global Economic Output in 2021. Economists continue to place the highest expectation for growth in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. Investment Banking Professionals are forecasting nominal growth of 400 Billion and real output of 240 Billion for the 2nd Quarter. This is a substantial amount of spending on Goods &amp; Services, which may face downside risk if there are any delays in Covid vaccinations or roll-outs.  Under these assumptions, we would need 50 to 60 Billion dollars of spending on Personal Consumption Expenditures in April, May, and June. I think we could see nominal growth in the 2nd Quarter of 700B to 600B and Real Output is likely between 375B to 310B. For March there is a strong possibility the $1,400 stimulus checks increase consumption similar to economic data in January 2021, which recorded a 487 Billion Dollar nominal gain in Personal Consumption Expenditure. It is also equally likely to engender significantly higher personal savings rates. We may temporarily eclipse the 20% savings rate experienced early in 2020. The higher US savings rate is helping to fund larger dissavings in the Public Sector and reduces substantial reliance on foreigner's savings

https://preview.redd.it/n58iusynbdr61.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3558a1f0f47f690a85c07633ef85eed8a151b888

The March non-farm payroll report was extremely robust changing the recent overall trend, which had been tilted towards weaker payroll growth. Despite a strong report there still exist 10 million Americans Unemployed. A large cohort of more than 4 Million on longer-term unemployment and 20 million receiving some form of Unemployment assistance. A return to 164 Million US workers employed may be continually undermined by the 6.5 million Americans remaining out of the labor force, which indicates large and substantial slack in the labor market. Private Forecast is anticipating payroll growth between 270k and 500k per month, which equates to 3.2 Million &amp; 6.0 Million additions to full-year US payrolls. This key economic indicator is likely to pressure growth in the 1st half of 2021. The relatively slow growth of the US population along with a substantial rise in the number of workers Not in the Labor Force has shrunk the size of the currently available labor pool. In 2020, the US lost a total of  9.7 Million Jobs or a loss of 6%. To break even this year the US would need employment growth of 6.60%. Nominal wage gains topped 5% during the recession for Non-Supervisory workers. Although, ECI salary and wages rose 2.8% in 2020. The gain in productivity, employment compensation, and a large amount of slack in the labor market tilt towards a continuation of non-inflationary pressures as the US economy grows.

https://preview.redd.it/duo7rxfwbdr61.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfcf680ffe0c882a2025b7f60aa3e3cf31bf60e4

However, the recent agreement on 1.9 Trillion in deficit spending is a significant tailwind to nominal growth in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This should increase aggregate demand, which should foster higher employment gains, but this assumes that virus cases come down substantially by April/May/June and pandemic flare-ups lessen. This has led some market observers to anticipate economic overheating, which is favorable for upside risk in inflation. I believe these fears are statistically unfounded. However, I do not disagree with rising inflation as a potential risk in the short term. The recent increase in nominal Treasury yields and 5yr Break-Evens on TIPs (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) towards 2.58% is transitory and likely reflecting anticipated increases in energy prices and base effects. The Federal Reserve typically subtracts 40 basis points from the break-even inflation rates, which would mean inflation expectations are currently anchored around the 2% (inflation averaging metric.

https://preview.redd.it/lnpxko12cdr61.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdbed9c63e5babee7dcf1dea5eeafd41c2e085d6

Following the passage of stimulus larger fiscal dissavings increases capital inflows to finance VERY large TWIN DEFICITS, which should put upward pressure on the US Dollar &amp; downward pressure on Corporate &amp; Government Bond Yields. The current rise in yields and increase in growth expectations will likely favor a stronger US Dollar in the 1st half of 2021. This is also likely to put some additional pressure on higher real yields if growth and inflation increases are realized. Although, potentially weaker inflation data than consensus estimates should allow real yields to remain negative. Thus providing additional support to the Federal Reserves ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and an extremely accommodating stance. Dollar appreciation also dampens import/commodity-driven inflation and should lessen temporary transitory base effects. Inflationistah and inflation fear-mongers engaging in scare tactics are likely to be proven wrong. However, inflation base effects are expected to be short-term. There will be a transitory spike in headline inflation data from March/April/and May. The impact on Core PCE is expected to be limited. Market Expectations are split, but I expect the Federal Reserve will look through these spikes

https://preview.redd.it/f541z4s9cdr61.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cd59bc572fa724d05c31b810a3e29214b957339

Political risks have diminished in the 1st quarter due to reconciliation, but it has increased in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, which may pose risk to much-needed Investment spending (infrastructure, human capital, &amp; research development), so I view it in the medium term as tilted to the upside due to potential gridlock. However, there is the possibility for another round of reconciliation in the 2022 budget combined with the removal of the Filibuster Rules in the Senate. This could pave the way for easier passage of additional INVESTMENT lead spending, which is much needed to raise the US Long Term Potential Growth Rate. Although, due to political isolation this increases the potential for Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorism

 Vaccine distribution is priced into Q3 2021, but distribution obstacles have increased and efficacy for herd immunity will be closely watched. Redefining herd immunity may become the norm, so instead of a fully vaccinated population of 90%. We may accept a different goal post for ""full vaccination"" perhaps it drops between 70% to 75%(?) Details are currently unknown. The market is currently pricing in an additional 5.74% move +/- (up/down) by June 18th. The S&amp;P 500 could potentially trade as high as 4,235.20 and as low as 3,787.87 by June 18th. The VIX is expected to move 6.22%(points), the VIX is currently 17.86. The VIX price range is 18.97 to 16.81. The Skew Index is elevated, which indicates market participants are paying up for catastrophic protection (2 sigma event). Stocks continue to offer investors the highest real returns. The nominal yield on equities is 4.5%, while the nominal yield on 10yr Treasury is 1.63%. Real yields on all tenors of government bonds at the shorter end and belly of the curve are decisively negative, but real yields at longer tenors above 20 years have moved into positive territory. Real yields on US Equities remain strongly positive.\*\*Disclaimer with Realized Volatility above 12 there is a larger risk of systematic highly leveraged short vol strategies like Equity Vol Targeting, Trend Following, and Risk Parity positioned for a selloff and reduction in market exposure. The potential for a MUCH larger DELAYED sell off 4% to 5% has diminished. We are much more likely to see a fall in realized and implied volatility and a gradual melt-up in asset prices.  The Apr/May VIX contracts at 19 &amp; 21 are fairly priced. In fact, they may now be overpriced given the new economic outlook 

Passage of fiscal stimulus should juice the start of a new long-term economic cycle, which favors a continued fall in realized volatility. - I am temporarily moving against a large rise in implied or realized volatility, However, I have been wrong before, but sell-offs will give investors great opportunities to buy the dip. Traders should focus on cyclical sectors, which tend to outperform at the start of new economic cycles. For example being long Financial, Industrials, Metals, Mining, Oil/Gas, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology"

--------------------------

Hello, last week I posted a brief summary of why I and many others are very excited about Progressive Care Inc for 2021 and beyond, and invited potential investors to attend their Annual and Quarterly Financial results earning call. In this post I will summarise what we learnt in the earnings call and the strategic targets for 2021. You can view my post from last week [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/mgcd5a/progressive_care_rxmd_schedules_earnings_call_for/). You can view the financial results [here](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/RXMD/news/Progressive-Care-Announces-2020-Annual-and-Quarterly-Financial-and-Operational-Performance-Highlights?id=296280). You can listen to the earnings call [here](https://www.smallcapvoice.com/progressive-care-quarterly-investor-call-april-2021/).

**Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB: RXMD)**

Progressive Care Inc, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a Florida technology and health services organization that provides prescription pharmaceuticals, compounded medications, tele-pharmacy services, anti-retroviral medications, medication therapy management, the supply of prescription medications to long term care facilities, 340B services to charitable organizations, and health practice risk management.

**Financial highlights for Fiscal Year Ended Dec 31, 2020**

&amp;#x200B;

* Consolidated Revenue was $40.3 million, representing an increase of 22% compared to fiscal 2019.
* Prescriptions filled was approximately 530,000, representing an increase of 16% compared to fiscal 2019.
* 340B revenue was approximately $2.8 million, representing a sharp increase of over 300% compared to fiscal 2019.
* COVID testing revenue was approximately $600K, most of which was earned in Q4 2020.
* Realized positive EBITDA of $7K when compared to $479K negative EBITDA in 2019.
* Cash provided by operations was $1.1 million in 2020, compared to $600K cash used in 2019.
* Net Cash balances as of Dec 31, 2020 was $2.1 million vs $816K compared to 2019.  


As you can see - even during a pandemic when most businesses across America faced substantial pressures - Progressive Care Inc continued their astounding growth. Revenues increased across both subsidiaries (22%) and cash has nearly tripled. Very few micro-cap companies have balance sheets this strong. If you know of another cash flow positive penny stock with over $40m revenue trading at 1.5x their revenue... please do share!  


**2021 Strategic Goals**

* **Strive to achieve over $50 million in sales**

This looks to be a perfectly achievable goal. Here are their annual sales from 2015 to 2020. As you can see, their sales have been increasing at a very impressive rate since 2015. The company's stock price peaked in 2018 at $0.23 per share. That was at a time when the company reported $21m in sales. Progressive Care Inc achieved $40.6m in sales in 2020, yet as of this post the stock price has not caught up to reflect this - trading at just $0.13 per share (1.5x revenue) like I keep mentioning. This is why Progressive Care Inc is so substantially undervalued. Although not in the same sector as ALPP - the comparisons regarding the stock price lagging behind the company's balance sheet are fair and both are attributed only to a lack of volume trading the stock.  


&amp;#x200B;

|Financial Year|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual Sales|$14m|$18m|$20m|$21m|$33m|$40.6m|

&amp;#x200B;

This explosive growth was planned accordingly by the chairman, Alan Weisberg. This was no fluke, and therefore we have every reason to believe his next target of $100m in sales is perfectly achievable.  
""Several years ago, when our revenue was $15 million, we saw our path to $40 million in sales and described this to our shareholders. Now, we are running at over $40 million on the top line and see a path to $100 million and beyond as a basic extrapolation of our organic growth curve paired with our strategic agenda, which provides for an open run to serve all 50 states in prescriptions and data management. We have strong reason to believe we will have an exceptional executive team in place, with the experience, skills, and drive to foster that next step, very soon.” 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Expansion of COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Programs**

Don't be alarmed - COVID-19 testing makes up just a fraction of Progressive Care's business. This is an example of how the leadership reacted swiftly to new business opportunities and rapidly executed a business plan to capture a percentage of this new market for Progressive Care. The company begun offering testing for COVID-19 in Q4 2020. They only tested **5,000 people**, yet generated a whopping **$600,000** in sales from those 5,000 tests. The CEO commented how they're continuing to expand their market share in COVID-19 testing throughout Florida in 2021 for as long as the market exists.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Completion of Telehealth Integration and the rollout of the Eagle Force Digital Passport Program**

Progressive Care have been striving towards developing their own proprietary Telehealth software for a number of years. You can see a video of the software in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzlH1N12_Wo). Eagle Force LLC identified the potential of Progressive Care's Telehealth software and have partnered with Progressive Care to integrate it as part of the COVID-19 Digital Passport they have been developing. Again, much like with COVID-19 testing, this does not represent Progressive Care's core business. This is simply another avenue the company is exploring to drive new sources of revenue. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Nationwide launch of ClearMetrX 340B TPA Services.**

 ClearMetrX soft-launched in July 2020 and is a wholly-owned data management company with services designed to support health care organizations across the country. It uses AI to help physicians make informed decisions in the medication therapy management process. Through ClearMetrX, the company has increased its third party administrative and data management fees to over $700,000 in 2020. These fees have gross margins significantly greater than those generated from their pharmacy operations. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Secure additional not-for-profit healthcare contracts and long-term care facility relationships.**  


This is arguably the bread and butter of Progressive Care's business. They fulfil and deliver pharmaceutical prescriptions for organisations (and individuals) across the state of Florida. The company filled 530,000 prescriptions in 2021, an increase of 16% compared to 2019. The company opened a new 11,000 square feet facility in Miami and a 3,000 feet square feet facility in Orlando in late 2020/early 2021 to help accommodate the increase in prescription fulfilment demand the company is driving.  


* **Achieve full enterprise profitability and earnings growth.**

Achieving full enterprise profitability is incredibly difficult for any penny stock. They do not have access to low-interest credit and loans, hence most are forever stuck in pennystock hell where they must either dilute the stock or take on toxic debt to finance their growth. Progressive Care are now cash flow positive and therefore will not need to dilute their stock or take out any more toxic debt to fund their growth. This has been building for years, and many long term holders suspect they may have actually achieved profitability late into Q4 and are hoping to see this confirmed in the next earnings report.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Complete an uplist to a national exchange (NASDAQ)**

This is the big one. This is the strategic  goal that will rapidly accelerate the stock price. Progressive Care submitted a confidential S-1 form months ago and have been working with the SEC to dot the i's and cross the t's. They filed for the right to perform a reverse split at anytime before June to increase the share price if necessary prior to the uplist. Reverse splits have negative reputations on this subreddit. I can assure you that a company performing a reverse split in order to uplist to a national exchange is one of, if not the most exciting actions you could ever wish your penny stock could take. It is the ultimate sign that the company is ready to kick-on. Your shares do not lose any value - it solely tidies up the share structure. It is entirely possible a reverse-split may not be needed. I'm sure many here remember seeing ALPP's stock price increase after publicly announcing their NASDAQ application and therefore they cancelled their reverse split. Once Progressive Care completes it's uplist to the NASDAQ, it will provide them with access to a much larger, more diverse pool of prospective investors, including a much wider institutional investor audience.  The CEO discussed in the earnings call how the company is already in the process of identifying acquisitions, paid for through the institutional funding to help accelerate their nationwide expansion. This isn't a dream for the latter half of the decade. Progressive Care are ready to up list and begin their nationwide expansion in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential Limitations**

The one potential limitation I and other investors have identified with Progressive Care is the lack of volume trading the company's stock. This lack of volume is what is causing the stock price to lag behind the company's continuous revenue growth. This will likely be resolved as the NASDAQ uplist is imminent as is evidenced by the increase in volume we see occur every other time a OTC company completes its final stages of uplisting. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible the stock price catches up long before then as it has grown already from 5 cents to 12 cents in the past two months. Do not mistake this for a missed opportunity however. Even at 12 cents this company is, fundamentally, one of the most undervalued companies currently trading on an American exchange. As a comparison - GoodRX ($GDRX) and Progressive Care offer almost identical services, albeit GoodRX already operate nationwide. GoodRX currently trades at about 28x their annual revenue ($550m 2020 revenue vs $16.1b market cap). Progressive Care currently trades at 1.5x their annual revenue ($40.6m 2020 revenue vs $66m market cap).  


**Conclusion**

RXMD offers a very unique opportunity to OTC investors.  Where most stocks you see on this subreddit already trade at 10x, 20x, 50x and sometimes even 1,000x+ their revenue, RXMD has somehow remained under the radar - still trading at just 1.5x their revenue despite their rapid growth and unbelievable near and long term potential. The uplisting to the NASDAQ will help ensure their market cap catches up to their revenue and will enable the company to attract institutional funding to drive their expansion nationwide.

Their well-established foothold in Florida (logistics, warehousing and existing customer base) leads me to believe a bigger fish will pick them up sooner rather than later as they have everything already in place to dominate prescription delivery in Florida. We saw Amazon buy PillPack for $753,000,000 two years ago. However, if they are not acquired in the near future, I am so incredibly excited to witness their expansion into the rest of the United States.

Gilded Age Critiques,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_data_rights/comments/mlmf5z/gilded_age_critiques/,data_rights,1,2021-04-07 05:37:59,8,/r/u_data_rights/comments/mlmf5z/gilded_age_critiques/,NaN,"# No Laissez-Faire There

*Friends of the free market tend to see the Gilded Age, roughly 1870-1890, as the closest thing in history to a laissez-faire economy \[...\] I’d rather we didn’t mark on a curve. The period could be closest to laissez faire without being terribly close.  (In important respects, including the legal status of blacks, women, and others, the period compares rather poorly with our time.)*

*It would be surprising if the Gilded Age had been marked by genuinely free markets for the simple reason that it followed a major war. War, Randolph Bourne wrote, is the health of the State. He meant this in a spiritual sense. In war people who were previously busy with their own individual and community lives suddenly develop a new-found awe for the State and the nation it claims to embody. State-worship doesn’t go away with the war’s end. Rather a permanent change occurs in the people’s psyche. Robert Higgs’s analysis in Crisis and Leviathan adds a material dimension to Bourne’s theme. Not only does government gain new prestige in war, it also gains new powers, not all of which are relinquished when the war ends.*

*Thus we would expect that the economy following the American Civil War to be profoundly shaped by the war. (See the special* *Civil War issue* *of* *The Freeman*\*.) For one thing, individuals made fortunes through contracting for goods and services, and handling of government debt. Influential business figures cultivated close relationships with leading politicians and bureaucrats – if they didn’t have them already. Government needed to buy all sorts of things and to borrow money. Who was it going to call? War is lucrative even without letter-of-the-law corruption.\*

**Hamilton-Clay Program**

*The administration of Abraham Lincoln finally gave America* ***the Hamilton-Clay program: a national bank, railroad subsidies and land grants, high tariffs, excise taxes, and other interventions.*** *It was a rent-seeker’s delight. As Richard Kaufman wrote in* *The War Profiteers*\*, “\****The most important of the nineteenth-century American capitalists acquired their first great fortunes during the war. J.P. Morgan, Philip Armour, Clement Studebaker, John Wanamaker, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and the du Ponts had all been government contractors. Andrew Carnegie got rich speculating in bridge and rail construction while assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transport.”***

*This wouldn’t seem to present ideal conditions for the postwar emergence of a free market. Too many people had a taste of power, privilege, and fortune, not to mention the inside track with federal and state officials. They weren’t likely to volunteer to give up those benefits. The eradication of evil — chattel slavery —* ***came with a good deal of pro-business economic intervention (corporatism). The result was the forced, conscious creation of a*** ***national*** ***economy according to a politically worked-out blueprint rather than spontaneous market evolution.*** \*(\**Benjamin Tucker’s* *identification of four State sources of monopoly — patents, tariffs, money, and land — is relevant here.)*

*I leave aside here what we should call the existing nonfree-market economic system. (Regarding the name* *capitalism*\*, see\* *this*\*.)\*

*The Gilded Age of course has been criticized by enemies of the free market — corporatism and the free market have been sloppily and even intentionally* *conflated* *— but what’s often unappreciated is that writers* *sympathetic* *to the free market have disparaged the Gilded Age as broadly illiberal and contrary to the spirit of free enterprise. Where many libertarians see laissez faire, these writers saw corruption and privilege distorting commerce. I’ll cite two examples here: Arthur A. Ekirch Jr. and George C. Roche III.*

**Expansion and Consolidation**

*Ekirch (1915-2000) was a distinguished professional historian and academic whose book* *The Decline of American Liberalism* *should be read by every lover of freedom. (Liberal for Ekirch meant free markets, decentralized power, and individual liberty.) Since I’ve written about Ekirch previously (****here****, here, and* *here*\*), I won’t dwell on him except to note his observation that “Later, in the postwar period, it would be forgotten that many of the national problems associated with the rise of big business and monopoly had their origins in this earlier era of expansion and consolidation during the Civil War.” He quoted the 1876 liberal Democratic president candidate, Samuel Tilden, who said:\*

&gt;*The demoralization of war — a spirit of gambling adventure, engendered by false systems of public finance;* ***a grasping centralism, absorbing all functions from the local authorities, and assuming to control the industries of individuals by largesses to favored classes from the public treasury of moneys wrung from the body of the people by taxation — were then, as now, characteristics of the period***\*.… The classes who desire pecuniary profit from existing governmental abuses have become numerous and powerful beyond any example in our country…. For the first time in our national history such classes have become powerful enough to aspire to be in America the ruling classes, as they have been and are in the corrupt societies of the Old World.\*

*Just a bit more from Ekirch:*

&gt;*Beginning with the economic legislation of the war years, the Republican party gave the business interests of the North the protection and encouragement they desired….****Instead of the limited state desired by Jeffersonian believers in an agrarian society, the post-Civil War era was characterized by the passage of a stream of tariffs, taxes, and subsidies unprecedented in their volume and scope….Also vital to big business was patent law, with its provisions granting exclusive rights to an inventor for seventeen years; this enabled companies to buy up and hoard patents, using such control to maintain a monopoly.***

*Roche (1935-2006), who once worked at FEE, was the president of Hillsdale College for many years and the author of works that include* *Frederic* *Bastiat: A Man Alone*\*. In 1974 he published\* *The Bewildered Society*\*, which contains a scathing portrayal of the Gilded Age. Here are a few choice quotations:\*

&gt;***The businessmen of the nineteenth century*** ***are*** ***to be blamed for courting government to gain special privilege…. The late nineteenth century was an era conspicuously dominated by the assumption that government could be used to achieve various special interest projects, whether it was building a railroad or the development of an “infant industry.”…Corruption soon followed the new American acceptance of highly centralized political power as a problem-solving device.*** *The process quite clearly began with the American Civil War…. It is true that a time of tremendous building did occur in industry, communication, and transportation across our American continent following the Civil War.* ***But it is also true that the era brought with it the spoils men in politics and the exploiters in economic life who were quite willing to work hand in glove in taking the American people for a ride.*** *Boss Tweed and Jim Fisk \[pictured here\] were all too symbolic of their era….Never before in American life had the temptation for corruption been so great. Following the Civil War,* ***politicians found themselves dealing in land grants, tariffs, mail contracts, subsidies, mining claims, pensions. The power of taxation gave them power to protect or de\[s\]troy individual businesses***\*….\****The corporation is now and has always been derived entirely from power granted by the state, power directly dependent upon continued enforcement of laws providing it with its special privileges and immunity….The interpretation of American history which views the latest nineteenth-century businessman as a free enterpriser, while describing government activity as an attempt to restrain*** ***laissez-faire***\*\*\*, is simply not borne out by the facts.\*\*\*

*You get the idea. Similar views were expressed six decades earlier by laissez-faire advocate William Graham Sumner.*

*It would behoove libertarians not to view this period of corporatist privilege with nostalgia – doing so undermines the free-market cause. This doesn’t mean that government-business control over economic activity was total. There were spaces for genuine competitive market activity and entrepreneurship, which is why the period saw dramatic economic growth and rising living standards. It’s also why big business helped usher in the* *Progressive-era regulatory “reforms.”* *But that’s a topic for another day.*

INTRODUCING NEPRI TOKENOMIC MODEL NEP — THE ULTIMATE GOVERNANCE AND UTILITY TOKEN,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/mm522f/introducing_nepri_tokenomic_model_nep_the/,fabal93,1,2021-04-07 23:47:30,0,/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/mm522f/introducing_nepri_tokenomic_model_nep_the/,NaN,"# TOKEN USAGE‌

NEP Tokens will be a subsidy for liquidity providers on NEPRIV and will be awarded via liquidity mining.‌

The $NEP token will be the system’s governance token, empowering $NEP holders to vote on updates to the NEPRIV platform. Combining governance mechanisms and incentivizing holders, it will serve as a means to align the different stakeholders in the system. $NEP will also serve as a security and policy management medium. Decentralized, automated governance, that incentivizes participants and aims for security, sustainability, and participant welfare is key to a DeFi protocol’s success.‌

Those who hold $NEP can stake their tokens to become governors, allowing them to participate in the governance of the system. In order to achieve long-term value of $NEP, these governors will be motivated to seek stability through the growth and diversification of NEPRIM.‌

$NEP embeds the incentives required to govern a decentralized system.‌

NEP will lie at the heart of the NEPRIM Standard. It will be what drives token governance, incentivizes public rewards, and may ensure the integrity of the system in the event of permanent loss.‌

1. To coordinate decentralised governance.
2. To incentivise bootstrapping of niAsset liquidity, utility, and a decentralised community of Governors.
3. To act as the source of re-collateralisation.‌

Used to stake in the system, and as a governance token when the governance module is launched. As it conforms to the ERC-20 standard, the $NEP token will be tradeable on any exchange and storable on any wallet — allowing anyone in the world to access it.‌

Once fully built out, the proposal system will automatically govern the parameters of and execute actions in NEPRIM, encompassing the:‌

* addition/removal of niAssets;
* addition/removal of sbAssets and their max weights,
* addition/removal of underlying lending markets for sbAssets,
* redemption and minting fees;
* selection of oracles (if needed);
* upgradability of system modules, such as Re-collateralisation and Governance;

‌

## EARN‌

EARN on NEPRIM will consolidate all of our incentivised liquidity pools into one place, and lets anyone track their $NEP rewards in real-time.

‌

## All your NEP rewards in one place‌

EARN will be a dashboard through which our users can see all of their yield farming options on NEPRIM in one convenient place. It is the place where all of our Public NEP Rewards will be currently distributed, and will likely be where future initiatives and incentives will be made accessible.‌

For the beginning, EARN lists will incentivise liquidity pools from [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/), [Curve](https://www.curve.fi/), and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/). These pools will change in response to votes proposed to the community. Reward amounts can be changed, new pools included, and old pools excluded, on a weekly basis. This process will be automated, with governance directing where rewards are sent.‌

‌

## Earning NEP on NEPRIM‌

To earn NEP rewards, you must contribute liquidity pool tokens from the relevant pool to the NEPRIM EARN contracts. **Contributing to the underlying liquidity pools and not the EARN contracts will result in missed rewards,** so it’s important to check EARN to confirm that your liquidity contributions have been put to work.

‌

## Impermanent Loss‌

Finally, it is important to state that participation in these liquidity pools may expose users to **impermanent loss**. In particular, pools containing volatile tokens as one or both sides of the pool are very susceptible to impermanent loss as the price of the volatile token changes.

‌

# GOVERNANCE‌

NEP Governors will be responsible for the setting and maintenance of NEPRI system parameters.

# NEP as a governance token for nYUSD

**NEP** will be the governance token for the nYUSD protocol, giving holders the ability to vote for proposals that can define the future of nYUSD. Any value created from future fees that may be generated through nYUSD growth and usage will accrue to NEP holders.‌

Here are several ways that NEP holders will be able to participate in governance in nYUSD by creating proposals for:‌

* Adding/removing new types of yield-earning strategies
* Allocating capital across a basket of strategies
* Determining what fees are charged by the protocol
* Determining what incentives (e.g. NEP rewards for liquidity mining) are offered on an ongoing basis
* Allocating engineering and business efforts towards protocol improvements
* Forming new partnerships (e.g. integrations with traditional financial institutions years down the line)

‌

## Protocol fees‌

Today, our team is focused on building the best product possible: a safe and secure nYUSD that has a strong risk-adjusted return. We believe growth (measured in nYUSD circulating supply and users) is far more important than monetization at this stage.‌

In the short term, we are intentionally trying to minimize the fees required to interact with nYUSD, whether that’s during the mint/redeem processes or buy/sell processes on third-party exchanges.‌

With success in increasing the circulating supply and usage of nYUSD, there will naturally be opportunities to introduce lightweight and thoughtful monetization strategies that will benefit NEP holders.‌

In the future months and years, there are multiple ways that the protocol can create value for governance token holders:‌

* **Exit fees**
* **Performance fees (similar to Yearn and Set Protocol) after target APYs have been reached (e.g. 10% of profits above 10% APY)**
* **Gas subsidization fees (as popularized by Yearn)**
* **Trading fees (e.g. 0.05% of trades once NEPRI launches an automated market maker to support dozens or hundreds of nYUSD pairs)**

‌

Again, we want to stress that our core team does not necessarily believe that fees should be implemented right away even if we add variables to our smart contracts to potentially support these fees at a later date.‌

Fees will both be more palatable to users and lucrative to NEP holders when nYUSD has reached hundreds of thousands or millions of users and has crossed hundreds of millions or billions in circulating supply. Over time, we trust that the community will self-govern and decide what fees, if any, should be put in place. The fees generated by DeFi protocols can be breathtaking. On September 1st of last year, Uniswap trading fees exceeded the fees generated by the entire Bitcoin network, with the protocol collecting over $1 million dollar a day.‌

Once protocol fees are generated, there are multiple ways to transfer that value to governance token holders. For example, buybacks have been popular since Binance and other centralized exchanges launched buyback and burn models in 2017. Other protocols like Kyber simply send ETH usage fees directly to token holders’ wallets. There are also newer models like the [Buyback and Make](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead) model proposed by Placeholder VC that are untested but intriguing. After nYUSD is fully governed by the community, we will let governance token holders determine the long-term monetization strategy.

‌

## Incentivizing nYUSD growth with NEP‌

Above we outlined how nYUSD growth will benefit NEP holders. Of course, we also want to accelerate nYUSD growth with NEP rewards. Users that help grow the NEPRI FINANCE platform should be rewarded in a compelling way, earning more NEP as they create more value just like miners on Ethereum earn more ETH over time. In this way, the two tokens will work together in a virtuous cycle. nYUSD will deliver value to NEP holders while NEP will be used to intelligently boost nYUSD growth. It’s important to make sure that much more value is created for the entire system of token holders so that rewards are minimally dilutive compared to the overall network value.‌

In the last few months, we’ve seen many different variations of incentivized rewards in DeFi. These generally involve the emissions of bonus tokens for supplying liquidity to either lending/borrowing pools or trading pools. We’ve observed some incentive programs that have worked relatively well in creating sustained usage, such as Uniswap’s retroactive and ongoing LP rewards and YFI accruing substantial Yearn Vault fees. On the other hand, while Curve has built a product that is highly used, its overly aggressive emission schedule has caused poor CRV performance. The jury is still out on other projects like SushiSwap and Swerve that very quickly aggregated tons of liquidity by being extremely generous with initial emissions but then saw significant pullbacks once rewards schedules tapered. Unfortunately, we’ve also seen many fly-by-night projects, including some outright scams. These poorly designed protocols and rug pulls have hurt the overall DeFi movement in a nontrivial way.

‌

&gt;***At NEPRI FINANCE, we very much believe in aligning interests and incentivizing the community to focus on long-term behaviors. Before unveiling our inaugural nYUSD-focused incentive program soon, we wanted to outline some of the principles we are adhering to as we aim to bootstrap nYUSD’s growth.‌***

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, we want to ensure that we are rewarding activities that create long-term usage of the NEPRI FINANCE Platform and products (e.g. nYUSD, NEPRIV, NEPRIM, VRTB, ETO, RTL, and TFA). We are not interested in flash-in-the-pan rewards programs that result in temporary usage. Instead, we prefer sustained growth since we believe what we’re building with nYUSD, NEPRIV, NEPRIM, VRTB, ETO, RTL, and TFA will be many times more valuable a decade from now than they are today.‌

Secondly, we are taking extra time to ensure that we can create the right balance between releasing NEP from Reserves to fund growth and not flooding the market with too many tokens and irresponsibly increasing our circulating supply. However, releasing new tokens can actually be very additive if and only if these tokens fund growth that significantly increases the overall value of the NEPRI FINANCE.‌

In addition, to mitigate potential supply increases, our upcoming rewards programs will allow NEP holders to stake/lock-up their NEP for more incentives.‌

We want to structure our upcoming nYUSD-focused incentive program to take advantage of our community. We want many NEP holders to buy, hold, and use nYUSD while keeping their stake in NEP to create the virtuous flywheel between the two tokens. This will enable nYUSD to leverage the full strength of the NEPRI Community.

NEPRI TOKENOMIC MODEL - LOYALTY PERKS,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/mm53z8/nepri_tokenomic_model_loyalty_perks/,fabal93,1,2021-04-07 23:49:59,0,/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/mm53z8/nepri_tokenomic_model_loyalty_perks/,NaN,"# Holders of NEP tokens will benefit from loyalty benefits ranging from cashbacks on investments to priority in allocations.‌

Cashback Based on a user’s stake, they will receive a tiered cashback on the fee that is otherwise charged to the project. For example, suppose a person is staking 500,000 NEP tokens. He/she would qualify in tier 2 (T2) of the loyalty program, which gives 70% cashback on the platform fee.‌

Now suppose this person participates in a NEPRI Enterprise Token Offering or a Venture Risk Tokenized Bond with a $20,000 purchase, and the platform fee to the project (raising funds) is 7.5%. The person would not only purchase $20,000 of Enterprise Token but also receive a cashback in the height of 70% of the 7.5% fee. That’s 20,000 \* 70% \* 7.5%, which is $1050. The person gets $20,000 of the equity purchased, and an additional $600 in cashback as a loyalty bonus for staking. If the person is not staking and is just holding tokens, the loyalty reward is reduced by 80% on all tiers.

# NEPRI Collateral for Lending Pool Sponsorship

Venture Risk Tokenized Bonds and Risk Tokenized Loans rely on interest generation on stablecoins. While the interest can be generated on any trusted DeFi and CeFi platform, NEPRI will launch a lending platform to internalize as much of the lending market it builds, as possible. This allows for additional value adding token utilities for the NEP token. Industry-approved assets will be default listed on the lending platform due to their safety and based on their established market liquidity, i.e. wBTC and ETH.‌

Beyond the large-cap assets, NEP tokens will be used as collateral to sponsor lending pools of any token. Any token could be added to the lending market through its smart contract. However, for these non-default tokens to have a lending market, NEP tokens must be staked as collateral. They represent a form of protection in case the sponsored token faces an extreme price drop.‌

NEP tokens that are staked for governance and are receiving distribution rewards can also claim an additional source of revenue. This means stakers will earn governance rewards, and also be able to use their stake to create lending pools that generate additional rewards for them.‌

# Terms of Sponsorship‌

Pool sponsorship is time-locked. The minimum time range for sponsoring a pool is 30 days. Beyond that, sponsors can make a lending pool last up to 2 years. 30 days is the minimum time period to facilitate any meaningful lending market. At the same time, a 2-year limit is placed just to ensure no one mistakenly locks their tokens for an incredible long period, like 100 years. The duration at which the lending pool is sponsored is displayed to market participants. Any borrowed assets must be returned before the final date of pool sponsorship.‌

Any loans taken by depositors must also be returned before that closing of the pool. If assets are not returned within the time limit, the participants of the sponsored pool will have their assets liquidated.‌

# Borrow Limits

The amount of assets that depositors can borrow cannot be more than 35% of the dollar value of the NEP tokens used to sponsor the pool.‌

Example: If $100,000 worth of NEP tokens are used to sponsor a CRV (Curve) lending market, the maximum amount all CRV depositors can borrow is $35,000.‌

This means if someone deposited $10,000 worth of CRV in the pool, they will be able to borrow 3,500 worth of other assets (like USDT). However, if a person deposited $200,000 worth of CRV, they won’t be able to borrow more than $35,000 because that pool is sponsored with only $100,000 worth of NEP tokens. Total borrow limit for all depositors is only $35,000.‌

# Deposit Limits

Continuing the example above:‌

The maximum limit of deposits in any pool is 3.5 times the dollar value of the NEP tokens. This means if CRV deposits reach $400,000, deposits will become locked. This is in order to prevent situations in which $1,000 worth of NEP tokens sponsors a market in which $1,000,000 worth of CRV becomes deposited.‌

# Lenders’ Safety Assessment

Non-established tokens are too volatile due to low liquidity to provide safety for lenders. If CRV depositors borrow USDT, it is important that the USDT lenders are getting collateral worth more than the amount they have lent. To address this issue, only 35% of deposit amount can be borrowed. This means an instantaneous drop of more than 65% would be needed to put the USDT lenders at risk.‌

Even if CRV were to drop by 65% in a sudden collapse, USDT lenders won’t be at risk. Someone had to sponsor the CRV with 2.5x the size of the borrow limit of CRV depositors. This means even if CRV dropped by 100%, the money owed to USDT lenders is recovered by the pool sponsor. This ensures the system cannot be gamed. A person won’t be able to just mint tokens, manipulate their price, and then borrow USDT against useless tokens or coins. The pool’s borrowing capacity depends on the NEP tokens used to sponsor it.‌

# Payments to Sponsors

‌Non-default contracts sponsored in NEP tokens will receive payments from the borrowers. The sponsor would additionally receive payments from depositors in case they borrow other assets (like USDT). Continuing the example of $100,000 of NEP tokens deposited to sponsor a CRV (Curve) pool. The market’s sponsor would be paid from the people who deposit CRV to borrow USDT, and also from the borrowers of CRV from the depositors. When CRV depositors would use their collateral to borrow a maximum of $35,000 of another coin, they’d pay a premium on top of the base interest rate, with the premium paid to the sponsor. Meanwhile, people who join the market to borrow CRV will have to pay interest too. A portion of this interest will go to the sponsor.‌

# Platform and Ecosystem Safety Assessment‌

The NEP token derives its value from a wide array of revenue sources and ecosystem benefits, the lending pool and therefore it faces no existential crisis from the failure of any particular lending pool. Still, only a maximum of 20% of circulating NEP tokens could be applied to pool sponsorships. This figure may be changed in the future. The opportunity to use the NEP token as a lending market sponsor offers benefits to more than just NEP token stakers. Coins that join the ecosystem can use their native tokens as collateral for borrowing or to earn interest and can do so by buying NEP tokens in order to collateralize and sponsor their own cryptocurrency.

I switched college majors and I feel like I wasted two years of my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/mmk9vf/i_switched_college_majors_and_i_feel_like_i/,GGKnicks,1,2021-04-08 12:48:01,4,/r/offmychest/comments/mmk9vf/i_switched_college_majors_and_i_feel_like_i/,NaN,"I don’t know how to start this but here I go: 
I’m a second semester sophomore who just transferred and switched majors from CS to Finance.

Since I was a freshman in high school I knew that I wanted to study computer science in college however once I arrived at college, I found that I really had no interest in coding.

I never took a computer class in high school so I went into college with no programming experience and boy was I in for a culture shock. Even though I used computers in my everyday life and enjoyed spending nights just sitting at my desktop browsing for information; I found I wasn’t the best coder. I’d spend days on projects that took others a few hours and just felt lost in general. I ended up failing my intro to CS class because I wasn’t prepared for the workload of college. 

That summer I retook my intro class worked extremely hard and got a B. However the harder I worked the less interested I got into coding it actually made me quite depressed knowing that there were so many people much better at programming and could put minimal effort to get the best scores.

The next class I took was data structures. I worked hard and really struggled I ended up barely passing because of the class curve. This just kept giving more doubt into my mind that I wasn’t cut out for CS.

I’m now taking Computer Architecture and pretty sure I’m going to fail. The sad part is I don’t even care about CS or coding anymore, just thinking about spending the rest of my future struggling to code depresses me. I only do my hw for the grade and not to actually learn about the subject anymore.

I decided today that I should work in a field that interests me and get a degree in something that excites me. So I decided to transfer to business and study finance since I’ve had growing interest in investing and stocks since I graduated high school. I guess I’m writing this because I feel like I wasted two years working so hard towards a major that will never show up on my degree. I struggled so much and came so far just to drop out. I feel defeated and think that I’m being lazy for not working harder but I just don’t know I genuinely don’t enjoy coding anymore; I get so frustrated at every little mistake I make. The more I think about it the more I feel that I just wanted to code  to have a safe secure job no matter the cost to my mental health.

I haven’t told anyone this and I just wanted to let out my thoughts out somewhere before I told my parents and friends to see their opinion. I feel even just writing this a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. To whoever took the time to read this thank you and I wish you the best.

P.S sorry if this was hard to read or follow I just had to spew my thoughts out somewhere!"
Anyone Discouraged By the Job Search Process? Maybe This Can Help?,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/mmwro7/anyone_discouraged_by_the_job_search_process/,ThrowawayAccount5260,1,2021-04-09 01:25:24,0,/r/careerguidance/comments/mmwro7/anyone_discouraged_by_the_job_search_process/,Advice,"As a recent college grad 2 years ago with a mediocre GPA and virtually no resume/internship experience, I quickly found myself in the situation many do. I had a big student debt bill, no job to make income, and no networked connections to help ""get me in"" with a good job. 

So naturally I had to enter the traditional ""submit resumes and wait"" job search process. And it didn't really help me personally that I really had no clue what I wanted to do for a living. I graduated with an Econ degree, so I figured aiming towards something in finance would at least increase my chances for good paying roles.

One of the first things I learned was how important it was to match keywords to get through the tracking systems. There are plenty of software solutions/websites that can help with this. Many will let you input the job description with your resume and show you exactly where you should insert keywords. Some may think that's over doing it, but you have to realize this step of the job search process is solely about getting your resume through the robots and in front of human eyes. Even with solid keyword matching, there's still a good chance it won't be seen. That's why you have to just keep going and applying to jobs.

I started applying about 2 months before graduation and was surprised that I managed to land 2 in person interviews and 1 phone interview. To make a long story short, one in person interview and the phone interview went terribly. The phone interview was so bad the interviewer wrapped up the call in 5 minutes after starting off by saying the call would probably take around 30 minutes. So that was very discouraging. Then I managed to get a second interview with the other in person interview, and then they gave me an excel test and gave me directions for what they wanted but verbally told me to do something different the whole time. So this confusion made them think I didn't know excel and they ended the interview before my planned meeting with the HM.

So by the time graduation came, I was depressed. Many of my friends had landed great jobs or full rides to graduate school while I had no job, no real experience, and a shitty 2.5 gpa. So all I could really do was keep applying and think of ways to pad my slim resume. Thankfully I was able to live at home during this time which allowed me to take a very low paying cashier job at a local family owned business. I was paid under the table so it was less than minimum wage, but as this was a new business I gained a lot of experience working directly with the management of a startup business and became well versed in the operation of the business.

From there, as I have always had entrepreneurial ambitions, I realized there was a unique opportunity to run a small concession business essentially out of the small business I was working for. My boss was okay with the idea and appreciated the drive, so I was allowed to run my business while also working for my manager so I was essentially ""double-dipping"" my pay with 2 jobs in one.

During this whole time I continued applying to jobs online with keyword-tailored resumes and cover letters. In the 6 months after I graduated, I believe I only managed to land 2 phone interviews but starting getting noticed more once I was able to add in my new experience to my resume. This eventually led to a few more phone interviews and then finally an offer for an in person interview right at the 6 month mark. And while that would be a nice ending to the story, life doesn't work that way.

Of course I landed my first in person interview in months with a big commercial real estate firm and felt really good about my chances. Unfortunately for me, my car didn't feel as good about it as it broke down on the way to the interview. The folks at the company were pretty understanding, but they apparently interviewed someone else that day they decided to hire instead. So I felt defeated yet again.

It was at this point that I promised myself that if I landed another interview, I was going to do everything I could to sell myself to them. I wanted to show why I was right for the job over anyone else. It just so happened that a few days after my car breaking down that I received an email from an HR rep at a major defense contractor saying they saw my resume and asked if I was interested in applying for a financial analyst role. I would've never bothered applying on my own because this company is one where you always hear even the 4.0 gpa students have a hard time getting hired at.

With nothing to lose I gave it a shot and to my surprise, within about a week I was called to come in for an in person interview. So as I said, I prepped myself to sell myself to them as much as I could. Without giving too much away, this contractor deals a lot with the aviation industry and as a kid, I was enamored with airplanes and flying. I even took several flying lessons so I knew that could be to my advantage.

So the interview day came, and I stuck to my plan. I talked about my passion for the industry and my personal experience with it. I tried to sell them on the idea that my learning curve for the job would probably be much lower than someone else whose sole interest in the job was just the financial aspect. And in discussing the financial aspects, I again sold myself on my experience running my own business as well as working closely with the management of a startup business which really showed my understanding of business functions and finances. My low gpa never even came up in the conversation. Fast forward to a week later and I got my offer letter from them and accepted. I haven't had any regrets about it either.

For me, this was more than enough proof that one doesn't need to know someone to get into a good job or company, you don't necessarily have to have a 4.0 gpa, and you don't have to have the A-list internships flooding your resume either. You can have success the old fashioned way of just applying and waiting. Again, I had a 2.5 gpa and practically hated myself at graduation because I wasn't in my friends' shoes. Now I have an amazing job with experience that will let me go practically anywhere and all of my friends are now envious of me. I was even told I was the first person hired basically right out of college on our team in over 12 years as it's nearly impossible. And I laugh when I think of those asshats that denied me a job because of that excel test knowing that I got hired for a more advanced position that uses nothing but excel all day. And according to LinkedIn none of them are even at that company anymore after only a year when many of my co-workers have been around 10, 15, 20+ years because they love our company.

I'm not saying you have to start a business to land a job like I did, but if you're not having success you have to start looking at ways you can translate your passions into job experience. It could be as simple as having a few thousand instagram followers and selling yourself on marketing and branding. That's actual experience and is usually valued more than a student who just read about doing that in a book, but most people won't think to spin it that way because they've been told that resumes need to be driven by academics and ""traditional"" work experience which just isn't true. Your entire self is going to get hired for a job, so don't just focus on selling yourself on the portion of you related to academics. You can bring more than that to the table. You just have to get creative.

So I say all of this in this long post because I see so much about how you can't land a good job without knowing someone and all of that, and while that could maybe make the chances slimmer, you absolutely cannot write off applying to jobs you'd want because of that. I wish someone had said this to me back then. Again, I was told people like me shouldn't even bother applying to the job I have now. But you can't let other people stop you or discourage you. If you believe in your abilities and can truly sell yourself on them, you'd be surprised how much farther you can go than someone with a just a ""pretty"" resume and nothing to offer beyond being book smart. Just don't give up."

I seem to be missing something and it’s probably simple and thus I appreciate anyone’s illumination.  What I think I know (I hold XXX GME and have purchased various amounts for all members of my family and I can afford to lose what I’ve invested):
Dude by name of DFV knows how the system works (I’m on steep learning curve) and saw value in GS and scarfed up low cost options that will have to be exercised at some point.  I get that and it seems smart and fine.  He shouted out to the world what he thought was a good stonk and company that was being unfairly attacked.  That is legal best I can tell since people sell that kind of info- to say you like this and don’t like that. This also seems like win-win since wrinkly and smooth apes got on board and in essence stopped the bad people from hurting something of value. So far (I hope) so good. I learned about all this through my 15yro son and his crappy virtual biz class. What I don’t get and please try and be nice to me cuz I know I’m smart in some ways (genetics which I teach and practice) and incredibly stupid in others (e.g. finance) - and this is the 20 bananA question - won’t his exercise of options lead to his selling? And isn’t the word on this street to be strong and HODL.  Even writing this, I feel like I’m missing something obvious - but I don’t get it.  How is his exercising helpful to the average ape if he does the normal non-ape thing and collects on them?  Isn’t exercising an option to buy at low price only valuable if you then sell?

""Hale Carnegie!"" cried Jackson from inside the room. ""The man of the hour! The man of the year! Sit, sit, sit!""

The three brothers lounged at the far end of the table. They looked professional. They were clean and dressed in their tailored suits. Stacks of papers sat on the table before them. 

""Morning, Hale,"" said James.

""How you doing, Hale?"" asked Josh. 

""Morning,"" said Hale, nodding. ""I'm doing well, thanks.""

Jackson interlinked his fingers on top of the table and leaned forward.

""So why did you want to meet?"" asked Jackson. 

""Well, sir,"" said Hale. ""Sirs. I've been doing more research.""

""Oh have you?"" asked Jackson, sitting up a bit straighter. 

""Yes,"" said Hale. ""And I've come to the conclusion that one a week isn't enough.""

""Not enough?"" repeated Jackson.

""It's sub-optimal,"" said Hale. ""That's what I mean. One a week is peanuts. I really think we need more. If we could manage one a day. . .Think about it. Think of the precision we would have. The minutely controlled volatility. The subtle, anticipatory positions we could take, day by day. This firm would become one giant printer. There wouldn't be enough space in the building to stack all that cash. Even if we took it in hundreds! One a day. That's what I'm proposing. One a day.""

Jackson smiled at the young spitfire. He was coming along. He was just the kind of intelligent, hardworking, critical thinker they needed. And he had a lot of leadership potential. His confidence in front of the brothers was evidence of that. But he still had a lot to learn. He was a newbie to this game. An initiate. Not a master. An idealist, as the young so often are, whose ideals hadn't yet been tempered by reality. The brothers had introduced him to a whole new way of looking at finance, at banking, at investment, only a week ago; yet already he was trying to improve upon their tried and true methods. First he needed to understand why those methods were tried and true. 

""Hale Carnegie,"" said Jackson, smiling and shaking his head. ""You're a real wonderboy, you know that? You've got a good head on your shoulders, and you're ambitious. We like it. We love it. The three of us can't get enough of it. That's the truth. . .You accepted our offer. You went through with the initiation. And the very next day you came in, telling us about all the research you had done that very night. 'This is our guy,' we said to each other. 'This is definitely our guy. Doesn't take the promotion for granted. Doesn't rest on his laurels. Dives right into the thick of the work. We love to see it.' You went home, you did your research, and you asked to meet with us. And we listened to what you had to say. Children, you said. The hearts of children. Superior in every way. . .For as long as we had been in this game, we had only ever used juniours. Just as our mentors used juniours, and their mentors before them. Just as all the other major firms in town use juniours. But you made your case about children. About the power of their strong, lively and innocent hearts. And what did we do? The very next day, we sent some men out, and we snatched ourselves three kids off the street. We did that the very next day.""

""It's true,"" said Josh, nodding paternally. 

""We were impressed,"" said James. ""We liked the idea. You sold us with that speech. You more than sold us. You blew our socks off.""

""But this new idea?"" continued Jackson. ""One a day? A sacrifice a day? Think of the logistics, Hale. Think of the difficulty making that many people disappear. Think of the bodies. Our freezer is big, but it's not that big. And think of the police, the media. . .think of all the money that would need to throw around in order to keep the whole thing under wraps. Especially if we're using kids. Hell, the three we took the other day made the top of the news! There are reasons we stick to one a week. Same as all the other top firms.""

""But that's not true,"" said Hale. ""About the other top firms. I have a friend at KTC, one of the floor managers, who says they've ramped up to three-a-week since the first of last month.""

Jackson furrowed his brow. His brothers turned to him.

""That explains the hot streak,"" said Josh, raising his palm as if cupping the the explanation.

""Their numbers have been exceptional,"" said James, nodding. ""It makes sense, Jack.""

'And one a day,"" continued Hale, driving the point home. ""It's really not so crazy when you think about it. They say that one time, the Aztecs sacrificed 80,000 people in four days. That's twenty-thousand times as many.""

""The Aztecs?"" scoffed Jackson. ""Come on, Hale. We're not living in the ancient world.""

""But you're living with an ancient mindset,"" said Hale. ""You're living in the past. One a week. . .That might have been enough when you guys started out.""

""It got us to where we are today,"" said Jackson.

""Yeah,"" said Hale. ""It did. But if you want to stay competitive, if you want to keep growing, expanding, you have to willing to change with the times. You have to adopt new methods, new ideas and principles, to keep your place on top. If you don't. . .if you stay stuck in your old ways, doing things as you've always done them. . .you'll get left behind. You'll get left in the dust by the companies willing to take risks and embrace the new.""

James was nodding. 

""He's got a good point, Jackson,"" said Josh. ""It's why old farts like us need the young guns around. To help us see the changes in the world that we would otherwise ignore. . .It's always the youth who have their fingers on the pulse. It's always the youth who can see what's coming. . .Just my opinion.""

Jackson still seemed hesitant, unconvinced.

""Two juniours a week,"" continued Hale, ""is going to become the industry standard by the end of next quarter. Mark my words. Two juniours a week. That means you won't be able to keep running things as you have in the past. Either way. You'll need to boost your numbers just to stay afloat. . .But you have the opportunity to do more than just stay afloat. You have the opportunity to bury the competition. To stay ahead of the curve. Kids instead of juniours. One sacrifice per day.""

An alarm began sounding from the hall.

""Okay,"" said Jackson, raising his voice above the alarm. ""Okay. You've made your case. And you've given us something to think about. ---Frank! Check that alarm!--But we *do* have to think about it, Hale, before we commit to anything. It would be a major transition, and would require some major restructuring of our organization. . .And we haven't even tried icing a kid yet! We have no idea what the results will be. We only have your conviction, based on your research, that it will yield better returns.""

""It will,"" said Hale, standing up and walking over to the door. ""Compared to the sad, weak, prematurely-aged hearts of juniours? The difference in ROI will be night and day.""

""Be that as it may,"" said Jackson. ""FRANK! THAT DAMN ALARM!""

Hale closed the door, muffling the siren whine.

""Thank you,"" huffed Jackson. ""But. . .Where was I? Yes. Be that as it may, we still need to talk it over amongst ourselves. The one-a-day idea. Give us some time to mull it over. . .In the meantime, though, let's get the wheels moving on the child heart experiment. Let's see if it's all you've cracked it up to be. . .Hale, since it was your idea, we'll let you do the honours. Come back up here in. . .say. . .an hour. . .Does an hour work? Come back then, and you can feed our bronze god the first child heart he's ever tasted. Sound good? . .Good. And please, close the door on your way out. And if you see Frank, tell him to see what's going on with that damn alarm.""

\- - -

Frank had started as their odd jobs man. That was back when the brothers were just starting out. That was back when it was just him, the receptionist, and the three brothers, working out of an old house Jersey. Well, it came to pass that the brothers didn't know Frank was spending his nights in that old house, sneaking back in after everyone had gone home to sleep upstairs. So they didn't expect him to be there the first time they showed up, after midnight, to feed the beast. 

Frank was asleep upstairs when he heard some commotion on the main level, what sounded like a young woman screaming, pleading and what have you. That got Frank excited. Some young woman pleading for her life. So he threw on some trousers and tucked himself up in his waistband and lumbered down the stairs. She was all tied up and muffled now because of the gag in her mouth. Naked. Struggling against her bonds. A plastic sheet beneath her. What a sight to see. And Josh was sharpening the knife while James was lighting the fire and Jackson was preparing the altar with the small figurine of their Bull Man. It was the woman who saw Frank first and she was pleading at him with her eyes. But Jackson's a smart fellow and he noticed she wasn't struggling no more so he looked at her eyes and then looked where her eyes was pointed and then saw Frank, standing in the doorway, grinning ear to ear. And he sicced the two younger brothers on Frank and James held the knife to Frank's throat but Frank said,

""You play ball, boys. Don't bother me none. So long as you let me watch.""

And since then the brothers kept Frank around. He'd do odd jobs and they gave him a salary. And sometimes Jackson could be a real son of a bitch with the way he called Frank dog and hollered at him. But Frank wasn't gunna leave. Not when he could stick close to all them beating hearts and watch as Josh sawed them bodies on the stationary and feel the burst of energy every time they pierced a heart in the Bull's bronze bowl. But times like this, when his back was killing him dead and he was in the middle of mopping the joint but one of the heart alarms was ringing and Jackson was screaming bloody murder for him, well, that set him grumbling. So he dragged his mop after him toward the monitors to see what was acting up, and he squinted and slowly read the serial of the box a couple times, so he would know which heart was acting up. But the thing was flatlining. So Frank hurried into the room with the hearts and threw his mop to the ground and walked up to it, because it was clear which ticker had stopped ticking: sitting there completely still. The gremlin was crying, ""We saw the light kill the heart!"" but Frank paid him no mind and crouched to check the power source but it seemed to be getting power still. Then he backed up from the thing to take a broad view and tripped back over the mop where he hadn't left it. 

\- - -

They had been watching the faint white light, hovering around the box, when it reached inside for the heart. And then the heart stopped beating. Soon after that an alarm sounded in the hall.

""It killed it!"" said Charlie. ""It killed the heart!""

""Hush,"" said Clara. 

""He's right,"" said Rich. ""Whatever that thing is. It made the heart stop.""

The door burst open and the tall, stooped sillouette hurried through the bright doorframe, his keys jangling at his hip. Frank tossed his mop close to the cages and hurried over to the dying heart. He was in a panic, trying to figure out what was wrong with the pace-making equipment. Rich quietly grabbed the mop handle and passed it hand over hand, incrimentally, from one gap in the bars to the next, until his hand stuck through the gap nearest Frank, holding the mop. Then when Frank backed up, Rich planted the mop behind his feet, and the tall, stooped man tripped and tumbled backwards, whipping his skull against the ground when he landed. Rich grabbed the man's arm and dragged him to the cage and got him in a chokehold. He squeezed with all the strength he had left, having not eaten in nearly a week, but that strength was enough to send the kicking and squirming Frank under. Rich fumbled at the unconcious man's hip until he fingered the keyring. He pressed it open and removed it from the beltloop. Then he started trying the different keys in his lock, one after the other, until he found the one that fit.

""We told you he was a janitor!"" said Charlie, pointing at the mop. 

Rich opened the door to his cage and set to trying different keys in the lock of the children's cage. 

""What kind of janitor trips on his own mop?"" asked Rich. 

Finally a key slid in. Rich turned it until the bolt clicked. He swung open the door.

""Come on you three,"" he said. ""We've got to go.""

""I need my shoes,"" whined Charlie. 

""Put 'em on quick and let's go,"" said Rich. ""Fast and quiet. Okay?""

The had been in the dark so long that the hallway light was blinding. They truly couldn't see. Yet Rich remembered the direction from which he had been brought, so he led the children through the hall, however blindly. They were chained, hand in hand, Rich, then Clara, then Stanley, then Charlie, who had shoved his feet into his shoes haphazardly, so the laces dragged and the shoes themselves looked close to falling off his feet. The alarm signalling the dead heart was still sounding, but it was less grating the farther from the monitors they got. Rich could see now that they were clear of the bright white light, the open door of a room with a bed for surgeries, the closed door to the freezer, and ahead, the closed door of the conference room. Rich stopped and turned to the kids and put his finger to his lips, stressing the importance of silence. In the chain they crept past the conference room where the brothers were talking animatedly, and they crept out the hallway into the lobby, where Rich pushed the elevator button. It was at this moment he considered that just as one could not enter the elevator from below without digital confirmation from one of the brothers, perhaps, too, one could not enter it from above without confirmation either. Perhaps pushing the button had alerted them! Rich watched the hallway and listened for any sign the brothers were up and in pursuit. But all he heard was the alarm down the hall and then the hum of the elevator. They waited. The numbers climbed. Until they heard the faint clunk and the doors slid open and Rich gestured to the kids to get in. 

Charlie had been standing on his shoelace and when he stepped forward he tripped and lost his left shoe. He scrambled into the elevator and Rich clicked the button to take them down to the thirtieth floor. The doors did not budge. Charlie stared at his shoe, squirming. But it was Stanley who scampered out to grab it and once he was clear the door started sliding shut. Rich waved his hand between the closing doors but that wasn't stopping them from closing. Stanley was framed by the doors, the shoe dangling at his side, and then he was armless and then he was a thin line through the crack and then he was gone, left behind. Rich pressed the buttons to open the doors again but the elevator began its descent. 

""We left Stanley!"" cried Charlie. 

'We have to go back!"" said Clara. 

""I'm trying!"" huffed Rich.

And he was trying. But when he pressed the '66' button it did not light up. They did not have the clearance to press it. The elevator continued descending as he pressed the button over and over to no avial. 

""We need to get Stanley!"" cried Charlie. ""Rich!""

""It's not letting me!"" yelled Rich. ""It's not letting me!""

""When we get down then we'll have to go back up,"" said Clara. 

""We can't,"" said Rich, still pressing the button. ""It doesn't work like that. . .Listen. Stanley is smart. He'll hide. He'll know how to hide for a while. What we need to do is act normal when we get downstairs. We need to act like everything is okay. We need to get out of this building, and get to the police, and tell them about Stanley. They'll save him. Okay? But first we need to get out of this building. Undetected. That's the only was we can save Stanley. Okay? So Charlie, you pick up your other shoe, and you guys follow my lead. Okay? We're almost there.""

\- - -

Stanley was alone. As we watched the numbers descend he believed they would suddenly pause, and then start climbing. But he was a smart boy. When that didn't happen, he realized that elevators did not work like that. They did not stop halfway through their route. So he waited for them to reach wherever they were going. The numbers stopped at thirty. Any moment they would start climbing again. Of that he was sure. But when that didn't happen, he decided to press the button. That would call the elevator. And it did. The numbers climbed. He watched the hallway, in case the men finished their meeting and caught him. But there was no sign of them at all. So when the doors opened he got in the elevator and pushed the only button he could: 30. 

He tried to keep as calm as he could, alone on that elevator, holding his brother's shoe. Stupid Charlie. It was his shoe that had caused this. But it wasn't. Charlie wasn't the one who had jumped out to grab it. So it was Stanley's fault. He pouted. He was so hungry and tired. That's why he had done a stupid thing like that. And he was scared, being alone, not knowing what would come next. 

When the door opened he found himself staring at the stomach of a man in a suit. Stanley looked up. The man was peering at his wristwatch as he walked into the elevator, bumping right into Stanley. The man looked down in surprise.

""What are you doing here, little man?"" Hale Carnegie asked.

When officer Chuck Davis saw the three of them waving at him and running up to his cruiser, he shook his head, and thought, 'The crazies have found me again.' Because they looked like they'd been in the same clothes for a week, hadn't showered, had hardly slept. The little boy was even walking down the public sidewalk in his sock feet, carrying a single shoe at his side. And once they started spinning their yarn, the officer thought, 'Damn the old lady for tearing us out of Texas. Damn her for plopping us right in the steaming centre of this horseshit city.' Because they were yammering all sorts of tall nonsense: investment bankers kidnapping children, keeping 'em in cages, storing human hearts in glass boxes. He'd heard similar sorts of conspiracy theories floating around now and again, of course. The Clintons as human traffickers, the Facebook guy as an alien lizard, the Royal Family getting high off--now what the hell did Brent call it?--adrenochrome. Anti-elitist sentiment turned into fairytales. The rich and powerful as goblins and ghouls. But a person didn't often see a young man in a nice suit, dirty as it might have been, speaking about that sort of claptrap to an officer of the law. And when Davis started taking their information down, and the kids told him their names, he stopped and thought, 'I'll be a horse's ass if those ain't the names of them missing kids.' So Davis told them they had better hop in the cruiser and come down to Headquarters. 

If he had to tell the truth, the strangest part wasn't finding them two missing kids in the state that they was in. It wasn't the stories they told Davis as he drove, or the panicked way they kept insisting that their brother was going to be sacrificed by the evil inverstors. No. The strangest part, to Rubins at least, was after he parked, when he was walking 'em up to the station. This big black woman, wearing real dark sunglasses, was sitting right beside the entrance. And when they got close enough, she shot out her arm and grabbed the young man, Richard, right by the wrist, and started speaking as if she was talking to all three of 'em at once.

""You done the best you could,"" she said. ""Don't spend a minute of your time thinking otherwise. The world ain't a fair place. What's fair is after. Bring the good you can and don't drive yourselves crazy over what can't be changed.""

Then she let Richard go and Davis led them inside. And he heard Rich ask the kids if they knew the woman, and they said no. So that already was strange in itself. But the part that made it even stranger to Davis was that she had a cane propped up beside her. And when he looked over his shoulder he saw her up and walking, tapping her cane in front of her all the while. But how does a blind woman know who's coming up the sidewalk? How does she know where to grab when an arm swings by? He pickled his brain in that one for so long it was hard to unpickle it.

\- - -

The police split the three of them into different rooms and Rich gave his statement to an officer. But when he tried to stress the urgency of the situation, the fact that the police needed to raid the *DIG* offices now, that a child's life was at stake, the officer simply said that Captain Coots had been made aware of the situation, and would be arriving soon to ask Rich some more questions. 

""I'm fine to answer any questions he or anyone else has,"" said Rich. ""But first, please, go save that fucking kid!""

""It's not up to me, pal,"" said the officer. ""And don't curse at an officer. Especially when you're asking for favours.""

""Favours?"" cried Rich. ""I'm asking you to do your job.""

""And I'm asking you to do yours,"" said the officer. 

""Which is?""

""To sit tight,"" said the officer.

Then he stood up and left the room.

That had happened over an hour ago, and Rich was still sitting in the damn interrogation room, waiting for this Captain Coots to arrive. He tried not to get too worked up or frustrated. Likely the Captain was organizing the sting. Things like that took time. A lot of preliminary work. They had to get warrants. They had to get the appropriate team together. They had to get their gear. It couldn't happen in a blink. But as soon as the door opened and he saw Captain Coots, Rich sensed there was no sting was in the works. 

Captain Coots was a tall, fit and handsome man, likely in his early forties. When he entered, he beamed a wide smile at Rich, revealing a set of perfectly straight, white teeth. His dark blue pants had evidently been tailored. His white shirt looked far too expensive an article for his role. The golden badge pinned to his chest was polished, and gleamed. But it's gleam was nothing compared to the gleam of his huge, gold pinky ring, in which was set a ring of diamonds. The gleam of his ring seemed dim, though, compared to that of his watch. 

""Richard Fines,"" he boomed, ""I'm Captain Coots.""

The Captain extended his hand for a shake and Rich took it. The Captain's grip was firm, powerful; he shook slowly, deliberately, a little too long. The Captain finally released Rich's hand and eased himself into the seat across the table.

""You've told us a troubling tale,"" said the Captain. ""I read over your statement, and spoke with officers Davis and Banks. A troubling tale, indeed.""

""Their brother is still up there,"" said Rich. ""Stanley. He's in danger. The Boden brothers--""

""Yes,"" said the Captain. ""The Boden brothers. As I mentioned, I've read your statement already. But as a former detective, and current police captain, I know there are two sides to every statement. Two perspectives on every. . .tale. Each with their own measure of truth. My job is to sift through the claims of both sides, and sparate the truth from the lies. . .You must understand. With a story as wild and whirling as the one brought us, it was only right that I call the Boden brothers myself, to hear their side of it.""

""What?"" said Rich. 

""So I called Mr Jackson Boden,"" said the Captain, ""and what he told me cast your statement in a very different light--a statement, need I remind you, that you legally affirmed was accurate and true.""

""It was true!"" cried Rich. ""It is true!""

""That's not what Mr Boden claims,"" said the Captain. ""He claims that you're a disgruntled employee whom he recently fired for poor performance. He claims that you're flinging baseless accusations at him, at his brothers, at their investment firm, in order to create a public relations scandal. In order to get revenge for your termination.""

""That's outrageous!"" cried Rich. ""That's completely outrageous!""

""More outrageous than your claims?"" asked the Captain, ""That these esteemed stock brokers and investment bankers are sacrificing humans on the altar of an ancient pagan diety? That they are keeping stores of human hearts alive in glass jars? That they have a freezer filled with the bodies of their former employees?""

""I never mentioned a freezer in my statement,"" said Rich. 

""Well you might as well have,"" said the Captain, flushing slightly, ""given how outlandish the rest of your claims are. . .The Boden brothers have agreed not to press any charges. Not for the slander. Not for the money you stole. And not for the man you assaulted.""

""Money I stole?"" said Rich. ""And what man did I assault?""

""Mr Boden claims you assaulted a man named Frank, right outside his conference room,"" said the Captain. ""He claims you knocked him to the ground and then choked him until he lost consciousness. You know, a good lawyer could put you away for attempted murder for that. And I can assure you, the Jack Boden can afford a very good lawyer.""

Rich stared at the table in front of him. As he raised his eyes, he caught sight of the face of the glimmering watch.

""Is that a real Rolex?"" asked Rich. 

""You're going to have to leave town,"" said the Captain. 

""On a policeman's salary?"" said Rich. ""A Rolex?""

""For your own sake,"" said the Captain. ""New York is not the right fit for you. You're not the right fit for it.""

""Is that what *Jack* told you?"" asked Rich, staring the Captain in the eye. 

""You seem to have a lot of passion now,"" said the Captain, smiling. ""Passion for what you think is right. But I can assure you, if you stay in the city much longer, you're going to lose heart much sooner than you think.""

""What about the missing kid?"" asked Rich. 

""A miracle two of them were found,"" said the Captain. 

""And the one who wasn't?"" asked Rich. ""Something like that won't just go away.""

""I was speaking with Jack about that,"" said the Captain. ""During our conversation. A tragedy. We both agreed. It's a tragedy anytime a child goes missing, never to be found. I said I was optimistic that there would be fewer sad cases like that going forward. Ever the pessimist, Jack disagreed. He's convinced the problem is only going to get worse in the days and years to come. I hope he's wrong, of course. But what else can I do but hope? What can any of us do but work together to shape a brighter future?""

The Captain stood up and smiled brightly. 

""Thanks for understanding, Richard Alphonso Fines of 409 Climber Heights,"" he said. ""And remember. Leave the city. Tonight.""

The Exorcism of Adolf Hitler [Part 1] The Angel,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/mrdq1g/the_exorcism_of_adolf_hitler_part_1_the_angel/,the_brabazon,1,2021-04-15 20:34:37,1,/r/libraryofshadows/comments/mrdq1g/the_exorcism_of_adolf_hitler_part_1_the_angel/,Supernatural,"I am one of over ninety thousand centenarians living in the United States in the year 2021 and I have a terrible secret. I never imagined living to the age of one hundred when I was a girl. It’s an awfully long time to hold onto a secret, especially one like this. If I am to be believed, then I hope the world will view history in a different light. But this requires the context of a story and knowledge of the brave people involved. 

I escaped from Europe in the bellies of freight trains and in steerage on a dilapidated ocean liner at the dawn of the Second World War. I evacuated to America with forged documents and under an alias that remains my legal name to this day. But that name does not matter here. My real name is Bruna Stengel and I was born in Berlin in 1920. 

My father was a Nazi. Most of our parents were in those days and it never struck us as unusual. He found National Socialism after my mother died when I was still a baby. It may be more correct to say it found him because that is what the Nazi Party’s founders did in the early days. They preyed on those who had lost everything and needed answers but sold them lies instead. As the 1930s came and wore on, my father demonstrated his ability to organize and control and was rewarded with rank, power, and a view behind the curtain. It was this view that allowed him to see how things inside The Third Reich were more sinister than the German people realized. He saw something terrifying the rest of Hitler’s inner circle could not and he knew he alone had a chance to alter Germany’s dangerous course.

My story starts on a picturesque afternoon in the spring of 1934 because this day was the last time I saw the angel. I was fourteen years old and a proud member of the *Bund Deutscher Madel*—the League of German Girls. The Hitler Youth was for molding boys into obedient fighting men. Fighting was not something party leaders thought girls could do. Our youth wing was the League and in it we went camping, learned songs, dance, gymnastics, and how to be homemakers. We aspired to one day earn the Mother's Cross. A bronze one was issued to a woman who birthed five children, six earned her a cross made of silver, and eight earned her gold. We were growing our race and doing so married to a handsome SS officer was considered the highest ideal. We were not individuals, we were instruments, each and every one of us alike. It was indoctrination, though we were not wise to it then.

I squinted in the afternoon sunlight through the lenses of a gas mask on that spring day in Berlin Central Park. The two-dozen teenaged League girls around me wore gas masks too. They were a strange accessory atop our black leotards, but they had a purpose. Our bodies swayed in unison as we performed a synchronized dance we had practiced for weeks. Our troupe leader, a brutish, middle-aged woman whose name I don’t recall, monitored us as we split into two lines. She did not wear a gas mask.

I snuck a look to the side to gauge my distance from the girl nearest to me. I knew the routine but seeing through the mask was difficult. I hoped my troupe leader hadn’t noticed. I was doing well. I was less coordinated than the other girls, still a few years away from growing into my frame, and it reflected in my level of confidence. I was quieter and less sure of myself than they were. But I had practiced so diligently, taking extra time on my own, that I knew I had mastered the routine. Even the motion picture director filming us for propaganda reels hadn’t unnerved me. 

But then I saw my angel. It appeared on a low, distant hill across the park. I had seen the angel many times before. Sometimes it appeared in a moment of need. I would find it when I grieved over seeing my father so little or having never known my mother at all. Other times it came as a blatant distraction as if it wanted to remind me that it served an agenda other than my own. I never saw it in full or up close. I'd see a face in a window, a silhouette in the fog, or hear the flap of a wing in the dark of night, but never all together. I had the strange distinction of being intimately familiar with it, yet I had no idea what it looked like. This time would be different. I knew I could see it clearly if only I took off that gas mask.

I went still and broke from the routine. The other girls continued, uncertain how to react when one of us deviated. Then I pulled off my mask. At a distance, the angel looked luminous, yet it was already fading. I saw only a nondescript human figure. Then something unfolded from its back. It was rare that I got to see the angel's wings.

“Bruna, you have wasted our director’s take. Is something wrong?” My troupe leader blocked my view of the angel.

“Do you see that?” I asked, pointing to the angel. 

She looked but didn’t react. “Why did you take off your gas mask?” She must not have seen it.

I was now embarrassed, regretting my decision. “Please I—I’m sorry. I thought I saw something.”

“This isn’t helpful. You know why we wear our masks don’t you?” She waited, her exacting eyes piercing mine. I thought she looked nothing like the pure, natural women we were told to be. The other girls giggled at me under their gas masks. 

Another girl replied, shouting through her mask. “To make powerful images for the Führer’s films!”

My troupe leader nodded. “Correct. But why cover our faces? Bruna this time.”

“To create a feeling of oneness…” I knew it was the correct response. Looking down at my gas mask, I wished to never see my angel again. I was getting older. The pressure to conform was too great and telling others I had an angel didn’t help. Plus, I had new thoughts and goals now. It was time that I drew strength from the system instead. I put the gas mask back on.

“Very good. Now start again.” Her demeanor changed completely. We resumed. This time I blended in. I no longer felt alone. It felt like my League troupe moved through me. We did two more takes until the director was satisfied. 

I saw an entourage approaching from across the park. They all wore the same gray or brown suits with thick, red bands around their left arms my father always wore. The director and troupe leader turned around and held their hands high in their stiffest Nazi salutes. 

In the center of the group stood Adolf Hitler. The Chancellor. *The Führer.* I couldn’t believe it. I had never seen him up close before. I knew other party ministers' children who had met him, but my father had never given me the privilege. He was average height and slight of build, but he carried himself with the presence of an Olympic strong man or film star. He was young for a head of state then, only forty-four, and every woman in Germany knew well he was still a bachelor.

Of all the girls in my troupe, he walked up to me. I was so awestruck I forgot to remove my gas mask. Hitler did it for me, lifting the mask to expose my young face.

“What pretty, young girls sprout from our German soil.” His voice was gruff but calm, different than how I had heard it on radio and film reels. His eyes were hypnotic. I tingled as I looked into them. Then he moved on from me. “Off with your masks. Let me see you!”

The other girls tossed their gas masks aside and swarmed him, pushing me to the outside. They fawned and swooned over him. He was everything we were supposed to admire. It seems impossible to understand the emotions Hitler stirred in us. We were more innocent and naïve in those days and never had access to information of our own the way later generations would. All that we knew came from the party, packaged and delivered by radio stations and newspapers under the party’s thumb. The Hitler they told us about was one of their products like any other.

Photographers from Hitler’s entourage staged us around him. The same type of picture I had grown to admire in the newspapers was now being created in front of me. Now it was our turn to be by his side and we would be the ones others admired and envied. “If only I could get closer,” I thought, craning my neck from the outside, hoping to make it into the frame.

“Wait! Her. Yes, her! Put her in front.” I realized it was me the photographer was referring to. Before I could react, a set of hands grabbed my arms and moved me in front of the girls who had laughed at me only moments ago. I looked up and the Führer glanced down, placing a firm hand on my shoulder. He looked back to the camera, but I could not look away from him. “Face here!” The photographer’s words startled me again. I followed his voice to the camera and smiled.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It would be four more years before I saw the Führer or the angel again. I was eighteen and a fresh graduate of the League of German Girls. I was a young woman now and a graceful dancer and gymnast. I had finally grown into my body and I could see the men around me starting to notice. “I’m the only daughter of Interior Minister Stengel,” I told myself. “The party and society will want to open doors for me.” But in secret, I was directionless. I wanted to lead and make a difference, not for the sake of power, but to set an example and be more than just the recipient of some bronze cross. 

There were a few women in high positions. I thought of Magda Goebbels or Lina Heydrich, but they were wives of powerful men. I thought I could settle for that, yet I also thought of Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the highest-ranking woman in Germany, and Leni Riefenstahl, the filmmaker. Yes, those were the women I wanted to be like. But while the SS officers, *Luftwaffe* pilots, and other aspirational young men noticed me, they also left me alone and I didn’t know why. Maybe my wandering mind was the problem. I decided I would do best to find my answers within the party.

I found myself at this crossroads one gray afternoon in March of 1938, looking out at Germany’s Black Forest from a third-floor window in Falkenhayn Castle. It was a sad sort of castle, only four stories tall, built of brick, with squat proportions and mundane roof spires. It would be dwarfed by the great architect Speer’s new Reich Chancellery back in Berlin, I thought. 

I didn’t know why my father had sent me here two days before to be watched over by the old woman who was the castle’s caretaker and only other occupant. Her name was Eloise and that was all she allowed me to know. The only thing I could think of was that Falkenhayn Castle might have been selected as a remote site for a secret meeting among party leaders. Perhaps now I would get my formal introduction to the inner circle. But if it were so secret, why would I, a fresh League of German Girls graduate, be permitted? I had spent the last two days trying to figure it out. Eloise told me nothing, but I was convinced she knew. 

I watched for headlights and listened for the sound of the car carrying my father. He told me he would explain everything once he arrived. I did not have to wait long. I caught a flicker of yellow light through the trees. Then a gray sedan drove off the dirt road into the clearing surrounding the castle. It was a rough sort of car used by soldiers of the German Army, the *Wehrmacht,* not a black Mercedes-Benz officials like my father rode in. But my father it was, given away by the dark brown homburg hat he always wore. He leaped out of the driver’s seat and ran around to the other side. I moved to another window to watch as he pulled a man out from the passenger door and lowered him to the ground. I could see blood on the man’s clothing and there were bullet holes in the car door. My anticipation dissipated, replaced by a plaguing concern that wrenched my stomach and would not leave me for days. What had my father gotten involved in? 

My father crouched over the bleeding man, though I couldn’t see what he was doing. My father stood up, but the man remained on the ground. I waited for him to sit up, for my father to lend him his hand and pull him to his feet, but it never came. I stopped breathing when I realized the man was dead. I had never seen a dead person before. 

I watched my father open the trunk. He dragged another man out through the opening and dumped him on the damp ground. This man was handcuffed and his head was bound and covered in a burlap sack. I could only imagine he was some kind of political prisoner. But then why would my father be transporting him? A pair of dogs started barking two floors below, snapping me out of my bewildered trance and reminding me to breathe. I followed their sound downstairs.

Diamond and Prinz, two large Rottweilers Eloise said belonged to an associate of my father, pawed at the heavy double doors in the castle entryway. They had been my companions over the past two days and they were glad for the attention as Eloise did little besides pour their food twice a day. But now my two new friends were snarling and leaving scratch marks on the doors. I reached between them and unbolted the lock. They forced the doors open and ran out to the clearing.

The dogs continued to bark at my father and his prisoner. “Diamond, Prinz, stop!” I tried to quiet them as I approached, but there was no stopping their protective instincts. “Father, what’s going on?”

My father, Werner Stengel, Reich Minister of the Interior, looked up from the prisoner with an expression that told me he had all but forgotten I was there. “Stay back, Bruna!” He had to shout to make himself heard over the dogs’ incessant barking. He was forty-five, with hair starting to thin and these grave, contemplative eyes that suggested a lifetime of tough decisions constantly weighing on him. Blood stained the sleeve of his brown suit jacket, matching his red swastika armband. 

“Are you alright?” I asked, noticing the stain.

“The blood isn’t mine, it’s Eugen’s,” he lamented, eying the man lying dead on the ground.

Another gray sedan emerged from the forest and slowed to a stop beside us. A young man dressed in the all-black uniform of a SS officer stepped out. We made instant and lingering eye contact. He was certainly handsome, probably twenty-five or twenty-six, and wore the rank of *Obersturmführer.* This was a man on the rise yet not high-up enough to have much to lose, I thought. I had met other young officers of his mold. I thought they were arrogant, but something always drew me to them. His badge displayed the name, ‘Dahlgren.’ We both realized we were staring and looked away. The dogs gave us a reprieve, bounding up to him, their barks turning excited and playful. 

“Guys, down! Down! Shhhhhh. I know, I’m happy to see you too.” 

My father spoke up. “Dahlgren, were you shot?”

“No. Were you?”

“No, but Eugen was. One caught him back at the Berghof.”

Dahlgren eyed Eugen’s body. His mood sank. “Then what are we going to do?”

My father tried hard to project a sense of steely calm. “We proceed.”

Dahlgren seemed almost annoyed. “You said we needed him.” 

“I’ll figure it out… Where did we lose Klaus?”

“I lost sight of his car a few kilometers outside Obersalzberg.” 

I had no idea what they were talking about. I took it all in, afraid to wade into the matter. We all heard a kicking sound coming from the trunk of Dahlgren’s car. He opened the lid and pulled out a second prisoner, fatter than the first, also handcuffed and covered by a burlap sack.

Dahlgren’s eyes met mine again. “Is this your daughter?”

“Indeed, she is. And I recall telling her to remain in the castle—"" my father cut himself off. The first prisoner had climbed to his feet and stood defiantly at my father's ear as if goading him. My father lurched and side-stepped in startlement. Diamond and Prinz barked, spittle flying off their gums. Whoever this prisoner was, something about him provoked the dogs’ ire. It worried me. 

“Father, please, what’s going on?” 

The first prisoner straightened up at the sound of my voice. His head swiveled toward me. The dogs went silent. My confusion gave way to a sense of unease. “Why do the dogs fear him?” I wondered. “Should I?”

I suddenly felt a twinge of what may have upset them. My ears rang and I was overcome with nausea. My skin grew ice cold. I felt like I had fallen, struck my head, and come down with food poisoning and fever chills all at once. My father winced. I was sure he felt it too, though he seemed to be hiding it. Dahlgren didn’t seem to notice anything at all. 

Then as suddenly as it came on, the sensation passed. I wondered if I had imagined it.

“Get them inside right now.” My father took a relieved breath after the thin prisoner slackened. He grabbed the prisoner’s handcuffs from behind, then he and Dahlgren pushed both prisoners toward the castle with the dogs at their heels.

I was left alone with the corpse on the ground, the one they called Eugen. I wondered why he had been shot and what it meant that my father had been shot at too. Desperate for answers, I followed them inside.

My father locked the castle’s double doors once I slipped through. “Dahlgren, take Ballin downstairs.”

Dahlgren pulled the fat prisoner down a stairwell to what I knew was a basement prison. I had explored every corner of the castle over the past two days and discovered the basement contained a row of wrought-iron jail cells.

The name my father mentioned rang a bell. ""Reich Minister of Finance Albert Ballin?” In the League, we learned the names of all the Nazi leadership.

My father responded with a nod, but a reluctant one, as if this was a conversation he dreaded. “Come with me.” 

He pulled the thin prisoner backward up the spiral stairwell. I followed him up through the second and third floors and into a single round turret above the roof, the castle's highest point. My next thought was that this was a SS operation, perhaps a prisoner interrogation, a possibility my father denied. I was confused and frustrated. Had Albert Ballin, a longtime confidante of Hitler, betrayed him? And why was my father being so vague with all his answers?

The turret chamber was circular and split in half by a brick wall with a thick steel door at its center. At the middle of the door was a one-foot-square opening with a set of bars. This cell looked far more secure than those in the basement. 

My father held the prisoner in place by the handcuffs and shot me a grave look. “I don’t expect you to understand this at first. I only ask that you trust me. The rest will be clear soon. Now stand back.”

At eighteen, I was not one to accept my father's word on blind faith, but at this moment I was too nervous to do anything else. I stepped back to the wall. My father opened the steel door with a brass key and walked the prisoner inside. He jammed his boot into the back of the prisoner's leg to bring him to his knees, then removed the burlap sack. I caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man from behind. Even with what little I saw, there was no doubt who it was. There was no mistaking him, but I still couldn’t believe it. My father backed out of the cell, shut the steel door, and locked it with the brass key.

I stammered. “Is it—? It’s not—""

My father’s words resonated. “It is.”

I approached the cell. A face appeared in the opening behind the bars, one well-known to the whole world. The implication of seeing him here and now made me feel ill. I looked into the blazing eyes of the Führer, Adolf Hitler. A piece of tape covered his mouth. I reached for it instinctively.

“No, don’t!” my father shouted. It was too late.

I pulled off the tape and Hitler spoke. “Stengel, why have you deprived us of your lovely daughter for so long?”

It all came fluttering back to me. I felt as if I was fourteen years old at Berlin Central Park again. The emotions he stirred in me then had never left.

My father stepped in. “Bruna, get out. Don’t let him talk to you."" 

“Your father’s a religious maniac!” Hitler shouted back. “He thinks I’m possessed by a demon!”

“What?” I could hardly comprehend everything that was happening. I protested as my father darted in and pulled me away. “Wait, stop! What have you done?”

Hitler continued. “Listen to me, fräulein, he’s a traitor to me, to you, and to all of Germany.”

My father pulled me to the stairwell. “Don’t believe anything he says to you.”

“You put her in danger, Stengel! Do you even care for her?”

My father slammed the wooden door to the turret chamber, muffling Hitler’s voice. He saw I was shaking and guided me down to the third floor.

I pleaded with him. “Please tell me it isn’t true.”

“I’m afraid it is.”

“But how can Hitler be possessed?”

“Eloise and I will explain everything shortly. There is going to be an exorcism.”

“But you’re not even a priest anymore.” I now doubted every word my father said. I heard each sentence as if it were that of a mad man.

“I know. I’ve made some terrible choices and I’m doing everything I can to atone for them now, but this is not one of them.”

“Why did you bring me here?”

“Berlin is no longer safe for you. The Nazis know only that I’ve disappeared along with him, but that still makes me a suspect. You're the first one they'd come for."" Whether he had gone mad or not, I could tell he believed every word he spoke.

“And they won’t find us here?” 

“Dahlgren and I have planned for that. Albert Ballin will be the patsy.”

I was incredulous. I saw my dreams evaporating before me. “I just graduated! You said you’d help me be whatever I wanted to be. You said I could be the Reich’s first female minister!”

“Because if we succeed it will be a very different Reich. The Nazis aren’t what you think they are. He’s going to start a war.”

This seemed preposterous to me. Hitler’s policies had brought only pride and prosperity to us up to then. “A war? Why would you say that?”

“Look at the signs. His political opponents are in camps, Jews are losing their rights, he’s seizing sovereign territories, growing the army in violation of treaties. What do you think it means?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why do you insist on not thinking for yourself?” 

I didn’t know what to say back. He saw how it wounded me and I knew I had disappointed him. I needed to be alone. I ran down the stairwell, almost bumping into Eloise and nearly spilling the tea kettle she was carrying. I paused halfway down to the next floor, curious to hear what my father and Eloise said to each other. They couldn't see me around the curve of the stairwell.

“You should have let me prepare her,” Eloise started. 

“She’s too indoctrinated. I couldn’t take that risk.”

“So were you not too many years ago.”

“I was a grown man. I knew the world before this. Bruna is young. This is all she knows.”

""Without Father Eugen, you're going to need her. If you want her to understand, tonight is all the time you’ll have… Werner, sit, please. You’ve had an exhausting day. I brought your tea.”

I could hear the tea kettle clanging against the serving tray. I had previously noticed how Eloise’s hands often shook uncontrollably. She tried to hide it, but I caught it happening several times.

My father remarked on it as well. “And what about you? Has it gotten worse?” 

The clanging stopped. She must have set down the kettle. “I could sense him getting nearer all afternoon and it got worse once you arrived with him. This demon is powerful, Werner, I can feel it.”

“Have you been able to prepare the materials?”

“Shame on you. I’m old, not useless. Now drink your tea before it gets any colder. I’m not making it again.” 

Eloise and my father spoke like old friends, but he had never spoken of her to me. She was much older than him and said the kinds of things no one dared say to a party minister. I knew little about my father’s time as a priest in the years before I was born. That was a different life he had always kept separate from me. This strange woman must have been a part of it. I couldn't understand how they thought I was indoctrinated. I said the same things our party leaders, newspapers, industrialists, and teachers did. If they were all in agreement, who was my father to start questioning them? It seemed so obvious to me. Wouldn’t that make him wrong?

I never imagined living to the age of one hundred when I was a girl. It’s an awfully long time to hold onto a secret, especially one like this. I don’t know how much longer I have left, but I don’t want to spend it carrying this burden alone. I have a responsibility to share it, a promise I have neglected for far too long. If I am to be believed, then I hope the world will view history in a different light. But this requires the context of a story and knowledge of the brave people involved. 

I escaped from Europe in the bellies of freight trains and in steerage on a dilapidated ocean liner at the dawn of the Second World War. I evacuated to America with forged documents and under an alias that remains my legal name to this day. But that name does not matter here. My real name is Bruna Stengel and I was born in Berlin in 1920. 

My father was a Nazi. Most of our parents were in those days and it never struck us as unusual. He found National Socialism after my mother died when I was still a baby. It may be more correct to say it found him because that is what the Nazi Party’s founders did in the early days. They preyed on those who had lost everything and needed answers but sold them lies instead. As the 1930s came and wore on, my father demonstrated his ability to organize and control and was rewarded with rank, power, and a view behind the curtain. It was this view that allowed him to see how things inside The Third Reich were more sinister than the German people realized. He saw something terrifying the rest of Hitler’s inner circle could not and he knew he alone had a chance to alter Germany’s dangerous course.

My story starts on a picturesque afternoon in the spring of 1934 because this day was the last time I saw the angel. I was fourteen years old and a proud member of the *Bund Deutscher Madel*—the League of German Girls. The Hitler Youth was for molding boys into obedient fighting men. Fighting was not something party leaders thought girls could do. Our youth wing was the League and in it we went camping, learned songs, dance, gymnastics, and how to be homemakers. We aspired to one day earn the Mother's Cross. A bronze one was issued to a woman who birthed five children, six earned her a cross made of silver, and eight earned her gold. We were growing our race and doing so married to a handsome SS officer was considered the highest ideal. We were not individuals, we were instruments, each and every one of us alike. It was indoctrination, though we were not wise to it then.

I squinted in the afternoon sunlight through the lenses of a gas mask on that spring day in Berlin Central Park. The two-dozen teenaged League girls around me wore gas masks too. They were a strange accessory atop our black leotards, but they had a purpose. Our bodies swayed in unison as we performed a synchronized dance we had practiced for weeks. Our troupe leader, a brutish, middle-aged woman whose name I don’t recall, monitored us as we split into two lines. She did not wear a gas mask.

I snuck a look to the side to gauge my distance from the girl nearest to me. I knew the routine but seeing through the mask was difficult. I hoped my troupe leader hadn’t noticed. I was doing well. I was less coordinated than the other girls, still a few years away from growing into my frame, and it reflected in my level of confidence. I was quieter and less sure of myself than they were. But I had practiced so diligently, taking extra time on my own, that I knew I had mastered the routine. Even the motion picture director filming us for propaganda reels hadn’t unnerved me. 

But then I saw my angel. It appeared on a low, distant hill across the park. I had seen the angel many times before. Sometimes it appeared in a moment of need. I would find it when I grieved over seeing my father so little or having never known my mother at all. Other times it came as a blatant distraction as if it wanted to remind me that it served an agenda other than my own. I never saw it in full or up close. I'd see a face in a window, a silhouette in the fog, or hear the flap of a wing in the dark of night, but never all together. I had the strange distinction of being intimately familiar with it, yet I had no idea what it looked like. This time would be different. I knew I could see it clearly if only I took off that gas mask.

I went still and broke from the routine. The other girls continued, uncertain how to react when one of us deviated. Then I pulled off my mask. At a distance, the angel looked luminous, yet it was already fading. I saw only a nondescript human figure. Then something unfolded from its back. It was rare that I got to see the angel's wings.

“Bruna, you have wasted our director’s take. Is something wrong?” My troupe leader blocked my view of the angel.

“Do you see that?” I asked, pointing to the angel. 

She looked but didn’t react. “Why did you take off your gas mask?” She must not have seen it.

I was now embarrassed, regretting my decision. “Please I—I’m sorry. I thought I saw something.”

“This isn’t helpful. You know why we wear our masks don’t you?” She waited, her exacting eyes piercing mine. I thought she looked nothing like the pure, natural women we were told to be. The other girls giggled at me under their gas masks. 

Another girl replied, shouting through her mask. “To make powerful images for the Führer’s films!”

My troupe leader nodded. “Correct. But why cover our faces? Bruna this time.”

“To create a feeling of oneness…” I knew it was the correct response. Looking down at my gas mask, I wished to never see my angel again. I was getting older. The pressure to conform was too great and telling others I had an angel didn’t help. Plus, I had new thoughts and goals now. It was time that I drew strength from the system instead. I put the gas mask back on.

“Very good. Now start again.” Her demeanor changed completely. We resumed. This time I blended in. I no longer felt alone. It felt like my League troupe moved through me. We did two more takes until the director was satisfied. 

I saw an entourage approaching from across the park. They all wore the same gray or brown suits with thick, red bands around their left arms my father always wore. The director and troupe leader turned around and held their hands high in their stiffest Nazi salutes. 

In the center of the group stood Adolf Hitler. The Chancellor. *The Führer.* I couldn’t believe it. I had never seen him up close before. I knew other party ministers' children who had met him, but my father had never given me the privilege. He was average height and slight of build, but he carried himself with the presence of an Olympic strong man or film star. He was young for a head of state then, only forty-four, and every woman in Germany knew well he was still a bachelor.

Of all the girls in my troupe, he walked up to me. I was so awestruck I forgot to remove my gas mask. Hitler did it for me, lifting the mask to expose my young face.

“What pretty, young girls sprout from our German soil.” His voice was gruff but calm, different than how I had heard it on radio and film reels. His eyes were hypnotic. I tingled as I looked into them. Then he moved on from me. “Off with your masks. Let me see you!”

The other girls tossed their gas masks aside and swarmed him, pushing me to the outside. They fawned and swooned over him. He was everything we were supposed to admire. It seems impossible to understand the emotions Hitler stirred in us. We were more innocent and naïve in those days and never had access to information of our own the way later generations would. All that we knew came from the party, packaged and delivered by radio stations and newspapers under the party’s thumb. The Hitler they told us about was one of their products like any other.

Photographers from Hitler’s entourage staged us around him. The same type of picture I had grown to admire in the newspapers was now being created in front of me. Now it was our turn to be by his side and we would be the ones others admired and envied. “If only I could get closer,” I thought, craning my neck from the outside, hoping to make it into the frame.

“Wait! Her. Yes, her! Put her in front.” I realized it was me the photographer was referring to. Before I could react, a set of hands grabbed my arms and moved me in front of the girls who had laughed at me only moments ago. I looked up and the Führer glanced down, placing a firm hand on my shoulder. He looked back to the camera, but I could not look away from him. “Face here!” The photographer’s words startled me again. I followed his voice to the camera and smiled.

It would be four more years before I saw the Führer or the angel again. I was eighteen and a fresh graduate of the League of German Girls. I was a young woman now and a graceful dancer and gymnast. I had finally grown into my body and I could see the men around me starting to notice. “I’m the only daughter of Interior Minister Stengel,” I told myself. “The party and society will want to open doors for me.” But in secret, I was directionless. I wanted to lead and make a difference, not for the sake of power, but to set an example and be more than just the recipient of some bronze cross. 

There were a few women in high positions. I thought of Magda Goebbels or Lina Heydrich, but they were wives of powerful men. I thought I could settle for that, yet I also thought of Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the highest-ranking woman in Germany, and Leni Riefenstahl, the filmmaker. Yes, those were the women I wanted to be like. But while the SS officers, *Luftwaffe* pilots, and other aspirational young men noticed me, they also left me alone and I didn’t know why. Maybe my wandering mind was the problem. I decided I would do best to find my answers within the party.

I found myself at this crossroads one gray afternoon in March of 1938, looking out at Germany’s Black Forest from a third-floor window in Falkenhayn Castle. It was a sad sort of castle, only four stories tall, built of brick, with squat proportions and mundane roof spires. It would be dwarfed by the great architect Speer’s new Reich Chancellery back in Berlin, I thought. 

I didn’t know why my father had sent me here two days before to be watched over by the old woman who was the castle’s caretaker and only other occupant. Her name was Eloise and that was all she allowed me to know. The only thing I could think of was that Falkenhayn Castle might have been selected as a remote site for a secret meeting among party leaders. Perhaps now I would get my formal introduction to the inner circle. But if it were so secret, why would I, a fresh League of German Girls graduate, be permitted? I had spent the last two days trying to figure it out. Eloise told me nothing, but I was convinced she knew. 

I watched for headlights and listened for the sound of the car carrying my father. He told me he would explain everything once he arrived. I did not have to wait long. I caught a flicker of yellow light through the trees. Then a gray sedan drove off the dirt road into the clearing surrounding the castle. It was a rough sort of car used by soldiers of the German Army, the *Wehrmacht,* not a black Mercedes-Benz officials like my father rode in. But my father it was, given away by the dark brown homburg hat he always wore. He leaped out of the driver’s seat and ran around to the other side. I moved to another window to watch as he pulled a man out from the passenger door and lowered him to the ground. I could see blood on the man’s clothing and there were bullet holes in the car door. My anticipation dissipated, replaced by a plaguing concern that wrenched my stomach and would not leave me for days. What had my father gotten involved in? 

My father crouched over the bleeding man, though I couldn’t see what he was doing. My father stood up, but the man remained on the ground. I waited for him to sit up, for my father to lend him his hand and pull him to his feet, but it never came. I stopped breathing when I realized the man was dead. I had never seen a dead person before. 

I watched my father open the trunk. He dragged another man out through the opening and dumped him on the damp ground. This man was handcuffed and his head was bound and covered in a burlap sack. I could only imagine he was some kind of political prisoner. But then why would my father be transporting him? A pair of dogs started barking two floors below, snapping me out of my bewildered trance and reminding me to breathe. I followed their sound downstairs.

Diamond and Prinz, two large Rottweilers Eloise said belonged to an associate of my father, pawed at the heavy double doors in the castle entryway. They had been my companions over the past two days and they were glad for the attention as Eloise did little besides pour their food twice a day. But now my two new friends were snarling and leaving scratch marks on the doors. I reached between them and unbolted the lock. They forced the doors open and ran out to the clearing.

The dogs continued to bark at my father and his prisoner. “Diamond, Prinz, stop!” I tried to quiet them as I approached, but there was no stopping their protective instincts. “Father, what’s going on?”

My father, Werner Stengel, Reich Minister of the Interior, looked up from the prisoner with an expression that told me he had all but forgotten I was there. “Stay back, Bruna!” He had to shout to make himself heard over the dogs’ incessant barking. He was forty-five, with hair starting to thin and these grave, contemplative eyes that suggested a lifetime of tough decisions constantly weighing on him. Blood stained the sleeve of his brown suit jacket, matching his red swastika armband. 

“Are you alright?” I asked, noticing the stain.

“The blood isn’t mine, it’s Eugen’s,” he lamented, eying the man lying dead on the ground.

Another gray sedan emerged from the forest and slowed to a stop beside us. A young man dressed in the all-black uniform of a SS officer stepped out. We made instant and lingering eye contact. He was certainly handsome, probably twenty-five or twenty-six, and wore the rank of *Obersturmführer.* This was a man on the rise yet not high-up enough to have much to lose, I thought. I had met other young officers of his mold. I thought they were arrogant, but something always drew me to them. His badge displayed the name, ‘Dahlgren.’ We both realized we were staring and looked away. The dogs gave us a reprieve, bounding up to him, their barks turning excited and playful. 

“Guys, down! Down! Shhhhhh. I know, I’m happy to see you too.” 

My father spoke up. “Dahlgren, were you shot?”

“No. Were you?”

“No, but Eugen was. One caught him back at the Berghof.”

Dahlgren eyed Eugen’s body. His mood sank. “Then what are we going to do?”

My father tried hard to project a sense of steely calm. “We proceed.”

Dahlgren seemed almost annoyed. “You said we needed him.” 

“I’ll figure it out… Where did we lose Klaus?”

“I lost sight of his car a few kilometers outside Obersalzberg.” 

I had no idea what they were talking about. I took it all in, afraid to wade into the matter. We all heard a kicking sound coming from the trunk of Dahlgren’s car. He opened the lid and pulled out a second prisoner, fatter than the first, also handcuffed and covered by a burlap sack.

Dahlgren’s eyes met mine again. “Is this your daughter?”

“Indeed, she is. And I recall telling her to remain in the castle—"" my father cut himself off. The first prisoner had climbed to his feet and stood defiantly at my father's ear as if goading him. My father lurched and side-stepped in startlement. Diamond and Prinz barked, spittle flying off their gums. Whoever this prisoner was, something about him provoked the dogs’ ire. It worried me. 

“Father, please, what’s going on?” 

The first prisoner straightened up at the sound of my voice. His head swiveled toward me. The dogs went silent. My confusion gave way to a sense of unease. “Why do the dogs fear him?” I wondered. “Should I?”

I suddenly felt a twinge of what may have upset them. My ears rang and I was overcome with nausea. My skin grew ice cold. I felt like I had fallen, struck my head, and come down with food poisoning and fever chills all at once. My father winced. I was sure he felt it too, though he seemed to be hiding it. Dahlgren didn’t seem to notice anything at all. 

Then as suddenly as it came on, the sensation passed. I wondered if I had imagined it.

“Get them inside right now.” My father took a relieved breath after the thin prisoner slackened. He grabbed the prisoner’s handcuffs from behind, then he and Dahlgren pushed both prisoners toward the castle with the dogs at their heels.

I was left alone with the corpse on the ground, the one they called Eugen. I wondered why he had been shot and what it meant that my father had been shot at too. Desperate for answers, I followed them inside.

My father locked the castle’s double doors once I slipped through. “Dahlgren, take Ballin downstairs.”

Dahlgren pulled the fat prisoner down a stairwell to what I knew was a basement prison. I had explored every corner of the castle over the past two days and discovered the basement contained a row of wrought-iron jail cells.

The name my father mentioned rang a bell. ""Reich Minister of Finance Albert Ballin?” In the League, we learned the names of all the Nazi leadership.

My father responded with a nod, but a reluctant one, as if this was a conversation he dreaded. “Come with me.” 

He pulled the thin prisoner backward up the spiral stairwell. I followed him up through the second and third floors and into a single round turret above the roof, the castle's highest point. My next thought was that this was a SS operation, perhaps a prisoner interrogation, a possibility my father denied. I was confused and frustrated. Had Albert Ballin, a longtime confidante of Hitler, betrayed him? And why was my father being so vague with all his answers?

The turret chamber was circular and split in half by a brick wall with a thick steel door at its center. At the middle of the door was a one-foot-square opening with a set of bars. This cell looked far more secure than those in the basement.

I approached the cell. A face appeared in the opening behind the bars, one well-known to the whole world. The implication of seeing him here and now made me feel ill. I looked into the blazing eyes of the Führer, Adolf Hitler. A piece of tape covered his mouth. I reached for it instinctively.

“No, don’t!” my father shouted. It was too late.

It all came fluttering back to me. I felt as if I was fourteen years old at Berlin Central Park again. The emotions he stirred in me then had never left.

The Exorcism of Adolf Hitler [Part 1] The Angel,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/mre4zv/the_exorcism_of_adolf_hitler_part_1_the_angel/,the_brabazon,1,2021-04-15 20:59:45,1,/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/mre4zv/the_exorcism_of_adolf_hitler_part_1_the_angel/,NaN,"I am one of over ninety thousand centenarians living in the United States in the year 2021 and I have a terrible secret. I never imagined living to the age of one hundred when I was a girl. It’s an awfully long time to hold onto a secret, especially one like this. I don’t know how much longer I have left, but I don’t want to spend it carrying this burden alone. I have a responsibility to share it, a promise I have neglected for far too long. If I am to be believed, then I hope the world will view history in a different light. But this requires the context of a story and knowledge of the brave people involved. 

I escaped from Europe in the bellies of freight trains and in steerage on a dilapidated ocean liner at the dawn of the Second World War. I evacuated to America with forged documents and under an alias that remains my legal name to this day. But that name does not matter here. My real name is Bruna Stengel and I was born in Berlin in 1920. 

My father was a Nazi. Most of our parents were in those days and it never struck us as unusual. He found National Socialism after my mother died when I was still a baby. It may be more correct to say it found him because that is what the Nazi Party’s founders did in the early days. They preyed on those who had lost everything and needed answers but sold them lies instead. As the 1930s came and wore on, my father demonstrated his ability to organize and control and was rewarded with rank, power, and a view behind the curtain. It was this view that allowed him to see how things inside The Third Reich were more sinister than the German people realized. He saw something terrifying the rest of Hitler’s inner circle could not and he knew he alone had a chance to alter Germany’s dangerous course.

My story starts on a picturesque afternoon in the spring of 1934 because this day was the last time I saw the angel. I was fourteen years old and a proud member of the *Bund Deutscher Madel*—the League of German Girls. The Hitler Youth was for molding boys into obedient fighting men. Fighting was not something party leaders thought girls could do. Our youth wing was the League and in it we went camping, learned songs, dance, gymnastics, and how to be homemakers. We aspired to one day earn the Mother's Cross. A bronze one was issued to a woman who birthed five children, six earned her a cross made of silver, and eight earned her gold. We were growing our race and doing so married to a handsome SS officer was considered the highest ideal. We were not individuals, we were instruments, each and every one of us alike. It was indoctrination, though we were not wise to it then.

I squinted in the afternoon sunlight through the lenses of a gas mask on that spring day in Berlin Central Park. The two-dozen teenaged League girls around me wore gas masks too. They were a strange accessory atop our black leotards, but they had a purpose. Our bodies swayed in unison as we performed a synchronized dance we had practiced for weeks. Our troupe leader, a brutish, middle-aged woman whose name I don’t recall, monitored us as we split into two lines. She did not wear a gas mask.

I snuck a look to the side to gauge my distance from the girl nearest to me. I knew the routine but seeing through the mask was difficult. I hoped my troupe leader hadn’t noticed. I was doing well. I was less coordinated than the other girls, still a few years away from growing into my frame, and it reflected in my level of confidence. I was quieter and less sure of myself than they were. But I had practiced so diligently, taking extra time on my own, that I knew I had mastered the routine. Even the motion picture director filming us for propaganda reels hadn’t unnerved me. 

But then I saw my angel. It appeared on a low, distant hill across the park. I had seen the angel many times before. Sometimes it appeared in a moment of need. I would find it when I grieved over seeing my father so little or having never known my mother at all. Other times it came as a blatant distraction as if it wanted to remind me that it served an agenda other than my own. I never saw it in full or up close. I'd see a face in a window, a silhouette in the fog, or hear the flap of a wing in the dark of night, but never all together. I had the strange distinction of being intimately familiar with it, yet I had no idea what it looked like. This time would be different. I knew I could see it clearly if only I took off that gas mask.

I went still and broke from the routine. The other girls continued, uncertain how to react when one of us deviated. Then I pulled off my mask. At a distance, the angel looked luminous, yet it was already fading. I saw only a nondescript human figure. Then something unfolded from its back. It was rare that I got to see the angel's wings.

“Bruna, you have wasted our director’s take. Is something wrong?” My troupe leader blocked my view of the angel.

“Do you see that?” I asked, pointing to the angel. 

She looked but didn’t react. “Why did you take off your gas mask?” She must not have seen it.

I was now embarrassed, regretting my decision. “Please I—I’m sorry. I thought I saw something.”

“This isn’t helpful. You know why we wear our masks don’t you?” She waited, her exacting eyes piercing mine. I thought she looked nothing like the pure, natural women we were told to be. The other girls giggled at me under their gas masks. 

Another girl replied, shouting through her mask. “To make powerful images for the Führer’s films!”

My troupe leader nodded. “Correct. But why cover our faces? Bruna this time.”

“To create a feeling of oneness…” I knew it was the correct response. Looking down at my gas mask, I wished to never see my angel again. I was getting older. The pressure to conform was too great and telling others I had an angel didn’t help. Plus, I had new thoughts and goals now. It was time that I drew strength from the system instead. I put the gas mask back on.

“Very good. Now start again.” Her demeanor changed completely. We resumed. This time I blended in. I no longer felt alone. It felt like my League troupe moved through me. We did two more takes until the director was satisfied. 

I saw an entourage approaching from across the park. They all wore the same gray or brown suits with thick, red bands around their left arms my father always wore. The director and troupe leader turned around and held their hands high in their stiffest Nazi salutes. 

In the center of the group stood Adolf Hitler. The Chancellor. *The Führer.* I couldn’t believe it. I had never seen him up close before. I knew other party ministers' children who had met him, but my father had never given me the privilege. He was average height and slight of build, but he carried himself with the presence of an Olympic strong man or film star. He was young for a head of state then, only forty-four, and every woman in Germany knew well he was still a bachelor.

Of all the girls in my troupe, he walked up to me. I was so awestruck I forgot to remove my gas mask. Hitler did it for me, lifting the mask to expose my young face.

“What pretty, young girls sprout from our German soil.” His voice was gruff but calm, different than how I had heard it on radio and film reels. His eyes were hypnotic. I tingled as I looked into them. Then he moved on from me. “Off with your masks. Let me see you!”

The other girls tossed their gas masks aside and swarmed him, pushing me to the outside. They fawned and swooned over him. He was everything we were supposed to admire. It seems impossible to understand the emotions Hitler stirred in us. We were more innocent and naïve in those days and never had access to information of our own the way later generations would. All that we knew came from the party, packaged and delivered by radio stations and newspapers under the party’s thumb. The Hitler they told us about was one of their products like any other.

Photographers from Hitler’s entourage staged us around him. The same type of picture I had grown to admire in the newspapers was now being created in front of me. Now it was our turn to be by his side and we would be the ones others admired and envied. “If only I could get closer,” I thought, craning my neck from the outside, hoping to make it into the frame.

“Wait! Her. Yes, her! Put her in front.” I realized it was me the photographer was referring to. Before I could react, a set of hands grabbed my arms and moved me in front of the girls who had laughed at me only moments ago. I looked up and the Führer glanced down, placing a firm hand on my shoulder. He looked back to the camera, but I could not look away from him. “Face here!” The photographer’s words startled me again. I followed his voice to the camera and smiled.

It would be four more years before I saw the Führer or the angel again. I was eighteen and a fresh graduate of the League of German Girls. I was a young woman now and a graceful dancer and gymnast. I had finally grown into my body and I could see the men around me starting to notice. “I’m the only daughter of Interior Minister Stengel,” I told myself. “The party and society will want to open doors for me.” But in secret, I was directionless. I wanted to lead and make a difference, not for the sake of power, but to set an example and be more than just the recipient of some bronze cross. 

There were a few women in high positions. I thought of Magda Goebbels or Lina Heydrich, but they were wives of powerful men. I thought I could settle for that, yet I also thought of Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the highest-ranking woman in Germany, and Leni Riefenstahl, the filmmaker. Yes, those were the women I wanted to be like. But while the SS officers, *Luftwaffe* pilots, and other aspirational young men noticed me, they also left me alone and I didn’t know why. Maybe my wandering mind was the problem. I decided I would do best to find my answers within the party.

I found myself at this crossroads one gray afternoon in March of 1938, looking out at Germany’s Black Forest from a third-floor window in Falkenhayn Castle. It was a sad sort of castle, only four stories tall, built of brick, with squat proportions and mundane roof spires. It would be dwarfed by the great architect Speer’s new Reich Chancellery back in Berlin, I thought. 

I didn’t know why my father had sent me here two days before to be watched over by the old woman who was the castle’s caretaker and only other occupant. Her name was Eloise and that was all she allowed me to know. The only thing I could think of was that Falkenhayn Castle might have been selected as a remote site for a secret meeting among party leaders. Perhaps now I would get my formal introduction to the inner circle. But if it were so secret, why would I, a fresh League of German Girls graduate, be permitted? I had spent the last two days trying to figure it out. Eloise told me nothing, but I was convinced she knew. 

I watched for headlights and listened for the sound of the car carrying my father. He told me he would explain everything once he arrived. I did not have to wait long. I caught a flicker of yellow light through the trees. Then a gray sedan drove off the dirt road into the clearing surrounding the castle. It was a rough sort of car used by soldiers of the German Army, the *Wehrmacht,* not a black Mercedes-Benz officials like my father rode in. But my father it was, given away by the dark brown homburg hat he always wore. He leaped out of the driver’s seat and ran around to the other side. I moved to another window to watch as he pulled a man out from the passenger door and lowered him to the ground. I could see blood on the man’s clothing and there were bullet holes in the car door. My anticipation dissipated, replaced by a plaguing concern that wrenched my stomach and would not leave me for days. What had my father gotten involved in? 

My father crouched over the bleeding man, though I couldn’t see what he was doing. My father stood up, but the man remained on the ground. I waited for him to sit up, for my father to lend him his hand and pull him to his feet, but it never came. I stopped breathing when I realized the man was dead. I had never seen a dead person before. 

I watched my father open the trunk. He dragged another man out through the opening and dumped him on the damp ground. This man was handcuffed and his head was bound and covered in a burlap sack. I could only imagine he was some kind of political prisoner. But then why would my father be transporting him? A pair of dogs started barking two floors below, snapping me out of my bewildered trance and reminding me to breathe. I followed their sound downstairs.

Diamond and Prinz, two large Rottweilers Eloise said belonged to an associate of my father, pawed at the heavy double doors in the castle entryway. They had been my companions over the past two days and they were glad for the attention as Eloise did little besides pour their food twice a day. But now my two new friends were snarling and leaving scratch marks on the doors. I reached between them and unbolted the lock. They forced the doors open and ran out to the clearing.

The dogs continued to bark at my father and his prisoner. “Diamond, Prinz, stop!” I tried to quiet them as I approached, but there was no stopping their protective instincts. “Father, what’s going on?”

My father, Werner Stengel, Reich Minister of the Interior, looked up from the prisoner with an expression that told me he had all but forgotten I was there. “Stay back, Bruna!” He had to shout to make himself heard over the dogs’ incessant barking. He was forty-five, with hair starting to thin and these grave, contemplative eyes that suggested a lifetime of tough decisions constantly weighing on him. Blood stained the sleeve of his brown suit jacket, matching his red swastika armband. 

“Are you alright?” I asked, noticing the stain.

“The blood isn’t mine, it’s Eugen’s,” he lamented, eying the man lying dead on the ground.

Another gray sedan emerged from the forest and slowed to a stop beside us. A young man dressed in the all-black uniform of a SS officer stepped out. We made instant and lingering eye contact. He was certainly handsome, probably twenty-five or twenty-six, and wore the rank of *Obersturmführer.* This was a man on the rise yet not high-up enough to have much to lose, I thought. I had met other young officers of his mold. I thought they were arrogant, but something always drew me to them. His badge displayed the name, ‘Dahlgren.’ We both realized we were staring and looked away. The dogs gave us a reprieve, bounding up to him, their barks turning excited and playful. 

“Guys, down! Down! Shhhhhh. I know, I’m happy to see you too.” 

My father spoke up. “Dahlgren, were you shot?”

“No. Were you?”

“No, but Eugen was. One caught him back at the Berghof.”

Dahlgren eyed Eugen’s body. His mood sank. “Then what are we going to do?”

My father tried hard to project a sense of steely calm. “We proceed.”

Dahlgren seemed almost annoyed. “You said we needed him.” 

“I’ll figure it out… Where did we lose Klaus?”

“I lost sight of his car a few kilometers outside Obersalzberg.” 

I had no idea what they were talking about. I took it all in, afraid to wade into the matter. We all heard a kicking sound coming from the trunk of Dahlgren’s car. He opened the lid and pulled out a second prisoner, fatter than the first, also handcuffed and covered by a burlap sack.

Dahlgren’s eyes met mine again. “Is this your daughter?”

“Indeed, she is. And I recall telling her to remain in the castle—"" my father cut himself off. The first prisoner had climbed to his feet and stood defiantly at my father's ear as if goading him. My father lurched and side-stepped in startlement. Diamond and Prinz barked, spittle flying off their gums. Whoever this prisoner was, something about him provoked the dogs’ ire. It worried me. 

“Father, please, what’s going on?” 

The first prisoner straightened up at the sound of my voice. His head swiveled toward me. The dogs went silent. My confusion gave way to a sense of unease. “Why do the dogs fear him?” I wondered. “Should I?”

I suddenly felt a twinge of what may have upset them. My ears rang and I was overcome with nausea. My skin grew ice cold. I felt like I had fallen, struck my head, and come down with food poisoning and fever chills all at once. My father winced. I was sure he felt it too, though he seemed to be hiding it. Dahlgren didn’t seem to notice anything at all. 

Then as suddenly as it came on, the sensation passed. I wondered if I had imagined it.

“Get them inside right now.” My father took a relieved breath after the thin prisoner slackened. He grabbed the prisoner’s handcuffs from behind, then he and Dahlgren pushed both prisoners toward the castle with the dogs at their heels.

I was left alone with the corpse on the ground, the one they called Eugen. I wondered why he had been shot and what it meant that my father had been shot at too. Desperate for answers, I followed them inside.

My father locked the castle’s double doors once I slipped through. “Dahlgren, take Ballin downstairs.”

Dahlgren pulled the fat prisoner down a stairwell to what I knew was a basement prison. I had explored every corner of the castle over the past two days and discovered the basement contained a row of wrought-iron jail cells.

The name my father mentioned rang a bell. ""Reich Minister of Finance Albert Ballin?” In the League, we learned the names of all the Nazi leadership.

My father responded with a nod, but a reluctant one, as if this was a conversation he dreaded. “Come with me.” 

He pulled the thin prisoner backward up the spiral stairwell. I followed him up through the second and third floors and into a single round turret above the roof, the castle's highest point. My next thought was that this was a SS operation, perhaps a prisoner interrogation, a possibility my father denied. I was confused and frustrated. Had Albert Ballin, a longtime confidante of Hitler, betrayed him? And why was my father being so vague with all his answers?

The turret chamber was circular and split in half by a brick wall with a thick steel door at its center. At the middle of the door was a one-foot-square opening with a set of bars. This cell looked far more secure than those in the basement. 

My father held the prisoner in place by the handcuffs and shot me a grave look. “I don’t expect you to understand this at first. I only ask that you trust me. The rest will be clear soon. Now stand back.”

At eighteen, I was not one to accept my father's word on blind faith, but at this moment I was too nervous to do anything else. I stepped back to the wall. My father opened the steel door with a brass key and walked the prisoner inside. He jammed his boot into the back of the prisoner's leg to bring him to his knees, then removed the burlap sack. I caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man from behind. Even with what little I saw, there was no doubt who it was. There was no mistaking him, but I still couldn’t believe it. My father backed out of the cell, shut the steel door, and locked it with the brass key.

I stammered. “Is it—? It’s not—""

My father’s words resonated. “It is.”

I approached the cell. A face appeared in the opening behind the bars, one well-known to the whole world. The implication of seeing him here and now made me feel ill. I looked into the blazing eyes of the Führer, Adolf Hitler. A piece of tape covered his mouth. I reached for it instinctively.

“No, don’t!” my father shouted. It was too late.

I pulled off the tape and Hitler spoke. “Stengel, why have you deprived us of your lovely daughter for so long?”

It all came fluttering back to me. I felt as if I was fourteen years old at Berlin Central Park again. The emotions he stirred in me then had never left.

My father stepped in. “Bruna, get out. Don’t let him talk to you.”

“Your father’s a religious maniac!” Hitler shouted back. “He thinks I’m possessed by a demon!”

“What?” I could hardly comprehend everything that was happening. I protested as my father darted in and pulled me away. “Wait, stop! What have you done?”

Hitler continued. “Listen to me, fräulein, he’s a traitor to me, to you, and to all of Germany.”

My father pulled me to the stairwell. “Don’t believe anything he says to you.”

“You put her in danger, Stengel! Do you even care for her?”

My father slammed the wooden door to the turret chamber, muffling Hitler’s voice. He saw I was shaking and guided me down to the third floor.

I pleaded with him. “Please tell me it isn’t true.”

“I’m afraid it is.”

“But how can Hitler be possessed?”

“Eloise and I will explain everything shortly. There is going to be an exorcism.”

“But you’re not even a priest anymore.” I now doubted every word my father said. I heard each sentence as if it were that of a mad man.

“I know. I’ve made some terrible choices and I’m doing everything I can to atone for them now, but this is not one of them.”

“Why did you bring me here?”

“Berlin is no longer safe for you. The Nazis know only that I’ve disappeared along with him, but that still makes me a suspect. You're the first one they'd come for."" Whether he had gone mad or not, I could tell he believed every word he spoke.

“And they won’t find us here?” 

“Dahlgren and I have planned for that. Albert Ballin will be the patsy.”

I was incredulous. I saw my dreams evaporating before me. “I just graduated! You said you’d help me be whatever I wanted to be. You said I could be the Reich’s first female minister!”

“Because if we succeed it will be a very different Reich. The Nazis aren’t what you think they are. He’s going to start a war.”

This seemed preposterous to me. Hitler’s policies had brought only pride and prosperity to us up to then. “A war? Why would you say that?”

“Look at the signs. His political opponents are in camps, Jews are losing their rights, he’s seizing sovereign territories, growing the army in violation of treaties. What do you think it means?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why do you insist on not thinking for yourself?” 

I didn’t know what to say back. He saw how it wounded me and I knew I had disappointed him. I needed to be alone. I ran down the stairwell, almost bumping into Eloise and nearly spilling the tea kettle she was carrying. I paused halfway down to the next floor, curious to hear what my father and Eloise said to each other. They couldn't see me around the curve of the stairwell.

“You should have let me prepare her,” Eloise started. 

“She’s too indoctrinated. I couldn’t take that risk.”

“So were you not too many years ago.”

“I was a grown man. I knew the world before this. Bruna is young. This is all she knows.”

""Without Father Eugen, you're going to need her. If you want her to understand, tonight is all the time you’ll have… Werner, sit, please. You’ve had an exhausting day. I brought your tea.”

I could hear the tea kettle clanging against the serving tray. I had previously noticed how Eloise’s hands often shook uncontrollably. She tried to hide it, but I caught it happening several times.

My father remarked on it as well. “And what about you? Has it gotten worse?” 

The clanging stopped. She must have set down the kettle. “I could sense him getting nearer all afternoon and it got worse once you arrived with him. This demon is powerful, Werner, I can feel it.”

“Have you been able to prepare the materials?”

“Shame on you. I’m old, not useless. Now drink your tea before it gets any colder. I’m not making it again.” 

Eloise and my father spoke like old friends, but he had never spoken of her to me. She was much older than him and said the kinds of things no one dared say to a party minister. I knew little about my father’s time as a priest in the years before I was born. That was a different life he had always kept separate from me. This strange woman must have been a part of it. I couldn't understand how they thought I was indoctrinated. I said the same things our party leaders, newspapers, industrialists, and teachers did. If they were all in agreement, who was my father to start questioning them? It seemed so obvious to me. Wouldn’t that make him wrong?

Photographers from Hitler’s entourage staged us around him. The same type of picture I had grown to admire in the newspapers was now being created in front of me. Now it was our turn to be by his side and we would be the ones others admired and envied. “If only I could get closer,” I thought, craning my neck from the outside, hoping to make it into the frame.

“Wait! Her. Yes, her! Put her in front.” I realized it was me the photographer was referring to. Before I could react, a set of hands grabbed my arms and moved me in front of the girls who had laughed at me only moments ago. I looked up and the Führer glanced down, placing a firm hand on my shoulder. He looked back to the camera, but I could not look away from him. “Face here!” The photographer’s words startled me again. I followed his voice to the camera and smiled.

It would be four more years before I saw the Führer or the angel again. I was eighteen and a fresh graduate of the League of German Girls. I was a young woman now and a graceful dancer and gymnast. I had finally grown into my body and I could see the men around me starting to notice. “I’m the only daughter of Interior Minister Stengel,” I told myself. “The party and society will want to open doors for me.” But in secret, I was directionless. I wanted to lead and make a difference, not for the sake of power, but to set an example and be more than just the recipient of some bronze cross. 

There were a few women in high positions. I thought of Magda Goebbels or Lina Heydrich, but they were wives of powerful men. I thought I could settle for that, yet I also thought of Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the highest-ranking woman in Germany, and Leni Riefenstahl, the filmmaker. Yes, those were the women I wanted to be like. But while the SS officers, *Luftwaffe* pilots, and other aspirational young men noticed me, they also left me alone and I didn’t know why. Maybe my wandering mind was the problem. I decided I would do best to find my answers within the party.

I found myself at this crossroads one gray afternoon in March of 1938, looking out at Germany’s Black Forest from a third-floor window in Falkenhayn Castle. It was a sad sort of castle, only four stories tall, built of brick, with squat proportions and mundane roof spires. It would be dwarfed by the great architect Speer’s new Reich Chancellery back in Berlin, I thought. 

I didn’t know why my father had sent me here two days before to be watched over by the old woman who was the castle’s caretaker and only other occupant. Her name was Eloise and that was all she allowed me to know. The only thing I could think of was that Falkenhayn Castle might have been selected as a remote site for a secret meeting among party leaders. Perhaps now I would get my formal introduction to the inner circle. But if it were so secret, why would I, a fresh League of German Girls graduate, be permitted? I had spent the last two days trying to figure it out. Eloise told me nothing, but I was convinced she knew. 

I watched for headlights and listened for the sound of the car carrying my father. He told me he would explain everything once he arrived. I did not have to wait long. I caught a flicker of yellow light through the trees. Then a gray sedan drove off the dirt road into the clearing surrounding the castle. It was a rough sort of car used by soldiers of the German Army, the *Wehrmacht,* not a black Mercedes-Benz officials like my father rode in. But my father it was, given away by the dark brown homburg hat he always wore. He leaped out of the driver’s seat and ran around to the other side. I moved to another window to watch as he pulled a man out from the passenger door and lowered him to the ground. I could see blood on the man’s clothing and there were bullet holes in the car door. My anticipation dissipated, replaced by a plaguing concern that wrenched my stomach and would not leave me for days. What had my father gotten involved in? 

My father crouched over the bleeding man, though I couldn’t see what he was doing. My father stood up, but the man remained on the ground. I waited for him to sit up, for my father to lend him his hand and pull him to his feet, but it never came. I stopped breathing when I realized the man was dead. I had never seen a dead person before. 

I watched my father open the trunk. He dragged another man out through the opening and dumped him on the damp ground. This man was handcuffed and his head was bound and covered in a burlap sack. I could only imagine he was some kind of political prisoner. But then why would my father be transporting him? A pair of dogs started barking two floors below, snapping me out of my bewildered trance and reminding me to breathe. I followed their sound downstairs.

Diamond and Prinz, two large Rottweilers Eloise said belonged to an associate of my father, pawed at the heavy double doors in the castle entryway. They had been my companions over the past two days and they were glad for the attention as Eloise did little besides pour their food twice a day. But now my two new friends were snarling and leaving scratch marks on the doors. I reached between them and unbolted the lock. They forced the doors open and ran out to the clearing.

The dogs continued to bark at my father and his prisoner. “Diamond, Prinz, stop!” I tried to quiet them as I approached, but there was no stopping their protective instincts. “Father, what’s going on?”

My father, Werner Stengel, Reich Minister of the Interior, looked up from the prisoner with an expression that told me he had all but forgotten I was there. “Stay back, Bruna!” He had to shout to make himself heard over the dogs’ incessant barking. He was forty-five, with hair starting to thin and these grave, contemplative eyes that suggested a lifetime of tough decisions constantly weighing on him. Blood stained the sleeve of his brown suit jacket, matching his red swastika armband. 

“Are you alright?” I asked, noticing the stain.

“The blood isn’t mine, it’s Eugen’s,” he lamented, eying the man lying dead on the ground.

Another gray sedan emerged from the forest and slowed to a stop beside us. A young man dressed in the all-black uniform of a SS officer stepped out. We made instant and lingering eye contact. He was certainly handsome, probably twenty-five or twenty-six, and wore the rank of *Obersturmführer.* This was a man on the rise yet not high-up enough to have much to lose, I thought. I had met other young officers of his mold. I thought they were arrogant, but something always drew me to them. His badge displayed the name, ‘Dahlgren.’ We both realized we were staring and looked away. The dogs gave us a reprieve, bounding up to him, their barks turning excited and playful. 

“Guys, down! Down! Shhhhhh. I know, I’m happy to see you too.” 

My father spoke up. “Dahlgren, were you shot?”

“No. Were you?”

“No, but Eugen was. One caught him back at the Berghof.”

Dahlgren eyed Eugen’s body. His mood sank. “Then what are we going to do?”

My father tried hard to project a sense of steely calm. “We proceed.”

Dahlgren seemed almost annoyed. “You said we needed him.” 

“I’ll figure it out… Where did we lose Klaus?”

“I lost sight of his car a few kilometers outside Obersalzberg.” 

I had no idea what they were talking about. I took it all in, afraid to wade into the matter. We all heard a kicking sound coming from the trunk of Dahlgren’s car. He opened the lid and pulled out a second prisoner, fatter than the first, also handcuffed and covered by a burlap sack.

Dahlgren’s eyes met mine again. “Is this your daughter?”

“Indeed, she is. And I recall telling her to remain in the castle—"" my father cut himself off. The first prisoner had climbed to his feet and stood defiantly at my father's ear as if goading him. My father lurched and side-stepped in startlement. Diamond and Prinz barked, spittle flying off their gums. Whoever this prisoner was, something about him provoked the dogs’ ire. It worried me. 

“Father, please, what’s going on?” 

The first prisoner straightened up at the sound of my voice. His head swiveled toward me. The dogs went silent. My confusion gave way to a sense of unease. “Why do the dogs fear him?” I wondered. “Should I?”

I suddenly felt a twinge of what may have upset them. My ears rang and I was overcome with nausea. My skin grew ice cold. I felt like I had fallen, struck my head, and come down with food poisoning and fever chills all at once. My father winced. I was sure he felt it too, though he seemed to be hiding it. Dahlgren didn’t seem to notice anything at all. 

Then as suddenly as it came on, the sensation passed. I wondered if I had imagined it.

“Get them inside right now.” My father took a relieved breath after the thin prisoner slackened. He grabbed the prisoner’s handcuffs from behind, then he and Dahlgren pushed both prisoners toward the castle with the dogs at their heels.

I was left alone with the corpse on the ground, the one they called Eugen. I wondered why he had been shot and what it meant that my father had been shot at too. Desperate for answers, I followed them inside.

My father locked the castle’s double doors once I slipped through. “Dahlgren, take Ballin downstairs.”

Dahlgren pulled the fat prisoner down a stairwell to what I knew was a basement prison. I had explored every corner of the castle over the past two days and discovered the basement contained a row of wrought-iron jail cells.

The name my father mentioned rang a bell. ""Reich Minister of Finance Albert Ballin?” In the League, we learned the names of all the Nazi leadership.

My father responded with a nod, but a reluctant one, as if this was a conversation he dreaded. “Come with me.” 

He pulled the thin prisoner backward up the spiral stairwell. I followed him up through the second and third floors and into a single round turret above the roof, the castle's highest point. My next thought was that this was a SS operation, perhaps a prisoner interrogation, a possibility my father denied. I was confused and frustrated. Had Albert Ballin, a longtime confidante of Hitler, betrayed him? And why was my father being so vague with all his answers?

The turret chamber was circular and split in half by a brick wall with a thick steel door at its center. At the middle of the door was a one-foot-square opening with a set of bars. This cell looked far more secure than those in the basement. 

My father held the prisoner in place by the handcuffs and shot me a grave look. “I don’t expect you to understand this at first. I only ask that you trust me. The rest will be clear soon. Now stand back.”

At eighteen, I was not one to accept my father's word on blind faith, but at this moment I was too nervous to do anything else. I stepped back to the wall. My father opened the steel door with a brass key and walked the prisoner inside. He jammed his boot into the back of the prisoner's leg to bring him to his knees, then removed the burlap sack. I caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man from behind. Even with what little I saw, there was no doubt who it was. There was no mistaking him, but I still couldn’t believe it. My father backed out of the cell, shut the steel door, and locked it with the brass key.

I stammered. “Is it—? It’s not—""

My father’s words resonated. “It is.”

I approached the cell. A face appeared in the opening behind the bars, one well-known to the whole world. The implication of seeing him here and now made me feel ill. I looked into the blazing eyes of the Führer, Adolf Hitler. A piece of tape covered his mouth. I reached for it instinctively.

“No, don’t!” my father shouted. It was too late.

I pulled off the tape and Hitler spoke. “Stengel, why have you deprived us of your lovely daughter for so long?”

It all came fluttering back to me. I felt as if I was fourteen years old at Berlin Central Park again. The emotions he stirred in me then had never left.

My father stepped in. “Bruna, get out. Don’t let him talk to you.”

“Your father’s a religious maniac!” Hitler shouted back. “He thinks I’m possessed by a demon!”

“What?” I could hardly comprehend everything that was happening. I protested as my father darted in and pulled me away. “Wait, stop! What have you done?”

Hitler continued. “Listen to me, fräulein, he’s a traitor to me, to you, and to all of Germany.”

My father pulled me to the stairwell. “Don’t believe anything he says to you.”

“You put her in danger, Stengel! Do you even care for her?”

My father slammed the wooden door to the turret chamber, muffling Hitler’s voice. He saw I was shaking and guided me down to the third floor.

I pleaded with him. “Please tell me it isn’t true.”

“I’m afraid it is.”

“But how can Hitler be possessed?”

“Eloise and I will explain everything shortly. There is going to be an exorcism.”

“But you’re not even a priest anymore.” I now doubted every word my father said. I heard each sentence as if it were that of a mad man.

“I know. I’ve made some terrible choices and I’m doing everything I can to atone for them now, but this is not one of them.”

“Why did you bring me here?”

“Berlin is no longer safe for you. The Nazis know only that I’ve disappeared along with him, but that still makes me a suspect. You're the first one they'd come for."" Whether he had gone mad or not, I could tell he believed every word he spoke.

“And they won’t find us here?” 

“Dahlgren and I have planned for that. Albert Ballin will be the patsy.”

I was incredulous. I saw my dreams evaporating before me. “I just graduated! You said you’d help me be whatever I wanted to be. You said I could be the Reich’s first female minister!”

“Because if we succeed it will be a very different Reich. The Nazis aren’t what you think they are. He’s going to start a war.”

This seemed preposterous to me. Hitler’s policies had brought only pride and prosperity to us up to then. “A war? Why would you say that?”

“Look at the signs. His political opponents are in camps, Jews are losing their rights, he’s seizing sovereign territories, growing the army in violation of treaties. What do you think it means?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why do you insist on not thinking for yourself?” 

I didn’t know what to say back. He saw how it wounded me and I knew I had disappointed him. I needed to be alone. I ran down the stairwell, almost bumping into Eloise and nearly spilling the tea kettle she was carrying. I paused halfway down to the next floor, curious to hear what my father and Eloise said to each other. They couldn't see me around the curve of the stairwell.

“You should have let me prepare her,” Eloise started. 

“She’s too indoctrinated. I couldn’t take that risk.”

“So were you not too many years ago.”

“I was a grown man. I knew the world before this. Bruna is young. This is all she knows.”

""Without Father Eugen, you're going to need her. If you want her to understand, tonight is all the time you’ll have… Werner, sit, please. You’ve had an exhausting day. I brought your tea.”

I could hear the tea kettle clanging against the serving tray. I had previously noticed how Eloise’s hands often shook uncontrollably. She tried to hide it, but I caught it happening several times.

My father remarked on it as well. “And what about you? Has it gotten worse?” 

The clanging stopped. She must have set down the kettle. “I could sense him getting nearer all afternoon and it got worse once you arrived with him. This demon is powerful, Werner, I can feel it.”

“Have you been able to prepare the materials?”

“Shame on you. I’m old, not useless. Now drink your tea before it gets any colder. I’m not making it again.” 

Eloise and my father spoke like old friends, but he had never spoken of her to me. She was much older than him and said the kinds of things no one dared say to a party minister. I knew little about my father’s time as a priest in the years before I was born. That was a different life he had always kept separate from me. This strange woman must have been a part of it. I couldn't understand how they thought I was indoctrinated. I said the same things our party leaders, newspapers, industrialists, and teachers did. If they were all in agreement, who was my father to start questioning them? It seemed so obvious to me. Wouldn’t that make him wrong?

Back before the WEF declared the Great Reset to usher in the Forth Industrial Revolution. Even before they decided to Build Back Better. We had someone who claimed to work in finance say this:    


&gt;Now for the bad part. They are expecting this thing to mutate further. Those results from the Australian lab are not good. This virus has a very high propensity to mutate into a highly lethal form and WHO is predicting a fairly probable likelihood that if it reaches certain bat populations in Brazil that it can jump to a 15% lethality rate. That means that the minute you hear about Rio or Brasilia or wherever reporting cases you need to immediately make sure you've got a month worth of supplies because it's going to start killing many millions of people. So far as people like WHO are concerned who deal with numbers like that all the time this isn't major and they're more concerned about lying to you that everything is not that bad because their calculus is that more people will die from refusing to seek medical treatment for anything from cancer to heart disease or other illnesses from hysteria over getting infected with this nCoV. [Source Here](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/241674007)     

He also claimed that he had friends who worked at the CDC and the WHO. People lost their minds about that post. And then slowly, most people forgot about that post and started posting about Wayfair. Or they went back to posting about Q. And the post was largely forgotten. But should it have been?    


Probably not. Why? Let me explain.    


The submission was posted on January 30, 2020. That was after all the videos of Chinese people dropping dead on the streets, but before any of us actually realized that the New Normal was right around the corner.     


The first confirmed case in the USA was reported on January 30, and was also  first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus. So in the grand scheme of things, I don't fault anyone for claiming a hoax on the post. Becsuse nothing had happened yet. So then the question becomes, why would someone make a post about how much Covid-19 mutates, and warn us to have stockpiles of food if the virus hits Brazil. Does that sound like a logical post that someone wrote back when this was all starting? Nope. Not at all. And how did they randomly pick Brazil? Because seriously, that doesn't make any sense at all. We hadn't heard anything about the virus mutating. The word lockdown wasn't even a part of our lexicon yet. And yet, here we are. 


**A new variant of coronavirus that combines 18 mutations has been detected as one of the world's worst-hit countries exceeds 4,000 deaths in a single 24-hour period.** [Source Here](https://au.sports.yahoo.com/new-variant-discovered-in-covid-ravaged-country-011601165.html)       


That's kind of strange, isn't it? So how on earth did this get predicted back in January 2020? Because I have a hard believing that this was all just a joke. And according to him we are about to get dropped into the beginning stages of 12 Monkeys. But do you want to see something really strange going on? Of course you do! 

#Ottawa drops specific COVID-19 screening for travellers from Brazil as variant spreads throughout British Columbia
[Source Here](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-ottawa-eases-travel-restrictions-as-covid-19-variants-spread/)   

What. Is. Going. On? Honest question. Have they realized that enough of the population is too stupefied to even utilize basic logic that they aren't even trying to hide it now? 

&gt;It's a stance that is garnering some criticism, given that he just got rid of specific COVID-19 screening for passengers coming in from Brazil, the home of one of the new variants of concern, and continues to let non-residents into the country while other nations have greatly benefited from far stricter criteria for entrance.

Some criticism? Oh boy. Do you want criticism? Cause I can criticize. What about the restrictions being placed on all non essential travellers when the essential traffic at the American Canadian border makes up the majority of traffic. And guess what? Those restrictions don't apply to essential travellers. Yep. They can just cross the border no problem. Without a Covid-19 test. Just as long as they don't show any symptoms. Makes perfect sense  doesn't it?

Or how about the airports never having been shut down, you know, like Trudeau implied could happen just before the first lockdown.    


**Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged Canadians on Friday to cancel all vacation travel inside and outside the country, warning that the federal government could be forced to bring in travel restrictions that would make it harder for people to return home.       
“People should not be planning non-essential travel or vacation travel outside of the country,” Trudeau said, speaking at his COVID-19 briefing in Ottawa. “Particularly because as I said a few days ago, we could be bringing in new measures that significantly impede your ability to return to Canada at any given moment without warning.”** [Source Here](https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2021/01/22/trudeau-urges-canadians-to-cancel-all-holiday-travel-plans/)           


Ok. Lets move forward and get back on topic. The Brazil variant. You know, the one that Canada doesn't actually seem worried about but then you read this:      




#On Thursday, France suspended all flights to and from Brazil — joining countries like Argentina, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom who have all taken similar measures.    


So what good does it do to shut down flights to Brazil if they can still fly to Canada and then take a connecting flight somewhere else?     


**“It makes sense [to suspend flights] because it reduces connections,” Clément Beaune, the junior minister for European affairs, said on French television. He also acknowledged “there is no one perfect solution” and “some risk of bypassing” the rules.     
Travelers wanting to come to France can still layover in another Schengen country given not all other states in the free movement zone have suspended flights.** [Source Here](https://www.politico.eu/article/beaune-brazil-flight-suspension-effective-despite-schengen-loophole/)     


Perfect. Ban all flights, but don't ban anyone having recently visited Brazil. Shake. My. Head.    


So what to make of all of this? We had a conspiracy post out of left field warning us about Brazil, and then we have the dire warnings coming out of Brazil, and then we have countries enacting policies that don't make any sense. And more and more this isn't looking good at all, is it? Let me answer that for you, no it isn't.    


#Final Thoughts     


There's something happening here, what it is, ain't exactly clear. We know this for sure. We are being run around in circles, and I'm almost positive that it's on purpose. If you go back and read this series from the start, I have always maintained a couple of notions, the main one being, do your own reading. Don't rely on the herd, because that will only let you gain Herd Stupidity, not Herd Immunity. And the second notion that I maintained was too be careful. Why? Simple. Just because the numbers for the virus aren't adding up, doesn't mean that we aren't going to face a pandemic whose numbers do add up in the future. And trust me, I've questioned the numbers over and over again. I've read the statistics from the hospitals. And so far, it hasn't reached a level that has been commensurate with the level of reaction. But.

Those are a lot of field hospitals, aren't they? And they were all built rather recently. That alone should give us pause when taken in conjunction with the Brazil news and the conspiracy post from January 30, 2020.    


Look. I know. Trust me, I do. I don't trust the numbers that we've seen on the virus so far (more to the point, I don't like what the numbers are indicating so far, namely, how the mortality spikes for the elderly and those with disabilities, which I'll have a post about soon). I also definitely don't trust the limited testing done on the vaccine and the massive propoganda campaign that's gone along with it. Yet at the end of the day we have to remember one main point; they can manufacture whatever virus they want now in a lab. That's it. That's the bottom line. The first waves may have merely been to induce complacency just before the main event. Am I saying to run and hide in the woods? No. But I am saying, don't let any preconceived ideas affect your future judgement."
Private Charter (ENS-PCT),https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mrze9s/private_charter_enspct/,Shatter_Hand,1,2021-04-16 17:11:24,1,/r/ethereum/comments/mrze9s/private_charter_enspct/,NaN,"
It’s no wonder the attraction my cheap dad had for Ethereum when I explained to him what *fat protocol theory* is. For those that don’t know, it’s this: 

The internet is a protocol. *Value* moves from the protocol layer to its application layer. Google, Amazon, etcetera, are its applications. They’ve become very valuable over the years and quite frankly, show no signs of contracting. In cryptocurrency however, value flows in the opposite direction. It flows from the application layer, to the protocol. Thus the name: *fat protocol thesis.* It’s easy to imagine then, why Ethereum is positioned better than any other cryptocurrency because of what’s built on it. And I’ll posit, that if gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (2.0), it’s likely to make burnt toast of every crypto not ERC related (excluding stablecoins, bitcoin, and privacy coins), unless those protocols velvet fork into the Ethereum protocol. 

It’s no wonder he crossed his arms, spit on the ground, and calmly said: “Tell me more.”

I went on about the promise of DeFi a couple years forward. What are traditionally the margins (profits) of banks will become yours. Some already can be in a limited way for the savvy, but DeFi has way too much friction (this defined as the number of steps required to accomplish something). Consider the genesis of video streaming around 1996 (which is about where we are with Ethereum’s protocol). Think of the friction there. You needed:

 - to own a 56k modem
 - to download a tcp/icp client
 - to download a media player
 - to find the website
 - to add batch files

The more friction, the higher the learning curve. Fast-forward to today, and everyone carries a dozen video streaming options with them in their pocket, assuming there’s a smart phone there. Two-year-old children literally know how to use it. DeFi is unusable for the masses right now, this will equally change. 

Yeah my cheap dad. Now I wake up to text messages from him asking: “When is moon?”

Well, probably after Ethereum 2.0, and now that you’re oiled, I’d like to explain a concept to look forward to after the upgrades:

**—Private Charter (ENS-PCT)—**

Can you picture yourself a resurrection man covered in dirt working a shovel under the white glow of a single moonbeam? Barbaric I know. That was me once. I lost my login information, but luckily had etched my private keys on a metal card before burying it in a forest. Those days weren’t long ago. Neither were the days of writing shit on paper and stuffing it in a desk drawer. Or the best one I’ve come across which I called the *Victorian:* A fun friend of mine once kept his keys in a very expensive [highly secured] painting. They couldn’t be gotten to unless the painting was stolen, and scanned with special equipment. He had the painting insured for twice its appraisal value (two insurers aware of the double insurance, but not of the keys, who charged him triple premiums). Then bitcoin broke $10k and it wasn’t worth it. This *personage* persistently wore that little edge of a smile, hoping it would get jacked. He walked with an exotic wood cane and claimed to be related to Henry James the writer. This isn’t *Portrait of a Young Lady,* it’s crypto for chrissakes! Thankfully we’ve graduated to multisig wallets, and currently, social wallets, which Vitalik Buterin wrote a post on recently (link below). 

vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html


I don’t believe any of that is even close to where we need to get. I propose the ENS-PCT (Ethereum Name Service Private Contract).

ENS-PCT is a smart contract you own. You are the dapp. Money has become like language. You can have as many as you like, but when set up, they are immutable. From it you can do everything a bank does and more: make loans, take loans, equity swaps, sending, spending, leveraging global interest rates (assuming central banks roll out their own stablecoins), help finance a war (kidding kind of), provide liquidity and stake. The latter two are important because ostensibly, they’ll allow you to never have to spend your crypto. If you want to spend, you borrow central bank stablecoins against your collateral. Because this collateral is staked or LP’d, those rewards offset the borrowed interest rate, probably by a percentage point or more (back to taking those bank margins we talked about earlier). This makes central banks compete in a way they never have before to attract borrowers to their stablecoin. So you can shop around. Also keep in mind your collateral is intrinsically deflationary (assuming it’s BTC, ETH or something of quality). The legacy financial apparatus (centralized finance) will serve decentralized finance. And they’ll have to do a damn good job of it, one that incentivizes people quite well. I believe they will. If they don’t, then the coming atomic swap abilities with privacy coins (I’m especially talking about XMR) will serve as an excellent check and balance that can wreck havoc on taxes among other things.  

The ENS-PCT has a vault and wallet. From the vault, you can recall all funds from your wallet into the vault. After pressing send to send any coins out of the vault, there’s a countdown unless the transaction is cancelled by email or other secure means. These outbound coins however, can only be sent to say four immutable predetermined addresses, each of escalating security: 

 - a different ENS-PCT vault you set up for yourself
 - an insured centralized exchange (like Coinbase vault)
 - the IRS (US Treasury) who will issue a refund

Any outbound transactions are accompanied by an attached note embedded with your immutable information and instructions. Again, nothing can ever be changed after initial setup. If you don’t login within a two year period (or however long you choose, or whatever conditions you choose) any borrowing is automatically settled, all funds recalled from the wallet, and all contents sent to the **fourth** predetermined addressee, which we assume is the ENS-PCT vault belonging to your wife, your children, a charity, or the US Treasury, because you’re dead or incapacitated. Again, detailed instructions embedded. 

Note: With immutable redundancies, private keys slowly start losing their importance

Also consider: The US Treasury should act as the probate, and I believe this is a controversial but elegant solution. 

All activity within the ENS-PCT wallet is protected with an NFT instead of a passcode or keys. You’ll have vowed this NFT to your empty vault before setting everything up in a process called ASM (art secured marriage). This will be used much like Apple’s finger ID or a decentralized identity where you can choose how much registration or personal info is attached. 

If you’ve gotten this far in this nonsense post of mine, I commend you. We’re almost finished.

For those talking about crypto cycles, and an eventual crypto winter, I have news for you: those ended when mass adoption got planted late last year. I can only speak of bitcoin and Ethereum (possibly stablecoins and privacy coins), but the global confidence curve of crypto is flattening dramatically. The liquidity here and every longterm metric point to a longterm collapse in volatility. It’s already happened to bitcoin. I believe the volatility [of bitcoin] will spike after $90k on the way to what is globally seen as a self-fulfilling prophecy of $100k. It likely stays in the $90k-$100k area for many many months as volatility continues edging off permanently. From there expect slow longterm appreciation, where the bank margin capture that we talked about above becomes the new form of speculation starting late 2022.

My prediction for Ethereum is a little different. It’s still the internet’s 1996 until 2.0, its major upgrades which I see in January next year. After, it will overtake bitcoin’s mkt capitalization and begin consuming everything digital, never fully, but think of digital mail (email) and the US Post Office dichotomy. 

People always ask me: “What price will you sell your ETH at?” It’s a silly question. Never. There’s no need to. I’m not a trader, I’m a DAO citizen. The pre-covid days of bitcoin and Ethereum are gone. The internet is no longer “[A] telecom scam sold to people too lazy to visit their local library,” as a professor once told me. And you’d be wise to consider that before any fiat interaction, unless you’re buying land/property or an education. 

Thank you for sharing my thoughts."
5 Things to Start your Day,https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestingandTrading/comments/ms25e6/5_things_to_start_your_day/,buddythetrader,1,2021-04-16 20:31:40,0,/r/InvestingandTrading/comments/ms25e6/5_things_to_start_your_day/,NaN,"China growth soars, unused vaccines pile up in the U.S., and a Wall Street bank goes big.

Growth 
The world's second-largest economy grew by 18.3% in the first quarter, with Chinese retail sales soaring 34.2% in March. While there are large base effects in the number, China's recovery from the coronavirus has been notable, with the economy regaining all its lost ground by the end of September. The housing market is also showing signs of strength with home prices growing at the fastest pace in seven months in March. The IMF warned that the breakdown in U.S. and Chinese technological ties could lead to a 5% drop in GDP for many countries. 

Hold 
There was some concerning news on the uptake of vaccines in the U.S., with data indicating as many as one in three doses are unused in some states. The hold on Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid-19 vaccine could last several more weeks, according to the head of an advisory committee. France became the latest country to record more than 100,000 deaths from the pandemic, with global fatalities approaching 3 million. Epidemiologists are puzzled as to why Covid-19 seems to be much more deadly in Brazil than India. 

Going big
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. sold $13 billion of bonds yesterday, the largest-ever deal by a bank. The sale, in the wake of the bank's best ever quarter, comes amid high demand for debt that provides a premium over Treasuries. Morgan Stanley closes out Wall Street bank earnings before the bell, with analysts expecting strong topline results while looking for clarity on the impact to the firm from the acquisition of E*Trade. 

Markets steady
Strong economic data over the past 24 hours has helped global stocks maintain their recent highs. Overnight the MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.3%, while Japan's Topix index closed 0.1% higher. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index had risen 0.7% by 5:50 a.m. Eastern Time, with every industry sector posting gains. S&amp;P 500 futures pointed to a small move higher at the open, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.575%, oil was $63.68 a barrel and gold gained. 

Coming up... 
U.S. housing starts and building permits data for March is published at 8:30 a.m. The latest University of Michigan sentiment numbers are at 10:00, with this week's Baker Hughes rig count at 1:00 p.m. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan speaks twice today including at a Bitcoin conference. Bank of New York Mellon Corp., State Street Corp. and Kansas City Southern are among other companies reporting results. 

What we've been reading
Here's what caught our eye over the last 24 hours.

Hedge funds nailed bond rout with $100 billion in Treasury sales.
Family offices are targeting 800% returns with SPAC economics. 
Day trader fever is ticking back up...
...While Einhorn sees broken markets in New Jersey deli valued at $105 million. 
It's time to knock the toilet off its pedestal. 
Buy a piece of Trump.
Plastic is falling from the sky. But where is it coming from?
And finally, here’s what Emily's interested in this morning
The U.S. has just thrown a ton of supply and strong economic data at the bond market and it's had no impact. First it was the U.S. jobs report, then $120 billion of Treasury auctions, followed by consumer price inflation, and now retail sales. The 10-year yield slid to a one-month low.

We are in Terminator 2 territory now, where the rewired-good-guy-Arnold Schwarzenegger's bullets make silvery craters in the natty-but-somewhat-intense robot policeman... But the holes close up, and he's after them again with that odd choppy-handed sprint. 

Just as that cyborg's days are numbered (at least in this installment of the franchise) -- we have reason to suspect the trend of falling yields hasn't far to go. We're going to go out on a limb here and say this bond market reaction isn't macro-driven. That's not for lack of theories, given the crush of analysts' notes today (""It's one of those days where anyone who has a strong opinion is back-fitting pretty hard,"" was one of the wrier observations.)

First, the data are strong. Second, Treasuries aren't rallying because of a dovish Fed (no fresh cues there), and that's clear from the lack of increase in market-implied inflation expectations -- see the rock-steady state of breakevens in the chart below.

Third, it doesn't look like safe-haven trades in response to virus spikes or vaccine setbacks, or the Russian sanctions (for a particularly long bow).  All three major U.S. equity benchmarks closed at record highs Thursday. 

The unwind: This one says investors were motivated to take profits on short positions and curve steepening trades after some sharp moves since the start of the year. ""Accounts who delayed buying during the 1Q reflation rout may be finally catching up with those duration needs now that rates have clearly stabilized and looking to remain range bound in the near term,"" wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn. 

Add to this theory the possibility of increased demand from dealers, who were left with a smaller than usual share of the latest successful Treasury auctions, given healthy takeup among institutional buyers. 

Hungry pension funds. Gwinn also attributes the rally to recent searing appetite among these institutions for long-dated debt. This is reflected in the surge in demand for stripped U.S. Treasuries, which are ultra-long zero-coupon bonds that deliver maximum interest-rate risk. Last month's jump in Strips outstanding was the largest since October 2018.

Big in Japan. As our Stephen Spratt has pointed out, this month is the start of Japan's fiscal year. That can be a bumper period for global bonds, and the latest figures from the Ministry of Finance show the country's funds scooped up the most foreign fixed-income assets in five months. The life insurance heavyweights release more of their investment strategies in the coming week -- not a great time to be short."
Do you need help talking to friends and family about crypto? Do you want the people you love to join your rocket to the moon without coming off as the weird crypto guy? Look here!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ms7vfg/do_you_need_help_talking_to_friends_and_family/,onlymadethistoargue,1,2021-04-17 01:16:55,14,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ms7vfg/do_you_need_help_talking_to_friends_and_family/,STRATEGY,"I originally commented an earlier version of this on another post where a user asked for help on how to communicate crypto and its virtues to skeptics and people who are curious but inexperienced. I figured more users are probably interested in this and should know how to navigate this precarious social avenue.

I have a lot of experience with this, especially recently, as well as with talking to people about complex subjects in layman’s terms in general. For my career I do a lot of presentation of concepts to people who both do and do not know what I’m talking about on an expert level for the purposes of convincing them my ideas are good. It turns out there are ways to understand people such that you can become more convincing. I’ll try to condense what I’ve learned into advice.

Keep in mind that if you’re not talking about crypto unprovoked, anyone talking to you about it is curious of the magic internet money that makes nerds rich on the news for basically just buying and waiting. They have no idea of the internal dynamics of cryptoeconomics. You need to be their guide, not their salesman.

The surest way to gain trust with someone is honesty or the appearance thereof. You have to be willing to accept the flaws within crypto as they currently stand even if there are fixes coming. People won’t see you as anything but a fanatic unless you acknowledge their concerns. That means acknowledging carbon costs of PoW coins even though ETH2.0 is supposedly coming and people can have solar mining farms. It means acknowledging that in terms of number of winners vs number of losers, crypto is analogous to an unregulated casino, even though its fundamentals are much less chaotic than the game theory of casino games. You must acknowledge that you are putting your money where your mouth is and that your money may leave your mouth empty and hungry.

This also means needing some measure of meaningful proof that your plan is going to work, which can come in many forms. Naturally we have all seen this in the form of staggering gains, but people can often be wary of their own impulses and FOMO and may try to suppress them sure as they do the urge to buy lotto tickets and enter casinos. Because that urge feels similar to the urge to engage with these less lucrative and more predatory purchases - low cost high reward with uncertain risk - repressing it feels good, smart, and sensible.

Yet some part will inevitably want those riches. As long as you have their ear, you can whisper into it.

Most importantly, remember this: you can’t control other people. You can only give information and allow them to come to conclusions on their own. So, ruminate on what information made you feel safe in crypto - not what information made you think about strong gains, but about reliable gains. Was it the tech? The institutional buy-in? Spread in popular culture?  Or just hype? if you can convey your feeling of safety in words while acknowledging their feeling of danger, you can connect the two and let them feel that oh so important assurance.

Avoid appealing to moralistic emotions. Fanatics do that. Cultists tell you how they are chosen. Fundamentalists of every religion will scream about the love and wrath of god as though the notion of consequences from god is meaningful to nonbelievers. Crypto has its share too, as a topic with many people overcommitted and who have seen great returns usually is. As someone heavily leveraged in crypto for years now, the number one thing that makes me roll my eyes has hearing about how bitcoin will be space money that frees us from banks so we can take control of our finances. Banks, as it turns out, are pretty good at creating infrastructure to capitalize on new forms of wealth; even if there is greater independence, I think finance is too complex for the average retailer to want to bother with anything but convenience. Humans easily give up control of our finance for the ease of use and potential to grow it further.

Instead, appeal to selfish emotions. I don’t mean selfish in a negative sense here, I mean emotions which reflect the importance of caring for the self. What made me hold my BTC after I bought in close to the 2017 ATH is the graph of BTC price as expressed in logarithmic terms. The order of magnitude fluctuates between upper and lower bounds which themselves change according to what looks very much like a square root function whose curve seems to be modulated by block reward halvings - thus, though the amount of fluctuation between orders of magnitude will eventually plateau, the fact that we’re dealing with orders of magnitude instead of numbers means even a small fluctuation between them equals a 10x growth and there is still time to go before that curve flattens completely.

Of course, I am not a financial adviser, nor can I claim that my hypothesis is factual. It is simply that which makes sense to me and thus far it has only rewarded me. It may be rewarding me for entirely the wrong reasons, but as long as I check out with my gains eventually, I don’t mind. What matters is that I am not buying something I myself internally doubt having any basis in reality. You must give information to your friends to allow them to develop their own internal rules. They might be amenable to yours if you present them well enough.

Additionally, never promise gains. In talking to my friends about crypto, I have repeatedly denounced much of what many of the die hards claim is the surefire future of currency - as I have said, the freedom from banks seems to rely on banks not adapting to crypto and control of finances has led to a ton of news stories about people losing cold wallets and the millions they hide forever. I recognize that this point in this comment may deny me my moons, as I am speaking against what the biggest original diehards have often spoken for, but I want to help you help others so I accept the risk. If I promise my friends gains and the market tanks, that’s it. The game is over. They won’t trust crypto and, more importantly, they won’t trust me.

So I tell them the truth: while the feeling of riding a bull run is akin to gazing at the smiling face of God upon His heavenly throne, the bear markets are so punishing as to make you doubt the virtue of even allowing yourself to feel excited for your bull run gains. Crypto, at least in my experience, has been a bad and stressful time. Only through education, patience, and grueling perseverance in the bad times have I managed to make it less so. I don’t promise anything else to my friends and I acknowledge that even though I have multiplied my investment by many times, it may vanish if the world, for whatever reason, decides to no longer speculate on the value of cryptocurrency. You must temporarily live in the world of old finance if you’re trying to be the ship that sails people to the new world of crypto. Their interest has only grown.

I’m speaking a lot here and I recognize there’s a lot here to ruminate on so I’ll cut to the summary of key points.

tl;dr

1.	⁠Be upfront and emphatic about any and all risks and losses.
2.	⁠Do not promise riches.
3.	⁠Do not try to convince people to buy directly; only give them information to allow them to make their own decisions.
4.	⁠Assume the biggest diehards of any system are wrong about their most emotionally held beliefs in the system.
5.	⁠Preach safety before gains.

In a sense, in giving all the warnings you need to know to manage risk in crypto, you inform people about the dynamics of the system. By helping them gain small footing into the world of cryptocurrency, they become brave enough to climb on their own.

If you would like further elaboration of my points, I will be happy to answer any and all questions. Thank you for reading."
Spin to win. Doki Doki's Chainbinders (BND),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ms9og5/spin_to_win_doki_dokis_chainbinders_bnd/,Jarndice,1,2021-04-17 02:44:21,1,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ms9og5/spin_to_win_doki_dokis_chainbinders_bnd/,New coin/token,"**Chainbinders** (BND) is a GAMBLING/NFT/COLLECTIBLES game backed by redeemable ETH.  Play the the game or be the house.

Over **3000 ETH** have been raised already for the pool with two weeks to go (end of April) and this little mountain of ETH will back the value of the Chainbinders NFT's.  There are multiple ways to get a piece of the action.

**BND** could become a moonshot for those with lucky or the strongest hands, but for the rest of us it looks like a solid opportunity to turn a profit if you believe that gamblers are gonna gamble.

**TLDR;** This is a next level project by an established team (Doki Doki Finance) with a track record and nowhere to go but up.  Buy BND now in presale and sell them back to gamblers and collectors later if you can resist spinning your BND away to cash in ETH backed collectors items.

[https://chainbinders.degacha.com/](https://chainbinders.degacha.com/)

**CONCEPT**

BND are the newly minted tokens that will be used to play Chainbinders degacha, which is more or less a slot machine tied to characters with an evolving story.  The BND presale is happening now and the game launches in the first week of May.  Chainbinders machines will pay out a variety of NFT's in the form of characters from an emerging story-world universe that have guaranteed real-world value since they can be sold back for some amount of ETH based on their rarity (and burned forever).

If you spin and win, you can keep your NFT and watch its value go up as other people redeem their own, or choose to ""unbind"" your Chainbinder NFT-character at any time for its share of ETH in the pool.  This destroys your NFT forever, pays you ETH, and transfers a portion of its reserve ETH to the value of the remaining NFT's, whether they are not yet won or being hodled.

**You can cash in a Chainbinders NFT for ETH at any time and the value of these NFTs does not require them to have any collectible value** (though I'm 100% sure they will).

The last unburned Chainbinders NFT's could be worth a massive amount of ETH relative to the original value based on the tokenomics alone, but just imagine what some people might pay to insure the last character in the Chainbinders universe is not burned forever?  This could go full on crazy-piece-of-early-NFT-history bidding war at some point.  Pokemon \^\^moon

BND is needed to play Chainbinders, like the token for a slot machine, this being the newest project in the DOKI ecosystem.  The presale (or liquidity generation event) for BND is happening now and is open only until the end of April.  After that, players will be able to buy BND only from the presale buyers.  All you need to buy in and mint BND is ETH.

BND tokens are priced on a sliding price scale in USD (a bonding curve).  Sooner is cheaper but the price is capped at $15.  It is \~$10 per BND and rising, as of today, 4/16.

More links below but here's the **page to mint BND**:  [https://chainbinders.degacha.com/mint](https://chainbinders.degacha.com/mint)

I see this as multidimensional play in the emerging gambling/NFT/collectibles space with strong fundamental demand drivers. There's a short term play, a revenue play, and a hodl play.  I'll just say upfront that the tokenomics have a lot of moving pieces, so I've tried to summarize why I'm taking a shot on not only BND but DOKI and have included all the links you'll need to look at this one for yourself.  The ingenious structure coupled with the quality of the art &amp; story sold me on this one.  Definitely takes some time to process though.

**TEAM AND PROJECT**  [https://degacha.com/](https://degacha.com/)

The team at Doki Doki (DOKI) is going places, and with a fully diluted market cap of only $13mm with buybacks incoming.  Someone in r/CryptoMoonShots has already done a great writeup on Doki Doki here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/lynzpq/doki\_is\_the\_most\_undervalued\_nft\_project\_on\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/lynzpq/doki_is_the_most_undervalued_nft_project_on_the/)

Degacha is a multi-billion dollar industry in Japan, and I think Chainbinders will play for both collectors and gamblers -- my investment thesis is that gamblers are gonna gamble and  collectors are gonna to collect.  I'm betting that Chainbinders NFT degacha will be the most novel (literally) and quality project in the space, the first of its kind and the birth of a new genre (if you ignore the first generation DOKI DOKI machines and their NFT's, which you likely shouldn't).  The historical value of the Chainbinders NFT's alone could be worth a multiple.  The website is great, and these NFT's are backed by cold, hard ETH so they have fungible, long term value in and of themselves.

Degacha is addictive -- I've tried it a bit too much -- and these particular NTF's will have value not only for their unique integration into a storyworld that will appeal to genre and degacha fans, but because you can cash them in at any time, guaranteed, for their share of the locked pool of ETH.

**WHY THERE IS VALUE HERE**

Once you start pulling the handle, you don't stop.  BNB is going to burn like hell.

Some of the character NFT's in the Chainbinders machine could pay 8000x or more of the cost of a spin, and that's just the baseline value.  As NFT's are burned and \*if\* the value of ETH goes up, the values could skyrocket.  This means that anyone who likes to play slots who discovers Chainbinders is part of the potential customer base, and they will have to buy BND to play.

Want to 500x off of one spin and get paid right away?  Could happen.  Sell/burn it to the original Chainbinders ETH pool and cash out.

Or maybe you want to auction your NFT character on the open market to someone with deep pockets and more time to hodl? They might buy your redeemable NFT for significantly more than the guaranteed buyback price because they know that as each Chainbinders NFT is sold back and burned (in exchange for ETH from the pool used for BND) both the scarcity and the ETH value of the NFT-character increases.  This is because additional ETH accrues to the NFT's that have not been won or burned.

The last few unburned Chainbinders NFT's are going to worth a relative boatload of ETH, and the last BND tokens needed to spin for a chance to win them will too.

And what if this thing goes just a little bit viral?  It has the looks and characters and value to do it.  That's just a premium.

(In case you don't know, NFT's are sold on Opensea, Rarible, or soon Digicol on L2 Matic  in which I'm also invested [https://www.digicol.io/](https://www.digicol.io/) but not shilling today since it's not clear the Digicol team is going to get it done.)

**BIGGER PICTURE &amp; SOME STRATEGIES**

Take a look at the quality of the Chainbinders site which is only slowly being revealed: [https://chainbinders.degacha.com/chainbinders](https://chainbinders.degacha.com/chainbinders)

This is just the beginning for Doki Doki.  The marketing for Chainbinders is going to take off as the story tied to the characters tied to the spinning and winning and burning evolves. The possibilities are endless.

Did I mention that DOKI is not yet listed on any major exchanges?  

**Plan A:** Buy BND presale, wait for it to burn, sell it back to players in the future.  Depending on how many rare NFT's are left in the machine after a few weeks of people burning all their BND to spin, BND becomes increasingly valuable as it is the only way to win the NFT's (and ETH) in the machine.

**Plan B:**  I'm a degen and am going to spin off some BND to try and win a few NFT's myself, and then try to hodl them. The clever tokenomics of the NFT's will make even the common NFT's worth more over time -- potentially a lot more as other people cash in -- if you have hands of steel.

**Plan C:**  I'm also buying DOKI based on how impressive the Chainbinders project is.  And buyback pools are coming based off of Chainbinders revenue, and more.  I think DOKI is a slightly longer term play as the price is still looking for a new floor from its first moonshot evolution (which I missed) but I see solid returns in DOKI soon and a possible second moon as the project grows and gets listed.  CB is next level from Doki's already successful (and growing) degacha enterprise, and the team is just getting started.  While it may look like a cartoon to some, CB could be the beginning of something huge in the degacha space.  Check out how much some of the rare NFT's from Doki's other machines are selling for, and those NFT's are not backed by anything!  

**Plan D:**  Buy AZUKI.  Don't want to complicate things further, but this is the token used to play some of Doki Doki's other degacha games.  It burns when sold on Uni.  It burns when you spin some of their other machines. Some AZUKI will be needed to unbind NFT's from Chainbinders and they are releasing new degacha games for this coin which can also be used for farming in several fields.

**LINKS TO GET THE DETAILS**

If you are intrigued and want to learn more about Chainbinders from the source, here's the article:

[https://medium.com/@dokidoki.finance/introducing-chainbinders-a-next-generation-nft-gacha-experience-en-4eaaa942f329](https://medium.com/@dokidoki.finance/introducing-chainbinders-a-next-generation-nft-gacha-experience-en-4eaaa942f329)

And here's an audio interview with one of the founders of Doki Doki talking about the project in an interview:

[https://anchor.fm/nftcast/episodes/Ep-5---Roy-Blackstone---Game-changing-NFTDeFi-platform---Chainbinders-by-Doki-Doki-eut1n3](https://anchor.fm/nftcast/episodes/Ep-5---Roy-Blackstone---Game-changing-NFTDeFi-platform---Chainbinders-by-Doki-Doki-eut1n3)

There's a lot to process here and I can't answer any questions about the project since I'm not affiliated with the Doki Doki team in any way, but I think BND, DOKI, and AZUKI are all solid plays with various moonshot potentials.

The more ETH there is in the pool, the better, so if you like the idea you'll want to spread the word.  Hopefully this gives you a starting point to DYOR  Good luck, especially if you are like me and can't resist spinning for a Chainbinder.  If I start drinking and go full on degen the first day of Chainbinders and spin off all my BND I'll be buying more BND from one of you for multiples..."

Why is everyone so salty about BSC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/msu76n/why_is_everyone_so_salty_about_bsc/,Nervous_Sort_2840,1,2021-04-18 00:45:04,67,/r/defi/comments/msu76n/why_is_everyone_so_salty_about_bsc/,NaN,"Seriously you guys need to chill. BSC is centralised, CeDeFi, whatever you want to call it.
But there is a huge elephant in the room, and that is ETH fees, and BSC solves it.

As a noob to defi, I was amazed when I found out about it and decided to check out curve.fi. I jumped in with $2000 of stablecoin and had about $600 in ETH in my wallet. 

I was shocked to find out that after depositing in a vault twice, staking my CRV etc, then withdrawing and unstaking, those $600 were all gone.

I asked several people on discord and they told me “yeah less than $10k in curve is not worth the fees”.

This isn’t how Defi is supposed to work! It’s supposed to democratise finance, not make it only available to the wealthy!
The same operations in BSC cost me $2!

BSC fulfils a role that the ETH network cannot at the moment. Hopefully this will change over time but until then, try not to be so caustic and shaming noobs which come here asking BSC questions."

With bitcoin’s price still rising and expected to rise even more, there has been a growing belief in cryptocurrency circles that it will replace unbacked government currencies when they eventually fail.

The assumptions behind this conclusion are naïve, exposing hardly any knowledge in what qualities are needed for sound money. This article agrees that current events are accelerating the path towards fiat destruction, and that historical precedents point to their eventual replacement with a sounder form of money. But what that money will be is decided when governments lose control over their fiat; and the public, its users, through free markets will set the monetary agenda.

Only then will the general public determine the qualities required, and in the past, it has always opted for metallic money. And because government treasury departments and their central banks coincidently possess only gold in their non-fiat reserves, its monetisation is the only option for governments to survive the collapse of their fiat currencies. That is what will eventually happen, with silver perhaps fulfilling a subsidiary monetary role to gold.

Introduction

While increasing numbers of the fiat investment community understand that the quantities of government money are being expanded without any sign of limitation, they have also concluded that bitcoin, not gold, is the pure investment play because over the next few years bitcoin will approach its final quantity.

It is almost certain that like the majority of gold and silver bulls hodlers expect to sell bitcoin for profit measured in their governments’ currencies, creating for themselves relative wealth in dollars, euros, yen — whatever their governments impose on their citizens as money. But it is an investor’s, or speculator’s approach, which is accompanied by feverish examination of charts, confirmation bias from “experts” and only a half-understood concept of what is driving the price. So sudden and wonderful has been the unbanked wealth creation in leading cryptocurrencies, that investors commonly proclaim that gold and silver are yesterday’s story and that we oldies should move with the times.

These investors claim that five thousand years of empirical evidence is about to be overturned. But they are investors. All bulls and no bears. Other than banking fabulous profits in fiat at a future date, this has nothing to do with money per se. The point about sound money is you acquire it by spending fiat, so that when fiat goes you will have it to spend. It is not an investment decision, but more like an insurance policy taken out for which a risk assessment has to be made. If it is decided the risk is that fiat currencies will not fail in one’s lifetime, then the insurance premium, which is an individual’s decision, need only be small or not even taken out. But if it is decided that the risk is there and growing, then the allocation into physical sound money should be increased accordingly. Lack of physical ownership, be it bitcoin gold or silver is not an option.

There is no doubt that economic and monetary instability are increasing. After all, this is fuelling the investment rationale for bitcoin, understood by those whose reasons for buying it are to benefit from its slow rate of quantity expansion compared with that of fiat. But the investment rationale is that all the subjective price performance is in bitcoin, and the national currency is the unchanging objective value. Otherwise, why value bitcoin in your fiat currency, and why would you ever sell it? And do you ever adjust your other investment returns for the debasement of the currency? No one does this.

The objective view of currency is so powerful that very few people can get away from it. But the decision to insure against the death of fiat currencies is about advance possession of their likely successor, not measuring gains. It requires an understanding of what money represents, its function, and the what and the why that is happening to fiat currencies. It involves an understanding that fiat money is being debased, and what that really means for the sound money of tomorrow. And it requires individuals to comprehend what is happening to fiat money’s objective value, evidenced by rising commodity prices, stock markets, house prices, bitcoin as well as gold and silver — all measured in fiat.

Today, very few owners of precious metals or of bitcoin understand that investment is fine and dandy, but the ultimate reason for possessing them is against the possibility that fiat money will fail. They are yet to make an informed choice about what that replacement will be. And talk of bitcoin going to a million dollars or gold going to five thousand misses the point entirely.        reminder why they always will be sound money and why bitcoin cannot fill that role

￼
Figure 1 gives us a basis for assessing the credentials of the principal contenders to replace fiat money when it dies. It should be noted that throughout the history of money, money mandated by governments with nothing to back it other than its legal status has always failed and been replaced with money which is essentially chosen by individuals through their personal exchanges with each other. With the invention of cryptocurrencies, there is offered a new technological form of money which claims to be sound, competing with the established metallic monies of the past for attention. We can ignore centralised central bank cryptocurrencies on the basis that is just rearranging the deck chairs on the fiat Titanic.

In estimating the suitability of each form of money, they have to survive the tests in Figured 1. Clearly, gold satisfies all categories, but some explanation is needed why this is so, and why bitcoin and silver do not.

Public acceptability


Both gold and silver have acted as money for millennia and are widely distributed. They are generally associated with a monetary value, that is to say suitable to be a medium of exchange. Indeed, silver was the basis of the pound sterling from as early as 775 AD and was the monetary standard until the adoption of the gold standard in 1816, though Sir Isaac Newton introduced a secondary standard for gold in 1717. That’s over a thousand years of monetary silver. Silver was still the currency standard in many jurisdictions on the European continent until the Franco-Prussian War, when Germany exacted tribute from France in gold, allowing it to change its monetary standard from silver to gold.

Both metals have a long history of being used as money throughout Europe and Asia. And when Columbus discovered the Americas, it was found that these metals were also valued by their civilisations — principally the Aztecs and Incas — which had had no prior trading connection with Europeans and Asians. Deep in the human psyche there has always been an appreciation of their constancy and their suitability as mediums of exchange.

The same cannot be said of bitcoin, which is held out as the leading and most sound cryptocurrency. But its distributed ledger cannot be corrupted by anyone, including governments. So long as electricity flows through our economic veins and our computers and mobile phones remain interconnected there will be bitcoin and its blockchain. But as a replacement for fiat, it suffers many disadvantages, some of which will doubtless be overcome. But the one thing it cannot do is act as the medium of exchange for those unwilling or unable to use it. The hodlers’ enthusiasm for bitcoin as money does not stretch much beyond educated millennials — less than a hundred million perhaps out of a transacting population of seven billion. It falls at this fence because it is not hodlers who ultimately decide what to use as money, but the wider public.

But bitcoins are already accepted in some outlets, and even Elon Musk is said to accept them in exchange for his Teslas. Maybe; but if someone thinks bitcoin is going to rise in price, then they would likely accept it as payment. It would be a way of acquiring bitcoin, so that they can be sold for a greater profit at a later date. This is not bitcoin being used as money.


Public acceptability

For a medium of exchange to be effective, it must be accepted by everyone in a community of people who divide their labour, and if one community is to benefit from trading with other communities, it must be accepted more widely for the exchange for goods. But we know that confining transactions to coins or metallic money by weight is an inefficient form of money. This is why fiat currencies started out as gold or silver substitutes in the forms of both cash and bank deposits, exchangeable into physical metal on demand at a fixed rate.

The convenience of being able to pay in sound money substitutes cannot be underestimated. A national currency fully fungible with gold or silver was central to the economics of the industrial revolution and is the basis of the currencies of the great nations of today. Markets in them developed, such as discounted bills, loans, bonds, stocks, and trade finance. Gold and silver substitutes were trusted. Businesses developed internationally, exchanging their money substitutes for commodities, importation of consumer goods and goods of a higher order. While Country A’s money did not circulate in Country B it was accepted and could be redeemed for its money at a cross rate fixed by their gold standards, or alternatively exchanged for physical gold. This was the basis of global trade before the First World War.

The monetary system based on the free exchange of gold and silver substitutes was so successful that it brought the nations that benefited from the arrangement out of feudal subsistence living into the greatest economic advancement for mankind since the ending of barter. It set the basis for modern economies and their technological advancement. Money could be trusted. You could save it, making it accessible for entrepreneurs to finance their production, knowing that gold or silver backed money would retain their purchasing power over time. It was fundamental to the evolution from medieval societies into free markets.

Through their money substitutes it was governments and their central banks which cheated on metallic money. Starting with the suspension of gold standards to finance the First World War, European nations failed to return to them and some currencies collapsed. Britain eventually introduced a gold bullion standard in 1925, replacing its gold specie standard at the pre-war rate. By only permitting the exchange of pounds for 400-ounce bars and removing the pre-war commitment to swap paper pounds for sovereigns, the general public effectively lost the gold substitute facility. The UK’s bullion standard only lasted until September 1931, when it was “temporarily” abandoned, never to be reintroduced.

The flaw in the system was not the fault of gold, or in earlier times, silver. The fundamental problem was that banks were free to expand the quantity of money in the form of credit, which when drawn down and spent was indistinguishable from gold substitutes. Following the Bank Charter Act of 1844 which permitted the existence of unbacked bank credit, the cycle of bank credit expansion was broadly self-liquidating through periodic bank crises. That changed when the Bank of England adopted the role of lender of last resort, subsequently copied by the Fed.

The credit tail had begun to wag the monetary dog, and led to the situation today, where money originating from bank credit makes up the bulk of money in circulation. Without a reform of the banking system to restrict the role of bank credit, the reintroduction of gold and silver substitutes is corrupted and cannot work for long. This must be addressed when fiat dies, otherwise the cycle of bank credit will destabilise the new monetary system.

If bitcoin is to be the money of the future, it will need enormous degrees of persuasion for the public to accept it as sound money compared with gold or silver. That persuasion is unlikely to come from markets, which are the sum total of people’s transactions, so it can only come from the state. An establishment agency of some kind, a revolutionary government in agreement with other revolutionary governments would have to successfully impose a cryptocurrency, over which no state has distributive control, on the general public whose traditional concept of money is very different. Not only is this proposition illogical, but it is logically the consequence of assuming the state decides what is money and not the people.


Official sanction of the new money

The last thing any government or central bank would wish is to lose control over money. These agencies will continue with fiat until the last possible moment and will then want to determine its replacement. Intellectually, they are not suited to the task, believing that the state must retain control of its national money at all times in order to manage economic outcomes. It sees free markets as the enemy of state-imposed order.

The collapse of fiat currencies will demolish the state theory of money, and not for the first time. Irrespective of how long it takes, the rapid loss of fiat currencies’ purchasing power means that governments will no longer be able to finance their obligations. There will, therefore, come a point where fiat money must be abandoned in the search for monetary stability. The demise of fiat is the demise of state money and the function of its replacement will be to restore public trust.

It is theoretically possible for trust to be restored without abandoning fiat, but that would be to act in anticipation of a monetary crisis. Cutting government spending to an economically sustainable level, balancing budgets, reforming the banking system and abandoning regulatory and other interventions in favour of free markets would have to be a deliberate policy. But it is unlikely that the necessary reforms would be possible politically ahead of a major economic and monetary crisis. Therefore, the crisis comes first, and then the state responds with an electorate fully aware of the consequences of failure.

At some stage in the collapse of a fiat money’s purchasing power it will have to be halted. In November 1923, Germany’s paper mark was finally exchanged for a new mark notionally tied to the gold mark at the rate of one trillion to one. The reasoning behind the conversion rate was it enabled the new Reichsmark to enter circulation. Today, the replacement of fiat currencies with the new money will almost certainly follow a similar procedure.

The replacement money can only be based on something in governments’ possession. And either in their treasury departments or central banks, other than each other’s fiat they only possess gold in their monetary reserves. It may take a few debilitating attempts by states to avoid it, but we can be certain that the only replacement for fiat money will be to back them with gold. It is necessary to stabilise everyone’s money. The other actions, reducing the scope of government and freeing markets from intervention will also have to be addressed. But following the increasingly obvious prospect of a total monetary collapse, stabilising the currency by turning it into gold substitutes exchangeable for gold coin should then become a politically viable solution.

It is not the intention to make light of the difficulties involved, nor to dismiss the political consequences. Based on the German experience following the collapse of its paper mark, Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom is instructive reading. The demise of the dollar raises geopolitical questions, because China has effectively cornered physical gold markets and there is evidence that she has accumulated very large quantities of non-monetary gold. Gold as circulating money would enhance her power relative to that of the United States. Russia’s central bank has also built her gold reserves at the expense of the dollar and can be assumed to have accumulated significant amounts of physical gold not otherwise declared.

The time taken for a fiat monetary collapse is another important factor not addressed in this article but will have significant consequences. If it is as much as a year from now, governments might introduce price controls and attempt to confiscate gold — these are traditionally resorted to in the past, going back as far as Roman times. The introduction of central bank digital currencies might just be advanced, hurried along by a falling purchasing power for traditional fiat. And the impoverishment of the middle classes through monetary inflation must not be ignored.

But eventually, a movement towards gold substitutes is bound to occur, and silver can then become supporting coinage. But one thing is clear, and that is a publicly distributed ledger cryptocurrency not in possession of the state cannot be adopted as a substitute for its fiat currency, because states do not have the means to introduce it.

Monetary flexibility

It is a mistake to think that a sound money is one that doesn’t vary in its quantity. The point behind sound money is that it is the users, the general public and businesses, who decide the quantity required and not the state. It was Georg Knapp’s State Theory of Money, published in 1905 that led to Germany’s inflationary financing that ended with the paper mark collapsing in 1923. It was Knapp’s theory and his Chartalist fellow travellers that permitted Germany to arm itself ahead of the First World war and then to prosecute it at no visible cost to the taxpayer. It is not a strict limitation on the quantity of money that is the problem, it is who determines its quantity.

We are told that above ground stocks of gold total some 200,000 tonnes, and that its extra supply is about 3,300 tonnes of annual extraction. Growing at about 1.5% annually, that is wrongly taken to be gold’s money supply. Monetary gold is just one function of the metal, and only 35,220 tonnes are officially monetary gold. In addition to official holdings, there are vaulted bars on behalf of governments and their agencies not officially designated as money, as well as hoarded bars owned by the general public. And with an estimated 60% in the form of jewellery and other uses, that leaves a global gold money supply of about 80,000 tonnes.

This gives gold enormous scope for increasing its monetary use. If gold is used as backing to turn fiat currencies into credible gold substitutes, its purchasing power becomes the determinant of the quantities of scrap acting as an arbitrage between uses. Free markets will decide how much gold is needed, and the supply is available if required.

With its predominantly industrial uses, silver acting as money is a more complex issue. Increasing values relative to gold will diminish industrial demand until the time monetary stability eventually returns, leaving the majority of an estimated 840 million ounces annual mine supply then feeding into the quantity of monetary silver. But unlike gold, above ground silver stocks are minimal, and furthermore, ownership of monetary silver by government agencies is virtually non-existent. And having been generally abandoned as monetary backing for note issues in European states as long ago as the early 1870s, silver is likely to have a future monetary role only secondary to gold. But its reintroduction as coinage would serve as a public affirmation, along with higher value gold coins, that currency reform is soundly based.

Unlike metallic-backed money, for its hodlers the virtue of bitcoin is the strict limit on its quantity, meaning that so long as governments expand their fiat money quantity, its price is bound to rise. But if the general public is to determine the future of money through free markets, they will need a form of money whose quantity is not dictated by government and the banks. Under a bitcoin standard one country can only expand the quantity of its bitcoin in circulation by obtaining them from another country. The economic mechanism is for the country to have lower prices of goods and services than the others, so that it obtains bitcoin in payment for net exports. Assuming no change in the proportion of savings relative to immediate consumption, this would require the government to increase its surplus of revenues relative to spending in an attempt to supress demand in its own economy and thereby lower prices.

Consequently, a bitcoin standard requires government intervention to operate, with governments setting marginal demand. But they cannot act in concert. And if one country contrives to increase its quantity of circulating bitcoin, it causes more accute deflation in the others. The lack of any monetary flexibility is bitcoin’s Achille’s heel.


Financial flexibility

Following the ending of the post-war Bretton Woods agreement, over the last fifty years financial markets have developed on the back of an unprecedented expansion of the quantity of money. In the US alone, since August 1971 broad M3 money supply has increased from $685bn to $19.4 trillion, a multiple of twenty-eight times. And the major US banks have increasingly diverted credit expansion from financing production to financial activities. These include purchases of government and other debt, rising from $160bn to $4.92 trillion over the same timescale. The expansion of regulated futures markets and the far larger over-the-counter markets have been explosive, with the Bank for International Settlements estimating the notional amounts outstanding of OTC contracts at $609 trillion in June 2020.

While much of these increases are the consequences of monetary inflation, there can be little doubt that having the ability to hedge risk, which is what derivatives are all about, is demanded by economic actors in any monetary system. In fact, futures, forwards and options existed long before the current fiat regime. We must therefore assume that financial markets will continue to find these services demanded, but perhaps in lower quantities.

A replacement monetary regime must therefore allow for derivatives and other financial activities, such as trade finance and the provision of credit to the non-financial sector to continue. The fact that derivatives have a longer history than fiat money is proof that metallic monies are no obstacle to them. Similarly, bond markets existed alongside bank credit, which are necessary to facilitate production and therefore consumption.

With prices generally stable, the purchasing power of metallic money increases over time as a result of competition driving manufacturing innovation along with the development and application of new technologies. Consumers can save in the knowledge that they are safeguarded from monetary debasement by the state, and that their standards of living will improve over time along with the purchasing power of their savings.

None of this would be possible with a form of inflexible money strictly limited in its quantity. Instead of the current situation of wealth being transferred from depositors to borrowers through currency debasement, wealth would tend to flow strongly the other way, only offset by contracting economic activity to act as a counter-pressure on a tendency for a rise in the purchasing power of a fixed-quantity form of money. The world as a whole would find itself in a permanent depression led by a decline in production.

Banks would be unable to fund themselves beyond sight deposits, with negative interest rates likely to offset the fixed money supply leading to its increasing purchasing power. Bond markets would be driven by negative yields increasing along the yield curve. In this upside-down world no entrepreneur would consider financing production from initial investment to final product sales, because prices for final products in that fixed currency would almost certainly fall substantially over time. And the wisest choice a consumer might make would be to spend nothing except on the barest essentials in order to hoard as much of this fixed quantity money as possible. These would be the basic conditions under a bitcoin currency regime.

Conclusion

This article has made the simple assumption that the demise of fiat currencies will be succeeded by sound money. It has glossed over the likely political and economic turbulence such a change would cause, which is assumed herein to be a temporary phase. Nonetheless, there are other institutional changes that need to be made for the introduction of a sound money regime to stick. These include governments reducing both their financial commitments and economic involvement to a bare minimum, maintaining balanced budgets, not discouraging savings by taxing them and ensuring they never take actions which discourage free markets. It must be admitted that the prospect of a smooth transition to sound money is close to zero, but transition there will eventually be.

This article has also played down the role of banks, whose credit creation is by far the greatest factor in the expansion of money. The misunderstanding of the importance of the factors behind the cycle of bank credit expansion and its sudden episodes of contraction led to interventionist policies with fatal long-run consequences. It is not generally understood that banks create money, with the financial establishment believing they simply have an intermediary role: it is not for the first time we see the high priests of central banking being utterly deluded about the business of commercial banking.

In a monetary revolution there can be no place for this type of loose thinking, so with it will have to be a process of rapid re-education for politicians and planners alike — probably in the real world of experience. Bank reform will have to be aimed at dampening the bank credit cycle. Purists of the Austrian School have suggested that banking must be realigned into deposit takers, who operate as off-balance sheet custodians, and financial arrangers for savers investing in productive enterprises. Then there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind about the status of their money, and unbacked bank credit would be eliminated.

While this approach is an ideal, it might be more practical to simply remove limited liability from banks. This would allow them to continue with existing banking practices and accounting. But the risks arising from balance sheet leverage would be significantly reduced because the homes and other assets of shareholders and directors would be on the line. This simple measure would likely be enough to drive banks towards the Austrian solution.

Aside from the institutional changes, the eventual replacements for fiat currencies that will initially be required will be driven by the establishment attempting to save itself from only having a worthless currency as its means of finance. Inevitably, it will require governments to use the only means at their disposal, and that is to monetise gold reserves because they are the only money they possess in non-fiat form. On this basis alone, cryptocurrencies, including planned central bank cryptocurrencies which are merely another unbacked form of fiat, don’t even get to the starting gate.

If that were not enough, we have established that a future sound money must be flexible enough to not only finance production, but to act as the mainspring for markets. Bitcoin enthusiasts have failed to grasp the importance of a degree of flexibility in the quantity of money, driven by free markets and not imposed by the state, for it to act as a medium of exchange. For now, bitcoin as money is merely poorly informed speculation. And when the world has returned to metallic money for all the reasons outlined in this article, bitcoin’s legacy will be the invention of a blockchain and all that follows it, and not its price in fiat currencies, which will be of no consequence.

04/19/2021 Morning Forecast-Markets are implying a move of 1.07%+/-(up/down) on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have realized a move of 0.77%+/-(up/down). The difference between what market makers are implying and what has been realized has decreased. The spread tightened to 484 (17.17-12.33) basis points. The put/call gamma imbalance favors put buying relative to call buying. Short put gamma on client purchases has the potential to exacerbate market selloffs. However, a tightening spread decreases left-tail risk and reduces the potential for spikes in realized volatility. Realized volatility has decreased recently below 13. This is favorable for smaller moves up or down on the indices. I expect a decreasing trend over the 2nd Quarter during April, May, and June. The current market environment is favorable for traders looking to sell convexity via short straddles, strangles, call overwriting, put writes, and other short vol strategies to capture alpha. The MOVE index hovers around 60 to 65 (or movement of 3 basis points daily in Treasury yields.)  However, economic growth upgrades and rising inflation expectations were pushing up real yields and raising discount rates. The rise in yields has diminished lessening negative effects on long-duration assets, such as Technology Stocks and Longer-Term Bonds. The S&amp;P is expected to move close to 1.15%+/- (up/down) this week, which means the S&amp;P could rise 17% or fall 14% above its 200 DAY Moving average (3,604.97.) The S&amp;P traded well above its 50-day moving average (3,950.49) last week. Full Year S&amp;P Earnings are expected to total 176 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P at 23x's earnings, which equates to an earnings yield of 4.3% &amp; an inflation-adjusted real earnings yield of 1.73% (using 5-year TIPs Break-evens for inflation 2.57.) Analysts are anticipating earnings in 2022 of 202 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P forward earnings for 2022 at 20.6.x's or a Yield = 4.8% &amp; Inflation Adjusted 2.23%

Forecasters have up-graded nominal and real growth expectations for the full year. The highest number of Private Forecasters and those from Federal Open Market Committee members are close to 7% on a Real basis. If this rate of growth is realized it would add 1.3 Trillion Dollars of Real Output to the US Economy ($18.78 Trillion = 20.00  Growth of 1,314 Billion.) The Corona Virus subtracted 3.5% of Real Economic Output from the US Economy in 2020. In 2021 the US Economy would need to grow at least 3.62% to break even on a Real basis (3.5% = 1/(1-0.035.) For the 1st quarter of 2021 upgrades to current estimates of nominal growth are 550 Billion and a Real Economic output of 378 Billion. There is no seasonal rigidity this year associated with 1st Quarter Growth.  The Atlanta Federal Reserve GDP Now indicates a 1st quarter growth rate of 8.3%. This equates to nominal growth of 563.8 Billion and real growth of 389 Billion. At the end of Q4 2020, the US lost 500 Billion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 669 Billion in Real Growth. It looks like the US will break even and eclipse this mark by May or June of this year 2021. The US is also on pace to close the output gap by the end of the third quarter of 2021, which means the economy will be running hot into the 4th quarter and 1st quarter of 2022. The US is on pace to generate a little over 560 Billion Dollars of Nominal Economic Output in the 1st Quarter. At the current pace If it held through the full year,  would generate close to 2.2 Trillion Dollars of Economic Output. While this is exciting, I do not think this pace is sustainable or likely to culminate in those size gains. However, I do believe a nominal gain of 1.5 Trillion to 2.2 Trillion in Economic Nominal Output is possible in 2021.

Full Year Economic Output estimates have increased significantly following the passage of stimulus. The median forecast was anticipating close to 1.2 Trillion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 800 Billion Dollars in real economic output for 2021. The 90 Trillion Dollar Global Economy is going to be lead by the US and China, which will both contribute more than 1 Trillion individually and 3 Trillion combined to global output. Current Account Imbalances between Surplus and Deficit Country's are likely to persist. However, they represent only 1.25% to 1.5% of nominal Global Output. These imbalances relative to the build-up prior to the Great Financial Crises are significantly smaller. Current Account Surplus ranges between 1.6 Trillion 1.9 Trillion Dollars and Global Current Account Deficit between 1.6 Trillion 1.9 Trillion Dollars. The large creditor nation's savings surplus will allow the US to run very large fiscal deficits. A major acceleration in growth is positioning the US to capture more than 1/3 of Global Economic Output in 2021. Economists continue to place the highest expectation for growth in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. US households and businesses will add a substantial amount of spending on Goods &amp; Services, which may face downside risk if there are any delays in Covid vaccinations,  roll-outs, or any unforeseen supply chain bottlenecks.  Personal Consumption Expenditures in April, May, and June will likely range between 80 to 160 billion dollars per month. I think we could see nominal GDP growth in the 2nd Quarter of 700B to 600B and Real Output is likely between 375B to 310B. In addition to spending more in dollar terms, US households will also be saving more. A prolonged higher US savings rate relative to historic norms will help fund larger dissavings in the Public Sector, which along with Federal Reserve Large Scale Asset Purchases will somewhat mitigate substantial reliance on foreigner's savings.

The March non-farm payroll report was extremely robust changing the recent overall trend, which had been tilted towards weaker payroll growth. Despite a strong report there still exist 10 million Americans Unemployed. A large cohort of more than 4 Million on longer-term unemployment and 20 million receiving some form of Unemployment assistance. A return to 164 Million US workers employed may be continually undermined by the 6.5 million Americans remaining out of the labor force, which indicates large and substantial slack in the labor market. Private Forecast is anticipating payroll growth between 270k and 500k per month, which equates to 3.2 Million &amp; 6.0 Million additions to full-year US payrolls. This key economic indicator is likely to pressure growth in the 1st half of 2021. The relatively slow growth of the US population along with a substantial rise in the number of workers Not in the Labor Force has shrunk the size of the currently available labor pool. In 2020, the US lost a total of  9.7 Million Jobs or a loss of 6%. To break even this year the US would need employment growth of 6.60%. Nominal wage gains topped 5% during the recession for Non-Supervisory workers. Although, ECI (Employment Cost Index) salary and wages rose 2.8% in 2020. The gain in productivity, employment compensation, and a large amount of slack in the labor market tilt towards a continuation of non-inflationary pressures as the US economy grows

 However, the recent agreement on 1.9 Trillion in deficit spending is a significant tailwind to nominal growth in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This should increase aggregate demand, which should foster higher employment gains, but this assumes that virus cases come down substantially by April/May/June and pandemic flare-ups lessen. This has led some market observers to anticipate economic overheating, which is favorable for upside risk in inflation. I believe these fears are statistically unfounded. However, I do not disagree with rising inflation as a potential risk in the short term. The recent increase in nominal Treasury yields and 5yr Break-Evens on TIPs (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) towards 2.57% is transitory and likely reflecting anticipated increases in energy prices and base effects. The Federal Reserve typically subtracts 40 basis points from the break-even inflation rates, which would mean inflation expectations are currently anchored around the 2% (inflation averaging metric.) 

https://preview.redd.it/kvlvcw4965u61.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ce303c9587ccda91d7565be6e4b52315368f4a

Following the passage of stimulus larger fiscal dissavings increases capital inflows to finance VERY large TWIN DEFICITS, which should put upward pressure on the US Dollar &amp; downward pressure on Corporate &amp; Government Bond Yields. The most recent Trade Data indicates the US is on pace to record a real Trade Deficit of 1.2 Trillion Dollars by the end of 2021. The current rise in yields and increase in growth expectations will likely favor a stronger US Dollar in the 1st half of 2021. This is also likely to put some additional pressure on higher real yields if growth and inflation increases are realized. Although, potentially weaker inflation data than consensus estimates should allow real yields to remain deeply negative. Thus providing additional support to the Federal Reserves ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and an extremely accommodating stance. Dollar appreciation also dampens import/commodity-driven inflation and should lessen temporary transitory base effects. The strong US dollar may have negative effects on Emerging market Countries with large current account deficits and substantial debt denominated in US Dollars. Inflationistah and inflation fear-mongers engaging in scare tactics are likely to be proven wrong. However, inflation base effects are expected to be short-term. There will be a transitory spike in headline inflation data from March/April/and May. The impact on Core PCE is expected to be limited. Market Expectations are split, but I expect the Federal Reserve will look through these spikes

 Political risks have diminished in the 1st quarter due to reconciliation, but it has increased in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, which may pose risk to much-needed Investment spending (infrastructure, human capital, &amp; research development), so I view it in the medium term as tilted to the upside due to potential gridlock. However, there is the possibility for another round of reconciliation in the 2022 budget combined with the removal of the Filibuster Rules in the Senate. This could pave the way for easier passage of additional INVESTMENT lead spending, which is much needed to raise the US Long Term Potential Growth Rate. Although, due to political isolation this increases the potential for Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorism

Vaccine distribution is priced into Q3 2021, but distribution obstacles have increased and efficacy for herd immunity will be closely watched. Redefining herd immunity may become the norm, so instead of a fully vaccinated population of 90%. We may accept a different goal post for ""full vaccination"" perhaps it drops between 70% to 75%(?) Details are currently unknown. The market is currently pricing in an additional 4.84% move +/- (up/down) by June 18th. The S&amp;P 500 could potentially trade as high as 4,375.07 and as low as 3,980.44 by June 18th. The VIX is expected to move 6.77%(points), the VIX is currently 17.17. The VIX price range is 18.33 to 16.08. The Skew Index is elevated, which indicates market participants are paying up for catastrophic protection (2 sigma event). Stocks continue to offer investors the highest real returns. The nominal yield on equities is 4.3%, while the nominal yield on 10yr Treasury is 1.59%. Real yields on all tenors of government bonds at the shorter end and belly of the curve are decisively negative, but real yields at longer tenors above 30 years remain slightly in positive territory. Real yields on US Equities remain strongly positive.\*\*Disclaimer with Realized Volatility near 12 there is a larger risk of systematic highly leveraged short vol strategies like Equity Vol Targeting, Trend Following, and Risk Parity positioned for a massive increase in market exposure. The potential for a MUCH larger MOVE HIGHER has increased, while a large sell-off has decreased. We are much more likely to see a fall in realized and implied volatility and a gradual melt-up in asset prices.  The Apr/May VIX contracts at 17 &amp; 20 are fairly priced. In fact, they may now be overpriced given the new economic outlook

Passage of fiscal stimulus should juice the start of a new long-term economic cycle, which favors a continued fall in realized volatility. - I am temporarily moving against a large rise in implied or realized volatility, However, I have been wrong before, but sell-offs will give investors great opportunities to buy the dip. Traders should focus on cyclical sectors, which tend to outperform at the start of new economic cycles. For example being long Financial, Industrials, Metals, Mining, Oil/Gas, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology

Editorial/discussion from a recent comment on another post: 

It needs to be mentioned that public health is the PRIMARY concern during a pandemic.  

While a 'path to recovery' and 'return to normalcy' may be popular and hopeful political talking points - I feel the government should be paying greater heed to Hinshaw's advice and be dealing with the current reality instead of nudging her toward their own best-case-scenario agendas. Between vaccine supply restraints, outbreaks, variant case surges, re-infection, and ICU numbers - normalcy still seems like a fairy tale Kenney is trying to sell at this point (or at least wishful thinking) for his own popularity, instead of the current reality with which we need to be dealing more cohesively as a province. 

Why were only late half-measures implemented, before the second and third waves - when health experts saw them coming?  Why has so much of the discourse been over economic recovery measures instead of health measures while case numbers have steadily increased?  Why is our health minister absent for so many of these press conferences?  (I can guess - too busy messing with health care jobs and/or isn't trusted by anyone in health care) I know we need hope, but let's not delude ourselves...  

Personally, I would be more hopeful if we didn't have the worst per-capita numbers in the country - and we need real hope, not fairy-tales or more empty promises from this government. (Edit - to my downvoter - my wife is a RN at her wit's end at work, with a Celine Dion ticket I bought for her two Christmases ago, postponed to this coming August, so believe you-me - we're hopeful for the best-case scenario...we're just disappointed in those who seem to be glossing over the present need for pandemic-prudency, including the government.)

...comment from u/demerits780 Northern Alberta

""Great reply, should be its own post. I’m still holding onto the hope to see Rage Against the Machine live but am grossly disappointed with the misplaced optimism going on right now. It’s utter insanity to me we’re talking about Calgary Stampede being an essential event, while we’ve never been at a worse point in the pandemic ever. 2021 is a complete write-off. And for what? 1 shitty rodeo and beers on a patio? Just asinine.""

OP Editorial - Please be aware that once the pandemic has abated, Kenney, Shandro and Toews intend to take full credit for any recovery and plan to then proceed to eliminate thousands of valued healthcare jobs in Alberta, along with any employment standards (even for Doctors) which accompanied them. Write your MLA if you disagree with this, or email if you prefer...

The Ministry of Health - Shandro, Tyler - 780 427-3665 [health.minister@gov.ab.ca](mailto:health.minister@gov.ab.ca)

The Ministry of Finance - Toews, Travis - 780 415-4855 [tbf.minister@gov.ab.ca](mailto:tbf.minister@gov.ab.ca)

These people need to back-up their back-handed compliments to health care with true respect, genuine trust, and respectful legislation for their rights as the heroes these workers are to the cause of public health. Doctors, nurses, and anyone who gives a cent of a damn for you at a hospital deserves better, during and even after the pandemic. Hospitals are bursting at their seams in the third wave - don't buy the fairy tale of recovery until we can honestly say we're reducing the number of deaths and are no longer the worst-of-the-worst per-capita as a province for dealing with this tragedy.

Use them as a tool to break free of the day-in, day-out grind to make rent that has been my existence for far too long. Depression, addiction, loneliness, hopelessness, the list goes on. I know them all too well. But. COVID happened. I was given the gift of free time and free money. I got sober and healthy. Then the whole GameStop thing happened. I think that was a spark for many people. I made a little money in that event, but more importantly, I realized that I could make money in the market, and that it’s all a game, truly. That shift in my thinking about money in general was a revolution for me, figuring out how to play the money game became fun. Like a puzzle. Fast-forward a few months to now: I’ve been in the markets everyday, reading books on finance every day, obsessed, determined to make this happen. I made some money and lost some money. I’ve made good investments and bad investments, but I’ve learned so much in the process. One thing I know now: we can break the pattern that we’re all dying to get out of. It’s possible. I also know now that we, the human race, is on the brink of a financial revolution, if we’re not already in one. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech in general is going to radically change the way people do things- everything- and soon. Some of you might know way more than I do, and I apologize for the wall of text. Anyway- just to wrap this up: SafeMoon is the golden ticket in my mind. It’s a brand new, super cheap token that is just EXPLODING. It’s kind of like a 401k on steroids in that it pays you to hold onto it. I’ve gotten my whole family and all of my close friends on board. We’re all up at least 10%, and it’s only. just. beginning. 
rule #1: never risk more than you can lose. Rule #2 do your own research. Rule #3 don’t panic sell. Crypto is extremely volatile and you need to emotionally prepare yourself for that. Don’t act in fear. If you feel confident in an investment, don’t sell at a loss. Diamond hands. 
Head over to r/Safemoon, the Discord server, and Safemoon.net for info. 
P.s. There are plenty of other coins too, I just think that Safemoon is literally a once in a lifetime, life changing opportunity. No hyperbole. It’s too good to be true, but it’s true anyway. There’s no catch. I’m confident that I’ve figured out how to live the life I’ve always dreamed of, but never thought was possible. 
Teach yourself and your loved ones about crypto because now is the time to get ahead of the curve. Good luck to you all!"

Is an MBA right for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/munek3/is_an_mba_right_for_me/,hyperxenophiliac,1,2021-04-20 18:30:13,0,/r/MBA/comments/munek3/is_an_mba_right_for_me/,Careers/Post Grad,"Non-American, non EU white male here. Graduated from a target university in my home region but relatively unknown internationally, 3.64 GPA. 

4 years out from uni, currently working as an expat at a Big 3 ratings agency in an economics/finance hybrid role. I have a pretty good life: making just above six figures with almost no tax, live by myself in a nice place, able to basically go out and do what I want while still saving solid cash. Job is genuinely interesting with loads of travel (pre-covid) and, while there are periods when it's super intense, I imagine it's nothing like the consistent stress of more deal focused roles. 

The problem is, as much as I like my job it feels very niche, so I feel like if I stay much longer I'm going to really narrow my future options. While I learned a lot of general skills really quickly early on (Microsoft Office, financial modelling, data management, overall macro understanding etc), and have also been studying the CFA in my spare time, this year it feels like the learning curve has flattened. I just feel like my life has stopped ""progressing"", if you get what I mean. 

So I'm looking at doing an MBA potentially in the next couple of years, assuming I was able to get into a solid school either in US (ideally M7) or Europe (INSEAD looks cool). The problem is, I don't really know what I want to do afterwards. Consulting appeals to me, especially if I was able to recruit into another international office like Dubai or somewhere, but I'm not really sure if I'd have the background to be competitive for the best roles. I'd be able to pay for everything without taking on debt which lowers some of the risk, but it would clean me out. 

The alternative is I just keep on keeping on with what I'm doing, and just hope that keeping my head down and being decent at what I do will open career doors.

I know it isn't exactly the norm (other than on this subreddit), I love, love, love eating pussy, and seeing a woman in pleasure is the most attractive thing in the world. 

I have a strong affinity for the female body.. I love everything about it, every curve, every natural scent, taste... 

I pride myself in being patient, working with partners who were previously too nervous to cum.. or willing to let go. 

Not only do I love feeling the pleasure and intimacy when I'm buried between your legs.. but I also love the wetness.. the amazing, delicious musky scent.. And of course.. the taste..

Sometimes I enjoy it more than sex. And to have you spread your legs and allow me to taste you sounds like heaven to me..

[$GME Retail Investor Convention 2022](https://preview.redd.it/iqbeu2nt5cu61.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d76ae6afcd2be26c207de6a843fece12ec70622)

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimers: 

What I am not: I'm not a professional working in finance; I'm not a quant. I'm not providing financial advice. I just like the stock and I like analyzing this financial anomaly with you all. &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

Who am I (background and qualifications)?: I have a graduate degree in a science field and I've taken several classes on statistics and other higher level mathematics classes. I've been a retail investor for years. Read several books on the topic of investing but, again, I am no expert.

&amp;#x200B;

Forward: I would like to thank the mods of this community for their volunteer service and dedication. I would also ask that we maintain a level of decorum when discussing differing opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

OK I've seen a lot of chatter about price floors, trend analysis, etc. and all of this is really getting under my skin. As a community that **REALLY** likes the stock and enjoys a purely academic discussion of $GME, I would **STRONGLY** urge the community to **AVOID CONFUSING SPECULATION FOR CERTAINTY**. Especially when one of us who has a strong following makes certain assertions. Let me address one BIG assertion that I've seen recently:

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. ""THE PRICE FLOOR/PEAK STATISTICALLY CAN'T BE BIGGER THAN $XXXX PRICE BECAUSE OF THIS DISTRIBUTION CURVE""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I really do not want to make a scarecrow argument here. If I've misrepresented this argument, please critique me!!

&amp;#x200B;

OK so what is a probability distribution/Gaussian Curve and when should you use it as a model?

&amp;#x200B;

Because I'm lazy, I'll just quote Investopeida because they do a good job at explaining it:

 A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a [random variable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/random-variable.asp) can take within a given range. This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors. These factors include the distribution's mean (average), [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp), [skewness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skewness.asp), and [kurtosis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kurtosis.asp). 

Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probabilitydistribution.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probabilitydistribution.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of a probability distribution curve for rolling a six-sided die](https://preview.redd.it/c3d7izde9cu61.png?width=2902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1edf964537c7a516813dcaa4d33ff459453cd0a)

OK so we can use a statistical function to predict the likelihood of a value reaching a specific number based on data such as the mean and standard deviation, etc. Because stocks are bound by a floor of 0 and can have virtually infinitely high returns, stocks will actually have a log-normal distribution which deviates from a perfectly symmetrical distribution about the mean:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/log-normal-distribution.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/log-normal-distribution.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's an important question to always ask yourself in any science field: ""What assumptions am I making and are they valid or reasonable in this instance?""** 

&amp;#x200B;

Or for our purposes: where does this data come from and how do we arrive at these statistical models? My understanding is that members of our community are using historical data from $GME to attempt to predict the likelihood of the share price reaching $1,000, $5,000, ... $10,000,000 per share. These individuals are seeing that the distribution curve basically states that even $100,000 is virtually impossible so they are concluding that this price target won't occur.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS A TERRIBLY INCORRECT ASSUMPTION!!

&amp;#x200B;

Why would you use **historical data** (that is **heavily manipulated** and basically follows the whims of some set of unknown institutions) to predict an **UNPRECEDENTED, ANOMALOUS, AND GIGANTIC SQUEEZE?!** Answer: you absolutely shouldn't! That'd be like asking Issac Newton to predict what the fuck will happen inside a black hole after he made his initial calculations giving us Newtonian physics. It's just fucking dumb (sorry I'm getting a little too heated here).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Einstein and Newton having a gentleman's discussion over physics \(1950\)](https://preview.redd.it/z4sgjrq8gcu61.png?width=301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b11b594d31f48ce7c041a7563f4e9ef0f1815f)

&amp;#x200B;

So how should we estimate the peak of the squeeze? Do I look like a fucking quant that placed first in a Chinese national math competition?!

&amp;#x200B;

[I am not this guy. And if I was, I wouldn't be on Reddit trying to piece this puzzle together.](https://preview.redd.it/ah8hyovafcu61.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=983535f7af2c5e6eae44f6e59141272da2b9acba)

So what do we know? First, I think we can all agree that this stock is so heavily shorted that it is a fucking financial atomic bomb. Second, I think we can all agree that retail holds a very, very large number of shares. To the point that this wouldn't be possible if it that wasn't so. Third, we know that if retail doesn't sell during the squeeze, the price will go higher and higher and...you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of misinformed apes say, ""ThE StoCk CanT geT to $XXXXX! ThAt'D maKe ThE mARkeT caP gReATer ThAn $X Trillion! GME iSn'T WorTH That MuCh!""

 

Again, you're making assumptions on how stocks NORMALLY behave. This is a fucking MOASS. Those assumptions do not apply here.

&amp;#x200B;

Recall that the 2008 VW squeeze ""didn't make sense"" in this matter either:

 ""VW's stock briefly touched €1,005 ($1,261) yesterday, making the company the most valuable in the world at roughly €295 billion, or $369 billion, temporarily exceeding Exxon-Mobil's $343 billion market capitalization. "" Source: [https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1030062\_volkswagen-shares-spike-over-1250-to-become-most-valuable-company-in-world](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1030062_volkswagen-shares-spike-over-1250-to-become-most-valuable-company-in-world)

&amp;#x200B;

Did it ""make sense"" that VW was the most valuable company in the world at the time? NO! But that's how squeezes work, ya retards. And yes I know that $GME isn't VW but fuck off we need something to compare it to in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also seen posts like, ""If the price hits $X Million then it'll crash the world economy! There isn't enough money in the world to support all those sales!""

&amp;#x200B;

No fucking duh. Virtually no one will sell 100 % at the peak because no one knows where it will peak. The best commentary I've seen is this ""geometric mean"" DD: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations\_for\_the\_total\_payout\_of\_gme\_based\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/)

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are far too many variables to be able to have any certainty here. And anyone saying ""it'll be at no more than $X"" is just **purely speculating**.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do? How do you know where the peak could be?

&amp;#x200B;

First, I would like to say that it doesn't fucking matter what ""your price floor is"" or what some website stays it should be. What matters is what the majority of retail do when it ""reaches that magic number"". That's what will determine the peak. I've determined what I think my shares SHOULD BE WORTH (which is a really fucking high number, by the way) which will be a tool for me to determine when to think about selling (or preparing to). But also, I'm going to follow the advice below to avoid being a bag holder and attempting to sell waaaay too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

Excellent advice on MOASS preparation:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mm5qle/the\_moass\_preparation\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mm5qle/the_moass_preparation_guide/)

&amp;#x200B;

Exit strategies that I will use:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m0r4kg/gme\_exit\_strategy\_here\_is\_what\_i\_not\_we\_i\_am/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m0r4kg/gme_exit_strategy_here_is_what_i_not_we_i_am/)

(yes this is using technical analysis but it's the best we got imo)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anther big assertion that's bugging me is this:

# 

# 2. Attempting to perform a technical analysis of the price movement via Elliott wave theory, or ""resistance""/""support"" curves, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we can all agree that this stock is HEAVILY MANIPULATED. So why the fuck would we think $GME is going to follow the typical rules for how a stock's price should fluctuate and thus use TA to make predictions? We shouldn't!! So stop trying to get into the weeds to predict when and how on a day-to-day basis. It's fucking driving the community crazy imo because it's just using bad assumptions and junk data (in this instance. For ""normal"" stocks this type of TA is perfectly valid).

&amp;#x200B;

So what DD has the best assumptions regarding when and how this will pop off?

&amp;#x200B;

This makes the most sense. We are all on the tendy train and Valhalla is the destination for sure. However, I believe that we are railroaded. The powers that be won't allow this atomic bomb to detonate and destroy the world economy. Yes, some firms will be evaporated in the blast but this will be a controlled explosion (at least as much as is possible). This reason is why I believe the SEC has seemingly done nothing so far. Everyone is getting their shit together to prepare for this and no one want's to be blamed for letting it go worse than 2008.

In 2014 I left Brazil and moved to Europe to try a better life. Being a South American without a European passport is tough out here, and for years I had to work as a cleaner, litter picker, waiter, barista, bartender, card dealer, dance teacher, you name it... just to try and pay my bills. Never had a chance to think about my future because I was living from paycheck to paycheck.

**In 2017 I got in contact with crypto**. After reading about it and getting interested in the technology, I registered on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org) forum and started to sell translation services to ICOs, in exchange for cryptos (mostly shitcoins or useless tokens). Crypto allowed me to have some sort of a side hustle (even though I couldn't pay my bills with shitcoins). I would then wait for months on end until some of the tokens would be listed on any exchange and quickly try to sell it for ETH or BTC. Slowly slowly my portfolio started to grow, while I would continue researching for more opportunities to get my hands on more crypto. It became like a healthy addiction, I even tried my luck on Bitmex and lost a lot of money there.

**Cut short to today:** I now have a diverse portfolio, allowing me to HODL some of my crypto and with some others invest in platforms like Nexo, or Uniswap/Curve. I have funds in some cryptogames that now generate passive income while helping create mass adoption for crypto via gaming. My savings are slowly multiplying before my eyes, and I feel powerful and hopeful for the future, *like I never could*. I'm planning to buy a house soon and I can't even begin to BELIEVE I can do it. Crypto also gave me visibility into freelancing as a side-hustle, and because of that I landed some amazing gigs that helped grow my stack even more.

# Thank you, cryptocurrencies.

The whole point of having a decentralised currency is to give power to the common man, and I can't believe I'm experiencing it. I'm so happy. I want to go back to my country and start helping people. I want to help educate the regular Johns about crypto and the power it holds, and how it can empower poor countries. I want to teach kids about finance, about patience, about hardwork with creativity, about never giving up.

Crypto inspires me, and I hope it keeps inspiring this community and the whole world!"
The risks and rewards of a bullish and cautious exit strategy during a short squeeze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv1li7/the_risks_and_rewards_of_a_bullish_and_cautious/,More_Math_Please,1,2021-04-21 06:02:01,7,/r/Superstonk/comments/mv1li7/the_risks_and_rewards_of_a_bullish_and_cautious/,DD 👨‍🔬,"**Introduction**

This is my first post (including comments) on Reddit. I learned about GME at the end of January and had an acute case of FOMO. The drop in February came in heavy, but the excellent DD made me average down (and later up) and I reached a low XXX status.

The discussion on this subreddit regarding a cautious and a bullish exit strategy during a short squeeze missed common ground of facts to reach its full potential. The goal of this DD is to contribute to this common ground. This post is purely academic, and is NOT financial advise. It is also NOT a call (or allusion) for a common strategy! Furthermore, it is assumed (not stated as a fact) that a short squeeze occurs. Finally, it is not the goal of this post to be exhaustive in identifying risks and rewards.

I have no formal education nor professional domain knowledge in finance. Furthermore, I’m prone to making errors. I look forward to the peer review of this text to increase my knowledge on the matter and correct my mistakes.  

**Conditions influencing the price**

Figure 1 shows how shares can be distributed over insiders (INS), institutions bounded to not sell (Institutional (B) – ETF,...), institutions free to sell (Institutional (F) – HF,…) and retail. Note that the 70M mark is placed arbitrary.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1 – Schematic overview of ownership](https://preview.redd.it/yi592fqneeu61.png?width=4237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec3eb864ed89c4cd0c0ff672c0983566a0f9d46e)

Figure 2 shows the process of short hedge funds, institutions and traders (SHITs in short) covering short positions by buying shares, either real ones or I.O.U.’s. assuming that this does not matter. The bought share can be returned to the lender, reducing the number of outstanding and shorted shares by one.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2 – Schematic overview of covering shorts by buying.](https://preview.redd.it/wh87burueeu61.png?width=4237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31c71f2edd8f4d1804816b155120b2f11aa115f)

Consider a possible desired sell price distribution (figure 3) during a short squeeze in which all SHITs are margin called and buy at any price the market sets. Furthermore, assume that all institutions (F) have a lower price compared to retail. The horizontal line represent shares that are not available “before the peak” and are located at infinity. Every share left from the red line is sold during a short squeeze. Notice that the price axis can be logarithmic and that I don’t put a scale on this axis. This analysis assumes that the curve is static (does not change during the squeeze) and that the only trades involved are covering short positions by forced buying. Under these assumptions, the desired price curve left of the red line can also be the price of the stock.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3 - A possible desired \(for each shareholder\) sell price distribution.](https://preview.redd.it/xlt24lcyeeu61.png?width=4665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22e9b1c024385be57686007cf260696914c53493)

The following conclusions can be made:

1. **Cautious 	case:** even if retail owns more than the float, not every share can be sold at the desired price. The shares on the right evolve towards price equilibrium matching the fundamentals.
2. **Bullish 	case:** if the number of shares sold after the peak (horizontal line at the right) exceeds the float, no peak price can be determined in this plot. This would allow for very bullish price action under these assumptions.

**Enter a new player:**

It is not unlikely that new SHITs enter during (the end of) a short squeeze. The reward of shorting is substantial and plenty of shares are available to borrow (at a low rate?) due to the covering. It can be also considered a “smArT mONeY”  trophy  to successfully short the downturn of the short squeeze. The risk of shorting lies in the remaining upward price action of the stock, however the process of shorting creates a downward pressure on the price. The forced covering of the last shorts can be provided by the selling of newly shorted shares from new SHITs. Once the price start dropping due to this short selling, the risk reduces for the new SHITs and their margin increases to short more. This unstable feedback can result in a very steep drop after the peak. (a.k.a. the falling piano) Hence, there is risk involved in selling after the peak.

A counter argument mentioned in other posts is that previous short squeezes have had a long enough descend to sell. The mechanism behind a slow descend is not clear to me. If only short covering happens, I see even no reason for a descend until each short has covered.

**Conclusion:**

**TL;DR:** Both the bullish and cautious exit strategy during a short squeeze make sense under certain conditions. However, it is up to every Ape to balance potential gain and risk.

I value DD and learning above all and I believe knowledge and transparency levels the playing field. Knowing the short position and the retail ownership with respect to the float would shed much light on the to be expected volatility.

I most likely made mistakes in this DD and I surely missed assumptions. I would love to read your feedback in the comments."

Do not let anyone tell you otherwise! You are changing lives, you are breaking records (and infrastructures \*cough\* \*cough\*), you are MAKING HISTORY!   


In our last post,  [Managing your SAFEMOON expectations: How to stop sniffing glue and get rich instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/mm2ee3/managing_your_safemoon_expectations_how_to_stop/),  we looked at how can we have a healthier relationship with our SAFEMOON expectations. We discussed selling pressure, market cap, and those sweet, sweet X gains. And as our investments sit calmly in a time capsule, our influence on this Epic Crypto Saga is far from exhausted. Because, in truth, we all can speed up the course of Time.   
 

Let’s dive right into it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lesson #1 – To innovate is to slaughter oneself**

Remember the 90s boom of the Internet? Here are just two infamous snippets of history:

[Flashback! The Internet In 1995 | Archives | TODAY - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95-yZ-31j9A)

[What is Internet ? Explained by Bill Gates 1995 | Funny Video | David Letterman Show | Must Watch - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk)

Your eyes. What do you see?

Your ears. What do you hear?

Your soul. What do you feel? 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s easy to laugh at David Letterman, The Media, and whole of Society from where we stand today. Because we all walked through time. We are almost three decades in the future from where Bill Gates was enduring mockery and ridicule by the ignorant Collective. 

Being on the edge of innovation, you will be attacked. You will be ridiculed. **You will be slaughtered**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your ego – gone.

Your pride – scorched.

Your peace – decimated.

Your integrity – Intact. Immovable. Indomitable. 

This is what matters, fellow astronauts. Your confidence has manifested through your investment. You are already ahead of the curve. You are leading through innovation. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lesson #2 – Confidence kills ridicule**

Step outside. Look around. 

Life. Humanity. Industry. Economy. Finance. Entertainment. All deeply embedded in our daily routine, so much that we have grown numb to their existence. To the Meta. To the invisible threads and structures in which we have navigated for centuries. And yet we resort in them every day!

&amp;#x200B;

We have bills. We go shopping. We watch movies. We pay for sex and buy flowers for our loved ones after.

&amp;#x200B;

**We experience.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is you. The local supermarket. The cashier grabs roughly that unpacked piece of lettuce and rib-eye steak you will be having for dinner. \*Beep\*. – “That will be 25 dollars and 34 cents”. 

Your wallet. A rusty-looking slim full-leather Montblanc comes out of your pocket. It catches the eye of the next in line, and their subtle smile inscapes your gaze. You might as well invite them for dinner? Anyway.

Time to pay. 

\- “Excuse me”, you unexpectedly say, “Do you take SAFEMOON?”. 

\- “I beg your pardon?”, the cashier replies.

\- “SAFEMOON. Can I pay with SAFEMOON here?”, you answer back in a grounded, yet demanding voice. 

\- “SAFE… what?”, the cashier bursts into laugher, evidently amused by the name. 

Yet you know that laugh comes from a place of confusion. From a place of embarrassment and discomfort.

\- “SAFEMOON. I’d like to pay for my lettuce and steak. And that bottle of whiskey behind you. The red one. I will have it”.

The cashier’s face quickly turns to stone. Seriousness has now engulfed every wrinkle from top to bottom. 

\- “I am sorry. We only accept Euros here. What is this SAFEMOON you are talking about?”

Your wallet unfolds. You place your credit card on the terminal, and while maintaining respectful eye contact with the cashier, you pierce through: “SAFEMOON. Google it. It will change your life”.   
   
 

\*Beep\*. The payment goes through. You smile back at the next in line, who has been a witness this whole time. You bid farewell to the cashier and go home to enjoy your dinner. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lesson #3 – Word-of-mouth**

You are a nuclear weapon. An atomic bomb of influence. An ambassador with an audience of millions.  


Think. How impactful was your encounter with the cashier? What about the bystander waiting behind you in line? 

The reality is that marketing is most effective when it is not forced. When it comes from a place of integrity. When it is humanized. Social media campaigns, as effective as they are for short-term hype, ultimately fail to engage and empower the audience for long-term commitment. Here is a useful read on the topic by Forbes, who already saw the diminishing returns of social platforms back in 2014:  [Why Word Of Mouth Marketing Is The Most Important Social Media (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2014/07/17/why-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-the-most-important-social-media/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Through your actions, you create impact. The cashier will go back to their family, friends, loved ones. They will tell the story of you from that day. They will tell the story of SAFEMOON. Why? 

Because it was extraordinary, yet it felt just in the right place. 

Because it was funny, yet serious. 

Because it was crazy, yet real.   


Through your confidence shines your investment. Through your confidence shines You.   


Start shining Every Single Day. With every cashier. With every clerk. With every tinder *prospect* you take out on a Thursday. 

Write to your bank. Write to your landlord. Write to your gas company. 

**Ask them about SAFEMOON. Engage with them. Equip them with the knowledge of SAFEMOON. Empower them.**  


Will it be embarrassing at first? Sure. 

Was asking your high-school sweetheart on a date embarrassing? ...

  
Confidence and flow will come with practice. My first cashier encounter a week ago was a train wreck of an embarrassment. By the time I go to the third one, I was already writing [SAFEMOON.NET](https://SAFEMOON.NET) on napkins, like a pimp.  


People will believe you if you believe in yourself. And you already do. Because you are here.   


**You are SAFEMOON.**  


And if you ever start to question where all of this is going, where the Crypto world is going, where our SAFEMOON family is going - just remember the silly looking Bill Gates from 1995 and his ramblings. 

And then recognize yourself in him.  


Where are you now?"
Is the Ethereum protocol exhibiting predatory behavior? A Wednesday morning hype thread.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mvdrk2/is_the_ethereum_protocol_exhibiting_predatory/,Shatter_Hand,1,2021-04-21 19:37:59,79,/r/ethereum/comments/mvdrk2/is_the_ethereum_protocol_exhibiting_predatory/,NaN,"


It’s 1996. Google is two years from founding. Amazon is reselling books. Video streaming is possible, if you own a 56k modem, live in a major city, are rich, and possess the technical know how to complete the several steps. President Clinton is “[B]uilding that bridge to the year two-*tha*sand.”

Good old ‘96, Tupac has been shot dead and the three largest companies listed on any US stock exchange (by market cap) are car manufacturers: GM, Ford, and Chrysler, respectively. Yeah, that’s hard to believe. 

We’ve talked about *fat protocol thesis* on this sub previously. So for those that know what it is, bear with me again while I briefly explain it for those that don’t: 

*The internet is a protocol. Value flows from its protocol to its applications. Google, Amazon, etcetera are its applications. Over time, they’ve become valuable. In cryptocurrency protocols however, value flows in the opposite direction, from the application layer to the protocol. Thus the name: fat protocol theory. Yes it’s just a theory, but so is gravity. It’s easy then, to imagine why Ethereum is uniquely positioned amongst its competition to capture so much value, because of all that’s built on it, its ecosystem. 

What’s interesting about the internet and its applications capturing value, is that we didn’t see that really begin until the late 90s. In the early-mid 90s, things were only arranging or jockeying themselves to an unknown future, so obvious to us now. And remember the ferocious competition? Anyone? That’s a book itself. Most of the companies went bankrupt, some merged, others were bought out. The ones that survived are global household names. 

It’s difficult to avoid then, comparing Ethereum and cryptocurrencies to this time period, because it’s mirroring it in lockstep. Ah the 90s. Remember its tech rockstars? Of course you do, they’re still around imposing their will in various ways. In crypto we have one living rockstar (unless Satoshi is alive): Vitalik Buterin. And that’s...not insignificant either folks, not in the culture we live in, not for Ethereum’s early days. For the younger people out there, what’s happening in crypto now is basically your chance to live, in some telling, the 90s tech boom, from which half of the top 10 wealthiest US people come:

 - Bezos
 - Gates
 - Page
 - Ellison
 - Brin

So don’t squander it watching on the sidelines. It’s still so new. Yolo in.

Let’s consider the last crypto bull cycle. Question: What crypto’s that were top ten in 2017, are top ten now? Only two: BTC and ETH (LTC is in and out of the top ten on any given week, having fallen 6 places from what was historically an unshakeable #3 position). But here’s the curious thing: if we expand that list to say the top 50, how many are ERC tokens? 33 are. The Ethereum network is starting to arrange and position itself. They [ERC tokens] now dominate the mid-tier of that list and are moving relentlessly upwards. USDC and ChainLink for example (both ERC), could break into the top ten soon. That would put three ERC tokens (ETH, LINK, USDC) in the top ten, and that is much more substantial than people think. How about visualizing the data in a different way: if we use the total crypto mkt cap which is approximately $2T, we see the entire Ethereum ecosystem makes up $500B or 25% of it. That’s more than a double percentage gain (almost triple actually) what it was in 2017. Bitcoin and Tether have a top ten relationship too. But USDC now has a mkt cap ~28% of Tether’s and gaining fast. Why is this happening? That was unthinkable just two years ago. And about BTC, the wrapped version (WBTC, an ERC token) is top 20 and moving up. That’s predatory, because the Ethereum Network is finding solutions to chew on things not natively built on it. Now, Ethereum will never eat Bitcoin anymore than Bing will eat Google (but Bing only exists because of antitrust laws), so a better analogy might be what email did to the USPS—didn’t kill it, but syphoned its small cost efficient property. I won’t even bother getting into the NFT market because it’s too nascent, but again, Ethereum is positioned to add this predatory wrinkle better than any other. Our century is young, and in these early days of crypto, unless you’re named BTC, innovation lag will kill you. 

What’s my point? My point is that like the internet and its value flow, the Ethereum protocol isn’t past 1996 yet. I don’t believe we’re seeing *fat protocol thesis* at work...not yet. And that’s a subject to ponder, because heretofore, there’s been a belief that it is. It’s important to add, that many scholars believe the thesis to be wrong and unprovable, including my economics professor. They’re right too, but only because the timeline data is too small, the thesis hasn’t had time to develop (as opposed to grow), because Amazon is still reselling books, AWS (Amazon Web Services Cloud) hasn’t democratized starting a small online business, Google doesn’t exist, ruthless competition is still killing things before they begin because the young galaxy is still full of space rocks, and global users are a small landlocked lake, not oceans yet...there’s less than 1M *active* Ethereum wallets.

My other point is that one has to wonder with trends so linear, wether holding anything besides Bitcoin, ERC, or privacy coin is worth it. I’m unconvinced, which is why I don’t. I’d also be concerned about how many potential major ETF’s are now considering structuring themselves: instead of an *Ethereum ETF* made of ETH, they’ll be made of a rotational basket of the Ethereum Network’s top tokens. Too, when some ETF’s start offering baskets of all crypto’s, how many ERC tokens do you imagine will be in there if current trends hold?


Remember the top three US companies we talked about in 1996? Well, by the early 2000’s, tech companies (what we defined earlier as internet applications) began dominating the mid-tier list of largest US companies, some making it quite high. And integrated oil-majors (Exxon, Chevron, etc) replaced the car companies as the largest by mkt cap, you know the ones selling the *gas*? No point here actually, besides the pun. 

Note: I promise I’ll try bringing this all around to make sense. So let’s continue this senseless ramble: 

After the 2008 economic crisis (which lasted some years) an unexpected group of companies staged a sudden move up the mkt cap rankings: Banks. Why? Quantitative Easing, zero percent interest rates, and loose central bank monetary policy on a global scale. It’s no coincidence that at this same time, Bitcoin came into existence. But, those damn longterm *internet applications* accruing value...

Right, so fast-forward to today. Go to your brokerage and find the top companies by market cap on any stock exchange. What are they? Bingo:

 - Apple
 - Microsoft
 - Amazon
 - Alphabet 
 - Google
 - Facebook

They’ve all finally made it. The difference is, they’re unlikely to be replaced by anything unrelated. They shouldn’t be. Not for a generation, right? Wrong. Most will be replaced from the top spots because they’ll be weakened by a DAO Web 3.0 predator that syphons, feeds, borrows, steals, learns, wraps, experiments, fails, merges, digitizes, and innovates at a pace that’s impossible to keep up with. And for good measure, add in the fact that it began as, and is unified with finance. **Its imagination will never overreach its supply of money.** On a global scale, that’s insane. At least that’s the longterm view of Ethereum. What replaces the top company’s spots is anyone’s guess. If it’s Boston Dynamics I’ll know the end is near. If it’s a green energy breakthrough I’ll have hope. 


Thanks for reading. Just wanted to try cleaning my mind this morning. Now for some fun predictions a couple years out dealing with finance bits:

 - Ethereum’s gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (both promises of 2.0)

 - Hindsight data shows DeFi eroding chartered bank margins

 - Central banks are forced to combat China’s digital Yuan threat by rolling out their own digital fiat much faster than we thought

 -Bitcoin captures 50% of gold’s $10T mkt cap 

 - Fat protocol thesis is finally set loose

 - ERC tokens comprise 13 of the top 20 token spots. 

 - DeFi friction collapses and with it the learning curve

 - Country’s banks compete for global retail borrowing undercutting Ethereum’s staking rewards APY by 3% or more in some places

 - Cryptocurrency makes the platform of both major US political parties 

 - Digital fiat captures the stablecoin business and Tether collapses from their front end integration allowing the Ethereum Network (all ERC tokens combined) to make a run on Bitcoin’s mkt cap

 - Volatility continues to dissipate and wild speculation is gone, the global confidence curve of crypto is flat, longterm deflationary appreciation begins and “margin capture” of what were once traditional bank margins (profits) is the new speculation as YOU become the bank

 - Two major US banks consolidate/merge 

 - Ethereum’s next major upgrade hype is an on-chain oracle 

 - US Treasury sets up probate crypto address 

 - London is no longer the world’s forex Capitol, their failure to adapt to crypto and their innovation lag is devastating

 - ENS (Ethereum Name Service) finally gets its act together allowing WEB 3.0 to begin in earnest 

 - The forbidden coin (XMR) has its day entering the top ten as atomic swaps and privacy premiums spike value after decentralized platforms begin (ever so) softly merging with legacy finance

 - Manned moon mission data inadvertently raises serious questions about the veracity of previous manned moon missions"
Intro to CELR,https://www.reddit.com/r/CELRcoin/comments/mvik8v/intro_to_celr/,4inchwifi,1,2021-04-21 23:48:22,0,/r/CELRcoin/comments/mvik8v/intro_to_celr/,Community Building,"The mods of this subreddit have come together to make this post to give you newbies understanding of Celer network and why it's important and how to use, with that being said let's begin!

1. ""What is CELR?"" Celer network - an exciting new project that aims to help blockchains achieve ‘internet level scalability’ by using off-chain scaling techniques to reach billions of transactions per second in a secure and trusted environment. 
Or as many are starting to call it, ""The Modern Subway of the DeFi City"". With layer2.finance launching soon, here is an ELI5 writeup about how it works as a subway system in the DeFi City and cuts costs by 100X to earn yield from your favorite protocols like Compound, AAVE, yEarn, Curve, Uniswap and more! 

TL;DR: 
The entire DeFi ecosystem is like a city with many cool yield-earning shops. However, the only way to get around in it today is by hiring an expensive private limo (individual layer1 txs to provide liquidity). This prevents non-millionaires from benefiting from DeFi. 

layer2.finance is basically a subway network under DeFi City (the layer2 rollup scaling platform). Multiple people can get on the same train (i.e. pool liquidity on L1 and aggregate their demands to provide liquidity on L2) and split the costs of a single ride (one tx on L1).

It's 100% non-custodial because the whole subway system is built as a layer-2 rollup scaling platform. More importantly, it can dynamically expand to more stations and even more cities (other layer2 or layer1 chains) as the demands grow and the ecosystem evolves.

2. ""How does it work?"" - Layer2.finance, a Celer Network project that aims to bring mass audiences to the existing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem with layer-2 scaling technology. Layer2.finance acts as a low-cost and trust-free gateway for the “early majority” users to explore and benefit from the existing DeFi ecosystem without the concerns of high transaction (gas) costs offsetting their gains. 

Layer2.finance enables quadratic scaling of the existing layer-1 DeFi ecosystem “in-place” with no protocol migration needed and therefore, does not cause liquidity fragmentation or break composability. Layer2.finance achieves this using an optimized layer-2 rollup construct to aggregate N small-fish users’ fund allocation transactions on layer-2 into a single one on layer-1 in a trust-free fashion.

 Celer Network is developing an off-chain scaling solution to scale the various blockchains that will run on its platform.

Off-chain (or layer 2) scaling solutions are theoretically superior because they allow the network to process smaller transactions off the blockchain, then bundle them into one single transaction that gets recognized On-Chain. By doing this, they can reduce the transaction bottleneck that occurs on the main chain while increasing the operational capacity of the system as a whole.

The Celer Network architecture is named Cstack, and is composed of four layers:

cRoute– This uses DBR (distributed balanced routing) to distribute payment traffic in a decentralized and trust-free manner. cRoute can achieve 15x greater throughput than Raiden or the Lightning Network.
cOS– This is the off-chain Dapp development framework. It handles operations, storage, off-chain disputes, and tracking.
cChannel– This is a sidechain suite that is supposed to provide liquidity and assist rapid state transitions. The eChannel layer makes it possible for gaming applications, exchanges, insurance platforms, and other high throughput applications to function on Celer Network.

3. ""Why CELR matters to everyday people like you and me.""
CELR’s primary use case is as a platform currency, but it can also be used for other functions such as:

Proof of liquidity (PoLC) PoLC is a virtual mining process that provides liquidity for the off-chain ecosystem. Users who lock up CELR tokens for some time are later rewarded with more CELR tokens.

 Liquidity backing auction (LiBA) LiBA allows off-chain service providers to request liquidity through crowdlending (Interest rates are negotiated). There is a ranking system for lenders based on a “happiness score.” The score is determined by the interest rate, the amount of provisioned liquidity, and the amount of CELR staked. As a lender, the more CELR you stake, the higher priority you have to provide liquidity to off-chain service providers.

 State Guardian Network (SGN) SGN is a unique side chain that allows any user to submit their state before going offline to have it protected for a period of time. Users pay a fee for this protection. CELR token holders can stake their tokens to earn service fees for providing protection.

4. ""How can I learn to use the mainnet when it launches?""
A Test net platform was provided for a short period in order for people to trial. Some good feedback was received from users directly to Mo Dong (CEO of Celer Network) to help create a user friendly Mainnet upon launching. 
Mo Dong mentioned that he and his team is currently creating a user's guide for the mainnet. We will ensure that this video is shared with everyone as soon as it is available. 

Welcome to CelerNetwork and we hope to create a strong and positive culture to take us into the future. Enjoy the journey!.

EPS price will drop over time,https://www.reddit.com/r/ellipsisFinance/comments/mvs5p2/eps_price_will_drop_over_time/,Ill-You5544,1,2021-04-22 07:21:57,17,/r/ellipsisFinance/comments/mvs5p2/eps_price_will_drop_over_time/,NaN,"I have invested some good amount in EPS Ellipsis (as in staking) but what I have concluded with all the price action I've seen so far is as follow:
1. The higher interest rates serve to attract more staking and this will in turn result in downward price trend as more people will sell their profits.
2. Airdrop that curve people are getting are just free money further driving down prices.
3. Particularly to sustain such large amounts of profits being given for staking, it has to be balances somehow by reducing price of the token so that EPS guys can maintain a healthy balance as profits they got from selling at higher price.
4. Not sure about the total volume of tokens being issued and if it keeps on increasing, it would further drive the price down. (If someone has read the whitepaper I would appreciate their feedback, I'd try to do that myself as well over coming days)
5. Can someone confirm the thing about a single address holding 2bn worth EPS or something like that? There was this post about it a few days ago but didn't get a chance to get hold of it.
6. Unless it gets massive staking soree and exchange activity, the prices will go down. Well if they do get higher, we'll be seeing a significant drop in profit/ interest rate being offered on staking.

I am but a student. Will appreciate your feedback and any corrections that I can make in my opinion of EPS.

Yes, EPS is listed on Binance, but why there is no information about the team except for the fact that it's an official fork of curve finance with a very very basic vintage user interface.

Thanks."

Fundamentals.,"  **The Various Strategies of Hedge Funds**

*By* [*NEIL O'HARA*](https://www.investopedia.com/contributors/53324/)  *Reviewed by* [*ROGER WOHLNER*](https://www.investopedia.com/contributors/53618/) *Updated Jan 31, 2021* 

[Hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) are alternative investments that use market opportunities to their advantage. These funds require a larger initial investment than many other types of investments and generally are accessible only to [accredited investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp). That's because hedge funds require far less regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) than others like mutual funds. Most hedge funds are illiquid, meaning investors need to keep their money invested for longer periods of time, and withdrawals are often limited to certain periods of time.

As such, they use different strategies so their investors can earn active returns. But potential hedge fund investors need to understand how these funds make money and how much [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp) they take on when they buy into this financial product. While no two hedge funds are identical, most generate their returns using one or more of several specific strategies that we've outlined below.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Hedge funds are versatile investment vehicles that can use leverage, derivatives, and take short positions in stocks.
* Because of this, hedge funds employ various strategies to try to generate active returns for their investors.
* Hedge fund strategies range from long/short equity to market neutral.
* Merger arbitrage is a kind of event-driven strategy, which can also involve distressed companies.

## Long/Short Equity

The first hedge fund used a long/short equity strategy. Launched by Alfred W. Jones in 1949, this strategy is still in use on the lion’s share of equity hedge fund assets today.1﻿ The concept is simple: Investment research turns up expected winners and losers, so why not bet on both? Take [long positions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) in the winners as collateral to finance [short positions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) in the losers. The combined portfolio creates more opportunities for idiosyncratic (i.e. stock-specific) gains, reducing [market risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp) with the shorts offsetting long market exposure.

[Long/short equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp) is basically [an extension of pairs trading](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/090804.asp), in which investors go long and short on two competing companies in the same industry based on their relative valuations. It is a relatively low-risk leveraged bet on [the manager’s stock-picking skill](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/09/can-fund-managers-pick-stocks.asp).

For example, if General Motors (GM) looks cheap relative to Ford, a pairs [trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp) might buy $100,000 worth of GM and short an equal value of Ford shares. The net [market exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketexposure.asp) is zero, but if GM does outperform Ford, the investor will make money no matter what happens to the overall market.

Let's suppose Ford rises 20% and GM rises 27%. The trader sells GM for $127,000, covers the Ford short for $120,000 and pockets $7,000. If Ford falls 30% and GM falls 23%, they sell GM for $77,000, cover the Ford short for $70,000, and still pocket $7,000. If the trader is wrong and Ford outperforms GM, however, they will lose money.

## Market Neutral

Long/short equity hedge funds typically have [net long](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netlong.asp) market exposure, because most managers do not hedge their entire [long market value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longmarketvalue.asp) with short positions. The portfolio's unhedged portion may fluctuate, introducing an element of [market timing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/markettiming.asp) to the overall return. By contrast, market-neutral hedge funds target zero net-market exposure, or shorts and longs have an equal market value. This means managers generate their entire return from stock selection. This strategy has a lower risk than a long-biased strategy—but the [expected returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) are lower, too.

Long/short and market-neutral hedge funds struggled for several years after [the 2007 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp). Investor attitudes were often binary—risk-on (bullish) or risk-off (bearish). Besides, when stocks go up or down in unison, strategies that depend on stock selection don’t work. In addition, record-low interest rates eliminated earnings from the [stock loan rebate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-rebate.asp) or interest earned on cash collateral posted against borrowed stock sold short. The cash is lent out overnight, and the lending broker keeps a proportion.

This typically amounts to 20% of the interest as a fee for arranging the stock loan, while ""rebating"" the remaining interest to the borrower. If [overnight interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overnightrate.asp) are 4% and a market-neutral fund earns the typical 80% rebate, it will earn 3.2% per annum (0.04 x 0.8) before fees, even if the portfolio is flat. But when rates are near zero, so is the rebate.

## Merger Arbitrage

A riskier version of [market neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketneutral.asp), merger arbitrage derives its returns from [takeover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeover.asp) activity. That's why it's often considered one kind of event-driven strategy. After a share-exchange transaction is announced, the hedge fund manager may buy shares in the target company and short sell the buying company's shares at the ratio prescribed by the merger agreement. The deal is subject to certain conditions:

* Regulatory approval
* A favorable vote by the target company's shareholders
* No material adverse change in the target’s business or financial position

The target company's shares trade for less than the merger consideration's per-share value—a spread that compensates the investor for the risk of the transaction not closing, as well as for the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) until closing.

In [cash transactions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashtransaction.asp), the target company shares trade [at a discount](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-a-discount.asp) to the cash payable at closing, so the manager does not need to hedge. In either case, the spread delivers a return when the deal goes through, no matter what happens to the market. The catch? The buyer often pays a large premium over the pre-deal stock price, so investors face large losses when transactions fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Because merger arbitrage comes with uncertainty, hedge fund managers must fully evaluate these deals and accept the risks that come with this kind of strategy.

There is, of course, significant risk that comes with this kind of strategy. The merger may not go ahead as planned because of conditional requirements from one or both companies, or regulations may eventually prohibit the merger. Those who take part in this kind of strategy must, therefore, be fully knowledgeable about all the risks involved as well as the potential rewards.

## Convertible Arbitrage

Convertibles are hybrid securities that combine a [straight bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straight-bond.asp) with an equity option. A convertible arbitrage hedge fund is typically [long on convertible bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/introduction-convertible-bonds/) and short on a proportion of the shares into which they convert. Managers try to maintain a [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) position, in which the bond and stock positions offset each other as the market fluctuates. To preserve delta-neutrality, traders must increase their hedge, or sell more shares short if the price goes up and buy shares back to reduce the hedge if the price goes down. This forces them to buy low and sell high.

Convertible arbitrage thrives on volatility. The more the shares bounce around, the more opportunities arise to adjust the delta-neutral hedge and book trading profits. Funds thrive when volatility is high or declining, but struggle when volatility spikes—as it always does in times of market stress. Convertible arbitrage faces [event risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eventrisk.asp) as well. If an [issuer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuer.asp) becomes a takeover target, the [conversion premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversionpremium.asp) collapses before the manager can adjust the hedge, resulting in a significant loss.

## Event-Driven

On the border between equity and [fixed income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp) lie event-driven strategies. This kind of strategy works well during periods of economic strength when corporate activity tends to be high. With an event-driven strategy, hedge funds buy the debt of [companies that are in financial distress](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/distressed-debt-hedge-fund.asp) or have already filed for bankruptcy. Managers often focus on senior debt, which is most likely to be repaid at par or with the smallest [haircut](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/haircut.asp) in any reorganization plan.

If the company has not yet filed for bankruptcy, the manager may sell short equity, betting that the shares will fall either when it does file or when a negotiated equity-for-debt [swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) forestalls bankruptcy. If the company is already in bankruptcy, a [junior class of debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junior-debt.asp) entitled to a lower recovery upon [reorganization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reorganization.asp) may constitute a better hedge.

Investors in event-driven funds need to be able to take on some risk and also be patient. Corporate reorganizations don't always happen the way managers plan, and, in some cases, they may play out over months or even years, during which the troubled company’s operations may deteriorate. Changing financial-market conditions can also affect the outcome – for better or for worse.

## Credit

Capital structure arbitrage, similar to event-driven trades, also underlies most hedge fund credit strategies. Managers look for a [relative value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp) between the senior and junior securities of the same corporate issuer. They also trade securities of equivalent [credit quality](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditquality.asp) from different corporate issuers, or different tranches, in the complex capital of structured debt vehicles like mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) or collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Credit hedge funds focus on credit rather than interest rates. Indeed, many managers sell short [interest rate futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestratefuture.asp) or [Treasury bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp) to hedge their rate exposure.

Credit funds tend to prosper when [credit spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditspread.asp) narrow during robust [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp) periods. But they may suffer losses when the economy slows and spreads blow out.

## Fixed-Income Arbitrage

Hedge funds that engage in fixed-income arbitrage eke out returns from risk-free [government bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp), eliminating [credit risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp). Remember, investors who use arbitrage to buy assets or securities on one market, then sell them on a different market. Any profit investors make is a result of a discrepancy in price between the purchase and sale prices.

Managers, therefore, make leveraged bets on how the shape of the [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) will change. For example, if they expect long rates to rise relative to short rates, they will sell short long-dated bonds or [bond futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondfutures.asp) and buy short-dated securities or interest rate futures.

These funds typically use high [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) to boost what would otherwise be modest returns. By definition, leverage increases the risk of loss when the manager is wrong.

## Global Macro

Some hedge funds analyze how macroeconomic trends will affect interest rates, currencies, commodities, or equities around the world, and take long or short positions in whichever [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) is most sensitive to their views. Although global macro funds can trade almost anything, managers usually prefer highly liquid instruments such as futures and [currency forwards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyforward.asp).

Macro funds don’t always hedge, but managers often take big directional bets—some never pan out. As a result, returns are among the most volatile of any hedge fund strategy.

## Short-Only

The ultimate directional traders are short-only hedge funds—the professional pessimists who devote their energy to finding [overvalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp) stocks. They scour financial statement footnotes and talk to suppliers or competitors to unearth any signs of trouble possibly ignored by investors. Hedge fund managers occasionally score a home run when they [uncover accounting fraud](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/detecting-financial-fraud.asp) or some other [malfeasance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/malfeasance.asp).

Short-only funds can provide a portfolio hedge against [bear markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp), but they are not for the faint of heart. Managers face a permanent handicap: They must overcome the long-term upward bias in the [equity market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitymarket.asp).

## Quantitative

Quantitative hedge fund strategies look to [quantitative analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp) (QA) to make investment decisions. QA is a technique that seeks to understand patterns using mathematical and statistical modeling, measurement, and research relying on large data sets. Quantitative hedge funds often leverage technology to crunch the numbers and automatically make trading decisions based on mathematical models or machine learning techniques. These funds may be considered ""[black boxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackbox.asp)"" since the internal workings are obscure and proprietary. [High-frequency trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-frequency-trading.asp) (HFT) firms that trade investor money would be examples of quantitative hedge funds.

## The Bottom Line

Investors should conduct extensive [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) before they commit money to any hedge fund. Understanding which strategies the fund uses, as well as its [risk profile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-profile.asp), is an essential first step.

Question about starting a crypto research startup,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mw86xi/question_about_starting_a_crypto_research_startup/,unstopablex5,1,2021-04-23 00:08:52,9,/r/ethfinance/comments/mw86xi/question_about_starting_a_crypto_research_startup/,Strategy,"So I just wanted to preface this with I am 21 and im pursuing a computer science degree.

I've always been interested in tech but I never dove into cryptocurrencies. I had crypto in my peripherals from about 2012-2015 or so but I really started reading into it back in 2016-2017. I didn't really understand it but I got the high-level basics and thought it was really cool. Anyways after the crash I lost some of my heat for it but always thought it was an interesting field and I should dive into it more.

Now snap back to 2020-2021 with covid giving me a lot more free time than I knew what to do with I dove fully into crypto. I read the bitcoin whitepaper, everything on [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/) and more. I would like to think i have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of the crypto space at this point. That covers everything from the block size wars to the DAO hack, all the way to DEFI and NFTs.

I actively save in ethereum and I've been encouraging my friends to make the effort to learn more. Sometimes I think im delusional but I think the crypto-revolution will easily be on same level as other civilizational changes like the printing press.

Now heres where I need help. I think more people want to get involved but I the difficulty is in the learning curve. My imposter syndrome is flaring up just thinking about it but because I live in a very crypto friendly city I wanted to start a research/consultant firm with the goal of helping businesses and investors learn how they could gain minimum (or more) exposure or use crypto as both a payment method or in their backend infrastructure.

I have friends who could help out and i know a couple businesses that could definitely benefit from the exposure but heres the problem. I don't know if I should do this or not. I've been learning solidity and im writing my macro economics paper on crypto currencies so I do have a knowledge base on crypto more in depth than the average person but the more I learn the more i feel uncomfortable telling someone else what they should do even when Im 90% confident I'm right.

My goals with this startup well honestly is:

1. I genuinely believe in crypto and think if I understand it as well as I think I do then I should help others understand and gain from it
2. Financial benefit for being early

I know some people will hate me for the 2) reason but thats part of why I am conflicted. I do have a passion for the ideology (decentralization and autonomy) but I can't ignore the fact that if I am right then by being this early ( and yes I genuinely think the story of ethereum and crypto as a whole is only 5% complete) then I can make a lot by encouraging adoption, helping business do that as well as conducting research for finance guys to digest.

So my question/**TLDR:**

Is this something the community encourages or is it better to wait and be cautious because the average joe associates crypto with scams so make sure you fully understand everything before trying a business like this?

2) If you supportive thank you! If not thank you! I just wanted some opinions from people who actually understand the space on what they think the best course of action is. **However** if you are supportive and you have some potential use cases for ethereum or crypto technology in general that could be applicable to businesses today if they understand it well enough to use them? what are they?"

Article:

&gt;In one of the world’s best-run pension markets, the biggest commercial manager says it’s time to dump bonds.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The switch out of fixed income into broader equities, whether it’s listed or unlisted, is what we recommend and what we are positioned for,” Kasper Lorenzen, chief investment officer at Copenhagen-based PFA, said in an interview.  
&gt;  
&gt;Back when most asset managers were being taught the trade, “we learned that government bonds are the safe assets, the risk-free asset,” he said. “Well, let’s see in a year or two what is really the risk-free asset. That transformation is definitely going on.”  
&gt;  
&gt;What's moving marketsStart your day with the 5 Things newsletter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The $120 billion pensions manager points to the flood of issuance to finance pandemic relief packages as a key reason why bonds are losing their allure. Mass issuance has also upended the in-tandem moves in stocks and bonds that had dominated markets after the last financial crisis. What’s more, it’s now clear that central banks are content to let the long end of the yield curve move considerably higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m just surprised how quickly things have changed,” Lorenzen said. “I would have thought that inflation-rate expectations and also interest rates would have been a little bit more anchored.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Denmark boasts the world’s best-funded pensions market, together with the Netherlands, according to the [Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index](https://www.mercer.com.au/content/dam/mercer/attachments/private/asia-pacific/australia/campaigns/mcgpi-2020/MCGPI-2020-executive-summary.pdf). Funds in the Nordic country were among the first in the world to respond to ultra-low interest rates by delving into new markets for alternative assets that included infrastructure and other hard-to-price, rarely traded markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, Lorenzen says pension funds need to brace for a world in which the supply of government bonds is going to be “huge.” What’s more, as investors increasingly shift into equities, risk premiums are likely to go “quite a bit lower,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But stocks are the only place to be, Lorenzen acknowledged.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There is no real alternative,” he said."
GameStop vs Random Article- a breakdown of typical FUD numbers and counterpoints supporting current pricing and undervaluation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwdhev/gamestop_vs_random_article_a_breakdown_of_typical/,bryanthecrab,1,2021-04-23 04:06:23,6,/r/Superstonk/comments/mwdhev/gamestop_vs_random_article_a_breakdown_of_typical/,Possible DD 👨‍🔬,"A friend of mine told me last night about this article that explained why GameStop is overvalued, and why it is Redditors keeping the price afloat- so I told him to send it to me so I could break it down. Here it is!  
I am not an analyst.

  
Article: [https://investorplace.com/2021/04/gme-stock-is-not-worth-buying-above-one-third-of-its-price-today-assuming-turnaround/](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/gme-stock-is-not-worth-buying-above-one-third-of-its-price-today-assuming-turnaround/)  


\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*""Now, as of the close April 19, it is back up to $164.37.*  
*At that price, the GME stock, which had just $5.1 billion in sales in 2020, has a market capitalization of $10.82 billion.* ***Instead of 2 times sales,*** ***most retail stocks trade for 30% to 50% of sales****. ""*

I picked a few ""retailers"" randomly that came to mind: Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Pet Supplies Plus, Chewy, Amazon. Regardless of whether MC:sales is a good valuator, here they are:

Target- market cap $103.1b/93.6b sales = 1.10x  
Walmart- market cap $397.77b/519.93b = **.77x lowest b&amp;m**  
Home Depot- market cap 350.47b/132.1b = **2.65x highest b&amp;m**  
Pet Supplies Plus-market cap 1.35b/1.2b = 1.125x  
Amazon- market cap 1690b/96.1b = 17.59x  
Chewy- market cap 33.32b/2.04b = **16.33x similar e-commerce**

GME trades currently at **2.18x** earnings with a market cap of 11.09b and 5.09b in sales.

At the lowest evaluation - Walmart 0.77x - GME trades at $56.30/share, or needs to make 8.547b to trade where it is.  
At Home Depot 2.65x evaluation GME trades at $193.77/share, or only needs to make 4.19b to trade where it is.  
At Chewy 16.33x evaluation, GME trades at **$1195.97/share.**

US pet industry (excluding vet care) is $64.1b. Chewy is 3.18% of the US pet industry (doesn't sell internationally) fully e-commerce.  
Global gaming market is $162.32b. Gamestop, at 3.14% of the global gaming industry, just beginning to ramp up e-commerce, with no major competition. Gamestop has nothing to stop it from far outperforming Chewy's relative pace. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""***That is going to take a lot of work****. At the end of 2020, GameStop had 4,816 stores, including 253 in Canada, 954 in Europe, and 417 in Australia, according to page 1 of its 10-K report.*

*That is a lot of stores that it wants to “de-densify” out of its global store base. It could easily take several years.* ***For example, last year the company rid itself of just 693 stores or about 12.6%. At that rate, it will take over five years even if it got down to a 20% base from today’s number.***""

On page 20 of the same 10-k, gamestop states that **1848 of its leases are up for expiration in fiscal 2021**, with 996, 620, and 532 leases expiring in subsequent years.  [https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593)

That means Gamestop *could* bring the store base from 4816 to 2968 by end of fiscal 2021, a **38.4% reduction in stores** /SGA expenses *without penalty* in just the next year. Though this is an extreme assessment, GameStop is also able to close leases early if they choose, especially once warehousing is in place. Gamestop does not need to keep unprofitable locations open if they have warehousing ready to restock storefront inventory. Thus the 12.6% that the author states is actually likely somewhere **between 12.6%-38.4%** closure rate per year.

""*In the meantime,* ***the company’s online sales account for a small percentage of its overall sales****.*   
*As with many retailers, GameStop is very coy about its actual e-commerce sales.* ***Nowhere will they state the actual dollar amount****, either in their press releases or in their 10-K or quarterly filing. However, they are very quick to point out that e-commerce sales rose 175% in Q4, and 191% in 2020. This high growth rate implies that the actual online sales amount is very low,* ***probably no more than 10% to 15% of total sales****.* ""

All of this is false except sales increase.  
The very link the author linked here states ""Global E-Commerce sales (included in comparable store sales) **increased 175% and represented 34% of net sales** in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter versus 12% of net sales in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter;"" Quick arithmetic shows a total of **721.5m in e-commerce sales** out of 2.1b net sales.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*""Some analysts are doubtful of GameStop’s turnaround plan to turn around e-commerce sales, especially given its negative comp store sales last year.* ***Jefferies****, which was hired as an investment banker for GameStop,* ***assumes an upside scenario of a 50% transfer of sales to online from bricks and mortar.*** *That is a very rosy scenario and could take many years to occur. Moreover, it* ***also assumes the loss of 50% of total sales now****.*""

Some analysts are doubtful, this is probably true. It did have negative comp sales last year, likely due to.. Idk, Covid?? 

The author links an article linked to Reuters discussing the Jefferies analysis, which quotes :

""*The analysts came up with their new price target by valuing the company using a sales multiple, rather than earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. They assumed* ***GameStop’s e-commerce business would grow sharply, with the transfer of 50% of its 2020 store sales online****, according to the report.*"" - Reuters on Jeffries

The claim that a transfer of 50% from brick/mortar sales to online sales somehow means a loss of the other 50% is.. absurd. If Gamestop closes half its stores, and the sales from those stores goes all online, the other half of stores do not suddenly stop selling things. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""*The truth is the company made* ***just $63.7 million in free cash flow (FCF) last year****, according to its own press release. That amounts to* ***a paltry FCF margin of just 1.25% of its $5.1 billion in sales****. Even if we assume that the Christmas season FCF of $137.4 million lasts for the whole year (which is FCF neutral), it still amounts to just 2.7% of sales. This is a really low figure.*""

In fiscal 2019, Gamestops FCF was a total net $(493m). Holiday quarter pulled a net $223.2m  
In fiscal 2020, Gamestops FCF was a total net $63.7m, holiday quarter pulling in a net $137.4m  
That means that even during Covid, Gamestop was able to increase its net FCF for the year by **+556.7m vs 2019**, and still only suffered a 38.4% loss in holiday sales during covid lockdown.

If we keep the rate of change of year/year FCF from 2019-2020 the same, a FCF of 556.7m makes up **10.94% of the 5.09b in sales.** If we apply that to next year, *not accounting for any drastic shift in last year's policy*, we end up with **620.4m FCF for 2021**. That includes last year's store closure rate of 12.6% (693 stores) rather than 12.6-38.4% (1848). 

""*Granted, if somehow the company can get to 50% of sales online, the FCF level will rise. Let’s say it can double to a margin of, say, 6% of sales. In addition, sales would be lower by 50%. That would amount to 6% of $2.5 billion, or $150 million in FCF.*""

We just showed how 2021 FCF could easily be 620m, 4x what the author states.

""As of March 15, 2021, following the pay down of outstanding borrowings under the Company’s asset-based revolving credit facility and the redemption of its 6.75% senior notes due in 2021, the Company had $48.5 million of short-term debt and $216.0 million of long-term debt remaining on its balance sheet."" - Gamestop 10-k  
Gamestop pays off all its remaining debt on April 30, which means no more interest for the next two years.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""*Today’s valuation of $10.8 billion is still too high. That implies that even with a major turnaround (no guarantee this will happen), GME stock trades at an FCF yield of 1.39%.* ***Another way to put this is that the market value is 72.1 times its FCF****.*

***A more reasonable figure is 36 times FCF****, implying a 2.77% FCF yield or 36 times FCF. GME stock is not worth more than $5.4 billion (i.e, 36 times $150 million). This is 50% of its $10.8 billion market cap.* ***GME stock is not worth more than 50% of $164.37, its Monday closing price, or $82.19.*****""**

We just evaluated that even disregarding the corporate overhaul and new direction, Gamestop could still have an FCF of 620.4m.  
**Using the author's rate of 36x FCF** for market cap, GameStop should have a **$22.33b market cap by end of Fiscal 2021**.   
That would put a price target, according to the model proposed by author, for the end of FY2021 at **$320.96/share assuming sales stay the same.**

**TLDR**

In closing:

author: *most retail trades 30-50% x sales*  
\-of four random major retailers, the lowest is 77% and the highest is 253% x sales. GME 193/share valued like Home Depot  
\-E-commerce trades 10x that- Chewy trading at 1633% x sales. GME trades $1200/share if valued like Chewy.

author: *Gamestop doesn't tell us online sales, probably 10-15%*  
\-Gamestop tells us that online sales make up 34%

author: even if Gamestop transfers 50% of sales online, they lose the other 50%  
\-...they do not lose the other 50%

author: at best case Free Cash Flow of $137.4m   
\-ignores net change of +556.7m increase of FCF from 2019-2020, despite pandemic  
\-following old rate we get 620.4m FCF for FY2021

author: GME is at 72.1 x FCF and should be 36x FCF  
\-at 36x FCF, which is probably low like the 30-50% sales eval, GME trades $320/share using existing FCF trend.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not suggest that these methods of evaluating pricing are the best or most accurate way to evaluate GME at this time, although they do provide insight into a basic range of operation for the price; that being $320-&gt;1200/share over the next fiscal year or two, even according to the author's use for the purpose of establishing a low value range.

Thanks for reading! Let me know if you spot any critical errors in my assessment.

Here is a graph of GME over the last couple months. There are some interesting trends. I am not experienced in Technical Analysis, these are just observations  
A- the constant downward resistance controlled by whoever is shorting the stock (we know who it is) and millions of short volume every day, as well as 10s of millions of dollars of puts and such weekly  
B- a low range that seems to correlate with institutional interest (probably more like a curve in reality)  
C- an absolute floor   
D- intersection (break out zone) between the absolute floor support and the resistance level  
E- greatly decreasing daily volume

\*I drew these lines maybe a day or two before ""E""  
\*I chose trend line A to intersect peaks but never touch the average, to demonstrate a high resistance zone  
\*I chose the start of the trend lines B/C as the lowest point following sudden runup in February  
\*this graph, today shows the price within the lower two bounds, similar to the area above ""E""

Against blockchain governance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_themeliolabs/comments/mwt63y/against_blockchain_governance/,themeliolabs,1,2021-04-23 19:30:19,0,/r/u_themeliolabs/comments/mwt63y/against_blockchain_governance/,NaN,"# Against blockchain governance

One of Themelio’s strongest design principles is its extreme hostility towards protocol governance: Themelio will not undergo any consensus-breaking changes after the stable network launches.

By “protocol governance”, or just “governance”, I mean community-wide coordinated changes to the core consensus rules of a blockchain, which includes hard and soft forks. All popular blockchains today undergo this kind of governance, whether informally through off-chain discussion, like in Bitcoin and Ethereum, or formally through on-chain procedures, as in Tezos.

This sort of governance is widely seen as necessary to maintain and improve a blockchain’s value. Examples include adding features, like opcodes for deploying ZK-rollups on Ethereum, or resolving large-scale community disputes, like the Bitcoin block-size controversy. Yet I will argue that protocol governance not only undermines the primary source of a blockchain’s value but is also not needed for a blockchain ecosystem to thrive and grow. For blockchains, *governance is simply a great and unnecessary evil.*

## Governance is a great evil

Since the purpose of governance is to preserve and improve a blockchain’s value, we must first investigate where this value comes from. Many features of blockchains are cited to explain the massive interest in blockchains. The bestselling book *Blockchain Revolution* raves about a “truly-open, distributed, global platform” where “all activity is transparent and incorruptible”. Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin attempts to pin down blockchains’ [decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274), another commonly cited “killer feature”, as

&gt;politically decentralized (no one controls them) and architecturally decentralized (no infrastructural central point of failure) but \[..\] logically centralized (there is one commonly agreed state and the system behaves like a single computer)

These groundbreaking properties of public blockchains all appear to stem from a key breakthrough in *trust*. By a “truly-open, distributed, global platform”, we don’t mean that we trust some highly reputable blockchain operators to guarantee these properties. Instead, we study a blockchain’s protocol and conclude that the system as a whole would have these desirable properties *independent of who is running the protocol*. This peculiar kind of trust also enables blockchains to have the rare combination of political and architectural decentralization with logical centralization that Vitalik points out: we trust the blockchain itself to somehow get disparate humans with different computers to “behave like a single computer”.

I call this property **endogenous trust**. Often somewhat misleadingly labeled “autonomy” or “trust-minimization”, endogenous trust refers to trust that a blockchain protocol will behave correctly with minimal assumptions about who runs it. In blockchains, trust emerges from within the protocol. This is categorically different from exogenous trust in whomever runs the protocol.

Nearly all of the unique properties of blockchains and blockchain applications stem from endogenous trust. Take an application often mentioned in *Blockchain Revolution*: transparent and immutable record-keeping for legal documents. When done on a blockchain, its endogenous trust assures us that the records we keep are indeed transparent and immutable — no trust in third parties necessary. This stands in contrast to traditional solutions like public notaries, which require much exogenous trust in some record-keeping authority. As another example, the radically jurisdiction-independent and open ecosystem of DeFi (decentralized finance) can only eliminate trust in traditional intermediaries like banks and exchanges by relying on the strong endogenous trust of a blockchain. In summary, endogenous trust is the real killer feature of blockchains.

So how does a blockchain secure endogenous trust? Endogenous trust is powered by **cryptoeconomic mechanisms** that incentivize correct behavior from protocol participants. From the incentive structure of such a mechanism, we can conclude that certain security-critical properties hold using weak, general assumptions about human behavior. For instance, we can show that as long as almost all Bitcoin miners are rational and profit-seeking, Bitcoin would converge to one history. This kind of mechanism allows us to trust that the participants of the protocol will act in a certain manner without any preexisting trust in their honesty.

This means that endogenous trust crucially depends on actually being able to pin down what cryptoeconomic mechanisms will be in force. Without knowing for sure what those mechanisms will be tomorrow, you cannot have endogenous trust. Since these mechanisms are encoded in the core consensus rules of a blockchain, *protocol immutability* is the ultimate backstop of endogenous trust. Alice and Bob trust the smart contract that intermediarizes their transaction only because they know that the contract code is immutable. A merchant accepts bitcoins for the goods he sells only when he is confident that tomorrow some protocol change wouldn’t freeze all his bitcoins.

By introducing externally coordinated protocol changes, governance undermines this ultimate backstop. Now instead of accepting bitcoins because Bitcoin has endogenous trust, the merchant must have *exogenous* trust that a governance event by the Bitcoin community wouldn’t expropriate his assets.

📷

The severity of this problem cannot be overstated. By introducing exogenous trust in a nebulous “community” that may from time to time rewrite the protocol, governance destroys the basis of endogenous trust.

It seems, however, that Bitcoin and Ethereum are pretty trustworthy despite having governance. After all, people put trillions of dollars in them! But this trust is not endogenous, but rather trust in “the community”. Just like any other human institution, a blockchain community can merit exogenous trust, even a lot of it. For instance, the Bitcoin community is perhaps far superior at maintaining consistent monetary policy than central banks, and therefore much more trustworthy. Nevertheless, trust in communities is categorically different from endogenous, cryptoeconomically-driven trust that doesn’t depend on trusting anybody running the protocol. After all, communities are not always that great: just take a look at EOS’s [infamously “plutocratic” governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html), which is often abused for protocol-violating actions like [freezing assets](https://thenextweb.com/news/eos-cryptocurrency-constitution).

The trust revolution promised by blockchains is no longer a revolution if all blockchains offer is yet another form of exogenous trust in yet another human institution. There is then no escape from the conclusion that by its very definition, **protocol governance wrecks the primary value proposition of blockchains**.

## Governance is an unnecessary evil

But all the major blockchains have governance. Perhaps blockchains cannot survive without some form of governance, and endogenous trust is simply unrealistic. Indeed, the experience of Bitcoin and Ethereum hints that at least for existing blockchains, governance is a “necessary evil”. Out of the [20 times](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Consensus_versions) the Bitcoin protocol soft- or hard-forked, the majority fixed important issues with the protocol. And Ethereum’s numerous upgrades added significant features such as [bitwise shifting operators](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/02/22/ethereum-constantinople-st-petersburg-upgrade-announcement/), [elliptic curve mathematics](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/10/12/byzantium-hf-announcement/), and [error handling functionality](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/206) necessary for many applications. If the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities dogmatically stuck with the original protocol, they would clearly be worse off.

But *why* do these blockchains need governance? What’s the source of the issues that must be addressed by governance, and can we avoid these issues?

If we examine Bitcoin and Ethereum’s numerous upgrades after their early development, it is clear that they largely come in two categories. First, many address situations where the blockchain protocol is no longer suitable for the applications people want to run on it, or *application-protocol friction*. This motivates most of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s governance events, where new features were added to the consensus rules to accommodate new applications, such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum smart contracts with advanced cryptography. The second kind of governance event, arguably the much more destabilizing kind, comes from *controversial application failures*. These stem from application-level community controversies, where the failure of a popular blockchain application (like low-fee transfers on Bitcoin, or the DAO smart contract on Ethereum) generates powerful special-interest “victim” groups that pressure the community for governance to address their grievances.

We see a common pattern here: **tight coupling with applications** makes the blockchain vulnerable to ever-changing application needs and happenings. Bitcoin is itself primarily a money-transfer application, while Ethereum is a “world computer” directly acting as a runtime environment for applications. Tight coupling to applications generates both application-protocol friction and controversial application failures — a diverse and innovative application ecosystem necessarily involves many unanticipated applications. Some would clash with the blockchain’s original design, and others might fail spectacularly.

This suggests that we can banish governance by avoiding tight coupling with applications. In fact, the most successful network protocol of all time — the Internet Protocol (IP) — does exactly that. IP focuses on one thing (unreliably routing datagrams), does it extremely well, and doesn’t interface directly with applications. Instead, user-facing Internet applications like Facebook or Netflix are separated from IP by many layers of abstraction. Importantly, IP needed no governance to support these ever-evolving applications. This stands in stark contrast to pre-Internet telecom protocols, which were tightly coupled to applications like telephone and television. In those protocols, even small application-level innovations, like [pagers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager), involved governance-intensive upgrade efforts reminiscent of blockchain protocol upgrades.

📷

Following IP’s example, blockchains can also be designed to eliminate tight coupling with applications. Indeed, **Themelio’s design is firmly centered around decoupling the blockchain from user-facing applications**. I believe that the proper role of a blockchain is to be deeply embedded in applications, providing endogenous trust to security-critical functionality, like PKIs and payments. The blockchain itself would be neither a user-facing application nor a platform in which applications are embedded. As such, Themelio aims to be a low-level, radically application-neutral blockchain. It focuses on implementing basic, highly composable functionality that can power a vast, diverse, and constantly changing ecosystem.

Governance for Themelio would then be a purely unnecessary evil. The core Themelio protocol will be separated from applications by layers of intermediate protocols and laser-focused on implementing one thing (endogenous trust) extremely well. As a result, it will not need to change with the fickle trends of upper-level applications, just like IP did not need to change to support today’s extremely diverse Internet ecosystem. That the Internet today has evolved unrecognizably compared to the Internet back when IPv4 was published in 1981 attests to the power of decoupling.

An objection may be that refraining from upgrading the protocol is also just another governance choice by the community. Since actual community members run the Themelio software, it may appear that we still need exogenous trust in their promise not to enforce governance.

Fortunately, *governance-freedom itself can also be endogenously trustworthy*. We don’t need to rely on the good judgement of “the community” for governance not to happen. It is simply in the nature of deeply embedded, low-level protocols not to change. Again, the Internet Protocol provides a stellar example. Ever since IPv6 was created in 1998, many influential members of “the community” have spent great efforts to try to replace the older IPv4 with its technically superior successor. Impressive-sounding events sponsored by “big shots”, like the Internet Society’s [“World IPv6 Day” in 2011 and “World IPv6 Launch Day” in 2012](https://www.worldipv6launch.org/) were supposed to jump-start IPv6 adoption.

📷

Yet IPv4, despite severe technical shortcomings like a drastic shortage of IP addresses, is just not going. Now, 23 years later and 9 years after “World IPv6 Launch”, only [a little more than 30%](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html) of networks support IPv6, and the vast majority of Internet traffic continues to be IPv4-based.

So we see that given an entrenched “narrow-waist” protocol, a governance event for an unambiguous technical improvement cannot get executed, even with widespread support and essentially zero opposition. How much harder would it be to push through governance in Themelio, when it threatens the core value proposition of the protocol itself!

So we don’t need to trust the Themelio community not to attempt governance. The entire incentive structure of a low-level, application-neutral network protocol is incredibly hostile to attempts at governance. Just like a Bitcoin user will trust Bitcoin’s incentive structure to provide stable consensus without preexisting trust in the Bitcoin mining community, a Themelio user can trust Themelio to remain radically immutable, independent of any trust in the Themelio community. Even though all systems are ultimately run by humans, the root of trust of Themelio is happily endogenous.

## Conclusion

In summary, governance aims at maintaining a blockchain’s value but actually destroys the most important source of blockchain value — endogenous trust. Protocol governance is also entirely unnecessary, provided that a blockchain steers clear of tight coupling to applications. In fact, a blockchain without application entanglements can come with powerful incentives that discourage any attempts at governance.

It turns out that blockchains really can revolutionize trust — we can avoid depending on “governing” authorities as a root of trust after all. To do so, we must eliminate governance from the core blockchain protocol, but that doesn’t mean governance has no place elsewhere. “Human-free” endogenous trust holds vast potential as a conduit for new forms of *human* trust, such as commercial trust between merchants in mutually hostile jurisdictions, or behind untraceable pseudonyms. Governance models utilizing these new kinds of social trust will be critical for building new modes of social interaction, such as DAOs and voluntary public-good provision. A radically simple blockchain with a self-enforcing lack of governance will provide a rock-solid foundation to explore this fascinating space.

For a while I've thought about making a post about this, because most people don't even know that this is a real option to earn passive income through crypto and decentralized finance.

I will keep this post relatively short, but I essentially want to show you all a method of staking stablecoins to earn extremely high yearly returns. At the time of writing this I am earning around 75-80% APR. This will **decrease over time** as people move their liquidity into the pools I'm about to talk about. The APR is super high, because Polygon is incentivizing people to move liquidity onto the network with WMATIC rewards.

There are four key aspects to doing this:

1. POLYGON
2. DAI / USDC / USDT
3. AAVE
4. CURVE

**Polygon** is a decentralized Ethereum sidechain that allows you to make transactions with near zero gas fees.

**Aave** is a decentralized lending protocol, kind of like a decentralized bank.

**Curve** is a liquidity protocol made for swapping stablecoins at a 1:1 rate.

I will be using the USDT stablecoin as an example on how to do this. This will work **only** with DAI, USDC and USDT.

Here is the tutorial part:

1. Take your USDT and deposit it to [app.aave.com](https://app.aave.com). This will give you back amUSDT.
2. Go to [polygon.curve.fi](https://polygon.curve.fi) and select the **aave pool**.
3. At the top click on deposit and **tick deposit aTokens**.
4. Deposit &amp; stake in Gauge. This will give you am3CRV Gauge Deposit tokens. You need these to unstake later.
5. You will see your WMATIC rewards constantly increasing now. You can claim them anytime you want and sell them on [quickswap.exchange](https://quickswap.exchange) or just hodl. You will also be earning Aave lending fees and Curve transaction fees passively.

And that's it! Super simple."

DATA SCIENCE: Information through correlation - AMC / GME,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxg80o/data_science_information_through_correlation_amc/,Responsible-Spirit95,1,2021-04-24 17:03:53,12,/r/Superstonk/comments/mxg80o/data_science_information_through_correlation_amc/,Education 👨‍🏫 | Data 🔢,"Dear monkey gang,

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to provide some data here, which I have prepared in the last days. The data sets come from my original idea to look more closely at correlations between AMC and GME in order to obtain information about the level of short interest. To be honest, this goal was probably a bit too ambitious, but I would still like to provide the results and data that were generated along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

What is difficult, in my opinion, is the interpretation of the data, so I would also like to have a discussion about what conclusions can possibly be drawn from this data.

Anyone who has studied correlations must of course know that one should have a rough background knowledge of what causes these correlations.

For example, if two stocks of companies operating in similar business areas  are sold short , a **natural correlation** is to be expected, so correlations would not be particularly valuable in such a case.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of AMC and GME, I think there are two ""natural"" correlations:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Both companies were hit hard by the COVID pandemic.
2. Both companies were sold short by the same hedge fund (Melvin Capital and others).

&amp;#x200B;

Point 1 is relevant for 2020, but negligible for the last three months. So one can assume that the natural underlying correlation is Melvin Capital / others shorting hedge funds.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

The first curve that amazed me was the AMC / GME curve from 2.2. to 5.2.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e9uhlykl43v61.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63d4bcdcb0f3853100705e13f3a61242f835604

**My interpretation** of this correlation is that the short positions of AMC and GME were not naturally covered, as was the case with the VW squeeze, for example. The idea that the short positions of both stocks were covered at exactly the same time is absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as i said, what I can do here  is to provide data. Data on the volume and price (open) of AMC, GME and Coca-Cola (as an example of an uncorrelated stock).

As already mentioned, I find it difficult to interpret. First, I wanted to integrate across all highly correlated volumes to give an estimate of short interest, but there are so many unassessable influencing factors in this story (dark pools, options trading, influence of day traders and automated bots during the first peak) that this is probably not possible.

Whether one can nevertheless draw useful information from this data would have to be discussed here. In my opinion, mainly support / plausibility assessment of other DD's here in the forum.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the data:

The correlation coefficient for the whole 3 months interval between AMC and GME is 0.85 for both price and volume.

I could also upload the plots between GME and Coca-Cola, but i think it's not that interesting. The correlation coefficient for the whole 3 months interval was 0.18 for price, and 0.19 for the volume.

Smoothy.Finance A real project with massive potential in the DeFi space! Pre-sale token in the 26th of April!,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegitBSCProjects/comments/mxqhi8/smoothyfinance_a_real_project_with_massive/,Fptmike,1,2021-04-25 03:01:00,2,/r/LegitBSCProjects/comments/mxqhi8/smoothyfinance_a_real_project_with_massive/,NaN,"Smoothy.finance

Smoothy is a novel stablecoin swapping protocol that is capable of supporting 20+ stablecoins in a single pool with low-cost low-slippage swapping and maximum interest earning for LPs. It is not a fork of any existing protocol.

Features of Smoothy:

1 Reduce the gas fee significantly by algorithm optimization

Even deployed on Ethereum, the gas fee required by stablecoin swap on Smoothy is reduced by 90% compared to Curve’s yPool and mStable after the algorithm optimization. It achieves a lower gas fee without using layer2 and ensures composability.

2 Single pool supporting multiple stablecoins with better liquidity

Unlike Curve, which supports up to 4 stablecoins in one pool, Smoothy can support multiple stablecoins in one single pool, and can flexibly add/remove any token. Theoretically, Smoothy can accommodate hundreds of different types of stablecoins in one pool (even algorithm stablecoin). This means that Smoothy will not suffer from the fragmented liquidity of multiple pools, enabling better liquidity.

3 Maximum LP reward

With reference to the bank’s reserve system, we designed a unique Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm, which dynamically allocates the majority of funds in the underlying interest-earning platform and the rest is reserved to meet daily swap needs. In other words, in addition to governance token earnings, liquidity providers can gain swap fees together with interest earning and lower gas fees.

4 zero-slippage swapping algorithm

Smoothy developed a SmoothSwap algorithm that can guarantee 1:1 ratio swap most of the time if the percentage of the token in the pool is lower than soft weights; if not, a swap is still allowed by imposing a penalty fee as slippage.

A different perspective on buying a home in NoVa right now,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/mxtige/a_different_perspective_on_buying_a_home_in_nova/,Joe_Climacus,1,2021-04-25 05:32:29,59,/r/nova/comments/mxtige/a_different_perspective_on_buying_a_home_in_nova/,Rant,"I have been following the real estate posts on this sub for awhile and there seems to be a general trend of people saying that anyone buying in this market is a sucker/crazy. I wanted to offer an alternate perspective. **Disclaimers: I am currently buying** ***and*** **selling a home in Alexandria, and nothing in this post should be mistaken for financial advice. Like most people in this sub, I am not a real estate or finance professional, and you should engage with one if you want expert advice.**

The decision on whether or not this is a smart time to buy in the NoVa area is extremely subjective. No one really knows whether places are going to continue appreciating at a rapid clip. There are some reasons to believe they will: the local economy is booming, some major employers are shifting large amounts of workforce to the DMV, and all the land is taken so there's no opportunity for ""new"" expansion inside the beltway.

Are we in a bubble? Maybe. Who knows? Literally no one can say for sure, and my experience has been that people have been saying we're in a bubble for years. If I had listened to that chatter in 2018 when I bought in for the first time and decided to wait for a downturn, I would have missed out on the 30% appreciation I've achieved in the past 3 years by owning. Granted -- 3 years ago the market was cooler. But if there IS a bubble, there is reason to believe that the areas of NoVa closest to DC (mostly inside the beltway) will be somewhat insulated. Even if there is a massive economic downturn across the country, the government jobs aren't going away so this area is uniquely insulated from some of the external market forces. The market could stabilize or even take a dip, but it's pretty unlikely that this area will ""crash.""

However, nothing is guaranteed. We could be in a bubble, it could burst, and all buyers could be screwed. But no matter when you buy, you will not be able to avoid the possibility that you're buying in at the top. That's a risk you will always take by buying real estate. It's just a risk that *could* be slightly elevated right now.

With that said, why are people buying right now if the market is so crazy that you have to waive all contingencies, offer 5-15% over asking, and submit an offer the day after viewing it? I wanted to offer a couple reasons, from the perspective of a person who was willing to put up with the bullshit and do what it took to secure a property:  


1. A lot of people believe that we are still on the front end of the appreciation curve. Research what happened to the Seattle market in the 10 years after Amazon moved in. It's doubtful that the exact same level of appreciation will happen here for a variety of reasons, but it's not unreasonable to think that we could see 5-10% annual appreciation for another couple years. 
2. Interest rates are historically low. That's not a buzzword/turn of phrase -- they literally are at the lowest level they've ever been. Look at this crazy-ass graph if you don't believe me: [https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart/](https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart/)   
Now, why do interest rates matter? **Because most people are shopping for a home based on what their monthly payment will be, not based on what dollar amount of home they want.** If your budget allows you to, for example, have a $3,000 mortgage payment,  then right now if you get a 3% interest rate, you can roughly afford a $713,000 house (depending on factors like down payment and credit score). But if you decide to wait a couple years for the market to settle down, and in that timeframe the interest rates rise to, for example, 4.5%? Now you are still paying $3,000/month, but that monthly payment only buys you a $592,000 house. And not only that, but if prices do keep going up, you will have missed out on any appreciation gains in that period of time. So if you ""overpay"" a little bit right now, and the market doesn't immediately crash, getting in with a low interest rate could be a ROI-positive decision for you, *especially* if the area continues to appreciate.   
\[Sidenote: from a lifetime-value perspective, if you are trying to determine what will lead to the largest amount of wealth before you die, then going based off interest rates and not home values might be unwise. After all, the bill eventually does come due. But before that bill comes due 30+ years from now, you will have paid drastically different amounts of interest in comparison to the home value, and a home is not a passive investment like a stock. It's an investment which you literally spend your life inside of, and it might be worth it to a lot of people to know their net worth will be a few thousand dollars lower when they die if it means they lived in a home they loved for 30 years. Count me among them.\]
3. Some people can afford more flexibility on ""overpaying"" when they are buying, because they are also selling and taking advantage of the hot market. This doesn't apply to first-time buyers, but is a big factor for folks looking to upgrade while rates are so low. If you ""overpay"" by 10% but someone ""overpays"" on your property too, it might be a wash. 

In the end, the decision about whether or not it's a good time to buy right now is about risk tolerance and how much you want to own land in this area. If your risk tolerance is low and you don't value home ownership, this is not the market for you. If your risk tolerance is high and you don't want to get priced out of NoVa, buying right now could be smart while you can secure a more affordable monthly payment on a high mortgage. Because while appreciation is a question mark, interest rates going up are not. We are almost certain to see interest rates increase in 2022 and beyond.

So are the people buying right now suckers, getting lured into overpaying right before a crash, or are the people committed to waiting for it to ""settle down"" suckers who are going to get priced out of the market and kick themselves for years for not getting in while they could? Only time will tell and that's a decision you have to make for yourself -- but I wanted to offer this alternate perspective since the overruling sentiment on this sub seems to be that anyone buying right now is a fool."
"After Barack Obama was first elected senator, he noticed lots of empty houses in Chicago. He told his friend, George Haywood, about it. Haywood was a professional blackjack player and a Wall Street bond trader. Haywood said, ""The entire financial system. It's all a house of cards waiting to topple.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxuln3/after_barack_obama_was_first_elected_senator_he/,sesamecake,1,2021-04-25 06:28:16,22,/r/Superstonk/comments/mxuln3/after_barack_obama_was_first_elected_senator_he/,Discussion 🦍,"I know politics is frowned upon here, but I couldn't help but post this due to the relevance of everything that we've been discovering in light of u/atobitt's DD on ""A House of Cards"". 

I was listening to Obama's new memoir, ""A Promised Land"" while driving today. Chapter 9 focuses on the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis where he details when he first learned about the threat of the bubble popping due to sub mortgage primes from his friend, George Haywood. Haywood was a professional blackjack player and a Wall Street bond trader who explained what was going on with the ""securitization"" of mortgages, the threat it posed to the housing market and financial system, and the recklessness of the banks.

Obama questioned why no one was talking about it. Haywood didn't know and replied, ""You tell me."" Obama later was told by the Federal Reserve chairman that the housing market posed no major threat to the broader economy and eventually pushed it out of his mind when he started prepping for the 2008 presidential election.

Haywood was so sure of it that he actually had a short position on the housing market. He eventually exited his position because he couldn't afford the fees. I'm sure he's been kicking himself ever since...

I wanted to highlight this because of how many similarities there are between what's going on now and then, especially with the warnings yet sunny optimism portrayed by everyone else while shrewd and observant individuals like George Haywood and Michael Burry saw the writing on the wall.

It's happening again.

**Here is the excerpt:**

&gt;After I was elected to the U.S. Senate, we sold our East View Park condo at a price high enough to cover our mortgage and home equity loan and make a small profit. But I noticed, driving home one night, that my mortgage broker’s storefront window was now empty, with a big FOR SALE OR LEASE sign in the window. All those new condos in River North and the South Loop appeared unoccupied, even with developers offering buyers deeper and deeper discounts. A former staffer who’d left government to get her real estate license asked if I knew of any job openings—the new gig wasn’t panning out as she’d hoped.   
&gt;  
&gt;I was neither surprised nor alarmed by any of this, figuring it was just the cyclical ebb and flow of the market. But back in D.C., I happened to mention the softening Chicago real estate market to a friend of mine, George Haywood, while we were eating sandwiches in a park near the Capitol. George had dropped out of Harvard Law to play professional blackjack, parlayed his skill with numbers and tolerance for risk into a job as a Wall Street bond trader, and had ultimately made a mint on personal investments. Being ahead of the curve was his business.   
&gt;  
&gt;“This is just the start,” he told me.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What do you mean?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“I mean the entire housing market,” George said.   
&gt;  
&gt;**“The entire financial system. It’s all a house of cards waiting to topple.”**   
&gt;  
&gt;As we sat in the afternoon sun, he gave me a quick tutorial on the burgeoning subprime mortgage market. Whereas banks had once typically held the mortgage loans they made in their own portfolios, a huge percentage of mortgages were now bundled and sold as securities on Wall Street. Since banks could now off-load their risk that any particular borrower might default on their loan, this “securitization” of mortgages had led banks to steadily loosen their lending standards. Credit rating agencies, paid by the issuers, had stamped these securities as “AAA,” or least risky, without adequately analyzing the default risk on the underlying mortgages. Global investors, awash in cash and eager for higher returns, rushed in to buy these products, pumping more and more money into housing finance.   
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two giant companies that Congress had authorized to purchase qualified mortgages to encourage homeownership—and which, by virtue of their quasi-governmental status, could borrow money much more cheaply than other companies—were knee-deep in the subprime market, with their shareholders making money hand over fist as the housing market swelled.   
&gt;  
&gt;All of this had contributed to a classic bubble, George said. So long as housing prices kept going up, everybody was happy: the family who could suddenly buy their dream house with no money down; the developers that couldn’t build houses fast enough to satisfy all these new customers; the banks that sold increasingly complex financial instruments at handsome profits; the hedge funds and investment banks that were placing bigger and bigger bets on these financial instruments with borrowed money; not to mention furniture retailers, carpet manufacturers, trade unions, and newspaper advertising departments, all of which had every incentive to keep the party going.   
&gt;  
&gt;But with so many unqualified buyers propping up the market, George was convinced the party would eventually end. What I was noticing in Chicago was just a tremor, he told me. Once the earthquake came, the impact would be far worse in places like Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, where subprime lending had been most active. As soon as large numbers of homeowners started defaulting, investors would realize that a lot of mortgage-backed securities weren’t so AAA after all. They’d likely rush for the exits, dumping the securities as fast as they could. Banks that held these securities would be vulnerable to runs, and would probably pull back on lending to cover losses or maintain capital requirements, making it hard for even qualified families to get a mortgage, which in turn would depress the housing market even further.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would be a vicious cycle, likely to trigger a market panic, and because of the sheer amount of money involved, the result could be an economic crisis the likes of which we hadn’t seen in our lifetimes.   
&gt;  
&gt;I listened to all this with growing incredulity. George was not prone to exaggeration, especially when it came to money. He told me he had taken a hefty “short” position himself, essentially betting that the price of mortgage-backed securities would go way down in the future. I asked him why it was that if the risk of a full-blown crisis was so high, no one—not the Federal Reserve, or bank regulators, or the financial press—seemed to be talking about it.   
&gt;  
&gt;George shrugged. “You tell me.”  
&gt;  
&gt;When I got back to my Senate office, I asked some of my staff to check with their counterparts on the Banking Committee to see if anyone saw any danger in the spiking of the subprime mortgage market. The reports came back negative: The Federal Reserve chairman had indicated that the housing market was a bit overheated and due for an eventual correction, but that given historical trends, he saw no major threat to the financial system or the broader economy. With all the other issues on my plate, including the start of the midterm campaigns, George’s warning receded from my mind. In fact, when I saw him a couple of months later, in early 2007, both the financial and housing markets had continued to soften, but it didn’t seem to be anything serious. George told me that he had been forced to abandon his “short” position after taking heavy losses.   
&gt;  
&gt;**“I just don’t have enough cash to stay with the bet,” he said calmly enough, adding, “Apparently I’ve underestimated how willing people are to maintain a charade.”**   
&gt;  
&gt;I didn’t ask George how much money he’d lost, and we moved on to other topics. We parted ways that day not knowing that the charade wouldn’t last very much longer—or that its terrible fallout would, just a year and a half later, play a critical role in electing me president.

"[Uni] Is NTU/NBS teaching style ""old school""? + student life in general",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/my0uqq/uni_is_ntunbs_teaching_style_old_school_student/,Numerous_Prune_72,1,2021-04-25 12:33:16,9,/r/SGExams/comments/my0uqq/uni_is_ntunbs_teaching_style_old_school_student/,University :snoo_smile:,"Hello, I'm a prospective student and have received offer in NBS business with a minor in international trading. Just wanted to find out more about the teaching style at NBS, particularly in the business analytics and banking and finance specialization. 

Personally, I prefer interactive learning so I would like to find out more about how seminars are conducted in NBS. (For business analytics track students, are classes more lecture and tutorial style?) Do professors actively interact with students and how is class participation like? Also, are classes conducted in 4 hours block? 

When I compared the curriculum structure of NTU and NUS, I noticed that NUS requires students to complete programming for business analytics as their core mod before specialization so I would like to find out how steep the learning curve is for NBS students with little coding experience and are there any core mods similar to NUS to prepare students for biz analytics? 

I read somewhere that biz specializations are not guaranteed and students have to meet the minimum CGPA requirements, is that true? If so, is the business analytics and banking and finance track highly sought after by students? 

Am I allowed to specialize in international trading if I'm taking it as a minor? (Just curious and have little intentions to go this route) Is priority for internships in the commodity industry also given to students minoring in ITP? 

Any career preparation guidance for students like how to source for jobs and internships, resumes and cover letters, how to present yourself during interview sessions etc.. 

How is a normal day of classes like and on average how many mods do students take per sem? I heard that it is more rigorous and am slightly worried about the workload.. What is the ratio of individual assignments to group projects like? 

How are the student exchange programs offered in NBS? I read that students usually only go for exchange during summer and winter breaks which is quite short for me and I'm kind of tempted to go for NUS for their 6 months exchange program. 

 I stay 2 hours away from NTU and the deciding factor between NUS and NTU is hall stay.. Because NTU is guaranteed for 2 years it makes me more inclined to choose that over NUS and if I choose NUS I don't think I would stay in hall/RC because of the very limited accommodation + troublesome interview procedures.. I would much rather travel 1 hour every day. 

So what are your thoughts on NTU hall and is it worth it to choose hall stay over NUS?"

I'm putting together an industry value curve for the ""cryptocurrency industry"" which I'll define for this purpose as the top-10 currencies by market cap via Coinmarketcap (and may expand depending on how the analysis goes). 

I need some help from those of you smarter and wiser than me with coming up with key success factors, I.e. the things that firms (or in this case, currencies) focus on to achieve success in the industry. For example, speed of transaction is one and network security another.

If you don't mind, can you list what you think are important factors of cryptocurrency that makes one attractive for you rather than another? 

To start...I know:

- speed of transaction
- ease of transaction
- network security
- network efficiency (uptime vs downtime)
- ecological impact
- use variations (NFTs, $ transfer, smart contracts, etc.)
- network effects (adoption and use)
- network effects - complementors  (development)
- ""tokenomics"" e.g. inflation/deflation and mechanisms for monetary policy 
- governance
- decentralization vs centralization

What can I add? What can I split into multiple factors? Etc. 

If you don't know what an industry value curve is, please see here: [https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/value-curve-model.htm](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/value-curve-model.htm)

In essence, an industry value curve ""provides a useful framework for comparing your strategy against that of your competitors, by using a simple chart. This helps you focus sharply on the things that differentiate you from your competitors, and develop a clear and easily explained value proposition."" 
  
If you're wondering ""Why is he doing this?"" The reason I'm doing this is I want to begin conducting some cryptocurrency analysis based more on business elements and use-cases, not on technical analysis or theoretical arguments. I'm an MBA with quite a bit of experience in the strategy, business development, and finance realm. I'm also a fundamentals-based value investor in other asset classes and believe some aspects of that can start making their way into the crypto market. I plan on doing a few analyses/frameworks (such as VRIO, brand mapping, five forces, etc.) in hopes that something may shine through - and if nothing does so be it.

Z3 (computer)

**The Z3 was a German electromechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse in 1935, and completed in 1941. It was the world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer.**
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)#:~:text=The%20Z3%20was%20a%20German,programmable%2C%20fully%20automatic%20digital%20computer.)      


I can't speak for you, but both of these peices of information shocked me. Greatly. I read about WW2 nonstop when I was in High School. I learnt about WW2 in High School. And never once did I read or get taught about either of these events back in the day. Why? **Propoganda**. That's why. So did the USA enter the war to stop the Nazis? Or did they enter the war to stop the Nazis from getting a Nuke and to grab the Computer? Possible? Sure. But so what? What does that have to do with a UFO crashing in Texas? Well we also have all those wild conspiracy stories about Foo Fighters in WW2. 


**In World War II, the so-called ""foo fighters"", a variety of unusual and anomalous aerial phenomena, were witnessed by both Axis and Allied personnel. While some foo fighter reports were dismissed as the misperceptions of troops in the heat of combat, others were taken seriously, and leading scientists such as Luis Alvarez began to investigate them.**
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_UFOs)      

Did the Nazis do it on their own? Or like the conspiracy tales suggest, did they actually make contact with ETs? As far as I'm concerned that's an unknown, and I can't find anything credible to suggest they had. Maybe they did find something in the Arctic, which was why the USA sent Admiral Byrd down there afterwards.    


&gt;**Nazi Germany claimed the territory of New Swabia in Antarctica, sent an expedition there in 1938, and planned others.**    

#Operation HIGHJUMP 

&gt; officially titled **The United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program, 1946–1947,** was a United States Navy operation organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Jr., USN (Ret), Officer in Charge, Task Force 68, and led by Rear Admiral Ethan Erik Larson, USN, Commanding Officer, Task Force 68. Operation HIGHJUMP commenced 26 August 1946 and ended in late February 1947. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation HIGHJUMP's primary mission was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV.     


So the Nazis go down there in 1938. The War ends and then the Americans jump down there immediately. Strange, right? Something was happening. And as far as I'm concerned, it's still happening to this day. Whatever it is our Governments are claiming to do is nothing but hogwash as far as I'm concerned. And really, why would the foo fighters of WW2 care about the war overall? Would they really care about a bunch of monkeys flying planes and shooting kinetic peices of metal at each other.    


Probably not.     


Until you wonder, did those UFOs arrive here because something in the Antarctic signaled them? And when they got here they saw that we were busy killing each other. Because after all the foo fighter reports then the reports of UFO'S really start picking up.    



#1947 Kenneth Arnold UFO 

&gt;Arnold originally described the objects' shape as ""flat like a pie pan"", ""shaped like a pie plate"", ""half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear"", ""something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear"", or simply **""saucer-like""** or ""like a big flat disk"", and also described their erratic motion being ""like a fish flipping in the sun"" or a **saucer skipped across water.**   
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arnold)


A suacer skipped across water? Doesn’t that sound like a craft that’s able to bend space time to fly? Kind of like the recent reports that scientists have been openly theorizing about. Sort of strange to find a tenuous link like that in 1947, isn’t it?      


And then after that we have Roswell and then events really start to kick it up into high gear with the American Government. How?    


Project Sign

The project was established in 1948 by Air Force General Nathan Farragut Twining, head of the Air Technical Service Command, and was initially named Project SAUCER. The goal of the project was to collect, evaluate, and distribute within the government all information relating to UFO sightings, on the premise that they might represent a national security concern.     
[Source Here!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sign)

We have the Nazis and Antarctic expeditions. Then the Nazis try to build a NUKE and actually develop the first computer called the Z3.  Then we have the foo fighters. Then we have Byrd High Jumping down to the Antarctic in 1947. And we also have UFO sightings by Kenneth Arnold in 1947. Which was immediately followed in 1948 with what was initially called, Project Saucer, just like how Kenneth described his UFO encounter.      

These events are a wee bit odd being so closely tied together, aren't they? Because after project Sign we had yet another project called Project Grudge. But before those projects there was a memo sent out to the military:    


**On September 23, 1947, Lieutenant General Twining issued a memo to Brigadier General George Schulgen of the Army Air Forces. The subject line of the memo read “AMC Opinion Concerning 'Flying Discs. The general tone of the memo was that unidentified objects seen in the skies by military personnel were not weather, astronomical or other phenomenon but rather objects that warranted further investigation. Twining wrote “The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.”**
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_F._Twining)        


**NOW**. Did you notice the date for the letter? September 23, 1947. What's the big deal with the date? Nothing on it's own, until you realize that just five days before this happened.   


#National Security Act of 1947

**The National Security Act of 1947 was a law enacting major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947**      


So. Ahem. Just five days after the NSA took effect, Twinning issued a memo to the military and told them, hey guys, take the UFO phenomenon seriously. Coincidence? Maybe. But I just don't buy it. Why? Because dates matter. Nothing happens in a vacuum. We have conspiracy theorists who have consistently looked past real life events while they eagerly and enthusiastically search for hidden evidence. This is a mistake. A big mistake. And I'm starting to become more convinced that we need to break down everything in order to see the big picture.    

So was Twinning admonished for his crazy pov that the UFO phenomenon should be taken seriously? Sure was! He was demoted and kicked out of the military forever! That's true if you consider getting promoted to become the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a demotion.      

So clearly the military and the President didn't think he was crazy. Not only wasn't he crazy, he was also the first chief of the Air Force to lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Let that sink in. The guy who thought that UFOS we're real became the head military man afterwards. A guy who thought that little green men may be real was promoted, not fired. But hey, **everyone else who believes in aliens is a tin foil hat wearing living in his mom's basement delusional nut job**.     

With that out of the way, back to the issue at hand.    


Has anything else happened that seems out of place? Yes. It. Has. Because while these events happened, we also have a purported meeting in 1954.        


#Fifty years ago tomorrow -- on Feb. 20, 1954 -- President Dwight Eisenhower interrupted his vacation in Palm Springs, Calif., to make a secret nocturnal trip to a nearby Air Force base to meet two extraterrestrial aliens.      
[Source Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/02/19/ike-and-the-alien-ambassadors/4698e544-1dc8-4573-8b8d-2b48d2a6305e/)       


That's pretty far out there, wouldn't you say? I would. And while I'm including it here, I wouldn't necessarily want to say that I believe this. But I also wouldn't discount this event either. Why? Because something else happened just after this meeting took place. Something that conspiracy minded individuals have been talking about for a long time, but never in a connection with UFOS.    


#Bilderberg Group      


The Bilderberg meeting (also known as the Bilderberg Group) is an annual conference established in 1954 to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. The group’s agenda, originally to prevent another world war, is now defined as bolstering a consensus around free market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe. Participants include political leaders, experts from industry, finance, academia, and the media, numbering between 120 and 150. Attendees are entitled to use information gained at meetings, but not attribute it to a named speaker.     
The first conference was held at the Bilderberg Hotel (Hotel de Bilderberg) in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, **from 29 to 31 May 1954.**
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_meeting)     


Some of you may recoil against the suggestion that the Bilderberg Group has a connection to UFOS. And I don't blame you. And I don't necessarily disagree. Yet. Look at the date. Roughly three months after Eisenhower was purported to talk with ET, the group started meeting up. Now. I'm not a fan of secrets. Never have been, and never will be. And the groups track record of their Stasi like handling of journalists is completely repugnant and reprehensible, and the group has no business acting like it was granted the Divine Right of Kings to steer the world without any inclusion of the world's populations. None. And even if they are meeting secretly to discuss the UFO phenomenon, guess what, that still doesn't mean they have our best interests at heart. Ok? Ok. I just wanted to be absolutely clear that I still don't think they're good guys.    


But a couple of dates being close in proximity doesn't mean they have anything to do with each other, does it? No it doesn't. Yet let me show you just a couple of other strange oddities that I found when I started digging into Bilderberg Meetings locations.     


#King City Canada, 1985     


In 1985, the Research Directorate of the Atmospheric Environment Service established the first Canadian Doppler weather radar in King City. In 2004, a Dual-Polarization Radar was installed for further research. These systems are used for predictive purposes, and the data collected is used for weather forecasts for the Greater Toronto Area and the Golden Horseshoe. **The observatory also participates in the NEODyS system, which tracks Near-Earth objects. Six asteroids have been discovered at this site.** 
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_City,_Ontario)        


That's a bit of a coincidence. A small town in Canada that also has an Observatory which tracks Near Earth Objects. And the first Canadian Doppler Weather Radar. This location seems to be mightily preoccupied with tracking the space above us, doesn't it?    


Which leads us to this:     


#Chantilly, Virginia



&gt;The headquarters of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which is one of the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies and considered, along with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and National Geospatial‐Intelligence Agency (NGA), to be one of the ""big five"" U.S. Intelligence agencies. It designs, builds, and operates the spy satellites of the United States government, and provides satellite intelligence to several government agencies, particularly signals intelligence (SIGINT) to the NSA, imagery intelligence (IMINT) to the NGA, and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) to the DIA.
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantilly,_Virginia)      


So the NRO just happens to be where the Bilderberg Group meets in the USA. The intelligence organization that's responsible for satellite intelligence.     


#Turin Italy     


The city is also well known for its aerospace industry Alenia Aeronautica, Thales Alenia Space and Avio. The International Space Station modules Harmony, Columbus, Tranquility, as well as the Cupola and all MPLMs were produced in Turin. The future European launcher projects beyond Ariane 5 will also be managed from Turin by the new NGL company, a subsidiary of EADS (70%) and Aircraft Division of Leonardo (30%).     
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin)     


Are you starting to see a pattern? Because I am. Does that mean all of the locations had something to do with outer space? No. But the list of meeting locations does have some other peculiar entries. They will be explored in more detail in an upcoming post when I have time. But for now, let's at least entertain that not everything may be what it seems to be.     

And from there let's move on to another strange set of circumstances.     



#Majestic 12     


&gt;Majestic 12, also known as MJ-12 for short, is a purported organization that appears in UFO conspiracy theories. The organization is claimed to be the code name of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, **formed in 1947** by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft.        


Back to 1947 again. But really, anyone could have linked that year because of all the UFO hoopla that was, ahem, flying around. But. 


&gt;The concept originated in a series of supposedly leaked secret government documents first circulated by ufologists in 1984.      


Now this starts getting somewhere. Because 1984 was a year prior to Regan suddenly and out of the blue sounding like a conspiracy theorist and going on about UFOS with Gorbachev and having the world unite to fight an extraterrestrial threat. Not. Normal. For. A. President. In. 1985. Not at all. And then that same year as the UFO declaration, this also happened with MJ-12.     


&gt;Shandera and his ufologist colleagues Stanton T. Friedman and Bill Moore say they later received a series of anonymous messages that led them to find what has been called the ""Cutler/Twining memo"" in 1985 while searching declassified files in the National Archives. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower's assistant Robert Cutler to **General Nathan F. Twining** and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax.    
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_12)     


In 1985 they found a memo linked to the General that said, hey guys, take UFOS seriously, and then in that same year Regan goes full on tin foil hat wearing the **The Truth is Out There**.     


#The Three Body Problem and the Dark Forest 


Do you know about this book? You should. I haven't read it yet, but it deals with an alien threat that the world has to confront. And guess who's a fan? Obama.   


**What are some of those books?**      
It’s interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things — some science fiction. For a while, there was a three-volume science-fiction novel, the “Three-Body Problem” series —      
**Oh, Liu Cixin, who won the Hugo Award.**
— which was just wildly imaginative, really interesting. It wasn’t so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping —      
**It’s really about the fate of the universe.**
Exactly. The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty — not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade. [Laughter]
[Source Here](https://www.tor.com/2017/01/17/barack-obama-books-the-three-body-problem/)     


Ha. Ha. Ha. Alien Invasion. How ridiculous. And maybe it is. Yet then we go to here.    

&gt;Zuckerberg recommends Liu’s The Three-Body Problem as a “fun break” from the weighty economics and social science books he included on the list. The book is set during Chairman Mao’s cultural revolution, and opens with an alien race invading Earth after the Chinese government covertly sent signals into space.    
[Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read)     

And then we go here.    


&gt;Darkforest is a computer go program developed by Facebook, based on deep learning techniques using a convolutional neural network.      


And the term Dark Forest means.    


**Since Fermi’s time, there have been several proposed resolutions to his question, which includes the Dark Forest Hypothesis, where extraterrestrial civilizations are deliberately avoiding contact.**       


And guess what the sequel to the Three Body Problem is called? **The Dark Forest.**   


Does this mean, aliens? Not necessarily. It could be a psy op designed by intelligence agencies towards an an agenda to further consolidate power. Of course it could. They don't exactly have a track record of caring about society, **cough, MKULTRA, cough cough**. 


Which brings us to now. To our present. To the longest two weeks of our lives. The era of Flatten the Curve and were All In This Together. Let's take another look at another strange coincidence.    


#Enders Game    

I had been reading reports about Tom Hanks and I pretty much dismissed them. Does that mean I'm right and they hold no weight. Nope. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he is part of some kidnapping children scheme that worships Moloch. Yet doesn't that seem like an outlandish enough theory that it could have been intentionally planted to occupy skeptical minds somewhere else? And where has all or that led us? Down a rabbit hole where any outside thinking of the narrative gets you labeled a crazy nut job by society. Never mind that the government actively keeps information away from us. You know, like whatever information they have dealing with UFOS. Which was called a conspiracy for years. And we were called carzy. And now they have started to say, hey, we have information that you don't know about. Uhm. Ok. And still nobody understands that the internet is actively using propoganda to shape our thinking. Because when the news of UAP'S broke, nobody batted an eye. Literally anyone that I brought it up to just went, ok, cool, and then carried on like that wasn't a massive bombshell.    


Yep. Perfectly normal. Back to our cell phones.    


Ok. Back to Tom Hanks. Actually, no. Let me show you Rita Hanks. And that picture again that came out at the start of the pandemic.      


[Rita Wilson and Enders Game Picture](https://images.app.goo.gl/K6efRjFGrPsssZCW8)      


And what is Enders Game. Oh, you know, a book about humans fighting a war with aliens. That's all. Nothing to see hear. Not. At. All. So was this a heads up to those of us paying attention? Or was it simply an effort to tell us, like the book, that not everything was what it seemed, and we're currently in the middle of unrestricted warfare before WW3? 


#Final Thoughts     


When I first started writing this series, aliens were the last thing on my mind. Seriously. Yes I was fascinated with them as a child. But as the years passed they became nothing but background noise. I dismissed all of them. Why? Nor sure. I guess life got busy and I became consumed by weapons of mass distraction. Thanks internet. But now I just can't dismiss it anymore. We have far too many coincidences to not think that something else is going on. Is it all part of a massive intelligence plan by the alphabet agencies? Or is this real? Because I do find it strange that the Vaccine Drive was called, **Operation Warp Speed**. And I also fond it odd that we have so many proclamations of physics breakthroughs and Salvatore Ceasar Pais claiming that he theoretically can cause mass reduction to enable interstellar travel. Or something along that lines (more coming up in a later post).    


And what about our Governments and if Presidents and Prime Ministers are really in charge of the country and society?     


&gt;In a radio interview last month, she said, “I want to open the files as much as we can.” Asked if she believed in U.F.O.s, Mrs. Clinton said: “I don’t know. I want to see what the information shows.” But she added, “There’s enough stories out there that I don’t think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen making them up.”      
When asked about extraterrestrials in an interview with The Conway Daily Sun in New Hampshire last year, Mrs. Clinton promised to “get to the bottom of it.”     
“I think we may have been” visited already, she said in the interview. “We don’t know for sure.”
[Source Here](https://psmag.com/news/why-is-hillary-clinton-making-strange-comments-about-aliens)     


She wanted to get to the bottom of it. Yep. Ok. Come on. She was part of this op from the very start. And did you notice that she said, I want to open the files as much as we can? What did she mean by that little nugget?    


&gt;However, she added a caveat that she will not be able to release any files that are closed due to national security.     
She said: ""**I mean, if there’s some huge national security thing and I can’t get agreement to open them, I won’t**, but I do want to open them because I’m interested.”    
[Source Here](https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/663246/Hillary-Clinton-tells-alien-abductee-national-security-could-block-UFO-truth-bid)      


And I can't get agreement to open them. I won't. Really? You won't? Or you're not allowed. Because words matter. She doesn't say, I won't open them because it will harm the nation. She simply says, I won't. So let me finish that sentence for her; I won't open them because I won't be allowed.    

Not that it matters, because if she was talking about it openly, then she had been instructed to openly talk about it.      

So where does this post lead us ultimately? Nowhere, really. But it does (in my opinion) shine a little bit more light on this subject, and it let's us see that there's a very good chance that something more is happening hidden in plain sight. Maybe, just maybe, tge National Security Act was established to deal with more than just us and foreign adversaries. Maybe there is something more than we can imagine happening down in the Antarctic. Maybe Majestic_12 is real. And maybe, just maybe, we have something more happening than just simply trying to overcome a pandemic. Because if any science is sufficiently advanced we would consider it magic, wouldn't we also have to consider that an alien race would be far removed from needing kinetic weapons to subdue us? I'm not suggesting that I think we’re under an invasion, but I'm also not going to discount anything now. And neither should you. Because there's a reason that UFOS have suddenly been disclosed by the government at the same time as a pandemic, but even if UFOS are real, that doesn't mean that the current UFO discussion initiated by the intelligence agencies isn't currently fake.


Part Two will be coming along shortly. Don't forget your **paperclips**. 


Keep your head up and eyes open.

Alpaca Finance ETH Deposit Vault and Leveraged Farming Pools + Interest Rate Adjustment,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/myt1if/alpaca_finance_eth_deposit_vault_and_leveraged/,AlapcaFinance,1,2021-04-26 16:37:00,0,/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/myt1if/alpaca_finance_eth_deposit_vault_and_leveraged/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/o8n45qzybhv61.png?width=3550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab4f52057c750d345dba94e271718b5da6785de)

Dear Alpacas,

Rain or shine, we senior Alpacas will keep on delivering new product features for the herd. So today, we’re excited to announce that we’ll be adding something to our platform, an all-new — ETH deposit vault!

We know that in crypto, many people like holding ETH for the long term. Now, they’ll have an opportunity to do so, while gaining high yields!

Along with this, we’ll also open three new leveraged yield farming pools on ETH pairs:

* BETH-ETH (4x)
* COMP-ETH (3x)
* SUSHI-ETH (3x)

# 💲Benefits to ETH depositors:

* As ETH depositors, you’ll earn interest from borrowed ETH. The lending interest will vary between **0% — 150% APR(**equaling **0% — 348% APY** compounded continuously**),** based on the pool’s utilization level. Most of the time though, we expect the borrowing rate to be stable around 20% APR. You can learn more about our interest rate model [here](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/our-protocol-1/global-parameters).
* You‘ll also be able to receive ALPACA rewards by staking ibETH(which you’ll get after depositing ETH) on the [Stake page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake). We’ll be allocating 100 reward points (\~ 1.7 ALPACA/block based on current emission rate) to ibETH stakers.

# 🕐Release Timeline

* ETH deposit vault &amp; ibETH staking: **Thursday, April 8th, 2021 at 8 AM GMT.** You’ll be able to start depositing your ETH on our [Lend Page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/lend) and stake your ibETH (which you’ll get after depositing ETH) for ALPACA rewards on [Stake Page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake)
* Leveraged farming pools: **Friday, April 9th, 2021 at 8 AM GMT.** You’ll be able to start opening leveraged positions on ETH pairs on our [Farm page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm).

# 🎁Rewards Allocations

* **ibETH stakers: 100 reward points** (\~ 1.82ALPACA/block based on current emission rate)
* **LYF positions on ETH pairs: 100 reward points.** The amount of ALPACA you receive will be based on your debt size. (\~ 1.82ALPACA/block based on current emission rate)

# 📈Interest Rate Model Adjustment

Since we launched leveraged yield farming two weeks ago, there’s been a massive demand for it, evidenced by the frequently high utilization rate on both the BNB and BUSD deposit vaults. During discussions in the barn, we Senior alpacas have analyzed how this has affected the system.

We’ve realized that while keeping these lending pools at high utilization is good for capital efficiency, their utilization rates have overshot to 95%+ more often than ideal, causing borrowing rates to become too high at times. Although these utilization spikes don’t last long, the change in APYs sometimes frightens some of the younger Alpacas…

Like shadows in the shape of llamas…

In addition, since leveraged yield farming is more effective as a long-term strategy, maintaining stable and predictable lending rates is important for all participants. As such, we’ll be making an adjustment to the borrowing interest rate model to improve the system’s efficiency.

**We’ll be raising the borrowing interest rate on slope-2 from a flat 10% to a flat 20%** (Slope 2 is the interest rate for 50–90% utilization). While at first glance, this may seem like a negative for yield farmers, we believe that after implementation, this will prove to be a positive for everyone involved, including farmers, for the following reasons:

* By raising the borrowing rate on slope-2, it will make the borrowing rate on slope-3 more prohibitive, which is the essential function of the steep curve on slope-3, to act as a counter-force pushing utilization down. This is best for everyone because long-term high utilization is inefficient. When utilization stays above 95% for a long time, although the lending APY increases, it also makes it difficult for lenders to withdraw, decreasing the appeal of lending in general, leading to fewer people willing to lend in the future. Fewer lenders -&gt; a smaller lending pool -&gt; higher utilization -&gt; higher borrowing rates for farmers. This is a negative cycle, which as you can see, is no good for anyone. Thus, by raising the interest rate on slope-2, utilization will stay away from the steeper slope-3, spending more time on slope-2, leading to a more stable borrowing rate where everyone can make money.
* By raising the borrowing rate at typical utilization, we expect to attract more capital, increasing the lending pool size, which will also result in lower utilization and thus lower borrowing rates; a positive cycle.
* With a larger capital pool, we’ll likely see less volatility in utilization rate fluctuations due to individual lenders having a smaller percentage of the pool when withdrawing.
* With higher and more predictable yields, lenders would be more willing to deploy capital in our vaults for longer periods of time rather than jumping back and forth, increasing the stability of the lending rate for everyone.
* This rate is more in line with the lending rates of competing protocols. Right now, many of our farming APYs are far ahead of competitors, but with such a large gap, there are diminishing returns. By adjusting the lending rate to optimize for overall protocol efficiency, it will lead to Alpaca Finance being more competitive as a whole, improving the value of the protocol and its representative token. Then, since everyone receives ALPACA rewards, a higher price of ALPACA -&gt; higher APYs for everyone.

Thus, we believe this adjustment will be beneficial for the entire ecosystem, leading to greater long-term profits for everybody. No matter how you participate, you’ll be able to lend or farm in peace, knowing your APYs are more stable. In addition, we’ll continue to monitor the dynamics of this change and keep improving the parameters one step at a time, seeking optimal efficiency and balance.

This change will go into effect on **Friday, April 9th, 2021 at Midnight GMT.**

The chart below illustrates our updated interest rate model.

So, you can look forward to all these updates this week. We’re especially excited about the BETH-ETH pool because we believe it’ll likely bring many new participants into our protocol:

* New lenders, that want to simply hold ETH and gain high APYs doing so.
* New leveraged farmers, that want ETH exposure, without having to worry about IL. In fact, there are very few farming pools where one can do this. After all, ETH and the typical tokens it’s paired with are volatile. However, the BETH-ETH pair is similar to the stable-stable pairs in that it possesses the like-kind property, due to BETH being pegged to ETH. That means that with a high degree of certainty, you can expect their prices to move together! In addition, BETH is not a new speculative pegged-token. It’s a token backed by Binance that has seen a large amount of adoption, having maintained a relatively high correlation to ETH historically. Hence, you can farm this pool without having to be overly concerned about volatility!

Well, we hope you enjoyed this newsflash. Yet, these are only a few of the updates we plan to release soon. At the moment, we’re working on additional features, UX improvements, new pools, and much more! So don’t forget to regularly check our socials!"

I’ve been observing the emergence of climate-oriented Republicans over the past few years, so I thought I would offer an update on what the GOP’s climate policy looks like for anyone who is interested. So today, we’re talking about the **[Energy Innovation Agenda](https://www.republicanleader.gov/the-energy-innovation-agenda/)**.

I’ve been burned on this before. Last summer, I wrote a pretty long post on this sub about a different “comprehensive plan” that Republican leaders endorsed and then immediately backtracked. You can read my post about that [here](/r/neoliberal/comments/hkmd2f/the_house_republicans_and_democrats_both_just/). 

# The Energy Innovation Agenda

The Republicans call their plan the “Energy Innovation Agenda.” The EIA was not created as a unified proposal, but rather drawn from many pre-existing bills introduced by Republicans. Among the notable members participating in the rollout this week were:

- **Kevin McCarthy**, GOP leader 
- **Garret Graves**, the top Republican on the **Select Committee on the Climate Crisis**
- **Cathy McMorris Rodgers**, top Republican on the **Energy and Commerce** Committee
- **Bruce Westerman**, top Republican on the **Natural Resources** Committee
- **Frank Lucas**, top Republican on the **Science, Space, and Technology** Committee
- **Sam Graves**, top Republican on the **Transportation and Instructure** Committee
- **Glenn Thompson**, top Republican on the **Agriculture** Committee
- **Michael McCaul**, top Republican on the **Foreign Affairs** Committee
- **Gary Palmer**, Chair of the **House Republican Policy Committee**

There were also plenty of Republican House members supporting the rollout without any relevant leadership position. But given the strong leadership support for the EIA, I am comfortable calling it the Republican plan.

# Composition of the Agenda

The webpage and rollout for the Agenda were built around the following six pillars. The bolded here text is taken from the plan itself, and the unbolded is my short summary. 

-  **Technological Innovation** Anticipating new technologies is the keystone of the GOP Agenda
- **Nuclear Energy** Policy to boost US uranium supply and finance nuclear plants in other countries
- **Natural Gas/Pipelines** We need more of it, including American gas exports to other countries
- **Renewable Energy** Lots of hydropower, plus mining of critical minerals
- **Regulatory Reform** Remove regulatory barriers to energy projects, especially natural gas drilling and pipelines
- **Natural Solutions and Conservation** Forestry and farming to sequester carbon

For the rest of the post, I will go through each plank of this agenda discussing those proposals and my own analysis of them.

# Technological Innovation

This plank does not refer to any one technology in particular, with the other sections all dedicated to individual tech areas. Rather, this plank outlines the general Republican outlook that **further technological innovation is the key to addressing climate change**.

Now, literally everyone in the climate policy space also recognizes an important role for technological progress. I’m a techno-optimist. What is unique about this GOP approach, though, is that it seeks to **preserve existing practices rather than enabling new ones**. Both Republicans and Democrats are responding to the same observed problem: our economy is based on production methods that emit greenhouse gases.

 Democrats respond to this by trying to change the economy so that it is no longer based on those production methods. They seek to alter price structures and create incentives to push people away from these destructive systems, before imposing regulations to end them entirely. Their end goal is to run the whole economy on zero-carbon energy.

**Republicans, on the other hand, want to modify the existing production methods so that we can continue relying on them without harming the climate.** The Republican plan has no intention of eliminating fossil fuels, reducing automobile use, or decreasing energy consumption. Instead, it hopes to discover technological and natural solutions that will let these practices remain, just minus their intense carbon emissions. And, as I will discuss, it is not clear that Republicans are even aiming to drastically reduce emissions — their aims are pretty limited.

The strictly innovation-policy proposal in this plank is to **[double early-stage science research funding](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-lucas-its-time-to-reinvest-in-american-science-and-technology/)**. There’s broad agreement in the climate that such an investment would be good, but some critics might prefer more ambition in two ways. First, confining the investment to early-stage research could be viewed as insufficient, as opposed to funding [research, development ,*demonstration, and deployment*](https://scottpeters.house.gov/climate-playbook-section/research-development-demonstration-deployment). Second, doubling investment is low relative to a lot of prominent proposals, such as Bill Gates’ call to quintuple research funding in his recent climate book. 

There are three other specific policies in this section that are not covered by the other planks. The EIA **opposes carbon pricing** and **supports carbon capture**. Their opposition to carbon pricing contradicts their desire for market solutions and technological innovation, but I’m sure I don’t need to reiterate that on this sub. In case anyone wants an overview of carbon pricing policy, this is a [good report](https://www.wri.org/research/putting-price-carbon-evaluating-carbon-price-and-complementary-policies-15deg-world). The EIA also **opposes US participation in the Paris Agreement**.

There are references to natural gas and nuclear power in this section, but I will cover those in their respective sections.

#Nuclear 

I have a lot of opinions about this section, so I’m going to put a concrete wall between the actual proposals and my analysis

### EIA proposals on nuclear

There are two new nuclear proposals in the EIA. They also link to some op-eds and already-adopted bills, but there are only two on-the-table proposals.

One of them wants to establish a [US uranium reserve](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-latta-we-need-to-establish-a-uranium-reserve/) so that America doesn’t need to rely on other countries for nuclear fuel. The other would have the US [advocate for the World Bank to finance nuclear projects](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-mchenry-bring-back-financing-for-nuclear-power-at-the-world-bank/) in the developing world. The World Bank has not been funding nuclear projects [since 2013](https://grist.org/climate-energy/world-bank-says-no-to-nuclear-as-it-lays-out-universal-energy-plan/ ).

### Subatomic levels of ambition: These policies aren’t enough

*This is now my analysis.*

If you want to see more nuclear power in the United States, this agenda is pretty lacking. Nuclear faces a lot of [hurdles](https://rootsofprogress.org/devanney-on-the-nuclear-flop). Plants take literal [decades and billions of dollars](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J) to build. **There simply is not an appetite among utilities and investors in the US to expand nuclear electricity**. 

For all their pro-nuclear rhetoric, Republicans’ policy proposals don’t even approach these roadblocks. At the end of the Obama administration, famously pro-nuclear Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz commissioned a [report](https://www.energy.gov/seab/downloads/final-report-task-force-future-nuclear-power) on **what it would take to get significant expansion of nuclear in America**. I think it’s still one of the best guides out there. That report identified the following seven issues. 

- Absence of a carbon price	
- Technical, cost, and regulatory uncertainties of new nuclear tech	
- Waste management and public acceptance	
- Projected market conditions	
- Unanticipated intervening events, like accident	
- Overnight capital costs	
- Electricity markets must recognize the value of carbon-free electricity

At the risk of sounding like a partisan hack, Republican proposals don’t help with any of this. Two of their top energy priorities would even make nuclear’s situation a lot worse. Their support for natural gas and their vehement opposition to carbon pricing both exacerbate nuclear’s overriding problem: cost competitiveness. Nuclear simply costs more than gas and renewables, so no one builds it. Republican policies only leave that cost gap to fester. 

If you want nuclear in a green economy, the only way is for it to **fill a very particular niche** on a zero-carbon grid. The only logical place for it is to be the **reliable baseload complementing renewables that are cheaper but [variable](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11257)**. But Republican policies would eliminate that crucial niche by preserving a role for natural gas. If cheap, plentiful natural gas is still an option, who in their right mind would invest in nuclear?

# Natural Gas

Republicans are big fans of natural gas. Most of the gas policy proposals in the Energy Innovation Agenda concern domestic gas production and consumption, as you can read outlined on the Agenda webpage. Republicans want to **allow drilling for gas on federal lands**, and they want **building gas pipelines to be easier**. They are mad at Biden for cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline, but gas pipelines were struggling even during the Trump administration for a variety of reasons.

One point on natural gas that I actually wish Republicans put more focus on is **American gas exports**, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG). Republicans really love LNG exports, and the Trump administration put out official materials calling natural gas “[molecules of US freedom](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48454674).” From a climate perspective, Republicans postulate that other countries will still need gas for years to come, so they might as well use US gas because it is less carbon intensive than Russian gas. 

The **energy transitions of developing countries is something** I wish Democrats would address. India and Africa will grow in population and industrialize over the coming decades, and what energy they use to do so will have huge climate impacts. China’s [Belt and Road Initiative has invested a lot in coal](https://www.cfr.org/blog/climate-challenge-and-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative) around the developing world, although it looks like they will phase that out moving forward. In 2019, the Department of Energy put out a [report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/09/f66/2019%20NETL%20LCA-GHG%20Report.pdf) measuring the lifecycle emissions of US LNG and Russian gas in European and Asian markets. They found that **American LNG has lower carbon emissions than Russian gas**. In Europe, American LNG was 29% cleaner than Russian gas over 20 years and 10% cleaner over 100 years. In Asia, 32% over 20 years and 11% over 100 years. While it is important to get to global net zero emissions around mid-century, any partial emissions reductions we make along the way will also have an impact.

Now, there is room for debate as to whether the US should support expanding gas use in developing countries. Doing so may lock those energy systems on a fossil-dependent path, delaying the transition to zero-carbon power. But on the other hand, these countries are [already investing in](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/natural-gas-renewables-key-to-india-decarbonization.html)  gas expansion, so it may as well be cleaner, geopolitically-better American gas. And perhaps the US could use its influence as an exporter to promote [carbon capture on gas plants](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/1/17416444/net-power-natural-gas-carbon-air-pollution-allam-cycle).

Now I should also note that Republicans mainly promote gas exports to European countries. That’s quite silly, really, as Europe has viable zero-carbon power options in solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear.

# Renewables

The Republicans’ proposals on renewable energy come in three buckets: **expanding hydropower, supporting hydrogen fuel, and supporting critical mineral production**. To be clear, hydropower (hydro) refers to generating electricity by moving water through a turbine, such as in a dam. Hydrogen power uses the element hydrogen as a fuel source.

On hydropower, Republicans want to make permitting and licensing regulations lighter for new dams and [pumped hydro storage](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower). On critical minerals, which are necessary for solar panels, batteries, and other pieces of the electricity puzzle, Republicans are very concerned about concentration of the supply chain in China, so they want more American production of minerals. And on hydrogen, Republicans want to expand one federal loan program from covering hHydrogen fuel cell technology” to also cover hydrogen “production, delivery, infrastructure, storage, fuel cells, and end uses.”

I should provide a few notes of context about hydropower. I won’t go into much detail since this post is pretty long and hydro isn’t hugely prominent in energy policy debates. First, there is a question of how much room for expansion there is in US hydro since we already have dams pretty much everywhere they could be. However, the Department of Energy believes that we could expand hydro by electrifying dams that currently do not provide any power. A [2016 DOE report](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/articles/hydropower-vision-new-chapter-america-s-1st-renewable-electricity-source) estimated that US hydro capacity could increase by around 50% by 2050. And industry observers say that there is also room to grow for [pumped hydro storage](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/to-batteries-and-beyond-in-a-high-renewables-world-pumped-hydro-storage-c/584958/). Finally, I should just note for the record that constructing [new dams releases a large amount of methane](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate).

I would be remiss if I did not note how unusual it is to roll out a big climate agenda with a section dedicated to nuclear power without any thought given to deployment of wind or solar energy. Huge strides are being made in those areas, and the Republican plan just misses it entirely. There are policy issues that need to be addressed to achieve widespread wind and solar deployment. We need to address [variability](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11257), energy [storage](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/9/20767886/renewable-energy-storage-cost-electricity), and the infamous [duck curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve). But Republicans have offered no ideas to address these issues, at least as far as the Energy Innovation Agenda is concerned.

# Regulatory Reform

I will admit that I will have to learn more about the energy industry to offer a substantive evaluation of these specific legislative proposals. But I can summarize what they do. The three bills proposed under this plank seek to reduce the regulatory burden associated with creating and maintaining energy infrastructure. These regulatory changes range from reducing the time associated with federal environmental impact reviews to only applying regulations dealing with increased pollution to actions resulting in increased pollution.

From my perspective as a center-left, climate oriented person who follows energy policy as a hobby, they seem good but rather small. 

# Natural Solutions and Conservation

In this area, Republicans focus on **forestry and farming**. Their signature proposal in this area has been the **Trillion Trees Act**, which seeks to plant one trillion trees over thirty years — with the objective of [cutting them down again](https://grist.org/climate/republicans-want-to-plant-1-trillion-trees-and-then-log-them/) for lumber. Reforestation is a popular climate policy, but the [climate impact](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/scientists-question-trillion-trees-plan-as-climate-strategy) of the Trillion Trees Act is questionable. [Another forestry proposal](/https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-blake-moore-incorporating-innovative-technology-into-our-reforestation-efforts/) in the Energy Innovation Agenda would have the federal government use drones and other high-tech methods in reforestation efforts. And another proposal would provide [grants for the creation of urban forests](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-malliotakis-on-urban-forests/) .

On farming, Republicans want to pay for [precision agriculture](https://www.republicanleader.gov/rep-hinson-lets-work-with-our-farmers-not-against-them/), which uses technology for greater efficiency. They also want to provide funds and technical assistance for farmers to use techniques to [increase soil carbon sequestration](https://www.republicanleader.gov/rep-davis-lets-find-workable-natural-solutions-that-benefit-our-farmers/), such as rotating crop types and planting cover crops. 

Finally, Republicans also want to focus on forest management techniques to mitigate wildfires.

# Overall analysis

The first few times that I read through the Energy Innovation Agenda, I had a feeling of frustration that was hard to place. I’m glad that the Republican Party is engaging on climate policy, which is unambiguously better than being a part of climate denial. But I have pondered, what if they implemented every single policy they propose? My problem is that the Republicans’ big plan — supposedly their answer to Biden’s proposals and the Green New Deal — would probably do very little to reduce emissions.

We can illustrate this if we think about all the different areas in which emissions need to be reduced. You can see those laid out on the table below.

### US total GHG emissions by sector (2016)

*Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#by-country-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-sector)*

Emissions category | Amount (megatons CO2e) | **Solutions** | **Challenges**                      
---|---|---|---
Electricity &amp; heat | 2,150 (36%) | Zero-carbon power | Intermittency, cost, deployment
Transport | 1,710 (29%) | Electric and zero-carbon vehicles, public transit | EV infrastructure, airplanes
Buildings | 497 (8%) | Electrification | long stock life, cost
Manufacturing &amp; construction | 434 (7%) | zero-carbon steel, concrete, plastic creation | needs R&amp;D
Agriculture | 381 (6%) | Animal emissions, tractors | needs R&amp;D
Fugitive emissions | 292 (5%) | Stop gas leaks, new appliances | implementation
Industry | 222 (4%) | high heat processes | needs R&amp;D
Waste | 131 (2%) | [See here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg3-chapter10-1.pdf) | [See here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg3-chapter10-1.pdf) 
Aviation &amp; shipping | 127 (2%) | zero carbon fuels | expensive, needs R&amp;D
*Other* | 95  (2%)| | |

This table only includes US emissions. It is important to consider how US policy might enable global emissions reductions, especially in India and Africa, where billions of people will become rich consumers in the next few decades. But for the sake of a simple table, consider first just US emissions.

If the whole Energy Innovation Agenda were implemented, I can’t see the emissions picture changing that much. If we start with electricity, the largest source of emissions, there is not much to work with. Most electricity-related policy in the Republican Agenda promotes natural gas, which is probably already as widespread as it will get. It was great that natural gas kicked us off of coal, but further progress on emissions will require us to move to zero-carbon power sources. Aside from gas, I’m sure easier licensing requirements might give a little boost to hydropower, but otherwise, **the electricity policies don’t promise much change to our mix of power**. 

Instead of promoting different power sources, a lot of the Republican proposals aim to make the US **energy independent**, such as by getting our own supplies of uranium and critical minerals. There may not be anything wrong with independent supply chains, but that will not do much to address the underlying factors enabling or preventing the expansion of zero-carbon power.

Maybe the biggest missing piece from this Agenda is the lack of any transportation policies. Nothing to promote zero-emissions vehicles or public transportation. Certainly no urbanism. The support of hydrogen research will *maybe* give a boost to clean air travel R&amp;D. But even this policy doesn’t actually increase funding for R&amp;D; it just expands the types of hydrogen projects that can be funded.

I won't go through every single thing that is neglected by these proposals. I think a review of our emissions will suffice on its own. But the overall point is that these proposals really nibble around the edges in terms of getting us closer to net zero.

A phrase that keeps coming to my mind is **climate policy without climate change**. What I mean by that is, even though Republicans have packaged this as climate policy, they seem to have a lot of goals other than reducing emissions. They want US energy independence. They want to compete with China. They want to support the logging industry. They want to support farmers. I’m sure that’s all very nice, but it is not emissions reductions.

And, at least in the timeframe contemplated by all these policies, Republicans seem to have **no intention of getting to net zero emissions**. They never articulated such a goal in this plan, and the policies do not point that way. To be sure, these policies do have emissions-reducing potential, but they also solidify the foothold of carbon-intensive activities like burning natural gas and cutting down trees. 

**I shouldn’t be all negative**. I love R&amp;D investments, so if Republicans want to increase those, by all means. I appreciate the support of carbon capture, which will be necessary. I appreciate the occasional consideration of reducing emissions in other countries, which is a neglected facet of the US policy debate.

So in my view, I am glad that the Republican Party is thinking about climate policy. I think that indicates that they believe it to be politically important. We still have room to grow to a point where (1) Republican climate policy aims for net zero emissions and (2) Republicans prioritize climate enough to actually legislate rather than just talking about proposals. 

But in the long slog of climate politics, this is a step in the right direction.

At the end of the post, I want to make a shameless plug that **I am starting a [free Substack](https://dismaltheorem.substack.com/) on climate issues from a center-left/neoliberal perspective**. If you're interested in this area, it would make my day to get some subscriptions. Plus, my substack, The Dismal Theorem, is named after a Harvard economist, so I thought this sub would like that.

 04/26/2021 Morning Forecast-Markets are implying a move of 1.12%+/-(up/down) on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have realized a move of 0.77%+/-(up/down). The difference between what market makers are implying and what has been realized has increased. The spread widened to 560 (17.96-12.36) basis points. The put/call gamma imbalance favors put buying relative to call buying. Short put gamma on client purchases has the potential to exacerbate market selloffs. However, a widening spread increases left-tail risk and the potential for spikes in realized volatility. Realized volatility has decreased recently below 13. This is favorable for smaller moves up or down on the indices. I expect a decreasing trend over the 2nd Quarter during April, May, and June. The current market environment is favorable for traders looking to sell convexity via short straddles, strangles, call overwriting, put writes, and other short vol strategies to capture alpha. The MOVE index hovers around 60 to 65 (or movement of 3 basis points daily in Treasury yields.)  However, economic growth upgrades and rising inflation expectations were pushing up real yields and raising discount rates. The rise in yields has diminished lessening negative effects on long-duration assets, such as Technology Stocks and Longer-Term Bonds. The S&amp;P is expected to move close to 1.27%+/- (up/down) this week, which means the S&amp;P could rise 16% or fall 13% above its 200 DAY Moving average (3,630.20.) The S&amp;P traded well above its 50-day moving average (3,976.32) last week. Full Year S&amp;P Earnings are expected to total 176 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P at 23x's earnings, which equates to an earnings yield of 4.3% &amp; an inflation-adjusted real earnings yield of 1.86% (using 5-year TIPs Break-evens for inflation 2.44.) Analysts are anticipating earnings in 2022 of 202 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P forward earnings for 2022 at 20.3.x's or a Yield = 4.9% &amp; Inflation Adjusted 2.46%

Forecasters have up-graded nominal and real growth expectations for the full year. The highest number of Private Forecasters and those from Federal Open Market Committee members are close to 7% on a Real basis. If this rate of growth is realized it would add 1.3 Trillion Dollars of Real Output to the US Economy ($18.78 Trillion = 20.00  Growth of 1,314 Billion.) The Corona Virus subtracted 3.5% of Real Economic Output from the US Economy in 2020. In 2021 the US Economy would need to grow at least 3.62% to break even on a Real basis (3.5% = 1/(1-0.035.) For the 1st quarter of 2021 upgrades to current estimates of nominal growth are 550 Billion and a Real Economic output of 378 Billion. There is no seasonal rigidity this year associated with 1st Quarter Growth.  The Atlanta Federal Reserve GDP Now indicates a 1st quarter growth rate of 8.3%. This equates to nominal growth of 563.8 Billion and real growth of 389 Billion. At the end of Q4 2020, the US lost 500 Billion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 669 Billion in Real Growth. The US will break even and eclipse this mark by May or June of this year 2021. The US is also on pace to close the output gap by the end of the third quarter, which means the economy will be running hot into the 4th quarter and 1st quarter of 2022. The US is on pace to generate a little over 560 Billion Dollars of Nominal Economic Output in the 1st Quarter. At the current pace If it held through the full year,  would generate close to 2.2 Trillion Dollars of Economic Output. While this is exciting, I do not think this pace is sustainable or likely to culminate in those size gains. However, I do believe a nominal gain of 1.5 Trillion to 2.1 Trillion in Economic Nominal Output is possible in 2021.

Full Year Economic Output estimates have increased significantly following the passage of stimulus. The median forecast was anticipating close to 1.2 Trillion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 800 Billion Dollars in real economic output for 2021. The 90 Trillion Dollar Global Economy will be led by the US and China, contributing more than 1 Trillion individually and 3 Trillion combined to global output. Current Account Imbalances between Surplus and Deficit Country's are likely to persist. However, they represent only 1.25% to 1.5% of nominal Global Output. These imbalances relative to the build-up before the Great Financial Crises are significantly smaller. Current Account Surplus ranges between 1.6 Trillion and 1.9 Trillion Dollars and Global Current Account Deficit mirror these amounts. The large creditor nation's savings surplus will allow the US to run very large fiscal deficits. A major acceleration in growth is positioning the US to capture more than 1/3 of Global Economic Output in 2021. Economists continue to place the highest expectation for growth in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. US households and businesses will add a substantial amount of spending on Goods &amp; Services, which may face downside risk if there are any delays in Covid vaccinations,  roll-outs, or any unforeseen supply chain bottlenecks.  Personal Consumption Expenditures in April, May, and June will likely range between 80 to 160 billion dollars per month. We could see nominal GDP growth in the 2nd Quarter of 700B to 600B and Real Output between 375B to 310B. In addition to spending more in dollar terms, US households will also be saving more. A prolonged higher US savings rate relative to historic norms will help fund larger dissavings in the Public Sector, which along with Federal Reserve Large Scale Asset Purchases will somewhat mitigate substantial reliance on foreigner's savings.

The March non-farm payroll report was extremely robust changing the recent overall trend, which had been tilted towards weaker payroll growth. Despite a strong report there still exist 10 million Americans Unemployed. A large cohort of more than 4 Million on longer-term unemployment and 20 million receiving some form of Unemployment assistance. A return to 164 Million US workers employed may be continually undermined by the 6.5 million Americans remaining out of the labor force, which indicates large and substantial slack in the labor market. Private Forecast is anticipating payroll growth between 270k and 500k per month, which equates to 3.2 Million &amp; 6.0 Million additions to full-year US payrolls. This key economic indicator is likely to pressure growth in the 1st half of 2021. The relatively slow growth of the US population along with a substantial rise in the number of workers Not in the Labor Force has shrunk the size of the currently available labor pool. In 2020, the US lost a total of  9.7 Million Jobs or a loss of 6%. To break even this year the US would need employment growth of 6.60%. Nominal wage gains topped 5% during the recession for Non-Supervisory workers. Although, ECI (Employment Cost Index) salary and wages rose 2.8% in 2020. The gain in productivity, employment compensation, and a large amount of slack in the labor market tilt towards a continuation of non-inflationary pressures as the US economy grows.

 However, the recent agreement on 1.9 Trillion in deficit spending is a significant tailwind to nominal growth in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This should increase aggregate demand, which should foster higher employment gains, but this assumes that virus cases come down substantially by April/May/June and pandemic flare-ups lessen. This has led some market observers to anticipate economic overheating, which is favorable for upside risk in inflation. I believe these fears are statistically unfounded. However, I do not disagree with rising inflation as a potential risk in the short term. The recent increase in nominal Treasury yields and 5yr Break-Evens on TIPs (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) towards 2.44% is transitory and likely reflecting anticipated increases in energy prices and base effects. The Federal Reserve typically subtracts 40 basis points from the break-even inflation rates, which would mean inflation expectations are currently anchored around the 2% (inflation averaging metric.)

Following the passage of stimulus larger fiscal dissavings increases capital inflows to finance VERY large TWIN DEFICITS, which should put upward pressure on the US Dollar &amp; downward pressure on Corporate &amp; Government Bond Yields. The most recent Trade Data indicates the US is on pace to record a real Trade Deficit of 1.2 Trillion Dollars by the end of 2021. The current rise in yields and increase in growth expectations will likely favor a stronger US Dollar in the 1st half of 2021. This is also likely to put some additional pressure on higher real yields if growth and inflation increases are realized. Although, potentially weaker inflation data than consensus estimates should allow real yields to remain deeply negative. Thus providing additional support to the Federal Reserves ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) and an extremely accommodating stance. Dollar appreciation also dampens import/commodity-driven inflation and should lessen temporary transitory base effects. The strong US dollar may have negative effects on Emerging market Countries with large current account deficits and substantial debt denominated in US Dollars. Inflationistah and inflation fear-mongers engaging in scare tactics are likely to be proven wrong. However, inflation base effects are expected to be short-term. There will be a transitory spike in headline inflation data from April, May, and June. The impact on Core PCE is expected to be limited. Market Expectations are split, but I expect the Federal Reserve will look through these spikes.

Political risks have diminished in the 1st half of 2021 due to reconciliation, but it has increased in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, which may pose risk to much-needed Investment spending (infrastructure, human capital, &amp; research development), so I view it in the medium term as tilted to the upside due to potential gridlock. However, there is the possibility for another round of reconciliation in the 2022 budget combined with the removal of the Filibuster Rules in the Senate. This could pave the way for easier passage of additional INVESTMENT lead spending, which is much needed to raise the US Long Term Potential Growth Rate. Although, due to political isolation this increases the potential for Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorism.

Vaccine distribution is priced into Q3 2021, but distribution obstacles have increased and efficacy for herd immunity will be closely watched. Redefining herd immunity may become the norm, so instead of a fully vaccinated population of 90%. We may accept a different goal post for ""full vaccination"" perhaps it drops between 70% to 75%(?) Details are currently unknown. The market is currently pricing in an additional 4.82% move +/- (up/down) by June 18th. The S&amp;P 500 could potentially trade as high as 4,367.95 and as low as 3,975.48 by June 18th. The VIX is expected to move 6.81%(points), the VIX is currently 17.96. The VIX price range is 19.18 to 16.81. The Skew Index is elevated, which indicates market participants are paying up for catastrophic protection (2 sigma event). Stocks continue to offer investors the highest real returns. The nominal yield on equities is 4.3%, while the nominal yield on 10yr Treasury is 1.58%. Real yields on all tenors of government bonds at the shorter end and belly of the curve are decisively negative, but real yields at longer tenors above 30 years remain slightly in positive territory. Real yields on US Equities remain strongly positive.\*\*Disclaimer with Realized Volatility near 12 there is a larger risk of systematic highly leveraged short vol strategies like Equity Vol Targeting, Trend Following, and Risk Parity positioned for a massive increase in market exposure. The potential for a MUCH larger MOVE HIGHER has increased, while a large sell-off has decreased. We are much more likely to see a fall in realized and implied volatility and a gradual melt-up in asset prices.  The May/June VIX contracts at 20 &amp; 22 are fairly priced. In fact, they may now be overpriced given the new economic outlook.

Passage of fiscal stimulus should juice the start of a new long-term economic cycle, which favors a continued fall in realized volatility. - I am temporarily moving against a large rise in implied or realized volatility, However, I have been wrong before, but sell-offs will give investors great opportunities to buy the dip. Traders should focus on cyclical sectors, which tend to outperform at the start of new economic cycles. For example being long Financial, Industrials, Metals, Mining, Oil/Gas, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology

I've recently deposited funds into Curve on the matic network.   Can anyone tell me where I can see the interest I'm earning?   I saw the rate that was advertised when I was depositing, but now I have no clue where I can see the yield that I'm earning.

Also, when depositing, there was an option to deposit and an option to deposit &amp; stake in gauge.  Can anyone tell me what the difference is and what gauge is?  

Also, one more question.  I deposited USDC. I see that you can also deposit aUSDC that you would get from lending on Aave.   Should I be depositing aUSDC instead of USDC?  If I deposit aUSDC tokens that I got from Aave, will earn interest on both Aave and Curve?

Thanks in advance!"

&lt;hr/&gt;

This post goes out to u/KookyNews15, a new friend of mine and newer addition to my block list, who took time out of their busy day this weekend to reach out and help give me perspective on a lot of things in the form of blatant assholery in my PMs

my posts and analysis on here have not been accessible to the chad-level gods among men that are able to sit through the Fibonacci Wave post's wall of text, like this individual, I apparently need to appeal to their best interests, specifically, by teaching an entire genre of Statistics that my post is using.

And they were concerned about me that I have gone astray and are only looking out for my best interest. Especially my career in finance if I cannot continue to interact with someone being a dick to me so I may teach them as they keep putting me down, all while &lt;strong&gt;OFF the clock&lt;/strong&gt; and interacting on a social media platform.

Taking the absolute wrong approach to tell me these things aside, reading between the lines, they made good points that I want to shore up, they are great and in need of a hug, my intent in this post is to do just that, from square one, for people at any skill level who don't mind doing a bit of math.

 

# Average
an average is one way to capture an understanding of the middle of a set of data, this is done by taking the sum, a fancy name for adding, of each number in the set of data and dividing by the length, so for a set of data `1,1,2,3,3,3,4,5,5` the average is `(1+1+2+3+3+3+4+5+5)/9 = 27/9 = 3`

Moreover If I say there are 2 1's, 3 3s, and 2 5's, instead of doing `1+1`, `3+3+3` and `5+5`, I can instead use the frequency that the numbers appear in my data, making this instead `( 1*2 + 2*1 + 3*3 + 4*1 + 5*2 ) / 9` or even better if I know what part of a whole a certain number is, I can weight the numbers respectively. 1 is 2/9ths, 3: 1/3rd, etc.

Generally this is written

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Csum_i%20x_i*%5Ctextup%7Bfreq%7D%28x_i%29)

beyond this, we can look at the average of the data set after applying a function `f(x)` to the data as

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Csum_i%20f%28x_i%29*%5Ctextup%7Bfreq%7D%28x_i%29)

the frequency of x_i is not any different so as long as we know the frequency going into the problem, we don't have to apply the function and re figure-out the frequency after applying the function

One further step you can take averages on continuous ranges as well, instead of talking of discrete frequencies, instead talking of densities at a value

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Cint%20f%28x%29*%5Ctextup%7Bdensity%7D%28x%29%20dx)

No I'm not going to teach you calculus, just believe me that the pattern abstracts to the infinite sum that is at the backbone of integration, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
# Probability
Probability is the study of likelihood of occurrence it comes in Discrete and Continuous and work great as frequencies and densities respectively, because the sum of all probabilities must be 1 (something must happen).

## The Normal Distribution
this is ""The Bell Curve"", it's perfectly symmetrical about it's center, and has 2 parameters that feed into it, the average value defining the center point and a spread factor defining how ""pointy"" or ""smooth""

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Normal_Distribution_PDF.svg/220px-Normal_Distribution_PDF.svg.png)

## Composite Distributions
It is possible for a number to come from a combination of different distributions if half of the time I use a coin flip ( for this example Heads = 1, Tails = 2) and half of the time I rolled a 6 sided dice to tell you a number, the likelihood my number is a 1 or a 2 would be artificially higher than 3-6 compared to using the D6

You can do any math that you want to combine distributions that would lead to valid results

For my analysis I am looking at the sum of Normal distributions. For example, I examine what if 89% of the time the price of an asset was coming from a normal distribution with average 270 and spread of 50 and the remaining 11% of the time it came with average 300 and shape 15, the density curve would look like the green line below, with the blue and orange lines being the 2 curves that comprise the final total (reflected over the X axis for visual clarity)

#Option Prices
when an option is exercised, it will give a certain amount of money, that we can know, ahead of time as revenue for a given asset price.

## Calls
a call is a contract to optionally buy 100 units of an asset at or before a certain time for a certain price, called a strike price.

it would never make sense to exercise when the asset price is less than the strike price, as you would be paying over market value, but if you exercise when it is above the strike price you pay the strike price. if you are a paper-handed bitch and immediately sold those things that you bought to market (or just generally as a means to evaluate how well your option has performed, you perform a calculation as if you had done that), you would pay the strike price and receive the market price

so for asset price x, and strike price k, so the revenue from the option is `0` if x&lt;k because the exercise does not happen, then if x&gt;k you pay out k and receive x so that's `x-k`,

this can be modeled exactly as `Revenue(x,k) = min(0,x-k)`
## Puts
a put is a contract to optionally sell 100 units of an asset at or before a certain time for a certain price.

Similar to above but reversed, it would never make sense to exercise the option when the asset price is above the strike, because you could sell to market better, but if the asset price is less than the strike price, you sell at the strike price. If you do not already have 100 shares to sell- you would have to buy them at market price first, then sell for revenue.

so for asset price x, and strike price k, the revenue from the option is `k-x` if x&lt;k because you pay out $x to buy the asset and receive $k from selling the asset to the other guy, and `0` if x&gt;k as you would not exercise.

this is similarly modeled as `Revenue(x,k) = min(0,k-x)`

## Pricing
Market Makers sell both ends of an option contract, so it is important that the option be well priced so that people are willing to take both ends of the bargain. As such, options are originally priced according to a commonly adopted model called the [Black Scholes Model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp)  by Fischer Black, Robert Merton, and Myron Scholes in the 70's

Assuming the Price of an Asset is LogNormally distributed (as well as other assumptions) the asset can be priced accordingly.
# What I am doing
I am using the pricing model behind Black Scholes and applying the same logic to the current prices of options to derive some understanding of future prices that the asset may be at.

&gt; Let me be 100% clear, this is *not* good math in the slightest, I am purposefully plugging things in backwards and seeing what I get this is used to get prices from movement assumptions, and I am getting movement assumptions from prices. 
&gt;
&gt;Scientific method used below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/kbQf2yW.jpg)

## right but how?
Under Distribution i , the average, expected, revenue generated by an option is

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Cint%5B%5Ctextup%7BRevenue%7D%28x%2Ck%29*%5Ctextup%7BPr%7D_i%28x%29%5D%5Cdelta%20x)

So the expected revenue generated by an option under all distributions weighted is:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Csum_i%5Cleft%28%5Cint%5B%5Ctextup%7BRevenue%7D%28x%2Ck%29*%5Ctextup%7BPr%7D_i%28x%29%5D%5Cdelta%20x*w_i%20%5Cright%20%29)

and that would be the price of the option under efficient market conditions.

## how well did we do?
well to calculate the error, I elected to:

* subtract the current mark price of the option from this calculated estimate
* square the quantity to make it positive
* give a little more importance to options with a lot of open interest (the options in the middle rather than those with very low likelihood of payouts that are very low priced and could throw off the error calculation)
   * I multiplied by a function of open interest
* sum all those errors together across the option chain we are looking at
* since the function of open interest does not have a sum of 1, to get the number to be mildly human understandable, I divide by the sum of that importance that I gave each value and take the square root

in the end for all calls `k` with markPrice, strikePrice and openInterest, for each distribution in the composite created `i` with average and spread, throwing everything at the wall (including the actual density function for normal distributions), the final error function is

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B50%7D%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Chuge%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Csum_k%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%28mark%5C_price_k-%5Csum_i%5Cleft%28%5Cint%5Cleft%5B%5Cmin%7B%28x-strike_k%2C0%29%7D*%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%5Cpi%5Csigma_i%5E2%7D%7D*e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B%28%5Cmu_i-x%29%5E2%7D%7B2%5Csigma_i%5E2%7D%7D%5Cright%5D%5Cdelta%20x*weight_i%20%5Cright%20%29%5Cright%29%5E2*%5Cln%28open%5C_interest_k%29%20%5Cright%29%5Cdiv%5Csum_k%28%5Cln%28open%5C_interest_k%29%29%7D)

Throw the problem at a minimizer to minimize that error function by playing around with the weighting, average and spread inputs for the distributions in the composite.

# Reporting
When giving out results of the minimization, I include:

* The final value of that error function as well as error on N+1 distributions as validation I am not keeping anything better back from you all
* the values for the weight, average and spread for all distributions used so those with the ability can:
    1) validate my results and call me out if I am lying
    1) move forward and develop trading strategies that take advantage of price expectations
* 90% Confidence Interval: \[assuming the distribution is correct\] 5% chance of price below 1st number, 5% chance price will be above 2nd
* the Cumulative density Plot F(x) = Pr\[N(m,s)&lt;x\] with both 5 and 95% marked
* For each option in the chain, the mark price less its expected price according to the total distribution plotted against strike prices
   1) Higher is better to buy, lower is better to sell (if you're cool shorting options)

My first week in the CrytoUniverse, so bare with me with the terminology. 

I'm stuck just trying to buy into NFTArt Finance. I've scoured the subs and watched some videos. 

So I've got my Trust Wallet set up and lots of the videos are saying to set up a Binance account and then purchase/swap through pancakeswap. The thing is Binance doesn't allow Canadian CAD to be used. I'm sure there is some kind of work around, but it's a pretty steep learning curve I'm contending with lol. Help please and thanks!"
Alpaca Finance ETH Deposit Vault and Leveraged Farming Pools + Interest Rate Adjustment,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/mzdfo1/alpaca_finance_eth_deposit_vault_and_leveraged/,AlpacaFinance,1,2021-04-27 09:32:34,2,/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/mzdfo1/alpaca_finance_eth_deposit_vault_and_leveraged/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

Dear Alpacas,

Rain or shine, we senior Alpacas will keep on delivering new product features for the herd. So today, we’re excited to announce that we’ll be adding something to our platform, an all-new — ETH deposit vault!

We know that in crypto, many people like holding ETH for the long term. Now, they’ll have an opportunity to do so, while gaining high yields!

Along with this, we’ll also open three new leveraged yield farming pools on ETH pairs:

* BETH-ETH (4x)
* COMP-ETH (3x)
* SUSHI-ETH (3x)

💲Benefits to ETH depositors:

* As ETH depositors, you’ll earn interest from borrowed ETH. The lending interest will vary between **0% — 150% APR(equaling 0% — 348% APY compounded continuously),** based on the pool’s utilization level. Most of the time though, we expect the borrowing rate to be stable around 20% APR. You can learn more about our interest rate model [here](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/our-protocol-1/global-parameters).
* You‘ll also be able to receive ALPACA rewards by staking ibETH(which you’ll get after depositing ETH) on the [Stake page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake). We’ll be allocating 100 reward points (\~ 1.7 ALPACA/block based on current emission rate) to ibETH stakers.

🕐Release Timeline

* ETH deposit vault &amp; ibETH staking: **Thursday, April 8th, 2021 at 8 AM GMT.** You’ll be able to start depositing your ETH on our [Lend Page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/lend) and stake your ibETH (which you’ll get after depositing ETH) for ALPACA rewards on [Stake Page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake)
* Leveraged farming pools: **Friday, April 9th, 2021 at 8 AM GMT.** You’ll be able to start opening leveraged positions on ETH pairs on our [Farm page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm).

🎁Rewards Allocations

* **ibETH stakers: 100 reward points** (\~ 1.82ALPACA/block based on current emission rate)
* **LYF positions on ETH pairs: 100 reward points.** The amount of ALPACA you receive will be based on your debt size. (\~ 1.82ALPACA/block based on current emission rate)

📈Interest Rate Model Adjustment

Since we launched leveraged yield farming two weeks ago, there’s been a massive demand for it, evidenced by the frequently high utilization rate on both the BNB and BUSD deposit vaults. During discussions in the barn, we Senior alpacas have analyzed how this has affected the system.

We’ve realized that while keeping these lending pools at high utilization is good for capital efficiency, their utilization rates have overshot to 95%+ more often than ideal, causing borrowing rates to become too high at times. Although these utilization spikes don’t last long, the change in APYs sometimes frightens some of the younger Alpacas…

Like shadows in the shape of llamas…

In addition, since leveraged yield farming is more effective as a long-term strategy, maintaining stable and predictable lending rates is important for all participants. As such, we’ll be making an adjustment to the borrowing interest rate model to improve the system’s efficiency.

**We’ll be raising the borrowing interest rate on slope-2 from a flat 10% to a flat 20%** (Slope 2 is the interest rate for 50–90% utilization). While at first glance, this may seem like a negative for yield farmers, we believe that after implementation, this will prove to be a positive for everyone involved, including farmers, for the following reasons:

* By raising the borrowing rate on slope-2, it will make the borrowing rate on slope-3 more prohibitive, which is the essential function of the steep curve on slope-3, to act as a counter-force pushing utilization down. This is best for everyone because long-term high utilization is inefficient. When utilization stays above 95% for a long time, although the lending APY increases, it also makes it difficult for lenders to withdraw, decreasing the appeal of lending in general, leading to fewer people willing to lend in the future. Fewer lenders -&gt; a smaller lending pool -&gt; higher utilization -&gt; higher borrowing rates for farmers. This is a negative cycle, which as you can see, is no good for anyone. Thus, by raising the interest rate on slope-2, utilization will stay away from the steeper slope-3, spending more time on slope-2, leading to a more stable borrowing rate where everyone can make money.
* By raising the borrowing rate at typical utilization, we expect to attract more capital, increasing the lending pool size, which will also result in lower utilization and thus lower borrowing rates; a positive cycle.
* With a larger capital pool, we’ll likely see less volatility in utilization rate fluctuations due to individual lenders having a smaller percentage of the pool when withdrawing.
* With higher and more predictable yields, lenders would be more willing to deploy capital in our vaults for longer periods of time rather than jumping back and forth, increasing the stability of the lending rate for everyone.
* This rate is more in line with the lending rates of competing protocols. Right now, many of our farming APYs are far ahead of competitors, but with such a large gap, there are diminishing returns. By adjusting the lending rate to optimize for overall protocol efficiency, it will lead to Alpaca Finance being more competitive as a whole, improving the value of the protocol and its representative token. Then, since everyone receives ALPACA rewards, a higher price of ALPACA -&gt; higher APYs for everyone.

Thus, we believe this adjustment will be beneficial for the entire ecosystem, leading to greater long-term profits for everybody. No matter how you participate, you’ll be able to lend or farm in peace, knowing your APYs are more stable. In addition, we’ll continue to monitor the dynamics of this change and keep improving the parameters one step at a time, seeking optimal efficiency and balance.

This change will go into effect on **Friday, April 9th, 2021 at Midnight GMT.**

The chart below illustrates our updated interest rate model.

[ 🌞A Bright Future](https://preview.redd.it/xua0pt78dmv61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67ed2591bc172bebb5c67ffa3cfb0d494878c5bd)

So, you can look forward to all these updates this week. We’re especially excited about the BETH-ETH pool because we believe it’ll likely bring many new participants into our protocol:

* New lenders, that want to simply hold ETH and gain high APYs doing so.
* New leveraged farmers, that want ETH exposure, without having to worry about IL. In fact, there are very few farming pools where one can do this. After all, ETH and the typical tokens it’s paired with are volatile. However, the BETH-ETH pair is similar to the stable-stable pairs in that it possesses the like-kind property, due to BETH being pegged to ETH. That means that with a high degree of certainty, you can expect their prices to move together! In addition, BETH is not a new speculative pegged-token. It’s a token backed by Binance that has seen a large amount of adoption, having maintained a relatively high correlation to ETH historically. Hence, you can farm this pool without having to be overly concerned about volatility!

Well, we hope you enjoyed this newsflash. Yet, these are only a few of the updates we plan to release soon. At the moment, we’re working on additional features, UX improvements, new pools, and much more! So don’t forget to regularly check our socials!"
The Exorcism of Adolf Hitler [Part 1] The Angel,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/mzg47g/the_exorcism_of_adolf_hitler_part_1_the_angel/,the_brabazon,1,2021-04-27 12:08:07,1,/r/scarystories/comments/mzg47g/the_exorcism_of_adolf_hitler_part_1_the_angel/,NaN,"I am one of over ninety thousand centenarians living in the United States in the year 2021 and I have a terrible secret. I never imagined living to the age of one hundred when I was a girl. It’s an awfully long time to hold onto a secret, especially one like this. I don’t know how much longer I have left, but I don’t want to spend it carrying this burden alone. I have a responsibility to share it, a promise I have neglected for far too long. If I am to be believed, then I hope the world will view history in a different light. But this requires the context of a story and knowledge of the brave people involved.

I escaped from Europe in the bellies of freight trains and in steerage on a dilapidated ocean liner at the dawn of the Second World War. I evacuated to America with forged documents and under an alias that remains my legal name to this day. But that name does not matter here. My real name is Bruna Stengel and I was born in Berlin in 1920.

My father was a Nazi. Most of our parents were in those days and it never struck us as unusual. He found National Socialism after my mother died when I was still a baby. It may be more correct to say it found him because that is what the Nazi Party’s founders did in the early days. They preyed on those who had lost everything and needed answers but sold them lies instead. As the 1930s came and wore on, my father demonstrated his ability to organize and control and was rewarded with rank, power, and a view behind the curtain. It was this view that allowed him to see how things inside The Third Reich were more sinister than the German people realized. He saw something terrifying the rest of Hitler’s inner circle could not and he knew he alone had a chance to alter Germany’s dangerous course.

My story starts on a picturesque afternoon in the spring of 1934 because this day was the last time I saw the angel. I was fourteen years old and a proud member of the *Bund Deutscher Madel*—the League of German Girls. The Hitler Youth was for molding boys into obedient fighting men. Fighting was not something party leaders thought girls could do. Our youth wing was the League and in it we went camping, learned songs, dance, gymnastics, and how to be homemakers. We aspired to one day earn the Mother's Cross. A bronze one was issued to a woman who birthed five children, six earned her a cross made of silver, and eight earned her gold. We were growing our race and doing so married to a handsome SS officer was considered the highest ideal. We were not individuals, we were instruments, each and every one of us alike. It was indoctrination, though we were not wise to it then.

I squinted in the afternoon sunlight through the lenses of a gas mask on that spring day in Berlin Central Park. The two-dozen teenaged League girls around me wore gas masks too. They were a strange accessory atop our black leotards, but they had a purpose. Our bodies swayed in unison as we performed a synchronized dance we had practiced for weeks. Our troupe leader, a brutish, middle-aged woman whose name I don’t recall, monitored us as we split into two lines. She did not wear a gas mask.

I snuck a look to the side to gauge my distance from the girl nearest to me. I knew the routine but seeing through the mask was difficult. I hoped my troupe leader hadn’t noticed. I was doing well. I was less coordinated than the other girls, still a few years away from growing into my frame, and it reflected in my level of confidence. I was quieter and less sure of myself than they were. But I had practiced so diligently, taking extra time on my own, that I knew I had mastered the routine. Even the motion picture director filming us for propaganda reels hadn’t unnerved me.

But then I saw my angel. It appeared on a low, distant hill across the park. I had seen the angel many times before. Sometimes it appeared in a moment of need. I would find it when I grieved over seeing my father so little or having never known my mother at all. Other times it came as a blatant distraction as if it wanted to remind me that it served an agenda other than my own. I never saw it in full or up close. I'd see a face in a window, a silhouette in the fog, or hear the flap of a wing in the dark of night, but never all together. I had the strange distinction of being intimately familiar with it, yet I had no idea what it looked like. This time would be different. I knew I could see it clearly if only I took off that gas mask.

I went still and broke from the routine. The other girls continued, uncertain how to react when one of us deviated. Then I pulled off my mask. At a distance, the angel looked luminous, yet it was already fading. I saw only a nondescript human figure. Then something unfolded from its back. It was rare that I got to see the angel's wings.

“Bruna, you have wasted our director’s take. Is something wrong?” My troupe leader blocked my view of the angel.

“Do you see that?” I asked, pointing to the angel.

She looked but didn’t react. “Why did you take off your gas mask?” She must not have seen it.

I was now embarrassed, regretting my decision. “Please I—I’m sorry. I thought I saw something.”

“This isn’t helpful. You know why we wear our masks don’t you?” She waited, her exacting eyes piercing mine. I thought she looked nothing like the pure, natural women we were told to be. The other girls giggled at me under their gas masks.

Another girl replied, shouting through her mask. “To make powerful images for the Führer’s films!”

My troupe leader nodded. “Correct. But why cover our faces? Bruna this time.”

“To create a feeling of oneness…” I knew it was the correct response. Looking down at my gas mask, I wished to never see my angel again. I was getting older. The pressure to conform was too great and telling others I had an angel didn’t help. Plus, I had new thoughts and goals now. It was time that I drew strength from the system instead. I put the gas mask back on.

“Very good. Now start again.” Her demeanor changed completely. We resumed. This time I blended in. I no longer felt alone. It felt like my League troupe moved through me. We did two more takes until the director was satisfied.

I saw an entourage approaching from across the park. They all wore the same gray or brown suits with thick, red bands around their left arms my father always wore. The director and troupe leader turned around and held their hands high in their stiffest Nazi salutes.

In the center of the group stood Adolf Hitler. The Chancellor. *The Führer.* I couldn’t believe it. I had never seen him up close before. I knew other party ministers' children who had met him, but my father had never given me the privilege. He was average height and slight of build, but he carried himself with the presence of an Olympic strong man or film star. He was young for a head of state then, only forty-four, and every woman in Germany knew well he was still a bachelor.

Of all the girls in my troupe, he walked up to me. I was so awestruck I forgot to remove my gas mask. Hitler did it for me, lifting the mask to expose my young face.

“What pretty, young girls sprout from our German soil.” His voice was gruff but calm, different than how I had heard it on radio and film reels. His eyes were hypnotic. I tingled as I looked into them. Then he moved on from me. “Off with your masks. Let me see you!”

The other girls tossed their gas masks aside and swarmed him, pushing me to the outside. They fawned and swooned over him. He was everything we were supposed to admire. It seems impossible to understand the emotions Hitler stirred in us. We were more innocent and naïve in those days and never had access to information of our own the way later generations would. All that we knew came from the party, packaged and delivered by radio stations and newspapers under the party’s thumb. The Hitler they told us about was one of their products like any other.

Photographers from Hitler’s entourage staged us around him. The same type of picture I had grown to admire in the newspapers was now being created in front of me. Now it was our turn to be by his side and we would be the ones others admired and envied. “If only I could get closer,” I thought, craning my neck from the outside, hoping to make it into the frame.

“Wait! Her. Yes, her! Put her in front.” I realized it was me the photographer was referring to. Before I could react, a set of hands grabbed my arms and moved me in front of the girls who had laughed at me only moments ago. I looked up and the Führer glanced down, placing a firm hand on my shoulder. He looked back to the camera, but I could not look away from him. “Face here!” The photographer’s words startled me again. I followed his voice to the camera and smiled.

It would be four more years before I saw the Führer or the angel again. I was eighteen and a fresh graduate of the League of German Girls. I was a young woman now and a graceful dancer and gymnast. I had finally grown into my body and I could see the men around me starting to notice. “I’m the only daughter of Interior Minister Stengel,” I told myself. “The party and society will want to open doors for me.” But in secret, I was directionless. I wanted to lead and make a difference, not for the sake of power, but to set an example and be more than just the recipient of some bronze cross.

There were a few women in high positions. I thought of Magda Goebbels or Lina Heydrich, but they were wives of powerful men. I thought I could settle for that, yet I also thought of Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the highest-ranking woman in Germany, and Leni Riefenstahl, the filmmaker. Yes, those were the women I wanted to be like. But while the SS officers, *Luftwaffe* pilots, and other aspirational young men noticed me, they also left me alone and I didn’t know why. Maybe my wandering mind was the problem. I decided I would do best to find my answers within the party.

I found myself at this crossroads one gray afternoon in March of 1938, looking out at Germany’s Black Forest from a third-floor window in Falkenhayn Castle. It was a sad sort of castle, only four stories tall, built of brick, with squat proportions and mundane roof spires. It would be dwarfed by the great architect Speer’s new Reich Chancellery back in Berlin, I thought.

I didn’t know why my father had sent me here two days before to be watched over by the old woman who was the castle’s caretaker and only other occupant. Her name was Eloise and that was all she allowed me to know. The only thing I could think of was that Falkenhayn Castle might have been selected as a remote site for a secret meeting among party leaders. Perhaps now I would get my formal introduction to the inner circle. But if it were so secret, why would I, a fresh League of German Girls graduate, be permitted? I had spent the last two days trying to figure it out. Eloise told me nothing, but I was convinced she knew.

I watched for headlights and listened for the sound of the car carrying my father. He told me he would explain everything once he arrived. I did not have to wait long. I caught a flicker of yellow light through the trees. Then a gray sedan drove off the dirt road into the clearing surrounding the castle. It was a rough sort of car used by soldiers of the German Army, the *Wehrmacht,* not a black Mercedes-Benz officials like my father rode in. But my father it was, given away by the dark brown homburg hat he always wore. He leaped out of the driver’s seat and ran around to the other side. I moved to another window to watch as he pulled a man out from the passenger door and lowered him to the ground. I could see blood on the man’s clothing and there were bullet holes in the car door. My anticipation dissipated, replaced by a plaguing concern that wrenched my stomach and would not leave me for days. What had my father gotten involved in?

My father crouched over the bleeding man, though I couldn’t see what he was doing. My father stood up, but the man remained on the ground. I waited for him to sit up, for my father to lend him his hand and pull him to his feet, but it never came. I stopped breathing when I realized the man was dead. I had never seen a dead person before.

I watched my father open the trunk. He dragged another man out through the opening and dumped him on the damp ground. This man was handcuffed and his head was bound and covered in a burlap sack. I could only imagine he was some kind of political prisoner. But then why would my father be transporting him? A pair of dogs started barking two floors below, snapping me out of my bewildered trance and reminding me to breathe. I followed their sound downstairs.

Diamond and Prinz, two large Rottweilers Eloise said belonged to an associate of my father, pawed at the heavy double doors in the castle entryway. They had been my companions over the past two days and they were glad for the attention as Eloise did little besides pour their food twice a day. But now my two new friends were snarling and leaving scratch marks on the doors. I reached between them and unbolted the lock. They forced the doors open and ran out to the clearing.

The dogs continued to bark at my father and his prisoner. “Diamond, Prinz, stop!” I tried to quiet them as I approached, but there was no stopping their protective instincts. “Father, what’s going on?”

My father, Werner Stengel, Reich Minister of the Interior, looked up from the prisoner with an expression that told me he had all but forgotten I was there. “Stay back, Bruna!” He had to shout to make himself heard over the dogs’ incessant barking. He was forty-five, with hair starting to thin and these grave, contemplative eyes that suggested a lifetime of tough decisions constantly weighing on him. Blood stained the sleeve of his brown suit jacket, matching his red swastika armband.

“Are you alright?” I asked, noticing the stain.

“The blood isn’t mine, it’s Eugen’s,” he lamented, eying the man lying dead on the ground.

Another gray sedan emerged from the forest and slowed to a stop beside us. A young man dressed in the all-black uniform of a SS officer stepped out. We made instant and lingering eye contact. He was certainly handsome, probably twenty-five or twenty-six, and wore the rank of *Obersturmführer.* This was a man on the rise yet not high-up enough to have much to lose, I thought. I had met other young officers of his mold. I thought they were arrogant, but something always drew me to them. His badge displayed the name, ‘Dahlgren.’ We both realized we were staring and looked away. The dogs gave us a reprieve, bounding up to him, their barks turning excited and playful.

“Guys, down! Down! Shhhhhh. I know, I’m happy to see you too.”

My father spoke up. “Dahlgren, were you shot?”

“No. Were you?”

“No, but Eugen was. One caught him back at the Berghof.”

Dahlgren eyed Eugen’s body. His mood sank. “Then what are we going to do?”

My father tried hard to project a sense of steely calm. “We proceed.”

Dahlgren seemed almost annoyed. “You said we needed him.”

“I’ll figure it out… Where did we lose Klaus?”

“I lost sight of his car a few kilometers outside Obersalzberg.”

I had no idea what they were talking about. I took it all in, afraid to wade into the matter. We all heard a kicking sound coming from the trunk of Dahlgren’s car. He opened the lid and pulled out a second prisoner, fatter than the first, also handcuffed and covered by a burlap sack.

Dahlgren’s eyes met mine again. “Is this your daughter?”

“Indeed, she is. And I recall telling her to remain in the castle—"" my father cut himself off. The first prisoner had climbed to his feet and stood defiantly at my father's ear as if goading him. My father lurched and side-stepped in startlement. Diamond and Prinz barked, spittle flying off their gums. Whoever this prisoner was, something about him provoked the dogs’ ire. It worried me.

“Father, please, what’s going on?”

The first prisoner straightened up at the sound of my voice. His head swiveled toward me. The dogs went silent. My confusion gave way to a sense of unease. “Why do the dogs fear him?” I wondered. “Should I?”

I suddenly felt a twinge of what may have upset them. My ears rang and I was overcome with nausea. My skin grew ice cold. I felt like I had fallen, struck my head, and come down with food poisoning and fever chills all at once. My father winced. I was sure he felt it too, though he seemed to be hiding it. Dahlgren didn’t seem to notice anything at all.

Then as suddenly as it came on, the sensation passed. I wondered if I had imagined it.

“Get them inside right now.” My father took a relieved breath after the thin prisoner slackened. He grabbed the prisoner’s handcuffs from behind, then he and Dahlgren pushed both prisoners toward the castle with the dogs at their heels.

I was left alone with the corpse on the ground, the one they called Eugen. I wondered why he had been shot and what it meant that my father had been shot at too. Desperate for answers, I followed them inside.

My father locked the castle’s double doors once I slipped through. “Dahlgren, take Ballin downstairs.”

Dahlgren pulled the fat prisoner down a stairwell to what I knew was a basement prison. I had explored every corner of the castle over the past two days and discovered the basement contained a row of wrought-iron jail cells.

The name my father mentioned rang a bell. ""Reich Minister of Finance Albert Ballin?” In the League, we learned the names of all the Nazi leadership.

My father responded with a nod, but a reluctant one, as if this was a conversation he dreaded. “Come with me.”

He pulled the thin prisoner backward up the spiral stairwell. I followed him up through the second and third floors and into a single round turret above the roof, the castle's highest point. My next thought was that this was a SS operation, perhaps a prisoner interrogation, a possibility my father denied. I was confused and frustrated. Had Albert Ballin, a longtime confidante of Hitler, betrayed him? And why was my father being so vague with all his answers?

The turret chamber was circular and split in half by a brick wall with a thick steel door at its center. At the middle of the door was a one-foot-square opening with a set of bars. This cell looked far more secure than those in the basement.

My father held the prisoner in place by the handcuffs and shot me a grave look. “I don’t expect you to understand this at first. I only ask that you trust me. The rest will be clear soon. Now stand back.”

At eighteen, I was not one to accept my father's word on blind faith, but at this moment I was too nervous to do anything else. I stepped back to the wall. My father opened the steel door with a brass key and walked the prisoner inside. He jammed his boot into the back of the prisoner's leg to bring him to his knees, then removed the burlap sack. I caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man from behind. Even with what little I saw, there was no doubt who it was. There was no mistaking him, but I still couldn’t believe it. My father backed out of the cell, shut the steel door, and locked it with the brass key.

I stammered. “Is it—? It’s not—""

My father’s words resonated. “It is.”

I approached the cell. A face appeared in the opening behind the bars, one well-known to the whole world. The implication of seeing him here and now made me feel ill. I looked into the blazing eyes of the Führer, Adolf Hitler. A piece of tape covered his mouth. I reached for it instinctively.

“No, don’t!” my father shouted. It was too late.

I pulled off the tape and Hitler spoke. “Stengel, why have you deprived us of your lovely daughter for so long?”

It all came fluttering back to me. I felt as if I was fourteen years old at Berlin Central Park again. The emotions he stirred in me then had never left.

My father stepped in. “Bruna, get out. Don’t let him talk to you.”

“Your father’s a religious maniac!” Hitler shouted back. “He thinks I’m possessed by a demon!”

“What?” I could hardly comprehend everything that was happening. I protested as my father darted in and pulled me away. “Wait, stop! What have you done?”

Hitler continued. “Listen to me, fräulein, he’s a traitor to me, to you, and to all of Germany.”

My father pulled me to the stairwell. “Don’t believe anything he says to you.”

“You put her in danger, Stengel! Do you even care for her?”

My father slammed the wooden door to the turret chamber, muffling Hitler’s voice. He saw I was shaking and guided me down to the third floor.

I pleaded with him. “Please tell me it isn’t true.”

“I’m afraid it is.”

“But how can Hitler be possessed?”

“Eloise and I will explain everything shortly. There is going to be an exorcism.”

“But you’re not even a priest anymore.” I now doubted every word my father said. I heard each sentence as if it were that of a mad man.

“I know. I’ve made some terrible choices and I’m doing everything I can to atone for them now, but this is not one of them.”

“Why did you bring me here?”

“Berlin is no longer safe for you. The Nazis know only that I’ve disappeared along with him, but that still makes me a suspect. You're the first one they'd come for."" Whether he had gone mad or not, I could tell he believed every word he spoke.

“And they won’t find us here?”

“Dahlgren and I have planned for that. Albert Ballin will be the patsy.”

I was incredulous. I saw my dreams evaporating before me. “I just graduated! You said you’d help me be whatever I wanted to be. You said I could be the Reich’s first female minister!”

“Because if we succeed it will be a very different Reich. The Nazis aren’t what you think they are. He’s going to start a war.”

This seemed preposterous to me. Hitler’s policies had brought only pride and prosperity to us up to then. “A war? Why would you say that?”

“Look at the signs. His political opponents are in camps, Jews are losing their rights, he’s seizing sovereign territories, growing the army in violation of treaties. What do you think it means?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why do you insist on not thinking for yourself?”

I didn’t know what to say back. He saw how it wounded me and I knew I had disappointed him. I needed to be alone. I ran down the stairwell, almost bumping into Eloise and nearly spilling the tea kettle she was carrying. I paused halfway down to the next floor, curious to hear what my father and Eloise said to each other. They couldn't see me around the curve of the stairwell.

“You should have let me prepare her,” Eloise started.

“She’s too indoctrinated. I couldn’t take that risk.”

“So were you not too many years ago.”

“I was a grown man. I knew the world before this. Bruna is young. This is all she knows.”

""Without Father Eugen, you're going to need her. If you want her to understand, tonight is all the time you’ll have… Werner, sit, please. You’ve had an exhausting day. I brought your tea.”

I could hear the tea kettle clanging against the serving tray. I had previously noticed how Eloise’s hands often shook uncontrollably. She tried to hide it, but I caught it happening several times.

My father remarked on it as well. “And what about you? Has it gotten worse?”

The clanging stopped. She must have set down the kettle. “I could sense him getting nearer all afternoon and it got worse once you arrived with him. This demon is powerful, Werner, I can feel it.”

“Have you been able to prepare the materials?”

“Shame on you. I’m old, not useless. Now drink your tea before it gets any colder. I’m not making it again.”

Eloise and my father spoke like old friends, but he had never spoken of her to me. She was much older than him and said the kinds of things no one dared say to a party minister. I knew little about my father’s time as a priest in the years before I was born. That was a different life he had always kept separate from me. This strange woman must have been a part of it. I couldn't understand how they thought I was indoctrinated. I said the same things our party leaders, newspapers, industrialists, and teachers did. If they were all in agreement, who was my father to start questioning them? It seemed so obvious to me. Wouldn’t that make him wrong?

I built a project for DOGE,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/mzytct/i_built_a_project_for_doge/,mustturd,2,2021-04-28 05:14:43,7,/r/dogecoindev/comments/mzytct/i_built_a_project_for_doge/,NaN,"Hello my fellow doge devs,

I thought it's time to build some stuff for DOGE so I built [dogen.finance](https://dogen.finance) and this post is inviting the doge dev community to contribute to our goal of bringing DOGE to DeFi. 

With the recent boom in DeFi, total active users [just reaching over 2 million today](https://duneanalytics.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time), I couldn't help but notice our DOGE--and all doge-inspired tokens--is being left out! DOGE is not on Aaave, Compound, or Curve. That is starting to change as [Ren](https://renproject.io/) built renDOGE to bring DOGE to Ethereum, and Opendao built a [DOGE-renDOGE bridge](https://doge.opendao.io/) so you can send your DOGES onto Ethereum. But there, I noticed the DeFi opportunities were not really available. 

I built [dogen.finance](https://dogen.finance/) to solve that problem and bring DOGE to DeFi ([and DeFi to Doges - here's the explainer](https://dogenfinance.medium.com/dogen-finance-doge-to-defi-8808ae9556bc)) following in the footsteps of [Badger finance](https://badger.finance/) bringing Bitcoin to DeFi.

Dogen progresses through a series of easy-to-learn lessons on DeFi for beginners with a supportive community!

* Lesson 1 of DeFi for doges is how to yield farm using LP tokens with DOGE. [Here's the smol pupper's guide on Medium](https://dogenfinance.medium.com/dogen-finance-guide-for-smol-puppers-and-new-dogens-cfb83bb7d963)
* Lesson 2 is how to vote with Doge tokens for token-based governance of a Dogemocracy - decentralized autonomous organization on Snapshot. [Check out all the votes](https://snapshot.org/#/dogen.eth) on our Shapshot page over the past week!
* Lesson 3 will be about cross-chain yield farming, reaching DOGE on bsc and bridging it to Harmony and spreading the DOGE diaspora throughout DeFi on all chains!

I launched Dogen exactly 7 days ago on #DogeDay420. Today, more than $1M worth of doges have joined the dog parks, with 2 DOGE pools (renDOGE-ETH and renDOGE-DOGEN) and 21 other doge-like token pools like SHIBA, AKITA, HUSKY, and new and exciting doges like MUSKY. But even though Dogen is a home for all doges, it's one true love is DOGE and it's purpose is bringing DOGE to DeFi..and DeFi to doges!

AMA about [Dogen.finance](https://dogen.finance/), what it was like in the early Dogecoin community, yield farming with DOGE, the future of Dogecoin, what I are for breakfast, what my own smol pupper is like (her name is Buku), or whatever you'd like!

Thanks for taking the time to read about my project.

Viral Finance (VIRAL) is a yield farming project inspired from DeFi Protocols and drastically improved from a tokenomics point of view.
We have combined several attractive features:
-  Farming with LP tokens.
-  Use part of LP tokens to mine BTC in various locations in the world with cheap electricity (0.05$ per KWH) and buyback VIRAL with BTC (adding continuously buy pressure)

❗️What is our innovation here❗️

Here’s our innovation: Inflation and Block rewards and the model of buybacks.
We understood the importance of balance these protocols required. We loved BTC mining because it’s trustable and sustainable, And this function increasing buy pressure inherently. Better to say massively. 
All it needed is a functioning inflation.
Let’s call our inflation model, the Berhane model. For this, we need an equation capable of achieving a curve like a transitory regime in physics. For more information please read our Medium article.
3% of LP tokens will change to BTC mining Devices and start to mine BTC. Then with BTCs in the vault we will buy back VIRAL from Pancakeswap.

This is incredible opportunity for Seascape Network because Binance is already partner with them from the start! This will be huge this summer. 

Seascape introduced new game, Staking Saloon and developers just keep on giving on this network! **Play games to earn $CWS**, there is no better than that.

[https://bsc.seascape.network/index/product.html?skin=light](https://bsc.seascape.network/index/product.html?skin=light)

$CWS was found by the same redditor who told us about $Audius before it mooned! Now, after $Audius, we have $CWS, Seascape.

The Seascape Network is basically ultimate game platform designed around the DeFi &amp; NFT Economy

**KEY DETAILS:** CWS/USDT ([https://www.seascape.network/](https://www.seascape.network/))

**Market Cap:** $29m 

**Investors:** Binance, LD Capital, Paka, Spark Digital Capital, Nabais Capital, M6, DU Capital, JRR Capital.

**Partners:** Chainlink, Moonbeam, Opensea, Maker, Binance Smart Chain, Matic, Treasureland etc...

They are partners with Binance, so you can buy via Pancakeswap $pCWS. pCWS is the bridged version of CWS (the currency of Seascape on ETH) on BSC (Binance Smart Chain). Users can bridge from ETH to BSC using poly.network bridge. 1 CWS = 1 pCWS as they are completely interchangeable. Here's a walk-through of Polybridge: [https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1](https://medium.com/seascape-network/bridge-your-crowns-to-bsc-today-through-poly-network-eaabde846d1) 

Its still listed on Uniswap, Pancakeswap, [Gate.io](https://gate.io/) and Bitmax, but big exchanges are coming soon. Since its already partners with Binance, Binance exchange is probably closer than we think. 

Like Audius, this is a coin with a website that the GENERAL PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND with a product that can be used now, granted they only have a few games, they are developing their blockchain to make it very cost effective and scalable for much bigger game titles to use them as their **in-game coin economy** partner, even if they have better distribution than seascape now. Seascape is an **in-game economy technology partner first and foremost. They are doing the hard stuff, unlike Ultra, so that they later this year become the distribution partner of choice for DeFi game titles.** Ultra is just steam with tokens and they are already around $250m market cap right now, so you see, Seascape could blow them out of the water! 

**KEY FETURES:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Any game      released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own      blockchain with its own set of rules. 
* Decentralized      cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seemless price discovery of      digital assets for users and projects 
* User-facing      game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator.      Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs. 
* Implement      gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of      core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more!

[https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Introducing Uniswap V3

March 23rd, 2021

Uniswap v1 was launched in November 2018 as a proof of concept for automated market makers (AMMs), a type of exchange where anyone can pool assets into shared market making strategies.

In May 2020, Uniswap v2 introduced new features and optimizations, setting the stage for exponential growth in AMM adoption. Less than one year since its launch, v2 has facilitated over $135bn in trading volume, ranking as one of the largest cryptocurrency spot exchanges in the world.

Uniswap now serves as critical infrastructure for decentralized finance, empowering developers, traders, and liquidity providers to participate in a secure and robust financial marketplace.

Today, we are excited to present an overview of Uniswap v3. We are targeting an **L1 Ethereum mainnet launch on May 5**, with an **L2 deployment on Optimism set to follow shortly after.**

Uniswap v3 introduces:

* **Concentrated liquidity,** giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against
* **Multiple fee tiers** , allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk

These features make Uniswap v3 **the most flexible and efficient AMM ever designed**:

* LPs can provide liquidity with **up to 4000x capital efficiency** relative to Uniswap v2, earning **higher returns on their capital**
* Capital efficiency paves the way for low-slippage **trade execution that can surpass both centralized exchanges and stablecoin-focused AMMs**
* LPs can significantly **increase their exposure to preferred assets** and **reduce their downside risk**
* LPs can sell one asset for another by adding liquidity to a price range entirely above or below the market price, approximating **a fee-earning limit order that executes along a smooth curve**

Uniswap’s **oracles are now far easier and cheaper to integrate**. V3 oracles are capable of providing time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) on demand for any period within the last \~9 days. This removes the need for integrators to checkpoint historical values.

Even with these groundbreaking design improvements, the **gas cost of v3 swaps on Ethereum mainnet is slightly cheaper than v2**. Transactions made on the Optimism deployment will likely be *significantly* cheaper!

&amp;#x200B;

 

V2 LPs only earn fees on a small portion of their capital, which can fail to appropriately compensate for the price risk (”impermanent loss”) they take by holding large inventories in both tokens. Additionally, traders are often subject to high degrees of slippage as liquidity is spread thin across all price ranges.

In Uniswap v3, LP’s can **concentrate their capital within custom price ranges, providing greater amounts of liquidity at desired prices.** In doing so, **LPs construct individualized price curves** that reflect their own preferences.

*V3 LPs can concentrate their liquidity within custom price ranges.*

LPs can combine any number of distinct concentrated positions within a single pool. For example, an LP in the ETH/DAI pool may choose to allocate $100 to the price ranges $1,000-$2,000 and an additional $50 to the ranges $1,500-$1,750.

By doing so, an LP can approximate the shape of any automated market maker or active order book.

**Users trade against the combined liquidity of all individual curves** with no gas cost increase per liquidity provider. Trading fees collected at a given price range are split pro-rata by LPs proportional to the amount of liquidity they contributed to that range.

*LPs can combine multiple positions, which are then efficiently aggregated into a single order book.*

## Capital Efficiency

By concentrating their liquidity, LPs can provide **the same liquidity depth as v2 within specified price ranges while putting far less capital at risk.** The capital saved can be held externally, invested in different assets, deposited elsewhere in DeFi, or used to increase exposure within the specified price range to earn more trading fees.

&amp;#x200B;

## Active Liquidity

If market prices move outside an LP’s specified price range, their liquidity is effectively removed from the pool and is no longer earning fees. In this state, an LP’s liquidity is composed entirely of the less valuable of the two assets, until the market price moves back into their specified price range or they decide to update their range to account for current prices.

*LPs only earn fees when the market trades between their specified price range.*

In v3, it is theoretically possible for no liquidity to exist in a given price range. However, we expect rational LPs to continuously update their price ranges to cover the current market price.

## Range Orders

V3’s LP customizability opens up a novel order feature to complement market orders, which we are calling ’range orders’.

LPs can deposit a single token in a custom price range above or below the current price: if the market price enters into their specified range, they sell one asset for another along a smooth curve while earning swap fees in the process.

Range orders within wider ranges may prove particularly useful for **profit-taking, buying the dip,** and **primary issuance events**: in the later use case, issuers are now able to deposit liquidity in a single asset and specify the exact range of prices across which they wish to sell their tokens.

## Non-Fungible Liquidity

As a byproduct of per-LP custom price curves, liquidity positions are no longer fungible and are not represented as ERC20 tokens in the core protocol.

Instead, LP positions will be represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, common shared positions can be made fungible (ERC20) via peripheral contracts or through other partner protocols. Additionally, trading fees are no longer automatically reinvested back into the pool on LPs’ behalf.

Over time we expect increasingly sophisticated strategies to be tokenized, making it possible for LPs to participate while maintaining a passive user experience. This could include multi-positions, auto-rebalancing to concentrate around the market price, fee reinvestment, lending, and more.

# Flexible Fees

Uniswap v3 offers LPs three separate fee tiers per pair — 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1.00%. This array of options ensures that LPs tailor their margins according to expected pair volatility: LPs take on more risk in non-correlated pairs like ETH/DAI and, conversely, take on minimal risk in correlated pairs like USDC/DAI.

Uniswap v2 introduced a protocol fee switch, which allowed a flat 5 basis point (16.66% of LP fees) fee to be turned on by governance. Uniswap v3 protocol fees are far more flexible. Fees will be off by default, but can be turned on by governance on a per-pool basis and set between 10% and 25% of LP fees.

# Advanced Oracles

Uniswap v2 introduced time weighted average price (TWAP) oracles. These oracles serve as a critical piece of DeFi infrastructure, and have been integrated into dozens of projects, including Compound and Reflexer.

V2 oracles work by storing cumulative sums of Uniswap pair prices on a per-second basis. These price sums can be checked once at the beginning of a period and once at the end to calculate an accurate TWAP over that period.

Uniswap v3 offers significant improvements to the TWAP oracle, making it possible to calculate any recent TWAP within the past \~9 days in a single on-chain call. This is achieved by storing an array of cumulative sums instead of just one.

This array of historical price accumulators makes it far easier and cheaper to create more advanced oracles that include simple-moving averages (SMA), exponential moving averages (EMA), outlier filtering, and more.

Despite this major improvement, the gas cost to Uniswap traders for keeping oracles up to date has been reduced by \~50% relative to v2. The costs for calculating TWAPs in external smart contracts is significantly cheaper as well.

DeFi Explained: Yield farming,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n0yng2/defi_explained_yield_farming/,Fantastic-Cucumber-1,1,2021-04-29 14:47:42,131,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n0yng2/defi_explained_yield_farming/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"Yield farming is becoming increasingly popular among crypto investors. Ofcourse, this is not illogical: DeFi platforms offer much higher interest rates compared to traditional banks. To understand yield farming, you first need to know what interest-on-interest (or compound interest) is.

# Compound interest

When you are saving money at a bank, you receive an interest payment for this: the so-called savings interest. Depending on the chosen type of savings, the interest is paid into the savings account or another (checking) account. If the interest payment is added to the savings account, you also accrue interest over that interest amount. This is called the interest-on-interest effect (compound interest).

# Factors for success

The effect of compound interest depends on three factors:

* Time. How long do you leave the money? You can see in the graph that the effect increases as more time passes.
* The percentage of interest or return that you make. Nowadays you hardly get any interest on a savings account, this affects your return. As a result, the effect of interest-on-interest is limited. The higher your return, the greater the impact of what Einstein called the eighth wonder of the world.
* The starting amount. The larger your starting amount, the greater the effect. After all, that starting amount grows every year.

One of the richest investors on the planet, Warren Buffet, has been taking advantage of compound interest for years. He bought his first stock when he was 11 years old. He made above-average returns and stayed off his money for decades. You can imagine how big the effect of interest-on-interest is.

## Example:

Let’s say you want to deposit $20,000. There are 2 banks who both offer interest. One pays 4% per year and the other one pays 1% per quarter. Let’s put $10,000 in both banks and see what happens:

* Bank A: interest payment: 4% (per year)
* Bank B: interest payment: 1% (per quarter)

&amp;#x200B;

* Bank A: 4% of $10,000 = $400 in interest per year

&amp;#x200B;

* Bank B: 1% of $10,000 = $100 in the first quarter
* 1% of $10,100 = $101 in the second quarter
* 1% of $10,201 = $102.10 in the third quarter
* 1% of $10,303.10 = $103.03 in the fourth quarter

Bank B: total amount of interest on an annual basis: $406.13. The effective return of bank B is higher than bank A: 4.06 percent on an annual basis.

# Example of yield farming

Because yield farming is often combined with liquidity pools, I suggest that you read my post about liquidity pools first. You can do so by [clicking this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mfk2oi/defi_explained_liquidity_pools/). 

In my previous post about liquidity pools I provided a good example of yield farming with liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens):

*Like any other tokens, LP (liquidity providers) can stake their tokens from the liquidity pool during the period of the smart contract. A LP can therefore deposit this token on another platform that accepts the liquidity pool token to get additional yield to maximize returns. Therefore, the user can compound two or three interest rates using yield farming, and maximize returns.*

*An example of such a DeFi platform is harvest.finance. Harvest.finance allows the LP to stake their tokens and rewards them with additional rewards* ***on top*** *of their fees rewards from the liquidity pool. In harvest.finance’s case, they reward the user with FARM tokens.*

*So as an example: Let’s say you have deposited $100 in a USDC/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 50%. The received UNI LP tokens can then be staked at havest.finance for additional rewards, which in this case would be 70% FARM APY.* 

*You can see that, by staking your LP tokens, rewards can be highly lucrative. By utilizing these techniques, APY’s of over 200% can be achieved. Of course, you need to remember that the price of tokens such as FARM are quite volatile and thus there is a risk to turn your $70 in FARM into way less amount of $ in a matter of days.*

*If you are interested in yield farming, I would recommend to use DeFi dashboard zapper.fi, which gives a great overview of all current liquidity pools and farms.*

# Yield farming platforms in DeFi

## Harvest.finance

Harvest Finance is an automated revenue farming protocol developed for users who want to put their assets to work in high-yielding farming opportunities. Harvest will appeal most to those who cannot manage their decentralized financial positions (DeFi) 24/7 – which is most of us.

If you've ever spent time in DeFi, you already know that manually moving money between the different protocols takes time. Developing strategies and control positions takes time as well and gas fees on the Ethereum network are, at the time of writing, pretty high.

Harvest Finance tries to help by automatically searching for the latest DeFi platforms with the highest return. It then optimizes the yield with the latest farming techniques. In addition to your optimized return, you often receive extra interest in the form of harvest.finance’s own token: Farm.

Harvest works best for those looking for an easy way to harvest the proceeds from the latest projects in DeFi. Hence the name ""harvest"". To put money to work in these high yield farming opportunities, users only have to deposit supported tokens to get started.

## Sushi swap

As a liquidity provider you receive an extra fee on top of almost all liquidity pools on Sushiswap, in addition to transaction fees: a daily payout is Sushi tokens. SUSHI is Sushiswap's own token.

When you have earned some SUSHI, you can take your it to the SushiBar. Here you can convert your SUSHI into the xSUSHI token. With this token you will earn about 5% interest per year on your amount in SUSHI:

xSUSHI automatically earns fees (0.05% of all swaps, including multichain swaps) proportional to your share in the SushiBar.

You can earn even more by depositing your xSushi on lending platforms such as Aave, to receive a small interest on top of your other interest.

## Curve.fi

Curve.fi is a decentralized exchange that mainly focuses on exchanging stablecoins (dollar, euro or gold tokens).

Curve pays the liquidity providers from transaction fees made in their pool. This is approximately between 0-10% interest per year, depending on the liquidity pool.

Like Sushiswap, Curve pays interest on top of this transaction fee in its own token: CRV. These interest payments can be high (&gt; 30%!).

Curve also allows you to lock CRV coins into their safe for a set amount of time. Based on how long you lock your tokens and the amount of tokens you’re locking, you can expect even higher interest rates (up to 80%).

# Conclusion

Because of the interest-on-interest effect, you can let your savings grow faster, without depositing extra money into the account yourself. The higher the savings interest and / or the savings balance, the greater the effect. So, The longer you leave the money, the greater the yield. Thanks to DeFi (and its platforms of course), high interest rates are accessible for every crypto investor.

Middle Management Destroyed my outlook,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n0yo9i/middle_management_destroyed_my_outlook/,throwaway_dir,1,2021-04-29 14:49:30,8,/r/antiwork/comments/n0yo9i/middle_management_destroyed_my_outlook/,NaN,"Full disclosure for this throwaway account, I make good money at a growing company. By all outward measures my career is going great and I'm ahead of the curve. In retrospect this is what I've been working for. It's not that I don't sympathize with this subreddit but I can say I've always ""drank the kool-aid"" at work. Lean certifications? I have them. Management seminars/trainings? Attended them. Patrick Lencioni books? Read them. I have to say though that taking a risk and moving across the country for a job was a massive fucking mistake. I work in biotech and have always had a passion for what I do. Starting out as a low level manufacturing technician I've always told myself that no matter how much my day sucks at least at the other end of it was a person who might be cancer free, or have their sight restored, or some other amazing feat of medical science. I still believe that, because it is true, but fuck middle management and it's bloated, bullshit effect on prices and my staff.

In spite of the ""mission"", I fucking hate my companies leadership. During my time in my current role I have kept tabs on how much product we've produced and tried to focus my team on how many lives they possibly have saved, whereas finance and the CEO only want to talk about how much goddamn money we make per week/month/quarter/year. I knowingly pushed my team to work 7 days a week with only 5 day a week staffing for literally months to meet demands for a critical project. I don't regret it, because I know it saved lives. But goddamn would it be nice to have my team recognized beyond some extra money and a weak ""thank you"" for the fact that we made revenue for the quarter. Or alternatively, you know, authorize the correct fucking head count. Stop asking for what can be made with X number of headcount then expect 50% more than that. The game is fucking retarded. 

I was brought in partly because I know ""how to handle millennials"" but I am a fucking millennial. If there's one thing I know is that I'm telling the truth when I say what it's going to take to do a task. There's no fluff. I know my generations work ethic and what we can do. My team hasn't ever wavered from what I would expect. But the asshats above me think I'm padding the numbers and only provide a fraction of the ask then flip their shit when things don't go how they expect. For me, I keep calm and explain why they fucked up, but for my team it's hell. They want to do the right thing and take it personally when we don't stay on track with projections because they know that a batch lost/delayed is a treatment lost/delayed. In other words they fucking care about the right things.

I realize I'm fortunate to be where I am and I feel like a prick when I ask people for more when I know they're giving all they can. The stress of getting fucking chewed out every day about it makes me physically ill even before I get out of bed. The whole goddamn system is fucked and it only serves to leverage people's good will and ""mission"" oriented work ethic to enrich dirt-bag investors looking for a buyout. At the end of the day though, let's be real, I've been bought. My family will be well off assuming I can continue pushing people to do more with less. I hate myself for having the ability to do that even though, after you factor out cost, it's for a good cause.

Roast me if you want, I'm part of the problem. The choice is between my kids and you though, and I'll chose my kids every time. I hate myself for making healthcare more expensive but if that means my kids don't have to take on debt like I did I'll do that for them. This whole system is a zero sum game and I guess I'm winning despite wanting to literally vomit every day. I won't make myself a martyr and put in jeopardy my kids future. I'll keep cracking the whip and manipulating people into working more. Here we are, welcome to life in 2021."
