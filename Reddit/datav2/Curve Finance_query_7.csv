Would it make sense to have a Ethereum Gas Futures Market?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/ob6m3n/would_it_make_sense_to_have_a_ethereum_gas/,thetagodfather,1,2021-07-01 05:07:49,39,/r/ethdev/comments/ob6m3n/would_it_make_sense_to_have_a_ethereum_gas/,Question,"In Traditional Finance there exist all kinds of hedging products. Futures were created in the agricultural market to reduce risk for farmers. Since the prices of crops can be unpredictable, and subject to boom/bust dynamics, farmers were able to sell contracts on their physical inventory in exchange for capital. 

Investors, shouldered additional risk and could earn decent returns by looking for market inefficiencies and earning money on the spread of the agreed upon futures price and the actual price when the crops were available at market.

This later expanded to energy, like oil and natural gas.

The net result resulted in smoothing out the risk curve and bringing reliability to markets with more predictable pricing.

In Ethereum, we have gas spikes when projects go live, or we have lower prices over weekends when demand is low. I know gas prices have come down dramatically, and with new ETH developments, this should ease up.

However, over time, gas prices will always be in high demand.

Do we already have this dynamic in Ethereum that works similar to a futures market?

Would it make sense for capital providers to should risk in a way to smooth out gas prices? Could this system be gamed and result in price gouging?"

Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Summary Pt 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/ob81sp/principles_of_navigating_big_debt_crises_summary/,captmorgan50,1,2021-07-01 06:20:55,0,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/ob81sp/principles_of_navigating_big_debt_crises_summary/,Discussion,"Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle
• Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes.  Debt is financing activities that produce growth.  Known as “Goldilocks” period
• Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth.  This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more.  This can go on for decades.  These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
o Usually start from Bull markets.  Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
o Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
o Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
o As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
o The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
o Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily.  This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
o Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don’t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles.  And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
o Don’t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
o Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
▪ How to Spot a Bubble
• Prices are high relative to traditional measures
• Broad bullish sentiment
• Purchases are financed by high leverage
• New buyers enter the market
• Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
• Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
• The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
o Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
o This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices.  Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
o Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
o A negative “wealth effect” occurs when one’s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending.  This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
o Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
▪ People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
o Unemployment is low
o The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
▪ Immediate post bubble period
▪ People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find “cheap” stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
▪ Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
▪ As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
▪ This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
• The “Depression”
o In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy.  But in a depression, rates can’t be cut because they are already at 0%
o The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy.  IE – “QE” or printing money or stimulus
o Declines of 50% of people’s assets are common
o As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people.  Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
o Runs on banks are common
o At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
o People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money.  Which slows down the economy
o Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard.  It doesn’t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
o If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
o A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money.  And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn’t real
o Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
o The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
o The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of “real” wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
o The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
▪ They are typically slow to react initially because they don’t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
▪ Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do.  But it doesn’t bring the debt and income into balance.  Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes.  All this is bad
▪ “QE” or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail.  However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
▪ Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.  
▪ Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times.  Political populism tends to take hold after this time period.  Taxes on the rich become common talking points.  Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
▪ Stocks usually fall 50%
▪ Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
▪ Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
▪ Economic activity falls about 10%
▪ Unemployment is 10-15%
▪ Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
• The “Beautiful Deleveraging”
o Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
o Printing money during this phase doesn’t necessarily cause inflation.  It won’t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces.  If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok.  However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.  
o But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy’s and cause a “ugly inflationary deleveraging” IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920’s
o Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won’t work (IE – Already at 0%)
o All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
o In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
▪ Austerity causes more pain than benefit
▪ Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
▪ Redistributing of sufficient size doesn’t happen without a revolution
• Pushing on a string phase
o Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
o Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
o The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a “ugly inflationary deleveraging” to occur
▪ Monetary Policy 1
• Usually try to lower interest rates first.  If that doesn’t work, they go to 2
▪ Monetary Policy 2
• “QE” or printing money and buying financial assets.  But over time, QE’s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low.  IE – investors don’t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns.  Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
• Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness.  This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency’s suitability as a store of value.  This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
• At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don’t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
▪ Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
• Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
• Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
• Normalization
o System gets back to normal.  But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame.  And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again"

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

- Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
- The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
- **Template of a debt crisis**
- Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
- Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
- During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
- Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
- Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
- Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
- Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
- Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
- It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
- No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
- During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
- Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
- It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
- By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
- Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

- Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

- Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
- If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one

# **Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle**

- Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression
- Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if
  - Don&amp;#39;t have reserve currency
  - Have low foreign exchange reserves
  - Have large foreign debt
  - Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit
  - Have negative real interest rates
  - History of high inflation
- 5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage
  - Early – Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
  - Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
  - Top – Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
    - Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
    - Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
      - Spending down reserves
      - Raising rates
    - Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
  - Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&amp;#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&amp;#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
    - Usually, 30% decline in the currency
    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
  - Normalization – Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

# **Hyperinflation**

- If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
- Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop
- People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value
- How to invest during a hyperinflation episode – Short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (Gold), and invest in commodity industries (Gold, Oil, etc)"

- Must know your time horizon for investments
  - Short Term Investments – 1 year or less
  - Intermediate Term Investments – 2-5 years
  - Long Term Investments – 5 plus years
- Is the investment Liquid(stocks) or Illiquid (Real Estate)?
- Don&amp;#39;t buy preferred shares or convertible shares of stock. They have tax advantages that individual investors can&amp;#39;t get
- Derivative assets(futures) - derive their value from an underlying security or something else (very speculative)
- Stocks – you are the owner
- Bonds – you are the bank
- Short term securities – cash = principal is safe. Inflation risk still exists.
- Mutual Funds – managed on your behalf
- Stocks have historically done better than bonds but move up and down more (Do you want to eat well or do you want to sleep well?)
  - Stocks have a greater distribution range than bonds. IE – they up 30% one year and down 10% the next
  - Investment returns over time tend to mirror a normal distribution or &amp;quot;bell curve&amp;quot;
  - The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution of returns and the risker the investment. Stocks have wider distribution and more risk than bonds. But long term they provide a higher average return
- Don&amp;#39;t chase the next big thing. You will lose
- Don&amp;#39;t speculate
- Do NOT invest in an annuity
- Short Term Investments - Cash
  - 1 year or less
  - Usually Guaranteed
  - Very liquid
  - Low Risk-Low Return
  - Good place for emergency fund
  - Can lose purchasing power if they don&amp;#39;t keep up with inflation. Which they sometimes don&amp;#39;t
    - Common types
  - Savings accounts – stated rate of interest
  - Series EE savings bonds - Discount method – buy for $50 and redeem for $100 later.
  - Series I savings bonds – indexed to inflation
  - Treasury Bills – 1, 3 or 6-month maturity
  - Certificate of Deposit (CD) – have to be on deposit for a certain amount of time. From days to years. They usually rollover if you don&amp;#39;t stop them
  - Money Market Mutual Fund – mutual fund that invests only in short term securities. Unlike savings, they are not federally guaranteed but are considered risk free because other companies will bail them out in a problem
- Mutual Funds
  - Choose a family, not a fund
  - Professional money management and diversification
  - DCA – Dollar cost average is a great way to invest in mutual funds. You don&amp;#39;t worry what the market is doing or where it is going.
  - Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market. DCA!!!
  - Keep a long-term horizon and DCA
  - Most mutual fund investors BUY HIGH and SELL LOW. Don&amp;#39;t do this. Do not bail out of stocks when the market is down and buy on the way up. Most mutual fund investors do worse than the funds they invest in.
  - Choose a fund family and stick with them. Re-evaluate your investments once a year.
  - PITA (Pain in the A\*\*) factor is low
  - Fees
    - Management fee - Between 0.05% and 2% based on asset value
    - 12b-1 – &amp;quot;Advertisement fee&amp;quot; usually under 1%
    - Trading Cost – not disclosed in the prospectus. Look at the fund turnover. Higher turnover = higher trading costs. Lower turnover = lower trading costs
    - Load – charge a commission when the fund is bought. Paid to the financial representative. Usually 3-5%
      - A – front end load – paid upfront
      - B – back end load – paid when shares are sold
      - Deferred sales charge – ladder down then go to zero. 5,4,3,2,1
    - No Load – no commission when the fund is bought
      - No sales representative
      - 12b-1 Fee can&amp;#39;t be over 0.25%
      - I, F = don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;load&amp;quot; but charge a &amp;quot;management fee&amp;quot; of usually 1-2%
      - Index funds are usually true no load funds – be careful because some 401K&amp;#39;s have index funds with very high fee

- REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust
  - Pass through investments that must distribute 95% of earnings to shareholders
  - Own various forms of real estate
  - Good long-term investment
  - No PITA factor unlike being a landlord
  - Very liquid
  - They are a hedge against inflation
  - No management concerns
  - Offer diversification
- Stocks
  - Allow general public ownership in a business
  - Historically the best return is in stocks
  - Very liquid
  - Primary Market – IPO&amp;#39;s – don&amp;#39;t get involved in this
  - Secondary Market – where most investors trade
  - Stay away from OTC (Over the Counter) markets
  - Bid (Sell) - Ask (Buy) – what they will buy or sell a security for. The market makers make the spread between the bid/ask and provide liquidity to the market
  - Don&amp;#39;t buy on margin
  - Don&amp;#39;t sell short
  - Dow Jones – price weighted index of 30 companies
  - S+P 500 – market cap weighted index of 500 companies
  - MSCI and EAFE – index of foreign companies
  - Stock spin off – conversion of a company&amp;#39;s subsidiaries into a standalone company
  - Stock split – increase in number of shares outstanding. IE 2 for 1. You had 100 shares at $10 but now you have 200 shares at $5
  - Share buyback – company buys back their own shares and this increases the EPS because you have less shares
  - Stocks can have different classes.
    - A – original shares
    - B, C, D, E, etc – companies can have different share classes that have different rights or benefits. IE – higher dividend, more votes, etc. look at what you are buying
  - You want cash dividends, not stock dividends

Valuation techniques

- Fundamental analysis of finance holds that the value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
- The worth of a company is primarily based on the earnings the company will produce in the future (difficult to predict)
- The most fundamental influence on stock prices is the level and duration of the future growth earnings and dividends. However, future earnings are dividends are NOT easily estimated even by professionals – Burton Malkiel
- There is no single financial ratio(P/E) that can summarize the general state of affairs of the company
- P/E ratio – current price of a company divided by the earnings per share. Industries tend to have certain P/E ratios. Some tend to have higher or lower P/E
- Historically P/E was supposed to match its growth rate. IE – 20% growth rate = 20 P/E. But P/E have been 100+ at times
- Growth stocks tend to have high P/E – must have very high earnings to justify
- Value stocks tend to have low P/E – doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it is a good buy
- The P/E ratio tells you how long to earn back your investment back. IE – P/E 10 takes 10 years
- Price/Sales ratio (P/S) – same as P/E but you used sales instead of earnings. Usually used for fast growing companies who don&amp;#39;t have any earnings. Wall St. justified high prices on internet stocks during the late 90&amp;#39;s by using a P/S ratio
- Price/Book Ratio (P/B) – Book value is assets minus liabilities. P/B ratio is current price divided by book value.
- Price Ratio Analysis - Expected stock price =
  - 5-year average P/E or P/S or P/Cash Flow x Current EPS X (1 + EPS Growth Estimate)
  - The Price Ratio Analysis has not been very reliable analysis tool
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
  - Shares of a stock are valued on the basis of the present value of the future dividend streams the stock is projected to produce
  - This strategy worked very well during the 2001 downturn
  - Value of a stock = present value of all future dividend payments
  - Present value – the value today of a lump sum to be received at some future date
  - Different types of DDM
    - Zero Growth – assumes dividends will continue at a fixed rate indefinitely. Works well for stable income producing stocks
      - Take annual dividends and divide by required rate of return (you generate this number)
      - IE – Dividend of $3 a share and 6% required rate of return = $50 share value
      - Zero growth is another way to think about dividend yield
      - IE – Dividend divided by market price = rate of return
      - Example – Utility stock pays a $2.86 dividend. Current price is $75. If we want an 8% return take 2.86/0.08 = $35.75 – stock is overvalued based on our expected 8% return
      - You can also flip the formula to get what the market thinks the return is going to be. Take the dividend/price. 2.86/75 = 3.81%
    - Constant perpetual growth model – assumes dividends will grow at a specified rate perpetuity into the future. Good for companies with consistent dividend growth
      - Example – dividend of $10 per share and a 5% dividend growth rate. Required rate of return = 15%.
      - (10 x 1.05) / (15% - 5%) = 10.5 / 10% (0.1) = $105
      - 3M example - $230.37 per share. $5.44 dividend. Dividend growth 8%. Required rate of return 13%
      - (5.44 x 1.08) / (13 – 8) = 5.87 / 5% = $117.50 – overvalued based on example. But this formula is very susceptible to changes in required rate of return
    - The constant perpetual growth model is very sensitive to dividend growth and required return rates plugged into the formula
    - You can&amp;#39;t use DDM for a company that isn&amp;#39;t paying dividends
    - Dividend growth rates are very difficult to estimate. Unless you are looking at large cap, well established companies. But for smaller, faster growing companies in new industries, it is almost impossible
    - DDM – The value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
    - This strategy is good for prudent, long term investors
- The value line investment survey is a good place to get your information. You can get this information at some library&amp;#39;s.
- Doing all this math only tilts the odds in our favor. It doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that it will work like we wanted. Ask yourself a simple question. Would I want to own this company if I had X dollars? That is the real question.
- There is no one financial ratio that tells you to buy or sell a stock
- Balance Sheet
  - Financial summary of firm&amp;#39;s assets, liabilities, and shareholders&amp;#39; equity
  - Assets – liabilities = shareholder equity
  - Current – Less than 1 year
  - Long Term – More than 1 year
- Income Statement
  - Financial summary of the operating results for a specified period
  - Revenue – expenses = income
- Cash Flow Statement
  - Financial summary of the cash flow of the company and other events
- Reports
  - 10K – annual
  - 10Q – quarterly
- Financial Ratios – remember there is no one ratio to consider
  - P/E – Price/Earnings
    - Most popular stock market ratio
    - Price/EPS
    - Tells you how long in years it will take the company to earn back its price. P/E of 5 = 5 years to earn back your investment
    - Look at competitor&amp;#39;s P/E ratio. Don&amp;#39;t just look at one number
    - The P/E ratio should approximately match the growth rate. PEG ratio of 1. Higher than 1 = P/E is higher than growth rate. Less than 1 = P/E is lower than growth rate. More than 1 is common now.
  - Dividend per share
    - Dividend/Number of shares outstanding
  - Dividend Yield
    - Dividend per share/market price
  - Dividend payout ratio – how much of the earnings are being paid out in dividends
    - Dividend per share/EPS
  - Book Value
    - Shareholders equity/Number of shares outstanding
    - It tells you the &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; value of the company if you sold off all the assets and paid off all the debts and paid off the shareholders. Many companies trade above book value because they are worth more intact than split up
  - Price to book value per share – tells an investor how far above the market value is above the book value
    - market price/book value
    - 3-4+ is not uncommon. IE – Book value of $5 and market value of $20
    - Less than 1 is bad because the company is in danger because raiders might try to take the company and sell off the assets
  - Price to cash flow and price to sales – don&amp;#39;t use these
    - A way to &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; companies without earnings. Many companies were valued with this during the internet boom of the late 90&amp;#39;s
- Profitability ratio
  - Net Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned after expenses and taxes.
    - Varies based on industry
    - Net Income/Total Revenue
  - Gross Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned from gross profit
    - Gross Profit/Total Revenue
  - Operating Margin
    - Rate of profit being earned from net income adjusting for non-cash items
    - Operating Income/Total Revenue
    - The higher the better with the profitability ratios. But check your competitors and see what is the normal for your industry
  - Return on assets (ROA)
    - Measures profitability relative to its total assets
    - Net Income/Total Assets
  - Return on equity (ROE)
    - Measure of the overall profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity
    - Net Income/Total Stockholder equity
    - Return on equity is sensitive to the amount of debt a company carries. If a company carries more debt, it will have a higher ROE.
    - ROA and ROE can be drastically different, especially if a company carries lots of debt
- Liquidly Ratios
  - Current Ratio
    - Current Assets/Current Liabilities
    - Current ratio of 1.0 or higher is good. It means you have enough money to fund your short-term obligations. Higher number is better
- Leverage Ratios
  - Debt to equity ratio
    - Long-term debt/Total stockholder equity
    - A higher ratio means that the company is financing its growth with debt. The lower the number the better
- Sir Issac Newton – I can calculate the movement of the stars but not the madness of men
- Maynard Keynes – The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
- From 1963-1998 the S+P 500 Index funds beat the active funds in 22 of the 36 years
- Many mutual funds have high expenses and high turnover rates. They also have a short time horizon. This makes it hard for them to beat the market.
- If you hear – BE CAREFUL!!!
  - It&amp;#39;s a new era
  - It&amp;#39;s different this time
  - The old ways of valuing stocks are gone
- Ben Graham – the investing public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some action in progress.
- Mania&amp;#39;s will end with a crash every time.
- Ben Graham – Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy
- John Templeton – Bear markets are born of pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy.
- Diversification – spreading your investments across asset classes to eliminate some, but not all risk
- Diversification – guarantees that some investments will not do well any given year. You have to look at the whole portfolio
- Cash has not been the top performer vs stocks or bonds in the last 25 years."

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

- Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
- The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
- **Template of a debt crisis**
- Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
- Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
- During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
- Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
- Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
- Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
- Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
- Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
- It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
- No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
- During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
- Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
- It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
- By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
- Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

- Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period
- Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
- The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
- The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
- The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution
- Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
- Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

- Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
- If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one

# **Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle**

- Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression
- Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if
  - Don&amp;#39;t have reserve currency
  - Have low foreign exchange reserves
  - Have large foreign debt
  - Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit
  - Have negative real interest rates
  - History of high inflation
- 5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage
  - Early – Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
  - Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
  - Top – Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
    - Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
    - Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
      - Spending down reserves
      - Raising rates
    - Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
  - Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&amp;#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&amp;#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
    - Usually, 30% decline in the currency
    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
  - Normalization – Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

# **Hyperinflation**

- If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
- Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop
- People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value

I put some money on the atricrypto pool (staked in gauge). On the withdraw page I can see my funds and the buttons ""unstake from gauge"" and ""unstake and withdraw"".

I can't see anything in my dashboard, is it because my founds are staked in gauge ? (I can see the funds if I withdraw from gauge). I've read the ""Understanding gauge"" on Curve's website but I don't understand why it does not show up on the dashboard..."

Cry a moment
The BSC machine gun pool project MerlinLs hacked at 15:24 on June 29. According to an analysis by blockchain security firm Peckshield, the MerlinLab was hacked There is a logic loophole in MerlinStrategyalPacabnb.
The contract mistakenly takes the BNB transferred by the beneficiary as the mining income, so that the contract issues more MERL as a reward. After repeated operations, the attacker gains $300,000 MERL and temporarily halves, from $16.23 to $6.09 .
Merlin Lab reacts quickly to this attack, but faster than most people would have expected. 
 According to the project owner, after repeated hacker attacks, the developers were not optimistic about the prospect of the project and believed that they had no more experience to deal with the potential challenges in the future, so they did nothing but to shut down the project because they could not realize their original vision.
At present, the official website of the project party can still be accessed, and funds can be withdrawn normally. The project party's documents, Twitter account and Chinese WeChat group have been disbanded. 
This incident exposes the following questions of DEFI :
1) Is the team responsible for evil or normal hacker attack? 
2) Are the audited projects safe?
 3) Are anonymous items trustworthy? 
4) The cost of the project party admitting defeat is low, so how to deal with the losses caused to the investors? Hackers are one of us?
 Peckshield said it was possible that the team had acted badly. 
One suspect: Why rush to deploy a contract on your main network when it wasn't ready? 
The single asset machine gun pool related to Alpaca Finance just went online this morning for testing on the Merlin Labs mainnet. The contract with the vulnerability has not been published yet, nor has it provided the user with the inside information needed to carry out this attack. Since the contract is deployed online and the audit is conducted by many people, there are many possible insiders Team evil may be: the core personnel take the initiative to do evil; Some personnel secretly evil; 
After the attack, the project operator shut down the project overnight, emptied the Twitter, emptied the project wiki, dissolved the WeChat group, sold the tokens and other operations. It seems that there is reason to suspect that this is the initiative of the team. 
However, the profit of this attack is about $300,000,Merlin Labs Before the attack of TVL is about 200 million dollars .If it is the core team take the initiative to do evil, they obviously have enough temptation to shut down the project, and give investors no time to extract money.
It seems that external hacker attacks, the coincidence indicated anything.
The audit does not solve all problems
Most DEFI projects will ask audit companies to issue audit reports to endorse the security of the projects. However, the audited projects are not necessarily safe. In May, BSC was targeted by hackers, many of which were audited by blockchain security companies Peckshield tells Babbitt that defending against an attack is not a static process, it's a dynamic process -- in short, it's a pre-event, post-event process Defense mode of three stages, before the new contract online to conduct a comprehensive and professional intelligent security audit contract, this step is mainly to help agreement screening known all kinds of loopholes, the audit does not solve all problems Also, pay attention to the screen in combination with other DeFi products when the business logic of the loophole, avoid logical loopholes compatibility across the contract; It is necessary to design a certain risk control circuit breaker mechanism, and introduce the threat perception intelligence and data situation intelligence service of the third party security company to respond to the security risk in the first time when the DEFI security incident occurs, and check and block the security attack in time, so as to avoid causing more losses.
In addition, a set of perfect asset tracking mechanism should be established to monitor the flow of virtual currencies in real time. After security incidents occur in other protocols, the protocol should be carefully checked and remedied, whether there are similar loopholes and whether there are potential risks We think that in addition to the need to build a safe prediction strategy, to thoroughly understand the agreement and in the prophecy machine this source fluctuation kongfu, do it from the Angle of audit found problems, provide reliable solutions, under the chain of timely check 20, can reduce the price because of how machine distortion data manipulation Anonymous project is worthy of trust?
almost all of the current top 10 DEFI projects are real names.
For example, Michael Egorov, founder of Curve, is a Russian like Vishen. Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of AVE, studied law at the University of Helsinki Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, was laid off from his first job out of school, and the world lost one young electrical engineer to one DEFI pioneer, and others like Compound(founder Robert Leshner), Makerdao (founder Rune) Christensen) Liquity(founder Robert Lauko) is also a real name project. The Venus project is supported by the Swipe team (which has since been reorganized and Swipe has stepped down from project decision-making), a Binance investment company Only the teams of Pancakeswap and Sushiswap are anonymous. 
However, several core developers of Sushiswap are active on Twitter. Although blockchain is about decentralization and trust, the reality is that real-name projects are more likely to win the trust of investors.
Unfortunately,Merlin Labs was an anonymous project
The project was discarded at random and the investors had to pay for it, right? 
The solution adopted by Merlin Labs after the attack did not fix the vulnerability and make a compensation plan for the investors like the previous two times. 
On the contrary, the project side quickly sold off the tokens and announced the dissolution of the project, which directly caused the halved coin price to go to zero . The sharp fall in the price of the coins also led to heavy losses for the LP, which provided liquidity for the project. 
To put it mildly, it is extremely irresponsible of the project party to do this, and completely disregarding the interests of investors Last night bottom-hunting investors cost more in the range of 6-8 dollars, a wake up to return to zero because the project party is anonymous, at the same time the project Twitter cancelled the cable group ban WeChat group dissolved, the loss of investors almost nowhere to ask for a claim that DEFI has no supervision, in Code is law Investors in the blockchain world rely on code security as well as ethical discipline. When those two lines of defense are breached, how we prevent it next time?"

# 3 Key Takeaways

1. If the Fed tapers QE, it may reveal waning appetite for long-term treasuries
2. The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations
3. If inflation persists, the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE

*Note: By definition,* ***inflation*** *is an expansion of the money supply. In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices (usually as a result of money supply expansion)*

## Introduction

When the economy was shut down in March 2020, the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support. The fiscal stimulus totaled $4T+ in relief packages. All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury. The Treasury mostly issued short-term debt. With rates being held at zero by the Fed, and strong demand for short-term debt, it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans.

The Fed monetary policy was two fold, slash short-term rates to zero and inject $1.5 trillion into the long-term debt treasury market. The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve. After the initial debt binge, QE changed to auto-pilot, buying about $80B a month in long-term debt (plus another $40B in Mortgage debt). Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise.

All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. [Part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) of this series went into detail about how US short-term debt has doubled from $2.5T to $4.5T. This makes even small changes in short-term rates an immediate risk to the federal government, not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight.

In theory the Fed could leave short-term rates at 0% but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet, pushing long-term rates up to combat inflation. In the short/medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long-term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long-term debt. See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument. Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills. The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/knv3r7lhyl871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9cf9e91f8bd61e3a174547c3730adfd3a380588)

 

Although the Treasury could handle rising long-term rates (even if the economy and mortgage market cannot), the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation.

With the economy opening up in March of this year, things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long-term rates. Remember that rising long-term rates indicate rising inflation expectations. This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory.

In summer 2020, the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve. In response to rising long-term rates in Q1 2021, it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long-term debt. With total short-term debt outstanding already so high, the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a $1.9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher. This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control.

If inflation doesn’t slow in the coming months, the Fed may be forced to step in. With the Treasury poised to issue more debt, it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves. This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long-term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE. Yes, the Fed may decide to print more money (leading to higher prices) to fight rising inflation expectations (higher long-term interest rates).

## Understanding recent fiscal and monetary menurvers

Last year when the pandemic hit, the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars. Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief. Because the Government does not have much money on hand, and taxes cannot quickly be raised, the Treasury issued trillions in debt. The markets can easily absorb short-term US Treasury Bills, so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0%, the Treasury responded by issuing short-term debt to the tune of $2.4T from March to June 2020. See figure 1 below.

In tandem, the Fed bought up trillions of dollars in US Debt, but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end. This caused long-term rates to collapse. The Fed purchased enough long-term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long-term debt issuance. The chart below, shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the Treasury Debt Issuance of long-term notes and bonds. 

&amp;#x200B;

This action by the Fed had a massive impact on long-term rates. The chart below shows the difference between the two bars above, specifically the difference in Fed Buying and Treasury issuance of long-term debt for each individual month since Jan 2020. These values are not cumulative. The right Y-Axis shows the the month-end interest rate of the 10 year bond. Looking at this chart shows something extremely clear: When the Fed buying exceeds debt issuance, rates are flat or falling; however, when long-term debt issuance surpasses the Feds buying, rates rise. 

[ Figure 4: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/8ir4qpmvyl871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289da75f4d1e82d50f02742675beed4c5a8815b5)

&amp;#x200B;

The impact of the Fed can first be seen as interest rates fell from 1.5% to .6% during the initial buying spree. After the initial burst, the Fed put QE on auto-pilot, buying “only” $80B a month in long-term treasuries. However, because the Treasury was issuing more than $80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020, interest rates started rising.

This trend started to accelerate in November of 2020, as long-term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around $200B. Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by $286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1.7%.

Then, suddenly, long-term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May. This consequently led to a fall in long-term rates, which are now hovering back around 1.5%. How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a $1.9T stimulus package? Unlike 2020 when short-term debt issuance was used to plug the gap, Figure 1 above shows that Short-Term debt issuance was actually turning negative (blue bars). What gives?

One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story. This was first highlighted by a [SchiffGold article](https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/why-are-us-treasury-bond-sales-are-about-to-spike/) published June 16. The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year. Since March of this year, the cash balance has plummeted by over $1T.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/meagva6yyl871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3783b2c26cf41c6c661d43689b05ba45f7c7f0c)

## Inflation Expectations

Why such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance? In truth there could be lots of reasons, but it does seem extremely sudden. One would think the Treasury, led by Yellen, would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up $1T+ in dry powder. For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory. At the June FOMC press conference, Powell stood up and explained how long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A proxy for inflation expecations is long-term interest rates.

Had interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory (climbing from .8% in Nov to 1.7% in March), this would have been a difficult narrative to push. The Fed *needs* inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory. Thus, the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long-term debt would be April-June 2021 just as the economy is re-opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down.

While this is speculation, it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen. Regardless of the intention though, the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance. It could return to the short-term debt market, but the outstanding balance is still sitting above $4T (see [part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/)). It needs to be converting that short-term debt to long-term debt while long-term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying. But the Fed is simply not buying enough at $80B to convert all that debt!

If inflation persists beyond a few months, then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates. Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the $80B Fed buying as it did from November to March. Then what? Who is absorbing the long-term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 - Mar 2021?

International creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately. The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments. In the past 15 months, while the Treasury has issued over $4T in new debt, **the net amount bought by foreign governments is close to zero**.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/k6yv6kv0zl871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f50855bf8e93b161f82816e2ef3f1ee5a719177)

To zoom into the exact amount of change since the massive debt issuance, see the chart below. In total, foreign creditors have absorbed $120 billion of $6T+ or **less than 2% of total issuance**! 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/u9jiqpg3zl871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cb6667562dbd6ce1a304d84198fd30adb17305e)

How are rates going to stay low if the Fed keeps the treasury buying cap at $80B? The Treasury will have to issue more than $80B in long-term debt to continue funding all the massive spending. If inflation expectations stay low, maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt, but not all of it. With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year, someone will need to fill the void of $80B. This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet, which should be considered impossible at this point.

The chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1.5%, one could argue there is strong demand for long-term Treasury debt. Unfortunately, foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases. It took decades for them to accumulate \~$7T in Treasury debt. The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that (\~$4.5T) over the last decade. The Fed is making the market seem strong, but as shown above, there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market. With a thumb on the scale, no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long-term debt.

## What about short-term debt markets?

As highlighted several times, the demand for short-term debt seems to remain very strong. This makes sense as T-Bills mature in less than a year so these investments are perceived as nearly risk free. In fact, it could be argued that the recent Treasury Bill issuance hiatus (Figure 1 - blue bars turning negative) could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repo market. The chart below shows the current Reverse Repo market. Based on past quarter end data, it’s very possible that Reverse Repos could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 9: Source - https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD ](https://preview.redd.it/fp0afs1azl871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f859efcf1f6dc922f711d48ef9dc4419d142b8d)

Many articles have been written to explain this phenomenon, without providing exact clarity on what’s actually going on. The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash. So much cash, they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight. This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds, but with so much cash in the system, if it were to all be invested in short-term debt instruments it could drive rates negative. To avoid negative rates, the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash. It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds **never** experience a loss and result in [breaking the buck](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp).

Maybe this is a leap too far, but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short-term debt. So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short-term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market? The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short-term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding. Unfortunately, this abundance of cash in the repo market is in search of low risk *short-term* debt so will not provide demand for long-term debt.

If this is the case, it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury. By issuing too much short-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to **not** raise short-term interest rates. However, by issuing too much long-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing. To reiterate, this is why it is *imperative* the market believes inflation is transitory. The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt, which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market. Additionally, if the Fed has to fight inflation, then it’s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment, but the entire US economy.

## Wrapping up

With the economy reopening, the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time, unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase (which based on all the data, anecdotal evidence, and liquidity in the repo market seems like a strong possibility). Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again. Will it lean towards short-term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low, or long-term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE?

The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though. Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers *disappoint*. If both don’t occur, then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus. Yellen and Powell may be best buds, but simple coordination will not be enough. They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022.

If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering. Rising long-term rates won’t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a “low” inflation environment. Unfortunately though; long-terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt. As the market this year has indicated, when issuance surpasses Fed buying, rates have gone up. So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely? Presumably, they go up a lot. How high will the Fed let rates go before re-entering?

Just because something is inevitable (US Debt spiral) does not make it imminent; however, the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory. Chances are, the only thing transitory will be “talking about talking about” tapering.

# 3 Key Takeaways

1. If the Fed tapers QE, it may reveal waning appetite for long-term treasuries
2. The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations
3. If inflation persists, the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE

*Note: By definition,* ***inflation*** *is an expansion of the money supply. In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices (usually as a result of money supply expansion)*

# Introduction

When the economy was shut down in March 2020, the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support. The fiscal stimulus totaled $4T+ in relief packages. All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury. The Treasury mostly issued short-term debt. With rates being held at zero by the Fed, and strong demand for short-term debt, it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans.

The Fed monetary policy was two fold, slash short-term rates to zero and inject $1.5 trillion into the long-term debt treasury market. The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve. After the initial debt binge, QE changed to auto-pilot, buying about $80B a month in long-term debt (plus another $40B in Mortgage debt). Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise.

All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. [Part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) of this series went into detail about how US short-term debt has doubled from $2.5T to $4.5T. This makes even small changes in short-term rates an immediate risk to the federal government, not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight.

In theory the Fed could leave short-term rates at 0% but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet, pushing long-term rates up to combat inflation. In the short/medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long-term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long-term debt. See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument. Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills. The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the Treasury could handle rising long-term rates (even if the economy and mortgage market cannot), the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation.

Based on past quarter end data, it’s very possible that Reverse Repos could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down.

Many articles have been written to explain this phenomenon, without providing exact clarity on what’s actually going on. The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash. So much cash, they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight. This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds, but with so much cash in the system, if it were to all be invested in short-term debt instruments it could drive rates negative. To avoid negative rates, the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash. It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds **never** experience a loss and result in [breaking the buck](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp).

Maybe this is a leap too far, but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short-term debt. So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short-term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market? The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short-term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding. Unfortunately, this abundance of cash in the repo market is in search of low risk *short-term* debt so will not provide demand for long-term debt.

If this is the case, it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury. By issuing too much short-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to **not** raise short-term interest rates. However, by issuing too much long-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing. To reiterate, this is why it is *imperative* the market believes inflation is transitory. The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt, which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market. Additionally, if the Fed has to fight inflation, then it’s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment, but the entire US economy.

# Wrapping up

With the economy reopening, the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time, unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase (which based on all the data, anecdotal evidence, and liquidity in the repo market seems like a strong possibility). Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again. Will it lean towards short-term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low, or long-term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE?

The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though. Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers *disappoint*. If both don’t occur, then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus. Yellen and Powell may be best buds, but simple coordination will not be enough. They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022.

If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering. Rising long-term rates won’t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a “low” inflation environment. Unfortunately though; long-terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt. As the market this year has indicated, when issuance surpasses Fed buying, rates have gone up. So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely? Presumably, they go up a lot. How high will the Fed let rates go before re-entering?

Just because something is inevitable (US Debt spiral) does not make it imminent; however, the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory. Chances are, the only thing transitory will be “talking about talking about” tapering.

# 3 Key Takeaways

1. If the Fed tapers QE, it may reveal waning appetite for long-term treasuries
2. The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations
3. If inflation persists, the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE

*Note: By definition,* ***inflation*** *is an expansion of the money supply. In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices (usually as a result of money supply expansion)*

## Introduction

When the economy was shut down in March 2020, the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support. The fiscal stimulus totaled $4T+ in relief packages. All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury. The Treasury mostly issued short-term debt. With rates being held at zero by the Fed, and strong demand for short-term debt, it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans.

The Fed monetary policy was two fold, slash short-term rates to zero and inject $1.5 trillion into the long-term debt treasury market. The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve. After the initial debt binge, QE changed to auto-pilot, buying about $80B a month in long-term debt (plus another $40B in Mortgage debt). Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise.

All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. [Part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) of this series went into detail about how US short-term debt has doubled from $2.5T to $4.5T. This makes even small changes in short-term rates an immediate risk to the federal government, not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight.

In theory the Fed could leave short-term rates at 0% but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet, pushing long-term rates up to combat inflation. In the short/medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long-term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long-term debt. See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument. Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills. The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Source - Treasurydirect.gov  ](https://preview.redd.it/y67gsfsntn871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03abb3684cd9e77a39a9b9a8d66aed14eeb5de4b)

Although the Treasury could handle rising long-term rates (even if the economy and mortgage market cannot), the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation.

With the economy opening up in March of this year, things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long-term rates. Remember that rising long-term rates indicate rising inflation expectations. This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory.

In summer 2020, the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve. In response to rising long-term rates in Q1 2021, it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long-term debt. With total short-term debt outstanding already so high, the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a $1.9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher. This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control.

If inflation doesn’t slow in the coming months, the Fed may be forced to step in. With the Treasury poised to issue more debt, it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves. This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long-term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE. Yes, the Fed may decide to print more money (leading to higher prices) to fight rising inflation expectations (higher long-term interest rates).

# Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers

Last year when the pandemic hit, the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars. Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief. Because the Government does not have much money on hand, and taxes cannot quickly be raised, the Treasury issued trillions in debt. The markets can easily absorb short-term US Treasury Bills, so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0%, the Treasury responded by issuing short-term debt to the tune of $2.4T from March to June 2020. See figure 1 below.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/9mj1tldztn871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3333ceed4af61368ecdae363a6282ec42ef8af63)

In tandem, the Fed bought up trillions of dollars in US Debt, but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end. This caused long-term rates to collapse. The Fed purchased enough long-term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long-term debt issuance. The chart below, shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the Treasury Debt Issuance of long-term notes and bonds. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 3: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/txm25ha3un871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4928c449ceb56b5143bc6dcbd9ae805748c193a)

This action by the Fed had a massive impact on long-term rates. The chart below shows the difference between the two bars above, specifically the difference in Fed Buying and Treasury issuance of long-term debt for each individual month since Jan 2020. These values are not cumulative. The right Y-Axis shows the the month-end interest rate of the 10 year bond. Looking at this chart shows something extremely clear: When the Fed buying exceeds debt issuance, rates are flat or falling; however, when long-term debt issuance surpasses the Feds buying, rates rise. 

&amp;#x200B;

[  Figure 4: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/2kmvdvo5un871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8560cdd7a3c67c78c185c9d847265a4d578c24e0)

The impact of the Fed can first be seen as interest rates fell from 1.5% to .6% during the initial buying spree. After the initial burst, the Fed put QE on auto-pilot, buying “only” $80B a month in long-term treasuries. However, because the Treasury was issuing more than $80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020, interest rates started rising.

This trend started to accelerate in November of 2020, as long-term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around $200B. Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by $286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1.7%.

Then, suddenly, long-term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May. This consequently led to a fall in long-term rates, which are now hovering back around 1.5%. How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a $1.9T stimulus package? Unlike 2020 when short-term debt issuance was used to plug the gap, Figure 1 above shows that Short-Term debt issuance was actually turning negative (blue bars). What gives?

One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story. This was first highlighted by a [SchiffGold article](https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/why-are-us-treasury-bond-sales-are-about-to-spike/) published June 16. The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year. Since March of this year, the cash balance has plummeted by over $1T.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/stucdov9un871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44c7ce2c570ed26e4db39863bf1cfd6a2d5f3bdc)

# Inflation Expectations

Why such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance? In truth there could be lots of reasons, but it does seem extremely sudden. One would think the Treasury, led by Yellen, would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up $1T+ in dry powder. For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory. At the June FOMC press conference, Powell stood up and explained how long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A proxy for inflation expecations is long-term interest rates.

Had interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory (climbing from .8% in Nov to 1.7% in March), this would have been a difficult narrative to push. The Fed *needs* inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory. Thus, the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long-term debt would be April-June 2021 just as the economy is re-opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down.

While this is speculation, it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen. Regardless of the intention though, the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance. It could return to the short-term debt market, but the outstanding balance is still sitting above $4T (see [part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/)). It needs to be converting that short-term debt to long-term debt while long-term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying. But the Fed is simply not buying enough at $80B to convert all that debt!

If inflation persists beyond a few months, then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates. Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the $80B Fed buying as it did from November to March. Then what? Who is absorbing the long-term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 - Mar 2021?

International creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately. The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments. In the past 15 months, while the Treasury has issued over $4T in new debt, **the net amount bought by foreign governments is close to zero**.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/7lm5dzscun871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ebeca942362107b6f17d075ce583ee230ac7206)

To zoom into the exact amount of change since the massive debt issuance, see the chart below. In total, foreign creditors have absorbed $120 billion of $6T+ or **less than 2% of total issuance**! 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/9zn0ir0hun871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1186004030730c8e67e5ce1e60333577c8b324)

How are rates going to stay low if the Fed keeps the treasury buying cap at $80B? The Treasury will have to issue more than $80B in long-term debt to continue funding all the massive spending. If inflation expectations stay low, maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt, but not all of it. With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year, someone will need to fill the void of $80B. This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet, which should be considered impossible at this point.

The chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1.5%, one could argue there is strong demand for long-term Treasury debt. Unfortunately, foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases. It took decades for them to accumulate \~$7T in Treasury debt. The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that (\~$4.5T) over the last decade. The Fed is making the market seem strong, but as shown above, there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market. With a thumb on the scale, no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long-term debt.

# What about short-term debt markets?

As highlighted several times, the demand for short-term debt seems to remain very strong. This makes sense as T-Bills mature in less than a year so these investments are perceived as nearly risk free. In fact, it could be argued that the recent Treasury Bill issuance hiatus (Figure 1 - blue bars turning negative) could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repurchase market. The chart below shows the current Reverse Repurchase market. Based on past quarter end data, it’s very possible that Reverse Repurchases could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 9: Source - https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD ](https://preview.redd.it/op6xhqplun871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=770a48e742389cd11f51e10aee5a2bcc8ef31983)

To reiterate, this is why it is *imperative* the market believes inflation is transitory. The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt, which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market. Additionally, if the Fed has to fight inflation, then it’s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment, but the entire US economy.

# Wrapping up

Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again.

Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise.

All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. [Part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) of this series went into detail about how US short-term debt has doubled from $2.5T to $4.5T. This makes even small changes in short-term rates an immediate risk to the federal government, not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight.

In theory the Fed could leave short-term rates at 0% but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet, pushing long-term rates up to combat inflation. In the short/medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long-term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long-term debt. See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument. Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills. The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again.

Although the Treasury could handle rising long-term rates (even if the economy and mortgage market cannot), the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation.

With the economy opening up in March of this year, things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long-term rates. Remember that rising long-term rates indicate rising inflation expectations. This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory.

In summer 2020, the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve. In response to rising long-term rates in Q1 2021, it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long-term debt. With total short-term debt outstanding already so high, the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a $1.9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher. This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control.

If inflation doesn’t slow in the coming months, the Fed may be forced to step in. With the Treasury poised to issue more debt, it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves. This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long-term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE. Yes, the Fed may decide to print more money (leading to higher prices) to fight rising inflation expectations (higher long-term interest rates).

# Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers

Last year when the pandemic hit, the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars. Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief. Because the Government does not have much money on hand, and taxes cannot quickly be raised, the Treasury issued trillions in debt. The markets can easily absorb short-term US Treasury Bills, so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0%, the Treasury responded by issuing short-term debt to the tune of $2.4T from March to June 2020. See figure 1 below.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/9mj1tldztn871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3333ceed4af61368ecdae363a6282ec42ef8af63)

In tandem, the Fed bought up trillions of dollars in US Debt, but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end. This caused long-term rates to collapse. The Fed purchased enough long-term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long-term debt issuance. The chart below, shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the Treasury Debt Issuance of long-term notes and bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 3: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/txm25ha3un871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4928c449ceb56b5143bc6dcbd9ae805748c193a)

This action by the Fed had a massive impact on long-term rates. The chart below shows the difference between the two bars above, specifically the difference in Fed Buying and Treasury issuance of long-term debt for each individual month since Jan 2020. These values are not cumulative. The right Y-Axis shows the the month-end interest rate of the 10 year bond. Looking at this chart shows something extremely clear: When the Fed buying exceeds debt issuance, rates are flat or falling; however, when long-term debt issuance surpasses the Feds buying, rates rise.

&amp;#x200B;

[  Figure 4: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/2kmvdvo5un871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8560cdd7a3c67c78c185c9d847265a4d578c24e0)

The impact of the Fed can first be seen as interest rates fell from 1.5% to .6% during the initial buying spree. After the initial burst, the Fed put QE on auto-pilot, buying “only” $80B a month in long-term treasuries. However, because the Treasury was issuing more than $80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020, interest rates started rising.

This trend started to accelerate in November of 2020, as long-term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around $200B. Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by $286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1.7%.

Then, suddenly, long-term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May. This consequently led to a fall in long-term rates, which are now hovering back around 1.5%. How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a $1.9T stimulus package? Unlike 2020 when short-term debt issuance was used to plug the gap, Figure 1 above shows that Short-Term debt issuance was actually turning negative (blue bars). What gives?

One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story. This was first highlighted by a [SchiffGold article](https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/why-are-us-treasury-bond-sales-are-about-to-spike/) published June 16. The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year. Since March of this year, the cash balance has plummeted by over $1T.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/stucdov9un871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44c7ce2c570ed26e4db39863bf1cfd6a2d5f3bdc)

# Inflation Expectations

Why such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance? In truth there could be lots of reasons, but it does seem extremely sudden. One would think the Treasury, led by Yellen, would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up $1T+ in dry powder. For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory. At the June FOMC press conference, Powell stood up and explained how long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A proxy for inflation expecations is long-term interest rates.

Had interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory (climbing from .8% in Nov to 1.7% in March), this would have been a difficult narrative to push. The Fed *needs* inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory. Thus, the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long-term debt would be April-June 2021 just as the economy is re-opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down.

While this is speculation, it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen. Regardless of the intention though, the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance. It could return to the short-term debt market, but the outstanding balance is still sitting above $4T (see [part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/)). It needs to be converting that short-term debt to long-term debt while long-term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying. But the Fed is simply not buying enough at $80B to convert all that debt!

If inflation persists beyond a few months, then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates. Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the $80B Fed buying as it did from November to March. Then what? Who is absorbing the long-term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 - Mar 2021?

International creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately. The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments. In the past 15 months, while the Treasury has issued over $4T in new debt, **the net amount bought by foreign governments is close to zero**.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/7lm5dzscun871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ebeca942362107b6f17d075ce583ee230ac7206)

To zoom into the exact amount of change since the massive debt issuance, see the chart below. In total, foreign creditors have absorbed $120 billion of $6T+ or **less than 2% of total issuance**!

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Source - https:\/\/ticdata.treasury.gov\/Publish\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/9zn0ir0hun871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1186004030730c8e67e5ce1e60333577c8b324)

How are rates going to stay low if the Fed keeps the treasury buying cap at $80B? The Treasury will have to issue more than $80B in long-term debt to continue funding all the massive spending. If inflation expectations stay low, maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt, but not all of it. With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year, someone will need to fill the void of $80B. This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet, which should be considered impossible at this point.

The chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1.5%, one could argue there is strong demand for long-term Treasury debt. Unfortunately, foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases. It took decades for them to accumulate \~$7T in Treasury debt. The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that (\~$4.5T) over the last decade. The Fed is making the market seem strong, but as shown above, there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market. With a thumb on the scale, no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long-term debt.

# What about short-term debt markets?

As highlighted several times, the demand for short-term debt seems to remain very strong. This makes sense as T-Bills mature in less than a year so these investments are perceived as nearly risk free. In fact, it could be argued that the recent Treasury Bill issuance hiatus (Figure 1 - blue bars turning negative) could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repurchase market. The chart below shows the current Reverse Repurchase market. Based on past quarter end data, it’s very possible that Reverse Repurchases could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 9: Source - https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD ](https://preview.redd.it/op6xhqplun871.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=770a48e742389cd11f51e10aee5a2bcc8ef31983)

Many articles have been written to explain this phenomenon, without providing exact clarity on what’s actually going on. The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash. So much cash, they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight. This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds, but with so much cash in the system, if it were to all be invested in short-term debt instruments it could drive rates negative. To avoid negative rates, the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash. It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds **never** experience a loss and result in [breaking the buck](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp).

Maybe this is a leap too far, but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short-term debt. So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short-term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market? The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short-term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding. Unfortunately, this abundance of cash in the Repurchase market is in search of low risk *short-term* debt so will not provide demand for long-term debt.

If this is the case, it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury. By issuing too much short-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to **not** raise short-term interest rates. However, by issuing too much long-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing. To reiterate, this is why it is *imperative* the market believes inflation is transitory. The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt, which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market. Additionally, if the Fed has to fight inflation, then it’s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment, but the entire US economy.

# Wrapping up

With the economy reopening, the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time, unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase (which based on all the data, anecdotal evidence, and liquidity in the Repurchase market seems like a strong possibility). Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again. Will it lean towards short-term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low, or long-term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE?

The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though. Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers *disappoint*. If both don’t occur, then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus. Yellen and Powell may be best buds, but simple coordination will not be enough. They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022.

If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering. Rising long-term rates won’t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a “low” inflation environment. Unfortunately though; long-terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt. As the market this year has indicated, when issuance surpasses Fed buying, rates have gone up. So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely? Presumably, they go up a lot. How high will the Fed let rates go before re-entering?

Just because something is inevitable (US Debt spiral) does not make it imminent; however, the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory. Chances are, the only thing transitory will be “talking about talking about” tapering.

**An Introduction to F-Wrapping**

**(Safe and Lucrative Yield Farming on Fegex)**

Fegex is a new decentralized exchange operating on both the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains. In this piece, I’m going to give an introductory overview of Fegex’s native yield farming protocol (\`f-wrapping’), and explain why I think it offers such an amazing risk/reward ratio for farming both stablecoins and more volatile crypto assets. 

**The Basic Concept**

Yield farming on Fegex works via an \`f-wrapping’ mechanism, which allows you to f-wrap any erc-20 or bep-20 token. To illustrate what this involves, I’ll use the example of f-wrapping the BNB token. 

Suppose I have 1 BNB that I want to f-wrap. To do this, I deposit my 1BNB into the fBNB pool and receive the equivalent amount back in fBNB, minus a 1% fee for f-wrapping, i.e. I get 0.99 fBNB back. Now, the 1% fee that I just paid gets distributed amongst everyone else that holds fBNB, in proportion to how much they hold (someone with 10fBNB gets 10 times as much as someone with 1fBNB). Now that I’m in the pool, I will receive a proportion of all these fees in the future. When I want to change my fBNB back to standard BNB, I can always do so at a 1:1 ratio, minus another 1% fee, which again gets distributed to everyone holding fBNB, i.e. if I have 1fBNB, I will get back 0.99 BNB when I leave the pool. But while I’m in the pool, I will be gaining a cut of all of the 1% entry and exit fees paid by people entering and leaving the pool. 

This is just an example using BNB. As I said, this can be done with *any* erc-20 or bep-20 token, including e.g. ETH, USDC, USDT, BUSD, AAVE, and the Binance or Ethereum pegged versions of ADA, DOGE, BTC etc. f-wrapping essentially allows you to yield farm any major crypto asset. 

Now that I’ve introduced the basic concept, I’m going to explain why it’s so great. 

**Safety**

Firstly, I should address safety, which is always a major concern in the world of yield farming. Clearly, there are many kinds of risk to take into account when dealing with yield farms. I’ll address a few of the most prominent ones here. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Impermanent Loss**

A lot of yield farming works via providing liquidity pairs to exchanges in order to generate yield. This carries an intrinsic risk of impermanent loss, which can seriously affect the value of your investment if one of your assets significantly underperforms in relation to the other. f-wrapping, which only ever involves one asset at a time, carries *no risk of impermanent loss*. 

**2. Farming with unstable and risky currencies**

A lot of yield farming platforms encourage and incentive you to farm with their native tokens, and generally also pay out yields denominated in those tokens (as opposed to paying out in whichever tokens you deposited). This exposes you to the risk associated with the token of the relevant platform. For instance, people farming on Iron Finance were exposed to the intrinsic risk of the Titan token. When that token’s value plummeted, so did the value of the Iron \`stable’ coin, which was partially collateralized by Titan, and many people lost of lot of money, either through participating in pools involving Iron/Titan, or through holding their rewards in Titan. With f-wrapping, you are not exposed in any way to the risk of fegex’s native currency, the feg token. The value and yield of your f-wraps is entirely independent of the price of feg. All f-wraps are fully collateralized by whichever currency you deposited, and you can always exchange your fETH/fBNB/fUSDC etc for ETH/BNB/USDC at a 1:1 ratio, minus the 1% tax. So if you deposit a stable coin like USDC, you will always know exactly how much of it you hold, and you will always be certain that you can unwrap it for that amount, without any exposure to the risk associated with volatile farming tokens. Furthermore, the yield itself is also paid back in the f-wrapped form of the currency that you deposited, meaning that your rewards are also shielded from exposure to farming tokens that are liable to dump at any moment. 

**3. Smart Contract Risk**

There is, of course, always a risk that the smart contracts underlying the protocol could be hacked or fail in some other way. There is simply no denying that this possibility exists *for any defi protocol*, and every investor needs to make a careful judgement about this before investing. The feg project has now been live for almost 6 months, the exchange has been live for around 3 months, and a new version of the exchange has just been launched. The f-wrapping feature itself has been around for roughly 2 months, and I’ve used it extensively in that time, encountering exactly zero problems or indications of technical issues. More generally, the feg developers have proven themselves to be highly trustworthy and competent, and have delivered a lot of serious and high quality technical innovation so far this year. The feg token itself was previously audited by Solidity finance (for what that’s worth), and I believe further audits are in the pipeline right now. More generally, I feel as safe putting my money here as I do anywhere in the defi world outside of maybe Aave and Curve.

Now that I’ve broken down why I think f-wrapping is in many ways safer than many existing yield farming protocols, let me explain why I think it’s also more lucrative. 

**Yield**

Here are the main things to note regarding the profitability of f-wrapping. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Yield Dynamics**

The first thing to note is that f-wrapping produces yield in a manner that is quite unlike most existing protocols. For instance, in liquidity provision protocols, the farms normally have a fixed number of rewards that are paid out at regular intervals to the investors in the pool. This means that the yield decreases monotonically as the amount of capital invested in the pool increases. This is not the case with f-wrapping. When the pool is small, you effectively have a big slice of a smaller pie — because the pool is small, there aren’t many fees to profit from, but you get a bigger share of those fees since there aren’t many people to share it with. When the pool is large, you get a smaller slice of a bigger pie — more people coming into the pool means more fees to profit from, but there are now more people to share those rewards with. But even so, it’s clear from my experience so far that as the number of people wrapping and unwrapping increases, rewards do tend to increase (the opposite to LP based farms, where rewards get diluted as pools fill up). 

**2. APY’s**

It is basically impossible to estimate long term apy’s for f-wraps in a reliable way given our information so far. Because the yield doesn’t stem from a fixed reward pot shared amongst farmers, but rather from the fees generated by people entering and leaving the pool, the yield will fluctuate radically based on how many people are wrapping and unwrapping from day to day. However, to give you a taste for how impressive the APY’s have been so far, most of the estimates I’ve seen so far project an average APY of roughly 200% for fBNB and 120% for fETH. These are almost certainly the highest APY’s of any f-wraps at the moment, since they are both paired with the feg token on fegex, meaning that people need to wrap/unwrap ETH/BNB whenever they buy/sell feg on fegex, thereby generating a lot of fees. Now that the new version of fegex has launched, you can expect many new pairs to launch with different f-wraps, which should massively increase the apy for other tokens. For instance, there is now an fusdt/feg pair on the Binance side of fegex, and the apy for fusdt has already rocketed in response. 

**3. Auto Compounding**

One of the major benefits of f-wrapping is that rewards automatically compound continuously. Your rewards are paid in the same f-wrapped currency that you hold, and are automatically added to your position in real time, meaning that the interest you earn compounds continuously as your rewards accrue. As people that yield farm erc-20 tokens know, gas fees often make it impossible to economically compound yield farming rewards frequently in an efficient manner. f-wrapping allows you to avoid this obstacle since yields auto compound without you needing to do any costly transactions. Note also that since the auto compounding aspect is built into the protocol, you don’t need to take on additional smart contract risk by using third party compounders like Yearn/Autofarm etc. 

**Conclusion**

Overall, regardless of what you think about the feg token or fegex as a decentralized exchange, f-wrapping represents a yield farming protocol that (i) mitigates or completely avoids many of the largest risks associated with most popular competitors, (ii) offers exceptional risk to reward ratios that look likely to improve exponentially as fegex matures and attracts more capitol and volume, (iii) provides an innovative new kind of auto compounding that turbo charges yields and minimizes smart contract risk, and (iv) allows you to profitably yield farm with pretty much any major crypto currency, all on a single platform.

**An Introduction to F-Wrapping**

**(Safe and Lucrative Yield Farming on Fegex)**

**Safety**

Firstly, I should address safety, which is always a major concern in the world of yield farming. Clearly, there are many kinds of risk to take into account when dealing with yield farms. I’ll address a few of the most prominent ones here. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Impermanent Loss**

A lot of yield farming works via providing liquidity pairs to exchanges in order to generate yield. This carries an intrinsic risk of impermanent loss, which can seriously affect the value of your investment if one of your assets significantly underperforms in relation to the other. f-wrapping, which only ever involves one asset at a time, carries *no risk of impermanent loss*. 

**2. Farming with unstable and risky currencies**

A lot of yield farming platforms encourage and incentive you to farm with their native tokens, and generally also pay out yields denominated in those tokens (as opposed to paying out in whichever tokens you deposited). This exposes you to the risk associated with the token of the relevant platform. For instance, people farming on Iron Finance were exposed to the intrinsic risk of the Titan token. When that token’s value plummeted, so did the value of the Iron \`stable’ coin, which was partially collateralized by Titan, and many people lost of lot of money, either through participating in pools involving Iron/Titan, or through holding their rewards in Titan. With f-wrapping, you are not exposed in any way to the risk of fegex’s native currency, the feg token. The value and yield of your f-wraps is entirely independent of the price of feg. All f-wraps are fully collateralized by whichever currency you deposited, and you can always exchange your fETH/fBNB/fUSDC etc for ETH/BNB/USDC at a 1:1 ratio, minus the 1% tax. So if you deposit a stable coin like USDC, you will always know exactly how much of it you hold, and you will always be certain that you can unwrap it for that amount, without any exposure to the risk associated with volatile farming tokens. Furthermore, the yield itself is also paid back in the f-wrapped form of the currency that you deposited, meaning that your rewards are also shielded from exposure to farming tokens that are liable to dump at any moment. 

**3. Smart Contract Risk**

There is, of course, always a risk that the smart contracts underlying the protocol could be hacked or fail in some other way. There is simply no denying that this possibility exists *for any defi protocol*, and every investor needs to make a careful judgement about this before investing. The feg project has now been live for almost 6 months, the exchange has been live for around 3 months, and a new version of the exchange has just been launched. The f-wrapping feature itself has been around for roughly 2 months, and I’ve used it extensively in that time, encountering exactly zero problems or indications of technical issues. More generally, the feg developers have proven themselves to be highly trustworthy and competent, and have delivered a lot of serious and high quality technical innovation so far this year. The feg token itself was previously audited by Solidity finance (for what that’s worth), and I believe further audits are in the pipeline right now. More generally, I feel as safe putting my money here as I do anywhere in the defi world outside of maybe Aave and Curve.

Now that I’ve broken down why I think f-wrapping is in many ways safer than many existing yield farming protocols, let me explain why I think it’s also more lucrative. 

**Yield**

Here are the main things to note regarding the profitability of f-wrapping. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Yield Dynamics**

The first thing to note is that f-wrapping produces yield in a manner that is quite unlike most existing protocols. For instance, in liquidity provision protocols, the farms normally have a fixed number of rewards that are paid out at regular intervals to the investors in the pool. This means that the yield decreases monotonically as the amount of capital invested in the pool increases. This is not the case with f-wrapping. When the pool is small, you effectively have a big slice of a smaller pie — because the pool is small, there aren’t many fees to profit from, but you get a bigger share of those fees since there aren’t many people to share it with. When the pool is large, you get a smaller slice of a bigger pie — more people coming into the pool means more fees to profit from, but there are now more people to share those rewards with. But even so, it’s clear from my experience so far that as the number of people wrapping and unwrapping increases, rewards do tend to increase (the opposite to LP based farms, where rewards get diluted as pools fill up). 

**2. APY’s**

It is basically impossible to estimate long term apy’s for f-wraps in a reliable way given our information so far. Because the yield doesn’t stem from a fixed reward pot shared amongst farmers, but rather from the fees generated by people entering and leaving the pool, the yield will fluctuate radically based on how many people are wrapping and unwrapping from day to day. However, to give you a taste for how impressive the APY’s have been so far, most of the estimates I’ve seen so far project an average APY of roughly 200% for fBNB and 120% for fETH. These are almost certainly the highest APY’s of any f-wraps at the moment, since they are both paired with the feg token on fegex, meaning that people need to wrap/unwrap ETH/BNB whenever they buy/sell feg on fegex, thereby generating a lot of fees. Now that the new version of fegex has launched, you can expect many new pairs to launch with different f-wraps, which should massively increase the apy for other tokens. For instance, there is now an fusdt/feg pair on the Binance side of fegex, and the apy for fusdt has already rocketed in response. 

**3. Auto Compounding**

One of the major benefits of f-wrapping is that rewards automatically compound continuously. Your rewards are paid in the same f-wrapped currency that you hold, and are automatically added to your position in real time, meaning that the interest you earn compounds continuously as your rewards accrue. As people that yield farm erc-20 tokens know, gas fees often make it impossible to economically compound yield farming rewards frequently in an efficient manner. f-wrapping allows you to avoid this obstacle since yields auto compound without you needing to do any costly transactions. Note also that since the auto compounding aspect is built into the protocol, you don’t need to take on additional smart contract risk by using third party compounders like Yearn/Autofarm etc. 

**Conclusion**

Overall, regardless of what you think about the feg token or fegex as a decentralized exchange, f-wrapping represents a yield farming protocol that (i) mitigates or completely avoids many of the largest risks associated with most popular competitors, (ii) offers exceptional risk to reward ratios that look likely to improve exponentially as fegex matures and attracts more capitol and volume, (iii) provides an innovative new kind of auto compounding that turbo charges yields and minimizes smart contract risk, and (iv) allows you to profitably yield farm with pretty much any major crypto currency, all on a single platform.

After years of learning and digging into interoperability solutions, Ren, Cosmos with IBC, Wanchain, Aion, ICON, Fusion, DOT (in the future), Dragonchain, Quant, Waves with gravity protocol which is more like an oracle interoperability solution, Rune, etc. I've finally understood that each solution had some trade-off, some are more idealistic than others but at the end of the day, experience told me that it doesn't matter if you have the ""best solution"" or not, you just need people to use it/adoption and be good enough to be at least a winner for a few years. The same logic goes with Bitcoin and Ethereum, they are not the best solutions but they are the ones with the highest network effect and wealth consensus thus any new token/coin will likely struggle to outperform them in the long run.

After all this time, I've concluded that Ren protocol had the highest chance to become the Interoperability standard of the crypto space. I also see Ren being able to reach the top 10 on Coin market cap because of the tokenomics if of course, it becomes the standard. Not only the supply is fixed and already released, but more importantly the dark nodes let you earn fees (in hard money like BTC, ETH, and others, not in some worthless governance token..) for every transaction processed on all networks that use the protocol, think of it like if you were running a virtual ASIC to mine BTC, ETH, and other coins or if you were owning a few % of a crypto exchange. Imagine if REN becomes the interoperability standard and processes trillions of dollars in volume. While we have many chains, in the end, they will all come together under one network and we will have the Internet of Money, and Ren might likely become the protocol to merge the whole thing together. Every DeFi project on every chain will have to leverage it, like Avalanche, Solana, ADA, Binance smart-chain, Tron, Ethereum, Polygon, Yearn Finance, Curve, all the Dexes, you name it.

This is why Ren is currently my favorite altcoin"
I started in 2016 and now employ 60+ people and make $500k. My business is worth $4-5 million. Here's what I've learned.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/oc3i0y/i_started_in_2016_and_now_employ_60_people_and/,coloradozack,1,2021-07-02 13:20:51,371,/r/Entrepreneur/comments/oc3i0y/i_started_in_2016_and_now_employ_60_people_and/,NaN,"I started a service-based company in 2016, and my startup costs were around $3,500.  I was employee number one, delivering the service directly to our customers while also writing code, designing logos, doing the books, etc.  Now, I employ over sixty (maybe 70, actually) part-time employees and a few full-timers.  My personal income will be about $500k this year, and my business is valued at around $4-5 million based on standard industry multipliers.  I have learned a thing or two in the last few years -- but all that really means is the mistakes I make now are mostly new mistakes.  

I'm going to give you a few things that I think I have learned, but you should keep in mind that much of this is business-model specific.  What works for a service-based company that delivers an in-person service is very different than what will work for a venture-backed tech startup.  I know nothing about that world, and I won't pretend to.  I do know how to sell other people's labor in a way that will make a ton of money, scale quickly and pay them well for their work -- and get them to stick around long-term.

A bit about me: Mid-30's, degrees in finance, marketing and philosophy, long-term career history of being a terrible employee who was lazy and unmotivated.  I had very, very little career success prior to being an entrepreneur, and much like a felon on the lam, *I won't go back to that place, man.*  I did work in this industry before I started my business, and I came into this with some solid design and web development skills.  

This is the internet in 2021, so let's do a numbered list:

1. You should be able to start a service business on a shoestring (in most cases).  People think they need $100k to start a business.  Most of the time, you don't.  I was in a Q&amp;A with Michael Dell (in college, not because I'm a baller) once, and someone asked him what to do if they couldn't get enough funding for the business they wanted to start.  His response: Find a way to start with less money.  I needed about $3,500, but I was also married to a nurse.  We didn't need my income.  But $3,500 is scratch that most of us can come up with.
2. Try to learn the industry on a future competitor's dollar.  Work in the industry first!  I did 80% of what I do now for a company that we now compete against.  Granted, I made way less money working for them than I do now, but the lessons I learned made it much, much easier to start my own thing.  You have to watch out for non-compete agreements, though.  But working in a related job first will make your learning curve so much flatter.
3. There has never been a better time in history to start a business.  I genuinely believe this.  A bunch of losers will tell you that corporate America is colluding to sabotage the little guy, and whether that is true or not doesn't really matter; what matters is that all sorts of business things that used to be expensive are now cheap.  You can have ten phone numbers ring to your phone for an extra $50 per month with Grasshopper.  You can compete against the biggest local companies there are in the most important marketing channel there is (Google) with just a little know-how.  You can have things custom-made in China to your specs (hopefully) and sold online without ever needing to buy a manufacturing facility or know about six sigma.  The age of the entrepreneur is now.  
4. Too many people are trying to start the next Facebook/Netflix/Google/insert pipe dream here.  You may as well try to be the first man to walk on Mars or be the next Lebron James.  Would you rather have a 40% chance at being worth $10 million or a .01% chance at being worth $200 million?  Venture-backed tech startups are great when they succeed, but the odds of success are low.  And you may not be able to hang onto enough equity in the process to really make it as big as you think you will.  Stop trying to be the first to do something and instead focus on delivering an existing service better than the next guy.  Which leads me to...
5. More people should be starting local-oriented, ""regular"" businesses and winning via operational excellence and superior marketing.  There are so many industries out there that are ripe for the picking.  Most local businesses are run terribly, and just because you are solving a local problem doesn't mean you can't scale.  Become a good enough plumber that you can hire other plumbers.  You probably can't make it to a ten man shop before you're a millionaire.  Start a commercial cleaning service.  Start a staffing agency.  Whatever industry you choose, chances are that the local person doing it right now sucks at the things you need to be good at.  Do they have a strong digital presence?  Do they answer the phone?  Probably not.  If they do, they're probably the only one near you who does.
6. Answer the damn phone.  I really believe half of success in a small business starts with answering the phone.  I am constantly blown away by how frequently I call a local service business and no one answers.  If I leave a message, I get a call back maybe 50% of the time, and it's probably a day later.  Your competitors are setting a low bar.  
7. Digital marketing *is* marketing.  Your first, and most realistic, goal is to get into the top three Google map results at the top of the search engine results page for your main local keywords.  ""plumber in Cheboygan"" should show a map at the top with you and your five star reviews.  It's not that difficult to do this in most industries in most cities.  But that's your first goal.  If you're doing that, there's a good chance you're near the top of the organic page results, too.  Learning about SEO and spending time doing quality blogging will pay dividends for you long-term.
8. I really can't emphasize enough how badly most local businesses are run.  This is opportunity for you.  I can boil down half of my marketing degree to ""Be customer-oriented.""  Think about how your potential customers see your business as they are going through their shopping process.  What are their objections?  What are their fears?  What kind of interactions do they want to have with you while shopping, and what can you do to overcome their objections and fears?  How are they perceiving your business after they have chosen you, and what can you do to meet their expectations?  Assuming all went well, how can you use them to generate further business?  95% of small business owners haven't thought about any of this stuff a single time.  Run your local shop like you are the CEO of Coca Cola.  Hold yourself to a very high standard and make 99.99% of your customers happy with their decision to go with you.  This is operational excellence.  If you can do that, and you can figure out marketing, you will be successful.
9. Learn what to delegate or hire out.  When I first started, my task list was massively long.  But I also wasted a lot of time doing things I shouldn't have been doing.  One of them was off-page SEO.  I eventually hired it out to an Indian agency I found on Upwork, and they did good work for us for three years.  It saved me tons of time, and they got the results I wanted much quicker.  For anything that is revenue-generating (like marketing), time really is money.  The longer it takes to get to a certain level of sales, the more revenue you've lost.  That agency is no longer what we need to go from being a strong regional player to beating the best national competitors, but they were exactly what we needed (and could afford) to start winning business on the local level.
10. You are going to have to learn some things by doing them and messing up and trying something else.  One of my big fears initially was how to balance marketing in a new city with hiring staff in that market.  If we made sales but had no one hired and trained, we couldn't deliver the service.  If we hired staff but had no sales, we would be paying for staff who had nothing to do.  I've gotten much better at that balancing act, but I also just realized it wasn't that big of a deal if we made a sale but couldn't deliver the product.  One call to the customer and a quick ""I'm really sorry, but we don't have the capacity for this right now.  We're issuing you a full refund, and I wish you the best"" gets it done every time.  Something I fretted about many times turned out to be nothing.  You should plan and prepare, but you can't foresee everything.
11. Stop trying to find a partner because you're too timid/scared/lazy to do a business on your own.  There are times when a partner is the answer, but too many entrepreneurs want a buddy to build something with.  But all that does is split your profits and give you a complex relationship to manage while trying to build something.  Don't get a partner unless it is unavoidable.
12. Try to find a business model that ties the bulk of your expenses directly to your revenue.  Hiring a full-time employee who makes $50k per year regardless of their workload is to be avoided if possible.  There are times you will have to do this, but a better model when starting out is to hire part-time employees and pay them either per project (if your pricing is project-based) or per hour (if your pricing is hourly).  In doing so, you know exactly what your gross margin looks like, and if you run a tight ship otherwise, your net margin isn't far off.  

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions and answers to finish it off:

***Why don't you sell?  Will you sell?***

Hell yes, I'll sell.  But it's tough to sell a business that is ""only"" worth $4-5 million.  Plus, we are still seeing 200% annual growth.  I anticipate selling for $20 million or so in 2-3 years.  I probably get a call from a private equity guy once a month right now, so I have no shortage of contacts when that time comes.  One thing I have realized, though: By the time this is at the right size to sell, I won't need the money.  I'm already pretty much at that point.  I'm a frugal guy by nature, and while I have a family, $500k is way more money than we can spend.  So the question I have to answer in the next couple of years is what I want to be doing with my time.  I may not be able to replace this job with something equally interesting, so I might decide to not sell.

&amp;#x200B;

***How many hours do you work?***

Fifteen or so per week.  No, I'm not blowing smoke.  In the early days, I probably worked more like thirty.  I had weeks here and there that were more like fifty or so, but I've never averaged forty.  To be honest, I'm not sure what most people spend so much time doing.

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the biggest mistake you have made in your business?***

I haven't done anything that I would call a terrible mistake, but I was probably a bit late in getting out of delivering the service myself and moving completely into focusing on sales and growing the business.  Phone sales are the heart of my business, and you can't take phone calls when you are out delivering the service.  

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the biggest little thing you've done?***

I hit the jackpot when I bought an expired domain that had previously belonged to a competitor of ours in a key market.  That $150 expense took us to an entirely new level, at least at the time, and I personally made tens of thousands of dollars off of that decision.  I'm not suggesting you focus on expired domains as a key part of your digital strategy; I got lucky that a direct competitor with a good digital presence in a key city for us went under, and I got their domain for cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

***What are the most important practical, daily skills for an entrepreneur?***

Personally, I couldn't imagine not having design skills or web development skills.  If I had to call a designer everytime I wanted to make a change, I'd either be broke or our marketing would look terrible.  I had been dabbling in web design since 1998 (yes, I was 14 and was terrible), so while I wasn't a professional, I was proficient.  I am a design-oriented person by nature and interest, so this stuff is a big deal to me.  I also think it makes us stand out.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it!  Best of luck.  I'll answer any questions you guys have."

Part 2

# How to Unbank Oneself

I'm not offering financial advice, and I'm not suggesting that anyone go and become their own bank this instant.

The concept of being your own bank (known as unbanking) can mean so many different things, and may differ depending on the type of financial freedoms and opportunities you have available. But simply, unbanking is the de-centralizing and de-institutionalizing of finance. For people escaping war-torn countries as political refugees, the ability to carry wealth in 12 words - instead of contraband cash, traceable digital accounts, or heavy gold - means freedom. These people may not have enough capital for upper-class living - but they can take it with them through world conflicts and systematic oppression, through the power of unbanking.

For others, unbanking oneself may be as simple as pulling local funds out of a Crypto ATM while on an international trip. Or simply purchasing an item with a crypto-to-fiat settlement card. No need for international transfers, no visiting currency exchanges, no guesstimating value-exchanges while shopping... **because 1 SFM = 1 SFM worldwide.**

With many crypto and various platforms, you have the ability to offer your holdings as collateral for a crypto loan or cash loan. Usually you must provide an established crypto such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, but many sites also allow more unique collateral opportunities. This allows a person to pull liquid from their investment while maintaining their investment position - for example:

**If I use $2000 of Bitcoin as collateral for my $1000 loan, and Bitcoin goes to 10x its value, I can pay back $1000 plus 7% to receive my (now) $20,000 of Bitcoin back.  I can spend my wealth WHILE it grows!**

&amp;#x200B;

# Unbanking is Big Business

The epitome of unbanking oneself, however, is the ability to generate passive income such as banks do by collecting interest on loans. Loans that were funded by the money others had elected to save! The savings accounts accounts and CDs have low interest rates, and this money is then loaned at 10-28% to car buyers and debt consolidators! The banks passively profit off the redistribution of money. The banks in crypto have this ability too, and you are the bank.

If the idea of maintaining an investment position while using that position for a loan wasn't attractive enough - people offset their loan interest rates by lending out their crypto just like regular banks lend cash to people. Your crypto can be lent to liquidity to facilitate other people's transactions and earn interest rewards by doing so; another portion of your crypto can be used as collateral for a loan. It's even possible to still be passively profitable while your loan is out!

**Some riskier players may take out a loan and reinvest in another crypto hoping for crazy gains on money they loaned to themselves, and can pay it back with their own passive income!**

# What's Special about SafeMoon and Unbanking?

A token like SafeMoon is beautiful in that it already returns a generous rate of interest because of the token reflections users hold. The supply burn in addition inflects the supply/demand curve, theoretically increasing rate of return in terms of value. Congratulations! As a holder of SafeMoon, you're fully unbanked. A SafeMoon investment reduces supply and contributes a permanent stake in the liquidity, while receiving reflections. This is the lending/borrowing profit model occurring simultaneously as a perpteual passive process.

As you continue to contribute to your investment and the evaluation grows, you will begin to be able to take reflections as income, with your wealth replacing itself so long as you spend slower than your reflections come in. You don't need to stake, or lend, or borrow. These actions are taken care of with Tokenomics and your wealth becomes a fluid mixture of earning as reflections come in and loaning as you spend."

This plant brings in interns every summer, all of which are engineers, until last year when they started the finance internship under the new controller. I am the 2nd intern they've ever had, the first of which is now working there full time.

The perfect storm as been created to give me the position I'm currently in, let me explain. 4 months ago they had to switch accounting backends to match corporate, which comes with a massive learning curve for the entire finance team, understandably so. At the same time the Accounting Supervisor who interviewed me resigned for a higher paying position at another company so the team of 3 accountants has really been leaderless in a completely new system until about 2 weeks ago when one of them was promoted to interim supervisor. We do a monthly close which is a highly stressful time in the office which is next week.

I am often left with absolutely nothing to do as an intern. I don't have access to the accounting backend software so I can't really dig into accounts and be helpful, and from all signs I'm not ever getting it. They give me a menial task I complete in about 20 minutes at most every couple days (things like make a picot table with 1 filter from this data) and every day I do my best to show I'm excited to be there and show I'm willing to work (""Hey do you have anything I can help with, What's the gameplan for me today"" etc.) and more often than not the answer is nothing, literally to the point yesterday where I was flat out told to go kill clock. 

I've been flat out told by the supervisor that last year they had big meetings to discuss what they wanted the first intern to do and had all these project for her and that this year they were asked if they wanted another intern, said why not, and pretty much left it at that due to all the drama about losing their supervisor and switching systems.

This company values safety and every intern engineer or not has to do their own safety project. I shared my idea with the controller, he liked it, and at the same time mentioned he'd like the safewalk in the parking lot repainted because it's extremely faded, being the best intern I can, trying to overperform, said yes I'm going to need paint for my project so I could get that done for you. I mention it to the safety officer and this week he comes to me saying he'd like to do it with me this week so that's what I did the majority of the week, only to me it was a collaborative thing between me and the safety officer, not my project, so the controller thinking its my project sees the other guy out there painting and I was away for about 5 minutes getting my clothes because it was a rare day when I had a meeting and needed to not be hot and sweaty in a room with other admins in the office, I was going to take a shower. The controller finds me and goes ""why's he doing your safety project"" to which I say ""It's really not my safety project, my project is out in the shop"" he says ""well its part of it isn't it?"" and me trying to me nice and non argumentative just say ""well I guess kinda but I have that meeting I'm trying to get ready for"" and he proceeds to tell me to go do all the painting before the meeting because its his understanding its my project when I never intended for it to be. I go do the painting and end up coming into the meeting still hot and sweaty from being outside doing that.

My actual safety project is in limbo, last I was told they are custom making 5 signs for me, 2 of which I believe are done but my order for those has been in for weeks so who knows how much longer I'll have to wait.

The tone of the office is super laid back, I'm the only member of accounting who is punctual, even the supervisor shows up 5-15 mins late on the regular whereas I'm usually 7 minutes early and I've never been late once. Everyone in the office is extremely nice to me, tries to get to know me, I'm a social guy so I appreciate it. I just have nothing to do. I also have ADHD, which I had, up to now, believed I'd outgrown, but this amplifies my condition to levels I haven't noticed about myself since I was 6 or 7 years old. I sit there in my office hoping they'll bring me something to do and after a while I crack and go ask if they have anything for me, then when they don't I go  back to my office and wait. I even reach out to other departments to see if they could use help and every day I'm told no.

That brings us to yesterday, where I go turn in my time card to the engineer over all the interns in a separate building and she asks me if the supervisor and the controller had a meeting with me yet about me and things I can do to improve. This surprises me and I tell her no they haven't said a word to me. She then with a horribly negative tone tells me they talked about me with her yesterday and she's surprised they didn't say anything to me. Then tells me the meeting is essentially a midway performance review and they have some things they'd like to see me do better. She's so negative to the point where her officemate makes a comment about it, so she rephrases. The meeting is supposed to be constructive feedback and I need to think about thing I like that I've gotten from them and things I think they can do to improve when it comes to handling me, again her tone is pretty negative so I make a comment along the lines of that sounds pretty bad and she ends up telling me I should come out of the meeting with a neutral feeling. Bye have a nice weekend.

I just have a hard time believing I'm anywhere in the wrong in this situation. It's hard for me to believe an intern is supposed to sit in a room and collect a check, to me the job description of an intern is to overperform. I know I probably pester the shit out of the supervisor asking if there's anything I can help with but I cannot physically stand to sit and stare at a windows desktop all day. I try to be self managing with the project but I'm stuck in limbo and have been for weeks and I don't know what to do about any of this. I believe its become painfully obvious to the powers at be that they don't need me there anymore and its true I don't do anything really because I can't.

JP Morgan has quietly been developing a smart chain based repo market on their proprietary ETH based block chain. Goldman Sachs is new utilizing the chain as well with the overall Repo Market worth 2 Billion. Growing adoption of this use could result in a rapidly expanded ETH market cap to 20k/ETH,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/od5wr3/jp_morgan_has_quietly_been_developing_a_smart/,afirebrand,1,2021-07-04 04:39:34,7,/r/ethtrader/comments/od5wr3/jp_morgan_has_quietly_been_developing_a_smart/,News,"On 6/22/21, Bloomberg published a report that Goldman Sachs had began performing transactions on the JP Morgan private blockchain built upon the Ethereum network. This news was met with little fanfare and largely ignored by the crypto media at large due to China mining FUD. 

To understand the significance of this event, you need to understand some backstory. First, in 2020, JPM created a new business entity, known as Onyx, to house its blockchain and digital currency efforts. Onyx was created to facilitate round-the-clock cross-border payments and the creation of separate payment rails for central banks that have expressed interest in starting their own currencies. At present, Onyx is performing $1B worth of daily transactions on ETH. 

In a 2020 CNBC interview, JPM’s senior executive and Onyx CEO, Umar Farooq, noted that blockchain technology can be viewed from the perspective of the Gartner hype cycle, a model for the adoption of new technologies. Farooq noted: *“If you think about blockchain, we are either somewhere in the trough of disillusionment or just beyond that on the hype curve…That’s why at JPMorgan we’ve been relatively quiet about it until we were ready to scale it and commercialize it.”*

Following this rationale, in October 2020, JP Morgan performed the first commercial transaction with its eponymous token, the JPMCoin, with little fanfare. The JPMCoin is an ERC20 token build upon the Ethereum blockchain; it is JPMorgan’s internal representation of a digital dollar. 

In June 2021, we learned that JPM has recently been focusing their attention on the use of repurchase agreements that utilize smart contracts and a digitized version of the U.S. dollar. 

Bloomberg notes that JPMorgan created the new repo market using its version of the Ethereum blockchain, with its first trades in December. It has since gone on to trade more than $1 billion a day through its Onyx blockchain platform. The firm is speaking with more than 10 banking and investing clients about joining the repo network, according to spokeswoman Jessica Francisco. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. served as the custody agent for the trades.

The first Goldman Sachs trade was performed on June 17th 2021 when it swapped a tokenized version of a U.S. Treasury bond for JPMCoin, JPMorgan’s internal representation of a digital dollar, according to Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets for Goldman’s global markets division. He declined to give the value of the trade but did note that unlike in the traditional repo market, the exact amount of time the banks took to complete the transaction was quantifiable. In this case, it was 3 hours and 5 minutes. McDermott noted that knowing the precise time is a big step up from the current market, as is the way the collateral and cash are interchanged simultaneously and immediately. “We pay interest per the minute,” he said. “We firmly think this will change the nature of the intraday marketplace.”

**What is the Repo market?**

The repurchase agreement, or “repo,” market is an obscure but important part of the financial system that has drawn increasing attention lately. 

On average, $2 trillion to $4 trillion in repurchase agreements – collateralized short-term loans – are traded each day. 

**Types of Repo Transactions:**

A repurchase agreement (repo) is a short-term secured loan: one party sells securities to another and agrees to repurchase those securities later at a higher price. The securities serve as collateral. The difference between the securities’ initial price and their repurchase price is the interest paid on the loan, known as the repo rate.

A reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) is the mirror of a repo transaction. In a reverse repo, one party purchases securities and agrees to sell them back for a positive return at a later date, often as soon as the next day. Most repos are overnight, though they can be longer.

**The Case for a JPM Repo Market on Ethereum:**

Transactions in the $2.4 trillion repo market raise cash overnight or for a few days, but are difficult to arrange within the same trading day. The digitized upgrade provides that ability to JPMorgan, using so-called smart contracts on an Ethereum-based blockchain that allow cash and Treasuries to be returned instantaneously.

Blockchain technology allows rapid execution and settlement of these contracts in a 24/7 manner. The use of ETH is especially significant because it allows for transactions to be completed on a secure network, soon to be even more secure by virtue of the blockchain’s upgrade from proof of work to proof of stake. 

The use of side chains and rollups will permit Ethereum’s ability to scale rapidly over the coming year prior to the launch of sharding on Eth 2.0. Specifically, post EIP-1559, the network (including roll ups) will be able to double throughput by up to 2x for a limited amount of time, while gas prices stabilize. Interestingly, data shards also have a similar mechanism where the max data is 2x target. So, rollups will be able to do up to 170,000 TPS in bursts. Please refer to the ETH scalability roadmap for expected TPS throughout Ethereum’s upcoming network upgrades.

**Ethereum Market Cap as it expands to Bridge** 

The market cap of Ethereum is likely to explosively increase if JPM and other big banks continue to use ETH for execution and settlement of smart contracts related to the repo market. 

Given the many benefits of blockchain technology for this type of financial transaction, adoption in the market-space can widely be expected to be rapid. 

The repo market performs $2 trillion in daily transactions. Let’s assume that JPM and their ETH based chain manage to capture one half of the daily transaction volume in the repo market. That’s $1T in transaction volume traversing the ETH blockchain daily. 

For the uninformed, market capitalization is a metric used to understand the current market value of an asset. In the context of cryptocurrencies, crypto market capitalization refers to the present value of the cryptocurrency network. You can calculate the market capitalization of an individual cryptocurrency as well as the industry as a whole. 

Crypto market capitalization = supply of crypto assets in circulation x the value of an individual unit.

As of 7/3/21, the global *crypto market cap* is $1.43T. Ethereum’s current market cap is $259,608,967,080. According to the analytics website, DeFi Llama, the total locked value for defi across all blockchains is 108.5B as of 7/3/21. On the Ethereum blockchain, which holds a disproportionate amount of defi TVL compared to other chains, TVL is equivalent to 83.17B. 

As such, if ETH managed to capture one half of the global repo market volume, ETH TVL would theoretically increase to 1.83T. This represents a growth of 9x more than the present value of ETH. As such, a reasonable price for ETH would be $2329 (x9) = $20,961. 

**Conclusion:**

It is hard to be bearish about Ethereum when network growth in the defi space continues at an explosive rate with increasing TVL in institutional based smart contracts which can take advantage of Ethereum’s upcoming improvements in transactional speed and scalability. 

As noted, “…*at JPMorgan we’ve been relatively quiet about it until we were ready to scale it and commercialize it (sic blockchain technology).”*

JP Morgan has indeed been quietly growing their network use to scale. I expect that soon we will see more real world use cases announced as Ethereum helps to bridge the fiat banking system with the crypto-ecosystem. When the world wakes up and begins to realize that a blockchain based world is already here, and set to expand, many people in the traditional fiat banking system will be forced to face the fact that cryptocurrency is not an elaborate Ponzi scheme but is, in fact, the future of finance.

## Introduction

Act of exchange without trusted parties is a most basic primitive for decentralized finance on top of blockchains. Many types of contracts for that were introduced early: with partial filling, buyback guarantee and so on. What is good for traders in decentralized worlds, such contracts are usually composable. While swap order contracts allows for orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes), now popular AMM-based DEXes (where AMM stands for Automated Market Maker) are also possible on blockchains with advanced smart-contracts such as Ergo and Cardano. Interestingly, unlike other known blockchains, thanks to the eUTXO model, liquidity pool contracts for AMM-based DEXes can be combined with order contracts (for orderbook-based DEXes). This gives unique possibility to have shared liquidity among different types of exchanges on top of the Ergo and Cardano blockchains.

This documant provides a description of the Automated Decentralized Exchange protocol on top of Ergo and Cardano.

## Protocol architecture overview

### Order-book DEX

Orders are waiting for another orders to be matched, or for a cancellation. There're the following three types of orders — ""buy"" (i.e. buy tokens for native asset), ""sell"" (i.e. sell tokens for native asset), and ""swap"" (buy tokens for other tokens) orders. Order-book DEX has the advantage of working best for those pairs with high liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/z62xfxyiu4971.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a0a18fb544dde95bf692ed4b0e772ca75f904fd

#### Atomic limit orders

Atomic orders can only be executed completely and are otherwise refunded. Such orders can either be aggregated by the ErgoDEX client so that users can choose from them or matched in an order-book with partial orders which will be defined next.

#### Partial limit orders

Partial orders are something more familiar to those who've ever used classical CEX'es. These orders can be partially executed so the best way to work with them is an order-book, where they can be aggregated, matched and executed by ErgoDEX bots.

### AMM DEX

Unlike order-book based DEX which relies on an order-book to represent liquidity and determine prices AMM DEX uses an automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on rates and slippage. AMM DEX suits best for pairs with low liquidity.

Each AMM liquidity pool is a trading venue for a pair of assets. In order to facilitate trades a liquidity pool accepts deposits of underlying assets proportional to their price rates. Whenever deposit happens a proportional amount of unique tokens known as liquidity tokens is minted. Minted liquidity tokens are distributed among liquidity providers proportional to their deposits. Liquidity providers can later exchange their liquidity tokens share for a proportional amount of underlying reserves.

#### Constant Function Market Makers (CFMM, classical AMM pools)

Classical AMM pools are based on Constant Product formula which is x\*y=c  
, where x  
 and y  
 are deposits on tokens X and Y respectively and c  
 is their product which has to remain constant after swap operations. CFMMs provide liquidity across the entire price range.

https://preview.redd.it/4z5hmgalu4971.png?width=348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0392013e97aed1eb06fd9eaaf254a86f488f04bf

Concentrated AMM pools

While in CFMMs liquidity is uniformly distributed along the reserve curve, which is slightly inefficient as much of the reserves held in a pool are never used, Concentrated AMMs allow LPs to provide liquidity to smaller price ranges. Each pair is composed of smaller pools each corresponding to some price range. We call such pool a concentrated liquidity pool (CLP). A CLP only needs to maintain enough reserves to support trading within its range, and therefore can act like a constant product pool with larger reserves (we call these the virtual reserves) within that range. At the same time LPs are not bound to some particular CLP and price range and can provide liquidity to multiple adjacent CLPs therefore forming something what we call a position. While price of an asset is within a position's price range the position is earning protocol fees. When the price escapes the position's price range it's liquidity no longer earns fees as it's not active anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

## Tokenomics

In the ErgoDEX each actor is incentivized to fulfill his role as better as possible.

There are three types of economic agents in the ErgoDEX ecosystem:

* DEXes (Parties which run DEX bots and UI) - need to be incentivized in order to provide best services.
* Liquidity providers (LPs) - need to be incentivized in order to provide liquidity.
* Traders

Each type of agents benefits from using DEX in his own way:

* DEXes are earning fees from both OrderBook and AMM services
   * In AMM: fees are charged for every operation on a liquidity pool
      * An amount of native tokens defined by a user for deposit|redeem operations
      * An amount of native tokens defined by a user for each unit of quote asset exchanged
   * In OrderBook: fees are charged in native tokens for each unit of quote asset exchanged
* LPs benefit from protocol fees paid in tokens and accumulated in liquidity pools
* Traders benefit from DEX services they use

Convex Finance - Clear Value Investment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/odqdtm/convex_finance_clear_value_investment/,Jimmy_the_hand,1,2021-07-05 02:40:28,11,/r/defi/comments/odqdtm/convex_finance_clear_value_investment/,NaN,"My goal with investing right now into crypto is to invest into the clear innovators on the block chain providing value and I don't see many with as strong of a bull case as Convex.

Some interesting points I have found

* Convex is locking up a large amount of CRV into what is called veCRV or ""Vote locked CRV"".  This gives Convex Finance the ability to guide future Curve decisions via voting as well as reap benefits of Curves fees.  If you look at [Convex finances tokenomics](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics) you can see they have a max supply of 100m total Convex tokens.

* [Convex's Wallet](https://curve.fi/pools?see=0x989aeb4d175e16225e39e87d0d97a3360524ad80) has a total of 55.8m total Vote Locked CRV.

* With only 470 transactions in the last 24 hours on all trading pairs as seen by [dex.guru](https://dex.guru/token/0x4e3fbd56cd56c3e72c1403e103b45db9da5b9d2b-eth) this is a low volume low market cap token that could take off.  Some of the sell pressure on Convex can be attributed to farmers dumping the token.  Low liquidity (~7m USD) and low trading volume right now could mean wide swings but also allow people to invest at good entry points for long term positions.

* Convex's ""wrapped"" CRV (or cvxCRV) is trading essentially 1:1 for Curve's real CRV on sushiswap.  So you can buy Convex token directly, stake it with them then earn CRV, CVX and base veCRV rewards all in one go.  This appears to be really effective leverage into the Curve ecosystem.

I recently took a position in both Curve and Convex tokens.  This is not financial advice!  DYOR.  WAGMI?

What is everyone's thoughts?

Hedge funds have suffered billions in losses this year in a fierce stock market showdown with retail investors on internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter over the past six months. These battles have usually centered around stocks that the hedge funds attempted to short-sell, inviting the wrath of users on Reddit forums like WallStreetBets, mostly comprising young investors, who bought up stakes in these companies to drive up the share price, initiating a short squeeze and making handsome profits in the process.

Some of the firms involved in this saga include GameStop Corp. (NYSE: [GME](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/gamestop%20corp/1326380/)), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: [AMC](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amc%20entertainment%20holdings%20inc/1411579/)), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: [WISH](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/contextlogic%20inc/1822250/)), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: [CLOV](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/clover%20health%20investments%20corp%20de/1801170/)), among others. According to some media reports, hedge funds have suffered a total of $12 billion in losses in these short-selling schemes. Investment bank Goldman Sachs last year compiled an index of stocks that these retail investors favored. That index has doubled in value over the past few months.

In an analysis, released to clients earlier this month, the investment bank [highlighted](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-analysis-retail-investors-plowing-400-billion-into-stocks-2021-6) that the retail favorites index had beaten the overall market by three percentage points this month. The analysis also underlined that retail investor spending into equities was poised to rise to $400 billion this year, an increase of $50 billion from a previous estimate of $350 billion. Perhaps this is one reason why hedge funds have been actively monitoring the hype around certain companies on Reddit in order to better manage their risk profiles.

The battle, though, still looks to be far from over. According to Goldman Sachs, the retail investor boom in equities is just beginning. Hedge funds managers, like Andrew Left, who expected retail investors to jump ship and drive the price of shorted stocks down, have been left red-faced as the prices of these stocks — referred to as meme stocks — continues to soar higher. However, in addition to being active, these stocks have been some of the most volatile ones on the market, adding to the overall chaos in the market.

The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

With this context in mind, here is our list of the 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. These were ranked keeping in mind the overall losses, size of the hedge fund, and the market credence of the hedge fund manager. The hedge funds that suffered losses, either directly or indirectly, as a result of the short squeezes but did not shutter completely have also been included in this list.

**Biggest Hedge Fund Casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' Short Squeezes**

**10. Citron Capital**

Andrew Left, the editor of investment newsletter *Citron Research*, is one of the most famous short-sellers on the market. His hedge fund was one of the biggest losers in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) short squeeze. Citron is placed tenth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. Left took to video sharing website YouTube in January to [assure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4yPsmaDDQ) investors in Citron Capital that he had made a mistake in predicting that GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) stock would lower in price.

Left clarified that Citron had managed to cover the short positions on GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) at a 100% loss, learning important lessons in the process. However, Left, in the video, said that he expected the stock of the video game retailer to return back to normal levels within a short span of time. This prediction has not aged well, as the stock is still trading at a high price, despite pulling back from record highs registered in January.

**9.** [**Maverick Capital**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/maverick-capital/17/)

Maverick Capital is an investment firm run from Texas. It is placed ninth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The hedge fund is run by Lee Ainslie and manages over $10 billion in assets. Earlier this month, *Financial Times* [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/dcd86860-09ed-420e-a5cc-d6d281863c03) that Maverick Capital was keeping track of the hype around certain stocks on Reddit forums in order to protect itself from short squeezes, lending credence to earlier reports that the hedge fund had suffered losses in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga at the turn of the year.

Maverick Capital holds a large stake in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the ecommerce retailer based in Washington.

*I gave some details of how Amazon has progressed over these past 6.5 years in last year’s Q2 2020 letter, which partners can find here (LINK). The company has executed amazingly well over this tenure, with revenues up \~3.3x and since our initial purchase, and reported operating income up \~30x over that period.*  
*Generally, I believe there are three reasons to sell an investment: 1) we recognize our initial thesis is wrong (sell out as quick as possible), 2) we have a significantly higher returning opportunity to redeploy the capital into (sell-down to fund the new investment), or 3) the company is maturing and hitting the top part of it’s S-curve / business lifecycle, so the business has fewer places to reinvest its capital internally. As such, the future returns will likely be lower than the past. This investment thus becomes a “source of capital” in the future, as we fund earlier-stage investment opportunities...""

&gt;*“Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, energy storage solutions, and battery cells. The stock fell during the quarter as a result of general market dynamics and a potential production slowdown due to parts shortages. A refreshed S/X and China Model Y ramp could also have a negative impact on margins in early 2021. We anticipate strong growth and improved margins driven by new production capacity, manufacturing efficiencies, localization of its manufacturing and supply chain, and maturation of Tesla’s full self-driving technology.*

Candlestick Capital Management is a hedge fund headquartered in Connecticut. It is placed seventh on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The fund is run by Jack Woodruff and manages more than $4 billion in assets, according to latest filings. The fund was a big gainer in 2020, gaining a handsome 26% over the pandemic period, but suffered low to midteen percentage losses in the Reddit-backed short squeeze earlier this year, per a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/several-hedge-funds-stung-by-market-turmoil-11611842693) in business news publication *The Wall Street Journal*.

[Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-buy-these-2-financial-services-stocks-before-its-too-late-922927/) is what the fund said:

&gt;*“While consumers resumed much of their spending by summer, what and how they used their Visas and Mastercards changed. For obvious reasons, people shifted to contactless payments—one of the Covid-era changes we think is permanent—and replaced travel purchases with online shopping and food delivery. Consumers spent more on their debit cards and less on their credit cards; Visa and Mastercard make more per transaction on the latter. They also make more on cross-border transactions that come mostly from international travel, which ground to a halt early in the pandemic. Visa’s and Mastercard’s earnings per share fell by 7% and 16%, respectively, compared to their usual mid-teens growth. We’re not too worried, and we think they’ll catch up nicely in the post-vaccine world. Visa’s stock returned 17.1% and Mastercard’s 20.2%.”*

Point72 Asset Management is a Connecticut-based hedge fund. It is ranked sixth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The fund is managed by Steven Cohen and is one of the biggest in the US, managing more than $21 billion in assets at the end of March, according to latest filings. *The New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/27/business/us-economy-coronavirus/point72-gamestop) in February that the fund lost 15% during the GameStop Corp.

&gt;*“We have also fully exited our stake in Baidu, following their outstanding performance during the period and their lower relative upside potential compared to other investment alternatives, which we will discuss below.*  
*The Chinese technology platform company Baidu has also been held in the portfolios managed by Alejandro, Miguel and myself for several years. During this period, we have seen very high volatility in its share price, which we have taken advantage of to make significant rebalancing moves in our position (in fact, we even sold our entire position once, when we thought the stock’s upside potential was exhausted). After several years of instability, market sentiment turned very positive, putting an end to the historical advertising problems in the healthcare sector, the divestments in O2O (Online-to-Offline) businesses that continued to weigh on the company’s margins, the IPO of part of the iQiyi streaming business (which hid Baidu’s underlying cash generation capacity) and the tough competition from other industry giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, as well as the entry of new players with disruptive business models (ByteDance). At the same time, the company’s recent commitment to electric vehicles contributed even more to this change of narrative. Baidu’s share price rose almost fourfold from the March 2020 lows to all-time highs and reached a valuation where the margin of safety, in our view, was too narrow.”*

It continues to experience business momentum through several dominant, essential, and competitively advantaged businesses, like Office 365 and Azure. The markets it competes for are enormous, which gives the company the ability to compound at scale. In the past quarter alone, the company generated over $40 billion in revenue, representing a 17% growth rate. The inherent operating leverage in Microsoft’s business model continues and led to 34% earnings growth this past quarter. Despite the broad rotation we saw in the first quarter and Microsoft’s robust performance in 2020, we think its business fundamentals continue to exhibit strength, and the stock continues to reflect the fundamentals.”

When we bought Disney three years ago, we wrote that “we view Disney theme parks in the US, Europe, and China as resistant to online substitution.” We did not reckon on a pandemic, which closed all of them, and sent all of usto our couches. Disney, however, wasready for us, brilliantly illustrating the importance of management foresight and change management. Or, as Louis Pasteur said, “chance favors the prepared mind.  
A century after its founding in 1923, Disney is in the middle of a bold shift from its legacy media networks &amp; entertainment model—with cable TV, theme parks, and theater films dominating its earnings—to a direct-to-consumer streaming media model. The keys to Disney’s transition: matchless storytelling, coupled with financial strength. The company reliably creates content that people all over the world are eager to consume. It also hastened spending on original content to attract subscribers to its new streaming platform. These factors have allowed Disney to weather the pandemic having expanded its direct engagement with customers. Such connections yield a rich harvest of insights used to customize offerings on a mass scale, reinforcing that engagement in a virtuous circle and thereby raising the lifetime value of each customer. Subscribers to Disney+ reached 86.8 million one year after launch, compared to the 60 – 90 million management projected to reach in 2024. To be sure, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon remain formidable competitors in new-era streaming entertainment (mind what we said about everyone standing up at once), but there’s fight left in this old dog.” "

#  Understanding Flashloans

When looking to understand **Flashloans** we must first look at traditional loans, understand how these work, their limitations and then we can start looking at what Flashloans are and how they come to fill a missing gap in the lightning fast DeFi space.

In order to fully grasp the concept, we have to understand that Flashloans are an adaptation of an existing traditional product, but greater enhanced with the help of blockchain technology.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wytwmt9y7g971.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b13024196fefc0102ad58ba97ccde2ece0ba6589

In this article we will explain the way Elrond’s **Secure Proof of Stake** mechanism works, its economics and also the whole process the user has to go through when Staking on Elrond Network. In order to explain all these in a clear way, we need to start from explaining the whole process of a transaction from the moment when it is signed until it is included in the blockchain. 

# Loans in the traditional sense

We all know what loans are in the broad sense, borrowing money to acquire/fund things is not something very complex. But the underlying processes and conditions that make loans possible are often overlooked.

There are 3 main components behind the lending system we see today:

 

1. **Credit scores**
2. **Collateral**
3. **Interest rates**

When we take out loans from an institution, like a bank, we often get our **credit score** checked, which means that the institutions checks our **financial history** in order to asses how good are we at managing our money and what will be an acceptable level of debt that we can pay back in monthly installments, without putting too much financial strain on us. 

Now given an individual **credit score**, some institutions or even individuals, can ask for a certain **collateral** to be deposited before any loans are given. This means that a person has to deposit upfront an amount of money, that can be counted towards the repayment of the loan or can be given back when the loan is fully repaid. This is a safety feature that is used by the lenders to ensure that they aren’t fully exposed to the risk of giving out large sums and such borrowers, given their credit score, have to put a % of the total sum borrowed as guarantee for repayment.

Financing loans is not an easy endeavor and requires a large capital pool, meaning that the institutions or persons who are lending money, they themselves have that capital beforehand and most of the times they want to gain from lending such big sums. As such borrowers are subjected to **interest rates** which in essence are fees for the money they borrowed, as paying for the service that the lenders offer. These rates are usually regulated and they can’t fluctuate that much, but they do exist and will add to the total sum that needs to be repaid.

# Limitation of traditional loans

 Traditionally loans are mostly collateralized, meaning that there is always a requirement for locking in capital or assets upfront as collateral for the loan. This means that for a lot of people accessing loans to finance things is still a costly endeavor and when we factor the interest rate in, it becomes even greater.

Enter **uncollateralized loans** as a solution to the above deposit requirement and enable an easier access to capital. But this often comes at a great risk for the lender and in practice that risk is taken only when there is a big premium to gain from. Lenders that offer uncollateralized loans do so with hefty interest rates on top, which in the end put a similar strain on the borrower. The only instance where a lender agrees to offer this type of loan and not take a big premium is when the reputation of the borrower supersedes the risk, but these cases are rare.

When lending and borrowing was introduced into the blockchain world, it came with certain challenges. Given the decentralized and anonymous world of DeFi, people can’t be checked for credit scores, which increase the risk of the lenders. As such the burden of the credit score was transferred on the collateral side, meaning that most protocols require the borrowers to deposit over 100% of the loan value as collateral. This model is what kept lending protocols safe and financially healthy, but as we saw above it is a huge strain for the average user.

# Flashloans

 

[ Flashloan example \(Aave.com\) ](https://preview.redd.it/7ngv5qpv9g971.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0c063c274ab1fbcf59b002de6c3602125b50013)

 

With the advent of smart contracts and lending protocols loans didn’t need to be intermediated by any middlemen, opening the avenue for additional use-cases and to a much larger user base as a alternative to the traditional banking sector.

As we have spoken about how loans work and how the staple overcollateralized loans work in DeFi, requiring huge amounts of capital upfront, we introduce the Flashloan concept that was created to address the problems with undercollateralized loan’s security and the overcollateralized loan’s high capital requirements.

**Flashloans** are a certain niche of undercollateralized loans that work by providing anyone the ability to borrow instantly and easily, with no collateral required, but with the condition that the loan is repaid within the same transaction block that it was taken on.

Now you might ask how are these loans useful if you need to repay them seconds later in the same block. As we can see in Flashloan example picture above, they are meant for developers to use, so that they can move large capital around efficiently, close any market discrepancies in the form of arbitrages or even a **dark usage**, exploit smart contract and economic vulnerabilities of various DeFi protocols.

#  Hacks due to Flashloans and protection against

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ycxix7obg971.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15baf8083bf97ba4a9f5a784c2db5f320573676c

 

Recent events have shown that Flashloans are a very powerful tool that can do both good and bad. There are a multitude of examples on how Flashloans have been used for various exploits to extract a lot of capital from multiple protocols. At the time of writing the DeFi industry has experienced almost $300 Million in assets lost due to Flashloan attacks.

One of the **first Flashloans** attacks that occurred was on **Fulcrum** (built on the bZx protocol) in which the attacker took an ETH flashloan on dYdX, splitting the sum by depositing on **Compound and on Fulcrum**.

*  **On Fulcrum** the attacker took a short position on ETH versus wrapped BTC (WBTC), which resulted in Fulcrum requiring to buy WBTC to cover the other side of the position. It did so by utilizing Kyber protocol to fill a WBTC buy order on Uniswap. But the attacker knew that Uniswap had low liquidity for WBTC, it’s price rose significantly, meaning that Fulcrum acquired the WBTC with a big premium.
*  **On Compound**, at the same time as the Fulcrum short position was taken, the attacker took a loan of WBTC using the rest of the ETH obtained from the dYdX flashloan. As the price pumped due to Fulcrum buying WTBC, the attacker sold the borrowed WBTC on Uniswap for ETH and made a hefty profit out of it, after repaying the ETH initially loaned from dYdX, pocketing the difference.

Not even the biggest and most respected protocols escaped such attacks that resulted from Flashloans, with **Yearn**, a popular DeFi aggregator suffering $11 Million in losses from an exploit of their smart contracts. 

*  The attacker started with an ETH stablecoin Flashloan from dYdX and Aave, which was used to borrow DAI and USDC from Compound, which in turn was deposited into the Yearn V1 vault product. That product deposits users funds into Curve (Stablecoin AMM Exchange) on the “3pool” product that contained 3 stablecoins (DAI, USDT and USDC). The Yearn V1 vault was relying on the DAI price given by the “3pool” product and as such the attacker was able to exploit that weakness.
*  The attack goes as follows, depositing the borrowed DAI in the V1 Vault and USDT in the “3pool”, then withdrawing the DAI from the vault and the USDT from the “3pool”. This caused the prices of DAI and USDC to be lowered while the price of USDT to increase and as such allow the attacker to drain the Yearn V1 vault of funds.

# How can we protect against Flashloans ?

 That is one of the million dollar question of today’s DeFi industry and a very tough one to crack. **Flashloans** are in general **not the main problem**, as they are a big innovation in DeFi, because allowing users to borrow without collateral as long as the liquidity is restored to the pool under one transaction block unlocks a lot of interesting use-cases for otherwise small players to participate in the markets and make them more efficient. In addition, it also enables handy DeFi features like self-liquidation, arbitrage, collateral swapping, and many more.

The main issues here are in general with **3 big vulnerability factors**:

*  **Oracle manipulation**
*  **Smart Contract vulnerabilities**
*  **Economic misalignment**

 **Oracles** are the main tool used for blockchains to access data outside of the blockchain itself. It is hard to get accurate information such as price data in a secure and reliable manner, that is also decentralized and tamper proof.

**Smart Contracts** are complex tools, that are very hard to build and to structure in such a way that they are exploit proof. Most of Smart Contracts suffer from bugs or poor design choices that make them prone to attacks and which aren’t discovered until it is too late. Even with extensive auditing, the intricacies and dependencies of smart contracts are hard to test and cleaned of weak links.

**Economic design** is of absolute importance when considering how a protocol operates. Ensuring that all the key player’s incentives are aligned is paramount to creating a secure environment for the protocol. Failure to create a sound incentive structure may lead to exploits that drain the protocol of resources in an unforeseen way.

A protocol must consider tackling all these 3 factors to ensure the maximum level of security and thus protection against Flashloan exploits.

# How can 3rd generation networks such as Elrond, protect users ?

 In a way it is hard to gauge at an early stage as Flashloans prey on the weakest link and there will always be novel ways of using capital to manipulate various protocol features in order to gain from them.

But as we all know, prevention is something that can be undertaken early in order to ensure that the 3 big vulnerability factors are addressed already.

Elrond network already took a big step with the addition of Formal Verification within the Elrond smart contract environment. Elrond is working to improve their dev toolkit with a set of formal tools based on K Framework, which will enable developers to better write their code, immediately see and increase testing code coverage, and ultimately, add symbolic execution and even formally verify their Elrond Smart Contracts. This will establish better standards for security and reduce the occurrence of Smart Contract bugs.

Another big step that Elrond took is to partner with and make available as many oracles as possible, effectively reducing the possibility of oracle manipulation on the network’s protocols and dApps. Multiple oracle sources result in a distributed data fetching method and thous a more robust way of gathering non-blockchain information. This way developers can use oracles to check and verify the data feed from other oracles, essentially creating a safety net.

And last but not least, the economic incentives are thoroughly aligned on every aspect of the Elrond network, including the design of the EGLD and MEX tokens that reward the users for providing security and liquidity to the ecosystem. Although these are good steps, they don’t guarantee that future protocols and dApps built on Elrond network will all have sound designs, but with the expected development of the Maiar Launchpad, which will offer a lot of support from the Elrond team to the projects that are selected to be launched through it, we can be confident that better and more resilient economic designs for various protocols and dApps will emerge.

# Conclusion

 As we have seen Flashloans are not a tool that was created for destruction and exploiting, but it can also be immensely useful to close the gap on a certain niche sector that previously, in the traditional finance world, hasn’t been possible to achieve.

As such Flashloans can create positive value and offer a more fair access to market opportunities for all participants, but protocols and dApps in the DeFi sphere have to design their projects with Flashloans in mind and take into account all the factors and possible attack vectors that come with them.

We at Istari Vision are confident into the capability of the Elrond network team and developer community to overtake the current constrains and create a safer environment that is Flashloan exploit resistant.

When looking to understand **Flashloans** we must first look at traditional loans, understand how these work, their limitations and then we can start looking at what Flashloans are and how they come to fill a missing gap in the lightning fast DeFi space.

In order to fully grasp the concept, we have to understand that Flashloans are an adaptation of an existing traditional product, but greater enhanced with the help of blockchain technology.

# Loans in the traditional sense

We all know what loans are in the broad sense, borrowing money to acquire/fund things is not something very complex. But the underlying processes and conditions that make loans possible are often overlooked.

There are 3 main components behind the lending system we see today:

1. **Credit scores**
2. **Collateral**
3. **Interest rates**

When we take out loans from an institution, like a bank, we often get our **credit score** checked, which means that the institutions checks our **financial history** in order to asses how good are we at managing our money and what will be an acceptable level of debt that we can pay back in monthly installments, without putting too much financial strain on us.

Now given an individual **credit score**, some institutions or even individuals, can ask for a certain **collateral** to be deposited before any loans are given. This means that a person has to deposit upfront an amount of money, that can be counted towards the repayment of the loan or can be given back when the loan is fully repaid. This is a safety feature that is used by the lenders to ensure that they aren’t fully exposed to the risk of giving out large sums and such borrowers, given their credit score, have to put a % of the total sum borrowed as guarantee for repayment.

Financing loans is not an easy endeavor and requires a large capital pool, meaning that the institutions or persons who are lending money, they themselves have that capital beforehand and most of the times they want to gain from lending such big sums. As such borrowers are subjected to **interest rates** which in essence are fees for the money they borrowed, as paying for the service that the lenders offer. These rates are usually regulated and they can’t fluctuate that much, but they do exist and will add to the total sum that needs to be repaid.

# Limitation of traditional loans

Traditionally loans are mostly collateralized, meaning that there is always a requirement for locking in capital or assets upfront as collateral for the loan. This means that for a lot of people accessing loans to finance things is still a costly endeavor and when we factor the interest rate in, it becomes even greater.

Enter **uncollateralized loans** as a solution to the above deposit requirement and enable an easier access to capital. But this often comes at a great risk for the lender and in practice that risk is taken only when there is a big premium to gain from. Lenders that offer uncollateralized loans do so with hefty interest rates on top, which in the end put a similar strain on the borrower. The only instance where a lender agrees to offer this type of loan and not take a big premium is when the reputation of the borrower supersedes the risk, but these cases are rare.

When lending and borrowing was introduced into the blockchain world, it came with certain challenges. Given the decentralized and anonymous world of DeFi, people can’t be checked for credit scores, which increase the risk of the lenders. As such the burden of the credit score was transferred on the collateral side, meaning that most protocols require the borrowers to deposit over 100% of the loan value as collateral. This model is what kept lending protocols safe and financially healthy, but as we saw above it is a huge strain for the average user.

# Flashloans

&amp;#x200B;

[ Flashloan example \(Aave.com\) ](https://preview.redd.it/g2exbyktll971.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3897b55d7975119d03d8a7a16de2b2dc16ba417)

With the advent of smart contracts and lending protocols loans didn’t need to be intermediated by any middlemen, opening the avenue for additional use-cases and to a much larger user base as a alternative to the traditional banking sector.

As we have spoken about how loans work and how the staple overcollateralized loans work in DeFi, requiring huge amounts of capital upfront, we introduce the Flashloan concept that was created to address the problems with undercollateralized loan’s security and the overcollateralized loan’s high capital requirements.

**Flashloans** are a certain niche of undercollateralized loans that work by providing anyone the ability to borrow instantly and easily, with no collateral required, but with the condition that the loan is repaid within the same transaction block that it was taken on.

Now you might ask how are these loans useful if you need to repay them seconds later in the same block. As we can see in Flashloan example picture above, they are meant for developers to use, so that they can move large capital around efficiently, close any market discrepancies in the form of arbitrages or even a **dark usage**, exploit smart contract and economic vulnerabilities of various DeFi protocols.

# Hacks due to Flashloans and protection against

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/faszef6wll971.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dfdc5cf3aed3fac2a5b442b1ab008a0251a2575

Recent events have shown that Flashloans are a very powerful tool that can do both good and bad. There are a multitude of examples on how Flashloans have been used for various exploits to extract a lot of capital from multiple protocols. At the time of writing the DeFi industry has experienced almost $300 Million in assets lost due to Flashloan attacks.

One of the **first Flashloans** attacks that occurred was on **Fulcrum** (built on the bZx protocol) in which the attacker took an ETH flashloan on dYdX, splitting the sum by depositing on **Compound and on Fulcrum**.

* **On Fulcrum** the attacker took a short position on ETH versus wrapped BTC (WBTC), which resulted in Fulcrum requiring to buy WBTC to cover the other side of the position. It did so by utilizing Kyber protocol to fill a WBTC buy order on Uniswap. But the attacker knew that Uniswap had low liquidity for WBTC, it’s price rose significantly, meaning that Fulcrum acquired the WBTC with a big premium.
* **On Compound**, at the same time as the Fulcrum short position was taken, the attacker took a loan of WBTC using the rest of the ETH obtained from the dYdX flashloan. As the price pumped due to Fulcrum buying WTBC, the attacker sold the borrowed WBTC on Uniswap for ETH and made a hefty profit out of it, after repaying the ETH initially loaned from dYdX, pocketing the difference.

Not even the biggest and most respected protocols escaped such attacks that resulted from Flashloans, with **Yearn**, a popular DeFi aggregator suffering $11 Million in losses from an exploit of their smart contracts.

* The attacker started with an ETH stablecoin Flashloan from dYdX and Aave, which was used to borrow DAI and USDC from Compound, which in turn was deposited into the Yearn V1 vault product. That product deposits users funds into Curve (Stablecoin AMM Exchange) on the “3pool” product that contained 3 stablecoins (DAI, USDT and USDC). The Yearn V1 vault was relying on the DAI price given by the “3pool” product and as such the attacker was able to exploit that weakness.
* The attack goes as follows, depositing the borrowed DAI in the V1 Vault and USDT in the “3pool”, then withdrawing the DAI from the vault and the USDT from the “3pool”. This caused the prices of DAI and USDC to be lowered while the price of USDT to increase and as such allow the attacker to drain the Yearn V1 vault of funds.

# How can we protect against Flashloans ?

That is one of the million dollar question of today’s DeFi industry and a very tough one to crack. **Flashloans** are in general **not the main problem**, as they are a big innovation in DeFi, because allowing users to borrow without collateral as long as the liquidity is restored to the pool under one transaction block unlocks a lot of interesting use-cases for otherwise small players to participate in the markets and make them more efficient. In addition, it also enables handy DeFi features like self-liquidation, arbitrage, collateral swapping, and many more.

The main issues here are in general with **3 big vulnerability factors**:

* **Oracle manipulation**
* **Smart Contract vulnerabilities**
* **Economic misalignment**

**Oracles** are the main tool used for blockchains to access data outside of the blockchain itself. It is hard to get accurate information such as price data in a secure and reliable manner, that is also decentralized and tamper proof.

**Smart Contracts** are complex tools, that are very hard to build and to structure in such a way that they are exploit proof. Most of Smart Contracts suffer from bugs or poor design choices that make them prone to attacks and which aren’t discovered until it is too late. Even with extensive auditing, the intricacies and dependencies of smart contracts are hard to test and cleaned of weak links.

**Economic design** is of absolute importance when considering how a protocol operates. Ensuring that all the key player’s incentives are aligned is paramount to creating a secure environment for the protocol. Failure to create a sound incentive structure may lead to exploits that drain the protocol of resources in an unforeseen way.

A protocol must consider tackling all these 3 factors to ensure the maximum level of security and thus protection against Flashloan exploits.

# How can 3rd generation networks such as Elrond, protect users ?

In a way it is hard to gauge at an early stage as Flashloans prey on the weakest link and there will always be novel ways of using capital to manipulate various protocol features in order to gain from them.

* **On Fulcrum** the attacker took a short position on ETH versus wrapped BTC (WBTC), which resulted in Fulcrum requiring to buy WBTC to cover the other side of the position. It did so by utilizing Kyber protocol to fill a WBTC buy order on Uniswap. But the attacker knew that Uniswap had low liquidity for WBTC, it’s price rose significantly, meaning that Fulcrum acquired the WBTC with a big premium.
* **On Compound**, at the same time as the Fulcrum short position was taken, the attacker took a loan of WBTC using the rest of the ETH obtained from the dYdX flashloan. As the price pumped due to Fulcrum buying WTBC, the attacker sold the borrowed WBTC on Uniswap for ETH and made a hefty profit out of it, after repaying the ETH initially loaned from dYdX, pocketing the difference.

Not even the biggest and most respected protocols escaped such attacks that resulted from Flashloans, with **Yearn**, a popular DeFi aggregator suffering $11 Million in losses from an exploit of their smart contracts.

* The attacker started with an ETH stablecoin Flashloan from dYdX and Aave, which was used to borrow DAI and USDC from Compound, which in turn was deposited into the Yearn V1 vault product. That product deposits users funds into Curve (Stablecoin AMM Exchange) on the “3pool” product that contained 3 stablecoins (DAI, USDT and USDC). The Yearn V1 vault was relying on the DAI price given by the “3pool” product and as such the attacker was able to exploit that weakness.
* The attack goes as follows, depositing the borrowed DAI in the V1 Vault and USDT in the “3pool”, then withdrawing the DAI from the vault and the USDT from the “3pool”. This caused the prices of DAI and USDC to be lowered while the price of USDT to increase and as such allow the attacker to drain the Yearn V1 vault of funds.

# How can we protect against Flashloans ?

That is one of the million dollar question of today’s DeFi industry and a very tough one to crack. **Flashloans** are in general **not the main problem**, as they are a big innovation in DeFi, because allowing users to borrow without collateral as long as the liquidity is restored to the pool under one transaction block unlocks a lot of interesting use-cases for otherwise small players to participate in the markets and make them more efficient. In addition, it also enables handy DeFi features like self-liquidation, arbitrage, collateral swapping, and many more.

The main issues here are in general with **3 big vulnerability factors**:

* **Oracle manipulation**
* **Smart Contract vulnerabilities**
* **Economic misalignment**

**Oracles** are the main tool used for blockchains to access data outside of the blockchain itself. It is hard to get accurate information such as price data in a secure and reliable manner, that is also decentralized and tamper proof.

**Smart Contracts** are complex tools, that are very hard to build and to structure in such a way that they are exploit proof. Most of Smart Contracts suffer from bugs or poor design choices that make them prone to attacks and which aren’t discovered until it is too late. Even with extensive auditing, the intricacies and dependencies of smart contracts are hard to test and cleaned of weak links.

**Economic design** is of absolute importance when considering how a protocol operates. Ensuring that all the key player’s incentives are aligned is paramount to creating a secure environment for the protocol. Failure to create a sound incentive structure may lead to exploits that drain the protocol of resources in an unforeseen way.

A protocol must consider tackling all these 3 factors to ensure the maximum level of security and thus protection against Flashloan exploits.

# How can 3rd generation networks such as Elrond, protect users ?

In a way it is hard to gauge at an early stage as Flashloans prey on the weakest link and there will always be novel ways of using capital to manipulate various protocol features in order to gain from them.

But as we all know, prevention is something that can be undertaken early in order to ensure that the 3 big vulnerability factors are addressed already.

Elrond network already took a big step with the addition of Formal Verification within the Elrond smart contract environment. Elrond is working to improve their dev toolkit with a set of formal tools based on K Framework, which will enable developers to better write their code, immediately see and increase testing code coverage, and ultimately, add symbolic execution and even formally verify their Elrond Smart Contracts. This will establish better standards for security and reduce the occurrence of Smart Contract bugs.

&amp;#x200B;

[Oracles available on Elrond through partnerships \(https:\/\/elrond.com\/assets\/files\/elrond-ecosystem.pdf\)](https://preview.redd.it/3hrb0rahml971.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8eecbe87277a7744e8f7fe8fab3ee8c3dfa1cb44)

Another big step that Elrond took is to partner with and make available as many oracles as possible, effectively reducing the possibility of oracle manipulation on the network’s protocols and dApps. Multiple oracle sources result in a distributed data fetching method and thous a more robust way of gathering non-blockchain information. This way developers can use oracles to check and verify the data feed from other oracles, essentially creating a safety net.

And last but not least, the economic incentives are thoroughly aligned on every aspect of the Elrond network, including the design of the EGLD and MEX tokens that reward the users for providing security and liquidity to the ecosystem. Although these are good steps, they don’t guarantee that future protocols and dApps built on Elrond network will all have sound designs, but with the expected development of the Maiar Launchpad, which will offer a lot of support from the Elrond team to the projects that are selected to be launched through it, we can be confident that better and more resilient economic designs for various protocols and dApps will emerge.

# Conclusion

As we have seen Flashloans are not a tool that was created for destruction and exploiting, but it can also be immensely useful to close the gap on a certain niche sector that previously, in the traditional finance world, hasn’t been possible to achieve.

As such Flashloans can create positive value and offer a more fair access to market opportunities for all participants, but protocols and dApps in the DeFi sphere have to design their projects with Flashloans in mind and take into account all the factors and possible attack vectors that come with them.

We at Istari Vision are confident into the capability of the Elrond network team and developer community to overtake the current constrains and create a safer environment that is Flashloan exploit resistant.

"The cryptocurrency industry won’t stop trying to make a purely algorithmic stablecoin work. To understand why, all you have to do is look at the U.S. dollar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/oewnhm/the_cryptocurrency_industry_wont_stop_trying_to/,Cullancuppo,1,2021-07-06 23:00:05,1,/r/CryptoMars/comments/oewnhm/the_cryptocurrency_industry_wont_stop_trying_to/,NaN,"The dollar was once basically a stablecoin tied to gold, and that worked well as the greenback was establishing itself as an asset, said Lisa Jy Tan, founder of Economics Design, a crypto-economics research company. The U.S. left the gold standard ostensibly because there was a war. But in time the American economy got so much bigger that it needed more flexibility than the gold standard afforded.

“It doesn’t work in the long run because the economy is still expanding faster than the amount of materials available,” Tan said.

Similarly, she expects the crypto economy will also outgrow a collateral obligation eventually (hopefully without a war).

An algorithmic stablecoin is one that can keep its peg using only software and rules. If one ever works, it could scale infinitely, to whatever size an economy needs.

“To create USDC you need USD in the bank, and that works well if you’re just starting out,” Tan said. “What comes after, it’s the right kind of monetary policy that allows stability and low volatility to allow people to trade … if we can do that with math and we can do that with monetary policy, that’s more efficient.”

Tan just finished up an extensive study of stablecoins that are either fully algorithmic or could evolve in that direction over time. Her conclusion: None of them are ready yet, but that’s also fine for now. 

“The reason algorithmic stablecoins keep getting tried is because it feels like the Holy Grail. It’s like bitcoin and settled on-chain, but actually stable and with purchasing power,” said Sam Kazemian, co-founder of the decentralized encyclopedia, Everipedia, and more recently of a mostly collateralized stablecoin called Frax.

Without stablecoins, there would have been no decentralized finance (DeFi) booms, which means there probably would have also been no non-fungible token (NFT) boom. Stablecoins have been table stakes for what the industry has achieved so far.

And the crypto industry largely agrees that some set of stablecoins will have a very bright future. 

“I think stablecoins will replace the eurodollar market completely,” said Tushar Jain of Multicoin Capital.

A stablecoin that scales infinitely is a very enticing problem to solve, but the last year has been unkind to the approach; several have tried. And yet, entrepreneurs are not giving up.

That said, a lot of the projects we’ve seen have looked and felt more like games than serious attempts at solving crypto’s volatility problem. And even well-intentioned ones seem to operate on the assumption that stable prices are just a matter of the right engineering. 

Watching the attempts, Jain has begun to suspect that, as he put it, “Risk cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transformed.” He sees economic designers looking for the game that erases algorithmic stablecoin risk, but at this point he doubts it’s possible. That said, Jain’s conviction here is not fixed yet.

The rigging might not be the issue anyway. Robert Leshner, Compound Labs founder, which made DeFi money market protocol Compound, said entrepreneurs are looking in the wrong place.

If you imagine a future in which an all-code token is able to hold a stable value, Leshner envisions that it will take “an unbelievable amount of agreement that this asset works.”

To that point, since the Coinage Act of 1792 defined the dollar as 416 grains of standard silver, the U.S. currency unit has had a very long time to establish its underlying economy, hit the world stage and then decouple from its final dance partner: gold. That also took a long time.

Leshner buys the algorithmic stablecoin thesis and has backed many of the projects, but he thinks they are all trying to achieve too much too soon.

For “most actual assets, it’s not a rapid journey to adoption, it’s a slow consensus-building journey to adoption,” Leshner said.

The way of all stable crypto things

Stablecoin history begins with Tether, which runs USDT. Originally known as Realcoin, it began in October 2014.

Tether’s model was always simple: It promised that for every USDT there would be an actual redeemable dollar in the bank somewhere. The various question marks and traffic bumps that Tether has faced over the years don’t need to be recounted here. There are just really three salient points to make.

First, Tether has shifted its collateral mix but still claims to be fully backed.

Second, it remains by far the dominant stablecoin in the market, the third-largest cryptocurrency overall, and has a market cap of $64 billion as of this writing.

Third, sentiment around Tether in crypto has changed. Where once it met widespread skepticism, now it is treated as one of the “too big to fail” pillars of the crypto economy.

“The culture definitely has shifted, mainly due to the continuous existence of Tether and the support of Tether by large institutional traders,” said Kory Hoang, CEO of Stably, an asset tokenization startup (which also once issued its own stablecoin). 

DeFi's best shovel

Since Tether, many stablecoins have followed. Stablecoins have been crucial in DeFi history. If Tether’s USDT and MakerDAO’s DAI had not worked, it is hard to imagine there would be billions of dollars locked up in all these financial smart contracts today.

Hoang and Tan offered a vision for how this future is going to play out (much of which is already here, if not fully realized). Both had views that were largely in sync with a few slight additional wrinkles from one or the other, though without direct contradiction.

The obvious place where it all begins is reserve-backed stablecoins, crypto tokens that are buoyed by assets, usually in the form of fiat currency (almost always dollars) – like Tether’s USDT.

This part of the market is established and it has worked well. Those who want more regulatory confidence than USDT affords tend to turn to the CENTRE Consortium’s USD coin (USDC).

There are many others as well, such as Binance USD (BUSD) and TrueUSD (TUSD).

The next phase comes from Hoang: over-collateralized but more decentralized stablecoins, such as MakerDAO’s DAI. DAI began as a stablecoin collateralized only with ETH, the cryptocurrency that runs the smart contract chain Ethereum. This required it to be seriously over-collateralized, at a minimum 150% but in practice usually much higher.

Tokens like liquidity probably count in here, and perhaps FEI does as well.

The next phase, Hoang says, is meta-stablecoins. These are stablecoins that exist in smart contracts that are making use of them and give depositors tokens that account for their deposits. These meta-stablecoins have unique properties, either growing in value or growing in quality based on the success of the deposit.

So DAI deposited in Compound becomes cDAI, which earns the interest on that deposit. Or any of several stablecoins deposited onto the automated market maker Curve, in its yCRV pool. Such deposits become yCRV tokens.

In most cases, they roughly track the fiat currency to which the meta-coin is pegged (see for example Aave’s aUSDC), but they also earn a yield. 

Unhinging

Then Tan pointed to partial reserve-backed stablecoins. Her report argues the most successful of these, so far, has been the aforementioned Frax project, which is largely backed by USDC but requires a small portion of each FRAX token to be backed by its governance token, frax shares (FXS). One could argue that DAI has entered this category since USDC has become one of its largest collateralization sources.

They both agree the next level after that will be the purely algorithmic stablecoin, with no collateral."

I am part of a Canadian team that helped BREAK AES-256 Encryption of the Wikileaks Insurance Files -- We can tell you how we did it - AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/ofhjqe/i_am_part_of_a_canadian_team_that_helped_break/,CodanWarrior,1,2021-07-07 20:05:46,13,/r/AMA/comments/ofhjqe/i_am_part_of_a_canadian_team_that_helped_break/,NaN,"As per the above AMA title, I am a Vancouver, Canada-based computer science worker who now works in corporate IT but was once part of a multi-provincial team of student and professional programmers, mathematicians, systems analysts, cryptographers and business people who just happened to have access to some really powerful computing systems used to find and create methods to break AES-256 encryption which is the 1990's data encryption standard still used today in 2021 to protect digital data using the Advanced Encryption Standard 256-bits long.

Just look up AES-256 on Wikipedia if you want to know more information on how it all works.

Another Reddit user (who was subsequently banned from Reddit in 2020) was the original poster who exposed the project to the world in 2017 and he was originally from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. If I remember correctly he called himself SG7 or something very similar. 

While he was not the mastermind of the project, he was or is an older business guy who was one of the higher ups who helped originally fund and direct the team that was first organized in Toronto, Ontario, Canada secretly within the Computer science and mathematics departments of the University of Toronto.  I was told that he was a business mentor of a student group that won some computer processing time on a large IBM Blue Gene/Q series supercomputer.

I won't disclose the names of the members of the student group but I can say that a University of Toronto Ph.D mathematics graduate student was the first to propose that the 256-bits long blocks of data encrypted with AES-256 could be organized as a series of RGB or Grayscale pixels within a 2D array or 3D array of 8x8x8, 16x16 or 8x32 items and other array widths and heights to form a small bitmap image which could be deep-data-mined to find patterns that might correspond to vowels, consonants and other ASCII or UNICODE character sequences that comprise the plaintext of common English conversational text and data within common Word documents and PDF or database file formats.

By organizing and comparing various original plaintexts and header or footer values of common file formats it was found that Yes it was possible to find simple curves that described where an encrypted output string would tend to be placed within a 256-bit block compared to other types and sequences of input data.

The students found that plus-or-minus character value differences between adjacent characters followed a discernable numeric pattern that could be broken down to such a level that it became possible to create a tree of possible password substrings which could exclusively indicate that a password (aka the encrypt key) contained English-like words and numeric sequences or that is one of those keys that that contained only nonsense text or truly random characters, numbers and punctuation.

Those password trees that indicated they were human-readable text were simply broken by brute force since specific consonant/vowel character combinations and the original password length were able to be determined and therefore a brute-force dictionary-based password attack was possible. 

The part of the data tree where passwords were defined to be nonsensical or truly random could also be broken down using brute force methods since we could exclude proper English plaintext and common phrases and common numeric sequences aka 1234. The curve-like mini-bitmaps gave clues to where and how many character combinations would occur within short character sequences of a longer password. 

The Reddit user SG7 also proposed to the student programmers that it was possible that various attributes about a character sequence could be encoded as a grayscale value or as Red, Green and Blue color channel values and be displayed as an uncompressed bitmap of an expanded size so that common graphics cards aka GPUs could be used to accelerate the data mining operations and pattern matching algorithms to find common correlations and similarities between known plaintext and encrypted output.    
These attributes could include plus/minus character difference values versus adjacent characters or distances between known sequences of plaintext or nonsensical character sequences or known lengths or place distances between specific classes of characters sequences aka only vowels, only consonants or only punctuation or combinations thereof. Each type of attribute was given a specific shade or grey or hue of color and could then be data mined on the student-won supercomputer time and on corporate-bought GPU-based accelerator networks.  
The students found success in breaking specific types and classes of AES-256 data streams by 2018 but were publicly ridiculed within the computer science community and have kept themselves hidden until now July 2021.  One of the first sets of files they attacked were the Wikileaks Insurance Files which you can also lookup on Wikipedia or Google to find out more about.   
These large files contain data sets and data leaks so dangerous to specific groups within the corporate offices and upper government echelons that Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, was arrested and has been kept in refuge from the public since 2012 in the Ecuadorian embassy and was then finally arrested by police in 2019 in the UK and remains imprisoned today.  He had created these insurance files as a last desperate chance at keeping himself alive and posted them to various forums around the world.  No one knew the contents of these files until now! The Canadian group figured out a way to break these passwords but has kept them secret for almost four years now. 

So ask me anything aka AMA about how these encrypted files were broken and what my role is and also ask away on WHAT is to happen next and WHEN it's to happen!    
To get some of the initial questions and answers out of the way, I am an early-40's male programmer now working in Vancouver, Canada and my role was to create the C++ code that allowed networked GPU cards to process specific algorithms such as low-pass, high-pass, edge detect and notch filters quickly and in parallel.

YES! I do know one of the keys of one the Wikileaks Insurance files. Everyone in the group knows one key to one file and all can disclose what they know when given the public flag telling us to do so. NO! I won't tell what that public semaphore is!  This prevents rubber-hose attacks ""aka interrogation beatings"" on group members because each person only has part of the key sequences for one insurance file. 

Do I know what's inside the file? YES! I do know parts of the contents but not others due to there being a compartmentation of the decryption process. YES! I do think more than a few well known and high level people around the world will be extremely alarmed at what is in those files. YES! They contain names, times, places, amounts, destinations and some petty dalliances and examples of common but large thievery and conspiracy within financial and political circles.  

NO! My parts did not contain evidence of aliens, ufos, cryptoids and other paranormal files. It's almost all petty hidden financial assets and political chicanery found in massive dumps of emails and other communications! Is sex involved? YES! It is! There are payoffs made to the typical male and female actors in these tabloid-like escapades and there will be more than a few expensive and public divorces coming out of these leaks.

YES! I do know one other group member who called me and said that his part of the decrypted Wikileaks Insurance file sequences does contain world-changing hard-core irrefutable examples of things we humans cannot imagine and will find to be stunning in its implications and that's all he said. YES! I can now say we humans are definitely not alone in the Universe. Aliens exists and multiple species have been visiting Earth and we now have the irrefutable proof that this universe is a lot stranger than we could possibly imagine. 

Who is SG7? He is the late-50's or early- 60's Alberta-based programmer who coded the original image-based pattern matching algorithms and served as a group leader and hardware purchaser in Eastern Canada. I think he was the one who helped finance the purchase of the GPU farm after the original mathematical proofs were calculated on the IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer.  
Was this project sanctioned by the University of Toronto? NO! They had no knowledge of what the student group was doing. All they supplied was student-won supercomputer time. Mostly night-time work I think!  The students co-computed their winning project code along with the hidden AES-256 breaking math-proofs and then moved to an off-site GPU server farm in Toronto once their supercomputer time was up.   
None of the students are still at University of Toronto. Ironically, most of the student group members now work in fields not actually directly related to their degree!  I was brought onto the project later doing GPU code work only.

Why am I not releasing my decrypted portions of the Wikileaks Insurance files? Out of simple courtesy to the other members of the group and to acquiesce to a long-term request from the Eastern Canada-based group leaders not to do so until the public semaphore has been raised telling us all to release our portions of the public keys.  NO! I don't know where or when the semaphore that says release the keys will be raised!

NO! I don't know the names of the other members except for the username/handle of one other in Eastern Canada who told me about his Insurance File contents!  I came later into the group so they didn't trust me fully and I was just doing it for a learning experience which has expanded my IT infrastructure scaling abilities and system administrator experience.   
You could say I was an intern learning the ropes! I came to coding later in life so it's more of a get-the-job-done thing than a personal calling. I happen to like my free time and don't spend 16 hour days like others at it. YES! The other username/group member actually suggested this AMA to me and I agreed since I am one of the low members on the totem pole and can't do much damage to the rest of the group. No one else has complained or said not to so here I am.

So again Ask Me Anything!  I will keep this AMA session active for at least 30 days and answer any questions up until August 8th, 2021.  I will answer the questions as best as I can and only to what I actually personally know or can properly opine upon based upon first hand knowledge. If I can't answer a question I will simply to say I Don't Know!  I will NOT ANSWER dumb personal questions like what veggies I like or my sex life. NO! NO! NO! So just don't ask about them!

Appreciate the words here Vito. PLEASE READ BEFORE SHITTING ON ME. About me first. I hold degrees in Finance and Market Psychology. I have been in the in the industry for 13 years and old a series 7 license. As intelligent investors we should always be questioning everything and all…even if we are emotionally invested. Unfortunately Vito I have to disagree here. I believe the Steele boom is dead and/or will be trading flat for the next while or so. While I have fully been in Steele since December I sold out entirely from all my positions the week of that CLF boom, and don’t intend to get back in. A couple reasons for this. One of those being as we came out of the pandemic there was a massive demand for raw food and commodities, we saw lumber and Steele sky rocket. But what happened production increased to meet demands and prices reduced. Lumber prices flattened out then will cede of the next couple of quarters back to higher than ore covid prices but not as the astronomical values they’re currently at. Similar to the toilet paper shortage but a socioeconomic scale and what now? The aisles are jam packed with toilet paper. But Barry you’re comparing Steele coils to toilet paper you gotta be kidding right? While it seems funny in thought the idea and emotion side of things is there. Commodities came to the forefront and was being picked up by the mainstream hence the CLF reference. When the mainstream picks up a stock, I always become skittish and start planning my exit. Too much attention in the markets I believe is a bad thing, but the perfect time to sell. Additionally as demand curbs Steele will trade flat over the next two quarters I believe then gradually decline. The news about China holding stock piles was another alarming factor for me for a couple reasons. First being they are the major manufacturer in the world and a mega Steele user. And China consistently lies about what they have in stock across the board, doing anything to benefit them. My belief is that they are sitting on massive stock piles even larger than reported to completely control the market. Those two factors put a massive ball in their court. These commodity stocks don’t move like tech ones and can quarters if not YEARS of trading flat. The question is can you hold that long? Truthfully I hope I am wrong and you all make a shit ton of money. But I see many of you getting emotionally tied up and that is alarming. When animal spirits come behind logic, we lose money. As investors we need to get out at high sentiment and buy the lowly thought of ones. So my 3 effecting factors are 1.) demand curve easing 2.) Chinas hidden stockpiles 3.) feverish sentiment. Also I believe Vito is too close to Steele like many of you and not seeing the risks here, and I mean that in the most respectful way possible. His current DD feels like he is trying too hard to convince us as he knows the true direction headed. I welcome any discussion and will engage in civil dialogue. Let me know your thoughts.

My whole college path has been such a mess and for no particular reason either which idk is maybe the worst part? I wasn't out partying or enjoying myself or wasting time really, more so inefficient I think. I'm not the smartest but I barely slept/worked really hard in high school; came in every morning an hour and half before classes started and stayed after every day for extra help. I ran track until 5ish so Id go after for study help and be at school until 7 or 8PM- basically 7AM-8PM everyday. I got my SAT score (out of 2400) from a 1550 to a 2100 (which IK isn't amazing especially relative to all the family/friends around me) after dozens of practice tests which I was actually proud of. I'm sharing this to add context as I think a huge part of me failing in my freshman year was being burnt out.

In college (2014) I attended a smaller school (for mechanical engineering) more known for academic focus and told myself I was ready for/should take on a challenge instead of some of the bigger/probably more fun schools that I had significant scholarships for. I was completely unprepared for college; didn't know how to navigate any of the portal/online stuff, didn't check emails, didn't go to the summer orientation, and during all the first month events I basically stayed locked in my dorm room because everyone was drinking and partying which I didn't understand at all. I gradually opened up and made some good friends who I studied with all the time, but I kept getting Cs and Bs at best with curves while they all did great. Then the last drop date came and suddenly I was at the bottom of the curve failing everything and I refused to even consider withdrawing from a class resulting in failing most of them. 2nd semester I doubled down on my mistakes, was incredibly ashamed and didn't share my grades with friends/classmates/family, and took 6 courses thinking I had to make up for the semester I lost (god that hurts to write now). I was actually doing ok and then got really sick with a 103.6 degree fever which I told no one about and of course mostly failed my courses again after bombing almost all my finals. I wish I spoke to the friends I made there because they were all great people and helped me out so much but I was too ashamed/insecure/egotistical to let anyone know. Despite how awful things were academically I grew so much socially and it was such a good experience- but I definitely lost out there as well constantly turning peoples invitations down to study, even rejecting the girl that I liked (which sucked because I never had a gf and really liked her) to study for a calc test I ended up failing anyway.

Anyway, got kicked out, appeal denied, my parents were absolutely destroyed especially being Asian with all of our family/family friends pretty much being top students/doctors/engineers etc. I went to community without any real direction took some pretty random business and poli-sci courses I did fine in without any effort really. It was incredibly robotic- drive to class, take notes, come home and avoid my family, go to class etc. I didn't really have any intention or make any effort to applying/coming back to my initial college. I still visited occasionally to see my friends and have that like driven attitude type of people around. Somehow at community I took their placement test and did really well so I got put in calc 2 despite never taking/passing 1 and somehow managed a D. I took calc 1 after and failed it. Then in early 2016- I guess the only real legitimate excuse I have of any kind- my cousin was in a coma for a month after attempting suicide. She passed away towards the end of the semester and it was later found that she was assaulted by a teacher, reported it to the school and they did nothing. The teacher was sentenced to 15 years after 25+ other girls came forward. I failed most classes that semester, and the next semester I failed everything. 

The following semester I just retook 3 courses and got As. I did the same the next semester and got As, so I bumped up to 5 courses the one after that and again got all As. I avoided calculus because I was afraid to take it after failing it 4 times and being so lost with math in general. I transferred to an ok state college where my tuition fees were covered and now I'm 5 classes away from graduating in Finance with a 3.7 GPA. However, I screwed up again putting off calculus all this time because I didn't want to tank my gpa and ruin all my work to this point, and now its a prerequisite for 2 of the last finance courses I need- and I even need to take a prerequisite for calculus first. I'm a few months away from being 26 and I'm going to be in college an extra year because I never finished calculus and I don't even know if I can pass it. My advisor/math department has been completely unhelpful in figuring this out because you need all these forms and approvals to take a course at another school and theyre not offering it this summer. I registered to take the calc prereq equivalence course at a community college without approval and am just hoping they'll take it after the fact since no one is helping figure things out right now. 

Anyway if anyone actually reads this I just feel like a complete loser/failure, like I'm turning 26 and losing health insurance and just burdening my parents further and I know they're already so ashamed. At the same time I feel like I've just wasted so many years after finally coming out of my shell and finding out I like doing social things and going out places but I cant let myself do that and enjoy life when I haven't even lived up to my basic responsibilities. I don't know what I'm looking for with this post I guess I'm really just scared I've fallen so short of my potential, of what everyone expected of me myself included, and that I've just wasted so much time. I know people have dealt with far worse and lost far more time but it still just feels miserable... I feel like I can never have respect for myself after all this and thats not even considering how hard it will be finding a job without any experience or even an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is rambling i didnt know how to structure it or what to include there's so much, thank you if you read I appreciate it."

2nd Major Advice Needed: Quantitative Finance or Chinese Studies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/og14o8/2nd_major_advice_needed_quantitative_finance_or/,qwqAimee,1,2021-07-08 13:54:35,9,/r/nus/comments/og14o8/2nd_major_advice_needed_quantitative_finance_or/,Looking for Advice,"Hi! I'm an incoming CHS freshie majoring in Econs. I'd like to have a second major and can't decide between the two. Any advice would be appreciated!

I initially wanted to do a second major in Management because this combo would be helpful for career prospects. However I don't think I would be able to complete 4 biz mods by the 4th semester under CHS and RC programmes.

I think QF is another major that helps an Econs graduate for career prospects (other helpful 2nd majors advice would also be appreciated!!). But I heard that the bell curve for this makes obtaining good grades hard because for the Maths mods they have to do it with Maths major students, Finance mods with finance students, etc.

I'm also thinking of Chinese Studies just mainly because I'm interested in Chinese cultures, histories etc. But I'm also hesitant because I'm unsure whether spending so much energy and time learning a discipline that may not be helful for career prospects at all would be worth it.

So to summarise my questions:
1. Would it be very hard to obtain good grades in QF because the bell curve makes you compete with Maths/finance major students?
2. Would spending so much energy and time learning a discipline that may not be helful for career at all be worth it?
3. Are there any other majors that would form a good combination with Econs that may enhance my career prospects?

Thank you guys in advance!!"
"📢 Hello Polygon Fam! The wait is over! As promised, our team has answered your questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/og90s6/hello_polygon_fam_the_wait_is_over_as_promised/,RamkumarKrishnan,1,2021-07-08 23:02:32,36,/r/0xPolygon/comments/og90s6/hello_polygon_fam_the_wait_is_over_as_promised/,NaN,"✅ Our team has answered most of the questions from our members. We are sure that you will find this interesting.

🚀 We’ve many exciting things in store which we’ll be revealing in the near future, so stay tuned!

Check out the answers below:

**1. How will ETH 2.0 affect layer 2 solutions like Polygon when implemented? Should investors be concerned?** 

Once ETH 2.0 goes live, the root chain nodes will be relieved of their computational efforts as all computation will be done on commit chains like Polygon with the help of Rollups and the Merkel root will be periodically submitted to the root chain. This process along with Sharding will help reduce the cost and increase the speed of transactions, so it is a win-win situation for Ethereum nodes and Layer 2 solutions. 

 **2. Is there a mobile-based Matic/Polygon wallet? Is there another wallet that we may use like Metamask, Coinbase, Trust Wallet to interact with Dapps on the polygon network?**

There are no mobile-based Polygon wallets at the moment. The various wallets that allow interactions with Dapps on the Polygon network are: Metamask, Arkane, Formatic, Portis, Torus and wallet connect. 

**3. Does Polygon manage DeFi admin platform keys? If so, does this mean they have access to the crypto assets?**

No, our team doesn't manage admin keys for any DeFi platforms built on Polygon. 

**4. For a crypto newbie, what does the full-scale polygon have to offer for investors? Will this bring lower swapping fees? Also, when could we see Coinbase staking?**

Low gas fees are very important for the next million users to onboard into DeFi - this will allow all categories of investors with even a hundred dollars to use blue-chip protocols like Aave and Curve. High throughput blockchain allows Web3 and Gaming applications to scale to a hundred thousand users here. 

**5. Moving funds to the network can be pricey from the Eth bridge, Asendex is amazing at allowing me directly able to deposit onto Polygon. Are there plans for other exchanges to follow suit similarly? Or is that something outside the scope of the project and more in the hands of the individual exchanges?**

I think it’s our responsibility as a scaling solution to create more avenues for investors to onboard into Polygon cheaply. Integrations like MXC, OKEx, and OkCoin are now live supporting $USDC withdrawals directly to the Polygon network. Bigger exchanges coming soon, increasing UX. 

**6. Does polygon have any interest in partnering with Cardano?**

Not in the near future.

**7. With a new blockchain created with the SDK, how it will use $MATIC tokens?**

$MATIC token will continue to be the gas token (near-future) and governance token to govern the multi-chain Ethereum.

**8.  Are you planning on adding an easy way to move NFT's to and from the Immutable X NFT Chain?**

Yes, integrations are coming soon there. 

**9. What’s the timeline for exchanges to implement L2 withdrawals? Moving assets via the bridge are still costly**

MXC, OKEx, OkCoin, and AscendEX are now live - more in the coming months. 

**10. Although OpenSea supports Polygon, it is not as full-featured as the Ethernet Mainnet version. When will it support more features? Or, do other NFT casting platforms with polygon support exist now?**

OpenSea is working on royalties and auctions, which should be available on Polygon soon. Additionally, Mintable is integrating with Polygon. Should be live soon.

11. **11. The issue is that as my HF was at 1.01 I was there trying to repay the loan I was getting JSON RPC errors over and over that prevented me from closing the loan and cause the liquidation, right in front of me ... I have been with Pablo (support with AAVE) they are not helping! I know it’s not the best place to ask, but I’m out of option, liquidation costs me + 100K AAVE support says it’s a Polygon issue and Polygon says to take it with AAVE. Thank you and sorry to ask this here, but as I said, I don’t know what to do.**

Sincerely sorry to hear this. During flash crashes, public RPCs are under immense load and these kinds of issues are there. DeFi and the tooling around it are still very early, and we are working with the best players to improve the standards. Having said that, please check this documentation [https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/network](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/network). I would urge you to dedicate a free RPC URL with Infura, MaticVigil, or QuickNode. :)

**12. Hi Polygon team! I love participating in various projects on the Polygon network because of the low gas fees. I learned one $50 lesson on Ethereum, but have learned at least a hundred lessons on Polygon for less than $1! Really the toughest part of using the network is getting my established assets ONTO the network. It seems I either eat gas/exchange fees or lose a similar percentage due to spots of low liquidity along the way. Are there any plans to simplify/streamline this flow? Thanks for all that your team is doing.**

The cheapest way to onboard assets from ETH-Polygon is via BSC. Move your X token to BSC via Binance and swap for $USDC. Then use [xpollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/) or [EvoDefi](https://evo-matic.com/bridge?token=USDC) to move $USDC to Polygon for 0.2 dollars. Total fees under 5 dollars. 

**13.  To add an ERC-20 token on the mapped Matic page, it asks me an eth address should I need to post my ERC-20  token at the eth network before adding Matic?**

Yes, the mapping works by connecting your ETH token to the Polygon side of the ERC20 token. If you don’t have an ETH ERC20 token, you can go ahead and mint it directly here. 

**14. As income generation is essential to valuation, how does Polygon plan to generate income over the short term/long term?** 

As with the case of all crypto startups, token appreciation is how we maintain our treasury and fund all developments and expansion efforts. 

**15. Many people lately have been skeptical about Polygon's multi-sig 5 of 8 admin key being insecure. What is Polygon's response to this?**

The multi-sig is held by some of the most respectable members of the DeFi and blockchain community. We believe in gradually decentralizing and moving to an algorithmic governance model, but that’s in the future.

**16. How can I use polygon for prediction market and video streaming? Can anyone in your team help in achieving these goals?**

Sure, you should check [Polymarket](https://blog.polygon.technology/project-spotlight-polymarket-the-biggest-decentralized-prediction-market-in-blockchain-acee977513e4), [SportX](https://medium.com/sportx-bet/introducing-sx-network-e3f4d8efe0e), and [Augur](https://awesomepolygon.com/augur/). These are some of the biggest prediction markets in crypto, and all are built on Polygon. Low gas fees, meta transactions, high throughput, and fiat onramps allow for a seamless web2 like experience on the blockchain.

**17. The recent Iron finance disaster showed that polygon struggled to handle a large volume of transactions when users needed it the most. Iron finance will not be the last large disaster that we encounter. What is the team doing to make the network more robust and protect average users? The future and reputation of polygon require honest conversation and introspection about these incidents**

Yes, Iron Finance was a disaster and a big test for the network. But Polygon handled everything well, there were not many gas spikes, and the RPCs might have been an issue if you’re using public ones. Please sign up for QuickNode or Infura to get a dedicated plan.

**18. Hi, do you plan to update network stability? Is it possible at all? As presently network is often unstable and laggy, kind regards** 

RPCs might have been an issue if you’re using public ones. Please sign up for QuickNode or Infura to get a dedicated plan. You can find them [here](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/network/)

**19. Hi, where can I stake my $MATIC?** 

You can visit our staking page by clicking [here](https://wallet.matic.network/staking/). 

**20. What strategy do you use when you want to onboard new users, such as firstly providing all the possibilities that the technology can do or providing the basics and then signposting to the more elaborate capabilities afterwards?**

Baby steps are best in our opinion. Start small as a beginner, become a pro once you get a hang of things.

**21. What is Polygon's SWOT analysis in terms of overall position in the DeFi space? I'm also interested in your response to skeptics who suggest that MATIC is nothing special in a rapidly expanding ""internet of blockchains"" (**[**https://investorplace.com/2021/06/ask-right-question-with-matic-usd/**](https://investorplace.com/2021/06/ask-right-question-with-matic-usd/) **)**

Polygon is a suite of Ethereum scaling solutions - currently live with Plasma and PoS chains. Both are battle-tested and production-ready, with DApps building and thriving. We recently announced our SDK - allowing projects to build their own chain, [SportX](https://medium.com/sportx-bet/introducing-sx-network-e3f4d8efe0e) went live as the first user, and the Data Availability solution called [AVAIL](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-avail-by-polygon-a-robust-general-purpose-scalable-data-availability-layer-98bc9814c048) will play a major role in scaling Rollups. You can find more details on our [website](https://polygon.technology/).   
DeFi will definitely be cross-chain in the near future, and Polygon is building capabilities to cater to this."

# A. Intro

&amp;#x200B;

I thought for a long time for a concise way to describe this series. Unfortunately for you, I am ape-tarded and no matter how hard I tried, this kept repeating in my head. I apologize in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

([Begin drum loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgLcJFad90I))

Nobody: Hey Nydus, can you tell us a bedtime story?

Ok, heeerrre we go:

Once upon a time not long ago

When people went long and invested slow

When laws were stern and justice stood

And people were investin' like they ought to: good

There was little Gabe who his broke bread

With another Kenny boy and this is what he said:

""Me, you and Steve are gonna make some G's

Shorting inelastic curves and makin' FTDs""

&amp;#x200B;

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# B. Assumptions

*SHORTS HAVE NOT COVERED*

Before I get into this one, read these excerpts from Finnerty's paper:

&gt;""Naked short selling and manipulating the price downward provide cash returns to the manipulator, who can withdraw cash from his clearing firm account as the shorted shares are marked to market at progressively lower prices. Through naked shorting, the manipulator realizes these returns without investing any cash (provided the market price never rises above the  sale price)."" (Pg. 34, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The clearing firm retains the cash proceeds from the short sale to secure the selling broker’s delivery obligation. The clearing firm releases cash equal to the reduction in value of the shorted shares as the price of the shares declines (or demands additional cash margin if the share price rises)."" (Pg. 34, footnote 51)

Yes, you read that correctly. Naked short selling is pretty much FREE MONEY. On top of this, finance is OBSESSED with maximization. Finnerty mentions it frequently, and the calculus behind all this stuff is pretty maximization problems.

What I'm saying is, we're familiar with Citadel and Co.'s natural inclination towards all consuming greed has been further sharpened by mathematical indoctrination. Ultimately, Kenny and Co. maximize their profit by never closing their FTDs. Why would they? Who was gonna check?

There is also a mathematical basis:

&gt;""The manipulator maximizes his profit by...naked shorting *P(3)* close to zero. The manipulator should sell short *A/(3B)* shares at time 1 resulting in *P(1) = 2A/3*...He should sell short an additional *A/(3B)* shares at time 2...The manipulator drives *P(3)* close to zero by adjusting the short position to *L/B* shares. If *L &gt; 2A/3*, the manipulator will increase his short position; otherwise, he will decrease it.""(Pg. 55, par. 1)

The only scenario where they could've reduced their position would conflict with our known Janurary SI. This also makes the calculations much more simple, as I don't have to worry about subtracting shares covered.

Along with this, Finnerty also describes a situation that might sound familiar:

&gt;""...suppose the manipulator realizes at time 2 that the firm’s share price the next period will be H, rather than L as originally expected, say, due to favorable developments in the firm’s business. Suppose further that the securities regulators or the clearing house require all securities dealers to clear up all fails to deliver. The manipulator would face potentially large losses on his short sales. By short selling an additional 2A/(3B) shares at time 2, he can drive the share price close to zero"" (Pg. 56, par. 3)

The quantity *2A/3B* is double the amount the manipulator usually sells at time 2, which indicates to me that they have to increase the magnitude of their attack to compensate. Past the Sneeze, I don't see how they would keep up such aggressive price suppression without increasing their position, especially when it was undeniable that this was a high value company.

&amp;#x200B;

*MONOPOLY MARKET*

Citadel and Co.'s market marking privileges have allowed them to form a monopoly on GME shares. They are the only suppliers. They have full direct control of quantity of output and indirect control over price. Assuming monopoly market simplifies calculations in that we do not have to consider actions from other players.

&amp;#x200B;

*INELASTIC DEMAND CURVE*

Basically, this means that the quantity demanded does not change much in response to a change in price and demand will at least stay constant. Throughout my calculations, only the inelastic value consistently provided reasonable answers. This also makes sense as we know even before the Sneeze there were diamond hands who knew the ~~value~~ **deep fucking value** of the company. From what I got, it appears that the only time apes had an elastic demand curve was when they turned off the buy button. 

&amp;#x200B;

*NO SUPPLY CURVE, ONLY DEMAND*

Biggest thing I discovered is that short selling in general is that it defies the very law of supply. Instead of a producer supplying less as the price gets lower, naked short sellers supply more as the price gets lower. They can afford to since, until recently, naked short selling had zero cost.

On top of this, monopolies do not have supply curves. This lack of a supply curve makes a monopoly’s output decision dependent on the shapes of its marginal cost curve and the market demand curve.

Because those reasons, I assume that price behavior over time is highly related to market demand, in that the elasticity (normalized/unitless) from the Price vs.Time charts is analogous to the elasticity on the market demand curve (Price vs. Quantity)

[Elasticity Assumption](https://preview.redd.it/dhddnm6a32a71.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cea57adf59d86cc879d0a35d92b687439e97174)

&amp;#x200B;

*DOUBLE-HALF CONJECTURE*

The paper lays out the general strategy of a manipulator who is aggressively naked shorting a stock. Basically, the manipulator naked shorts a certain amount of shares based on a formula taking into account current market price, various probabilities, etc, etc. By the end of the paper, Finnerty proves mathematically that the manipulator must naked short at least as many shares as the firm has outstanding in order to short a companies price **close to zero, not zero**!. Side note, the reason its not zero is because: 

&gt;""The manipulated price could be less than a penny if market convention allows quotations in a fraction of a cent, as for example the OTCBB market does"" (Pg. 11, footnote 21)

**Anyway, the point is this strategy of shorting usually leaves a pattern. The first attack drops the price by about one-third (\~33%), the second cuts that price in half (\~50%) and the third kicks it down close to zero. Around the time the price is cut in half the manipulator has naked shorted the same amount of shares outstanding.**

&gt; ""If *L &gt; A/3*, the manipulator will naked short more shares than the firm has outstanding. The share price is *P(2) = A/3*, which is half what it was at time 1.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""...if *L = A/3*, then the manipulator would naked short the same number of shares the firm has outstanding, doubling the float. He would halve the short position at time 3 to *A/(3B)*, restoring it to what it was at time 1. The strategic fail substantially decreases at the same time the share price declines because the intrinsic value of the shares decreases.""

Going on this I assume that every time the price is approximately cut in half, the naked short seller has doubled the shares in existence.

&amp;#x200B;

*PROFIT STRATEGY*

They started short selling on the inelastic part of the demand curve. Normally, a monopoly wants to work on the elastic part of the demand curve. However, if you naked short sell an elastic curve the price will drop quicker with less shares shorted. I think its possible that Short, Shorter &amp; Co. figured they could maximize profit by naked short selling on an inelastic demand curve, as they could short more shares over time since it takes more short shares to affect an inelastic demand curve.

# C. Duration &amp; Timeline

Einstein said the only infinite things are the universe and human stupidity. Were he alive today I'd ask him if he could human greed as well. To truly grasp how greedy, I'll run you through my estimation of the total duration of their short postion until the Sneeze.

From the price action, it looks Short, Shorter &amp; Co. opened their short position approximately December 2015, going until December 2020 is:

* 5 calendar years
* 3.45 trading years
* 868 trading days

(Note: there about 252 trading days in a year. Almost exactly 69 percent (lol) of a calendar year)

I wanted to start with general data, so I eyeballed the Google chart of GME and these immediately stood out to me. We will be looking at the following dates (all approximate!):

* Time 0, October 30 2015. Initial conditions, price was approximately $46.14
* Time 1, July 29, 2016. Price dropped approximately 33% from about $46.14 and leveled out around $30.76
* Time 2, April 6, 2018. Price dropped by approximately 50 percent from $30.76 and leveled out around $15.38
* Time 3, Aug. 9 2019. Price dropped 75 percent from approximately $15.38 and leveled out around $3.85

# F. Conclusion

Notice how that by time 2, when the price halves they had shorted more shares then shares outstanding.

Additionally, the best estimate we have of pre-Sneeze SI is from the Robinhood filing that lists \~225%. The average value was consistent with that. 

I used this timeframe of estimates as a calibration of sorts and the model seems to hold here.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.
FlashL1ght Wallet App-
The DeFi space has exploded on the development end, with revolutionary blockchain technology re-defining finance, however millions of consumers and investors alike are missing out on the benefits of decentralized finance, simply because the initial learning curve is too steep. The FlashL1ght will illuminate void, demystifying the magical DeFi space.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***

Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.

We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.
FlashL1ght Wallet App-
The DeFi space has exploded on the development end, with revolutionary blockchain technology re-defining finance, however millions of consumers and investors alike are missing out on the benefits of decentralized finance, simply because the initial learning curve is too steep. The FlashL1ght will illuminate void, demystifying the magical DeFi space. Users will enjoy access to an abundance of tokens and cryptocurrencies available through the integrated 1inch API, seamlessly purchasing crypto with fiat payments in-app through MoonPay, a built in dApp explorer, the ability to add custom tokens, and even interacting directly with the L1ght L1st protocol, through one simplified app.

Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.
FlashL1ght Wallet App-
The DeFi space has exploded on the development end, with revolutionary blockchain technology re-defining finance, however millions of consumers and investors alike are missing out on the benefits of decentralized finance, simply because the initial learning curve is too steep. The FlashL1ght will illuminate void, demystifying the magical DeFi space. Users will enjoy access to an abundance of tokens and cryptocurrencies available through the integrated 1inch API, seamlessly purchasing crypto with fiat payments in-app through MoonPay, a built in dApp explorer, the ability to add custom tokens, and even interacting directly with the L1ght L1st protocol, through one simplified app.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.
FlashL1ght Wallet App-
The DeFi space has exploded on the development end, with revolutionary blockchain technology re-defining finance, however millions of consumers and investors alike are missing out on the benefits of decentralized finance, simply because the initial learning curve is too steep. The FlashL1ght will illuminate void, demystifying the magical DeFi space. Users will enjoy access to an abundance of tokens and cryptocurrencies available through the integrated 1inch API, seamlessly purchasing crypto with fiat payments in-app through MoonPay, a built in dApp explorer, the ability to add custom tokens, and even interacting directly with the L1ght L1st protocol, through one simplified app.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.
FlashL1ght Wallet App-
The DeFi space has exploded on the development end, with revolutionary blockchain technology re-defining finance, however millions of consumers and investors alike are missing out on the benefits of decentralized finance, simply because the initial learning curve is too steep. The FlashL1ght will illuminate void, demystifying the magical DeFi space. Users will enjoy access to an abundance of tokens and cryptocurrencies available through the integrated 1inch API, seamlessly purchasing crypto with fiat payments in-app through MoonPay, a built in dApp explorer, the ability to add custom tokens, and even interacting directly with the L1ght L1st protocol, through one simplified app.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

The Problem-
In search of moon shots, we scoured the web day and night for promising tokens that had legitimate utility and hadn’t been listed anywhere major yet. There were few and far between. In six months we came exactly one token on presale with a market cap under ten million with legitimate long term value and well developed code. Unfortunately the vast majority of heavily marketed coins are meme coins, which are rug pulls by nature, even when not done maliciously. We knew there had to be a way to filter irrelevant tokens and get the same early access to innovative projects that large scale investors have, without the projects seeking us out directly. Vote manipulation made public platforms unreliable, and hundreds of ""meme"" coins launch any given day. There was no solution. So we made one.
Well what's wrong with looking for IDOs?
Like all investments, young crypto currencies pose significant risks, but one seemingly unique to these assets, and even more so to IDOs, is that anyone can create their own token, and launch it on any DEX, with absolutely no screening, and simultaneously pop up a website template, copy and paste a professional white paper and some catchy tech jargon, and while everyone is rushing to catch the next big thing, that sounds and looks incredible, the malicious token holder pulls all of their liquidity, shuts everything down, and leaves tens to thousands of investors high and dry. The sad reality is that in the very first quarter of 2021 alone, over $50 million was reported lost to crypto scams throughout the United States, and that’s completely ignoring the amount of “good ideas” that launch and cost investors millions when they tank due to bad leadership and/or poor execution. Right now the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is unregulated and subject to millions, if not billions of dollars more in unnecessary losses if a solution is not implemented.
Can't I just use a central exchange?
Currently, the only way anyone can trust that they are getting a truly valuable token, is through buying one through a CEX. While on the surface this is the traditional way of doing things, there are thousands of crypto startups with brilliant ideas and excellent minds working on them that can’t get past the barriers provided by central exchanges. The primary barrier to being listed on a central exchange is money. Large, reputable exchanges charge anywhere from thousands to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies trying to get their cryptos listed, and without excellent seed funding at the cost of a large presale of their token to select large investors, it doesn’t matter how perfect your product is, you can’t get listed, and if a developer can’t get their project listed, it’s dead in the water.
The L1ght Solution:
Rather than create large financial barriers to ensure high quality listings, we leave the governance of our listings to you, the people. Through a series of complex protocols and smart contracts, users can utilize L1ght to determine how many Seeds turn to Sprouts, which Seeds turn to Sprouts, how much liquidity must be allocated for L1ght Shining rewards, and how much of the proprietary crypto must be staked alongside the Seed through its lifecycle. By allowing users to dictate which Seeds turn to Sprouts, we create a completely decentralized filter, which provides the listing credibility of a CEX, and the broad user accessibility of a DEX, along with an innovative path to elevated exposure. This will attract developers with responsible financial standing, and retail investors seeking trustworthy startups who have been screened by millions of potential users before being allowed to list.

Our Vision- 
It’s been a long time dream of ours to find a platform where non-career investors could dip their toes in the world of investing, while making meaningful gains. Before the blockchain this was impossible. Investing in strong up and coming companies was a right reserved to accredited investors at major firms. Because of this, publicly owned institutions we depend on are governed by shareholders with their bottom lines in mind. Innovation is stalled to maximize profits, fees are hiked as high as they can force users to pay, and every decision is made with profit margins for the 1% in mind. We have a unique opportunity to change this with L1ght L1st, and we look forward to seeing our vision through with each and every one of you. We no longer need to let the future unfold around us, we will be participating in it.
FlashL1ght Wallet App-
The DeFi space has exploded on the development end, with revolutionary blockchain technology re-defining finance, however millions of consumers and investors alike are missing out on the benefits of decentralized finance, simply because the initial learning curve is too steep. The FlashL1ght will illuminate void, demystifying the magical DeFi space. Users will enjoy access to an abundance of tokens and cryptocurrencies available through the integrated 1inch API, seamlessly purchasing crypto with fiat payments in-app through MoonPay, a built in dApp explorer, the ability to add custom tokens, and even interacting directly with the L1ght L1st protocol, through one simplified app.

Abstract- 
At its core, L1ght L1st aims to offer users a Decentralized Listing Service exclusively designed for listing Initial Harvest Offerings (IHOs) with the same listing credibility as Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) found on large Central Exchanges (CEX), without all of the corporate interference and hidden fees; as well as offer a unique platform to Start Ups, where they can deploy their exceptional IHOs to a larger audience without having to spend thousands, to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting listed on a reputable site. This bridge allows everyday investors the same access to the innovation powering tomorrow usually reserved for large hedge-funds, and developers the same market exposure typically reserved for multi-million dollar companies. 
L1ght- L1ghtL1st uses our native token L1ght to identify outstanding projects and simultaneously filter out malicious and redundant cash grabs through a three phase process, known as an initial Harvest offer, governed exclusively by users. As the native token of the L1ght L1st platform, L1ght can be earned through various forms of participation in the platform protocol, or via staking within the wallet.
Seeds: Promising developers submit their early projects as Seeds at the beginning of every week. Seeds are listed Sunday-Saturday, during which time investors are encouraged to research and thoroughly audit the platform, marketing strategies, code reviews, and market validation for the listed projects. After researching each listed project investors ""shine light"" on the Seeds that they believe have the most promise or potential. At the end of each week, the top performing Seeds turn into Sprouts, while the rest are dismissed and returned to their owners wallets. 
Sprouts: Successful Seeds are passed along into our Sprout listing page and organized by how much L1ght was shined on them during their Seed phase, ensuring users see the most sought after investments first and eliminating vote manipulation. A finite amount of tokens are sold for the Sprouts at a fixed and predetermined price for 28 days, or until supply runs out. After the Sprout phase, they then move on to be Harvested for L1ght.
Harvest- Users who have acquired Sprouts may hold them for their long term value, or they can provide liquidity for our Harvest pools. This enables users on a variety of aggregation platforms to access the Sprouts in exchange for more L1ght to shine on more Seeds. In doing so, users are helping the Seed projects they believe in the most build and sustain for long term growth.
Goals-
For Investors: New investors will find our platform to be a non-intimidating gateway to the exciting world of decentralized finance, where they will find easy access to the most promising up and coming companies on our Sprouts page with absolutely no technical knowledge and minimal research required prior to investing. Just buy from the top and hold on for dear life while you experience the rollercoaster of growing with a startup.
More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***

More confident investors will enjoy shaping the future of the crypto-sphere through utilization of our underlying token L1ght. Investors will be able to browse our Seed submission pages and “shine” L1ght on the projects they see the most promise in, then at the end of each week, top performing projects Sprout. When projects Sprout the investors who shined their L1ght on them are rewarded a small portion of the new token, and the remaining allocation is open for purchase.
For Developers: Developers who list successful Seeds will enjoy massive exposure through our Sprouts page, a platform to earn fundraising, and long term liquidity across a variety of Decentralized Exchanges through our Harvest pools. While there are many platforms to launch from out there, many of them require excessive fees as well as outrageous amounts of locked liquidity, and ultimately are more beneficial to the service providers than to the investors or developers trusting them. L1ght L1st aims to provide an accessible platform for strong projects with long-term utility, without stripping the developers of any control of their projects, all while being cost effective for tight budgets.
Specifications-
L1ghtL1st uses three unique phases to mitigate risk, identify profitable investments, and facilitate long term success of projects, all through utilization of the remarkable L1ght token. We do so through use of a widespread community driven filter during the Seed phase, unbiased ranking during the Sprout phase, and user provided liquidity during the Harvest phase.
L1ght Breakdown
L1ght Basics
L1ght is a unique token built on the Binance Smart Chain under the bep20 standard, with multichain functionality integrated in through smart bridge technology to ensure no additional token issuance necessary for scaling across networks. 25 million L1ght tokens will be minted and immediately distributed accordingly, while the other 25 million are minted and distributed over a course of 5 years at a pace of 5 million a year, allowing ample opportunity for investors to get their share before the token is fully distributed.

Staking L1ght
L1ght holders can stake their L1ght on a number of L1ght L1st governance protocols such as the number of Seeds to Sprout each week (between 5 and 10), what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for L1ght Shiners each week (between 5% and 10%), and what portion of new Seeds must be allocated for liquidity in the Harvest pool (between 5% and 10%). Flexible governance is just one of the ways L1ght can be utilized to ensure only high quality Seeds are able to Sprout each week, but L1ght also has measurable intrinsic value when it shines.

Shining L1ght
This is the true value of this entire platform, and the grand filter that wasn’t possible prior to the blockchain. Users anonymously shine L1ght on Seeds, doing so locks away that allocation of L1ght until the end of the week, when the Seed either Sprouts or dies. If that Seed Sprouts, all users who shined L1ght on a particular Seed are rewarded by the tokens allocated to L1ght shiners proportional to their stake in the Seed. To prevent bandwagoning on Seeds, users will not be able to see a Seeds L1ght allocation until it Sprouts, nor will they be able to move their L1ght once it’s staked, although they are encouraged to stake on as many Seeds as they desire with the L1ght they hold. This reward system promotes research on each Seed, as users are naturally inclined to shine as much L1ght as possible on Seeds they see the least risk in, alongside the most upward potential. Users are encouraged to post about malicious/generic code, and suspicious Seeds in our Telegram discussion at https://t.me/L1ghtL1stDiscussion or on https://www.reddit.com/r/L1ghtL1st to alert others as early as possible, ensuring they don’t Sprout.
L1ght Distribution and Minting
The L1ght token was first minted on July 07-2021 at 04:49:25 AM +UTC with an initial supply of 25,000,000 tokens, and continued at a pace of 5,000,000 a year, starting January 1st of 2022 through 2026, for a total of 50,000,000 tokens distributed throughout each year.

*** It is important to note, in order to protect investors from whale dumping, the long term early backer rewards are distributed each year in proportion to how much is being held in their wallets at the time of distribution. If backers have no tokens in the wallets they used to purchase their presale tokens, they will need to update their wallet address, or they will not have new tokens distributed to them, similarly, if they acquire more through purchase over the years, their portion of the backer distribution will proportionately increase.***
Phase Breakdown
Seeds
In order for a token to be listed, it must pass through our exclusive “Seed” phase. Developers wishing to launch their IHO through our platform must provide 15-45% of their total token supply as well as a small amount of the proprietary token of the chain they wish to launch on in order to pay gas fees through the phases. The Seed page updates the listings with new Seeds organized in random order every Sunday, after which they have until Saturday for L1ght holders to shine their L1ght on. On the following Sunday, the top 5-10 Seeds (as determined through site governance) with L1ght shined on them are moved to our Sprouts page to be sold while a small allocation is distributed among the L1ght shiners (5-10% of the supplied liquidity, inversely to the amount of Seeds Sprouting each week)  and the amount of tokens reserved for the Harvest pool (5-10% of the supplied liquidity), as  new Seeds are planted for users to shine their L1ght on.
Sprouts
As Seeds grow into Sprouts, an allocated amount of their new token is dispersed among users who staked their L1ght on the Seed, and  the provided proprietary cryptocurrency (ETH/BNB/MATIC) goes to paying transaction fees for activating each of the new smart contracts. The Sprouts are then listed on their designated page, organized by default according to the amount of L1ght shined on them as Seeds so users are able to see what other investors considered the most promising listings first, placed for sale in a smart contract at a fixed and predesignated price for 28 days, where individual users can buy up to 5% of the provided liquidity, allowing at least 20 users individual access to any given IHO. At the end of 28 days, the Sprout is ready for Harvest, and no longer available at its fixed Sprout prices.
Harvest
The last phase of a seeds life-cycle is the Harvest. This generates a new liquidity pool, the preallocated portion of the tokens, along with whatever wasn’t sold in the sprout phase, are staked alongside the remainder the proprietary chain token provided, and locked for seven more days, at the end of which the token provider may withdraw their stake, or leave it. Liquidity pools generated in the Harvest are permanently fed into multiple DEX aggregators (making them more accessible than any CEX), and are open to all users to provide liquidity, as this will be the primary source to receive newly minted L1ght, so-as to allocate as much governing power as possible to investors that are earning and purchasing Sprouts, and benefiting from high quality listings. By the time all the L1ght has been minted, 20% will be dispersed to our liquidity providers at no direct expense to them.

**ALPHARETTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / July 8, 2021 /** **RushNet, Inc (OTC PINK:RSHN)**, (""the Company"") is pleased to announce the acquisition of **heliosDX** was closed and effective July 1, 2021.

heliosDX  is a National Clinical Reference Laboratory offering High-Complexity  Urine Drug Testing (UDT), Behavioral Drug Testing, Allergy Droplet  Cards, Oral Fluids, Infectious Disease (PCR), and NGS Genetic Testing.  This acquisition brings significant value to RushNet, Inc and its  shareholders.

&amp;#x200B;

heliosDX had annual revenues in 2019 of $2,639,454.58, 2020 of $4,294,435.82, and in 2021 through the 2nd  Quarter of $2,827,582.50. heliosDX expects their current trends to hold  and should meet their stretch goal of $6,000,000 for 2021. The company  is profitable and has seen profits continue to grow right alongside the  revenue growth. The company is also under a Binding Letter of Intent to  acquire a privately held Laboratory slated to close late 3rd Quarter or early 4th Quarter. This acquisition will immediately bring heliosDX annual revenues to over $16,000,000 with a tremendous upside.

The  combined operations vastly increase the heliosDX specimen capacity,  sales representatives, and creates room for future growth in their  infectious disease business, which is expected to outpace toxicology  within 12 months. In a separate transaction, the company is seeking to  purchase the building that the private company currently occupies, which  includes an empty space attached for future expansion. This first  acquisition should yield annual revenues for heliosDX of $25,000,000  after a full 12 months of combined operations. We believe, as we  continue to grow organically, along with acquisitions, we can reach and  exceed $50,000,000 in annual revenue within two years.

Currently,  heliosDX is in Alpharetta, GA which will remain the laboratory  headquarters after the acquisition of the private laboratory. The  company also just negotiated a new lease in Orange Park, Florida  (Oakleaf Area) to open executive offices with an anticipated opening  date of August 1, 2021. heliosDX recently announced via their Twitter  page ([https://twitter.com/dx\_helios](https://pr.report/ouL14OAh)) they are actively seeking board members and expect to announce members throughout the 3rd Quarter.

heliosDX  is launching a National Sales Campaign utilizing Verb's interactive  technology and hired a Director of Virtual Sales to run this platform.  This platform is anticipated to begin on August 1, 2021. We believe this  platform will significantly increase the company's ability to reach new  clients at a fraction of the cost across the country. In late June  2021, heliosDX extended an offer to hire a Chief Operations Officer  (COO), which has been accepted with a start date of August 2, 2021.  Other executive positions are currently being explored and formal job  postings will be made available on the company's [LinkedIn business page](https://pr.report/k6f3Vr5F).

RushNet,  Inc and heliosDX have significant plans to reduce the current share  structure. We are not prepared at this time to disclose the nature of  this reduction but can confirm it is not through a Reverse Split (RS).

The ABCs of Retirement Investment Accounts,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/ogxomn/the_abcs_of_retirement_investment_accounts/,milehighfinanceguy,1,2021-07-09 23:16:00,3,/r/investing_discussion/comments/ogxomn/the_abcs_of_retirement_investment_accounts/,NaN,"## The ABCs of Retirement Investment Accounts: A Beginners Guide to Traditional or Roth, IRA or 401(k), Taxable or Tax Preferred Accounts 

Have you ever wondered if there was an instruction manual that covered investment accounts for retirement savings? Something that you could easily read and get the basic gist of things? Well, then today is your lucky day! I will outline the different types of retirement investment accounts and how they work through today’s post!  


Now to discuss investment accounts, we must start with the basics: There are two types of retirement accounts in Uncle Sam’s eyes: Tax Preferential and After-tax accounts (i.e., non-tax preferential). 

### Tax Preferential

Tax Preferential accounts have two primary flavors: Tax-deferred and tax-upfront accounts, which commonly are referred to as pre-tax or traditional, and Roth. With pre-tax accounts, you make a contribution that is deducted from your income (whether through your paychecks or on your tax returns). With these traditional accounts, you make contributions that you have not paid taxes on. They grow without taxes incurred (i.e., they stay tax-deferred) up until the time you withdraw them.   


The second type of preferential tax account is the Roth flavor, which, when used, requires you to pay your taxes now. However, your money is then allowed to go into the account, and in exchange for giving Uncle Sam his cut upfront, he won’t tax you when you take it out. Now that is what I call a sweet deal!

To further illustrate these concepts, I now introduce the three Ds:

*Deductions, Deferrals, &amp; Dues*

Deductions and deferrals relate to tax-deferred accounts. The fact that you get to deduct money from your taxable income now, paired with the ability to defer the gains until later, makes these outstanding accounts for tax purposes. Trade as frequently as you like (though you probably shouldn’t)!

For Roth accounts, you pay your dues (i.e., taxes) upfront, and then you can invest and trade *however* you want and never worry about taxes again.  


Hence the three D’s save you the burden of dealing with taxes whenever you receive dividends, interest, or trade within your account. \[Check out these articles if you need a refresher on dividends, interest, or gains\]

How do you choose between tax-deferred and Roth? Simply put with tax-deferred accounts, you are betting that your tax rate will be *lower* in retirement. With Roth accounts, you are betting your tax rate will be *higher* in retirement. Do you know the answer to this question? Some people will likely be able to deduce this to a certain degree, but no one will ever know unless they have a crystal ball. Why do I say this? Well, it is because the wild card at play is that the government can and may change our tax rates down the road; thus we will never know! Now this doesn’t mean that we cannot make an educated guess, which is the topic for our next post! \[[Link](https://milehighfinanceguy.com/traditional-or-roth/)\]  


You now know the fundamental differences between the two significant types of preferential tax accounts, so what about non-tax preferential accounts? Well, the name after-tax may be misleading when it comes to taxes, but we will get that later! So let us start with the basics first.

### After-Tax/Non-Preferential Accounts

Tax non-preferential accounts are most commonly referred to as (non-retirement) brokerage accounts. Simply put, whatever you do in these accounts will be taxed during that year. How does this work? 

When putting money into an after-tax account, you must first pay your taxes on these dollars, hence why it is called an after-tax (see the play on words?). In addition to paying taxes on these monies upfront, you create a reportable tax event whenever you trade within this account. Translation: If you make money, you owe taxes. If you lose money, you write it off on your taxes. The same applies to dividends and interest payments, too. These are just another fancy way of saying the word gains, and you will owe taxes on them in the year they are received. 

Who in their right mind would invest in an after-tax account then when you do not get a tax deduction, deferral, or tax-free guarantee in the future? I’m glad you asked, and the answer is simple: Everyone. Why? Preferential tax accounts have limits and rules that govern them, making them more restrictive when depositing and withdrawing your money from them.   


It sounds like a list is to highlight the benefits of after-tax accounts is in order:

•No limit on how much money you can save each year

•No penalty for withdrawing your money, ever

•Dividends are always taxed as long-term capital gains, which can be a lower tax rate

•Investments held for 12 months or longer are taxed as long-term capital gains 

•Losses are deductible on your tax return

Sounds pretty great, right? 

Well, you likely are now wondering about the rules and limits that govern preferential tax accounts. I agree that this is in order, but rather than a list, let’s talk about the actual account types and then cover the rules and restrictions since they vary. Once done, I will consolidate everything into a list just as I did above!   


### Employer &amp; Individual Tax-Deferred/Roth Accounts

#### 401(k) &amp; 403(b) Accounts

Employer preferential tax accounts are referred to as employer-sponsored retirement plans or defined contribution plans. These are boring names, though. You most likely know them as 401(k) and 403(b) accounts, and the chances are high that you have one! These fun names, 401(k) and 403(b), come from subsections in the tax code known as sections 401(k) and 403(b). These two subsections established the ability for preferential tax accounts to be created by for-profit and non-profit firms. Many companies did this so they could move away from offering pensions.

Whoa, who knew the tax code could be so exciting! Alright, jokes aside, these employer-sponsored accounts have substantially higher contribution limits than their individual tax-preferential counterparts. 

For people employed by firms offering these that are under the age of 50, they can put up to $19,500\* each year into these accounts on either a pre-tax or Roth basis (or even a combination of both up to that amount). Additionally, for those 50 and above, this amount goes up by an additional $6,500\* a year for a staggering $26,000\* in total. Notably, company match does not factor into these limits; it is considered separate. 

Okay, but what about people who do not have an employer-sponsored retirement account or are already maxing one out? Enter the many individual tax preferential retirement accounts: (The) Traditional &amp; Roth IRA, HSA &amp; more!

#### IRA Accounts

Commonly abbreviated as IRA, the Individual Retirement Account comes in the tax-deferred/pre-tax flavor known as the Traditional IRA. It also comes in the one-time, upfront tax flavor known as the Roth IRA. Now, these accounts have a combined annual limit of $6,000\* that you can contribute to in any combination of traditional and Roth. Plus, for those aged 50 or older, the limit raises by $1,000\* in either format; it ~~pays~~ saves to age!

Now we could spend an entire article discussing the differences between the 401(k) and IRA account types, but I already have created a post on that, which you can access here if you need help choosing between them \[[Link](https://milehighfinanceguy.com/401k-options/)\].  


As with anything in life, there are caveats. In the case of 401(k) and IRA accounts, if you make too much money in the eyes of Uncle Sam, then there are restrictions. These include not receiving traditional IRA deductions, being able to directly contribute to a Roth IRA, and or being allowed to contribute to your 401(k). More frequently, this applies to traditional and Roth IRA accounts. If it affects you in your 401(k), you will know (trust me). 

#### Quick cheat sheet for caveats of 401(k) &amp; IRA accounts:

•401(k) Bad news: You are considered a Highly Compensated Employee, and you are restricted by how much you are allowed to contribute to your company’s 401(k) plan (You will know if you are an HCE employee)

•Traditional IRA bad news: You make over $66,000\*, AND you have an employer that offers a 401(k) or 403(b). You do not get to take a deduction when your money goes into your traditional IRA. Any growth stays tax-deferred, but you lose the deduction advantage. You also have to file a form each year that tracks your amounts of nondeductible IRA contributions and their deferred tax growth. Can you say ick! No one likes government forms, no one. If you are married, the limit is $105,000 for the spouse(s) that has a 401(k)

•Roth IRA bad news: You make over $125,000\*. Sorry gals and guys, but you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. Well, not directly 🤐😉. A caveat for a caveat?! Caveat-inception. Additionally this limit raises to $198,000\* for married couples. \[To learn more about Backdoor Roth IRA Contributions, [click here](https://milehighfinanceguy.com/backdoor-roth/)\] 

•If you withdraw from any of these accounts before 59.5, you will pay a 10% penalty to the IRS.

For a complete list of IRA contribution income limits, please visit the IRS website. These limits actually start to phase out before being fully disqualified, but that is something the IRS covers; my purpose is to explain the basics!

### Other Individual Accounts

#### HSA

The HSA, i.e., Health Savings Account, is what some in the finance and tax industry refer to as the retirement super account. Why is this? Because the HSA takes tax preferential and puts it on steroids! 

Contributions go into an HSA tax-deferred. They then grow tax-deferred. Finally, so long as used for medical expenses at any point in your life, they are 100% tax-free when taken! This occurs even if you don’t have an HSA eligible health insurance plan any longer. 

 Whoa, Nelly! Hold onto your horse there, hotshot! 

As you can tell, I love the HSA account but let’s lay down the facts:

•Anyone can open an HSA account

•To *contribute* to an HSA, you *must* have a high deductible health insurance plan (HDHP for short) during the year in which you make a contribution

•You do not need to have an HDHP when you *use funds* or to *maintain* an HSA

•The annual limit is $3,600\* for individuals and 7,200\* for families

• Add an extra $1,000\* if you are over 55 

•If your spouse is on your HDHP, and is over 55, they can contribute $1,000 to their own HSA account (which will be covered in my future HSA post)

•HSA contributions that come directly out of your paycheck do not have FICA or Medicare taxes withheld, saving you an instant 7.5%; *no other account offers this, period*

•In NJ &amp; CA, there are exceptions to the deferred tax growth. If you live in either, I highly recommend you read up on it this subject or ask me to explain it in the comments below or in a future post

Now, if you are thinking to yourself, “But Mile High Finance Guy, I won’t have healthcare expenses in retirement!” Sure, you won’t 🙄. Jokes aside, if you somehow manage not to have medical expenses in retirement, once aged 65, funds can be withdrawn without penalty. Instead, you only pay income taxes since you are taking funds out for non-medical purposes. Now, if you want to withdraw before 65 for non-medical expenses, you can, but you will pay taxes plus a staggering 20% penalty. So don’t do it!

#### Self Employed Accounts

In addition to the HSA, the SEP-IRA and Self Employed 401(k) accounts exist for entrepreneurs. These accounts work similar to their standard counterparts mentioned above but have different contribution limits and finer nuances. Since most people do not fall into this category of self-employed, we will not cover these details in today’s post. However, if you want me to explain them, let me know in the comments below!

Alright, so we have covered the benefits and drawbacks of contributing to tax-preferred accounts. Anything further you should know? I’m glad you asked!

### The P-Word

Uh oh, that doesn’t sound good. 

Do you like giving away your money to the government? If you do, skip this section, but if you don’t, then the elephant in the room is the early withdrawal penalty. Basically, the IRS wants you to keep your money in a 401(k) or IRA-like account until you turn 59.5. Otherwise, they will slap a 10% penalty on top of ANY taxes you will owe when funds are withdrawn to discourage you from doing this.

As we covered early on, there are always caveats, and penalties are no different. There are several ways to access your money without giving Uncle Sam 10%. However, we will cover those in a future article on withdrawing from a retirement account without penalty. Tune in early retirees, those with kids, and those whose lives throw them curve balls!

### Summary

So as covered above, there are various reasons to contribute to tax preferential and non-preferential retirement accounts. Generally, what I would implore you to consider is to start with a 401(k) to get any company match of your contributions if one is provided. Company match, when provided, is free money. From there, save in whichever type or combination of types that fit your specific needs. For some people, withdrawal flexibility matters if they plan on early retirement and don’t want to be penalized. These folks should use non-preferential tax accounts AND tax-preferential accounts. Others may want the flexibility to buy a house with their money or help their kids out instead of just using them for living on in retirement. Situations can vary, but the chances are you should be using both types of accounts! Thanks for joining today; below are the points that I feel matter most.

#### Recap

•Non-preferential accounts (regular brokerage/investing accounts) have more flexibility for withdrawing from but incur taxes before the money may be needed

•Non-preferential accounts have no savings limit 

•Non-preferential accounts allow investments to be taxed as long-term capital gains (this may be more preferential depending on your income and tax situation)

•Non-preferential accounts can be used for additional purposes other than retirement if your plans change

•Tax preferential accounts (those with deferrals, deductions, or dues) take the stress out of repeatedly incurring taxes. You are taxed once on the front or back end, rather than continually

•Tax preferential accounts can save you substantial money if you trade frequently or have lower/higher tax rates in retirement compared to now

•Tax preferential accounts have more rules and nuances since Uncle Sam is providing you these benefits. These include penalties if you don’t follow them

•You can save in a 401(k), IRA, HSA, self-employed, and non-preferential tax account all at the same time

•Using one does not disqualify you from using the other, so use both depending on what you need

List of Retirement Accounts &amp; Annual Limits from IRS.gov as of 2021 Tax Year. For a guide as to what order to use these accounts, check out this [article](https://milehighfinanceguy.com/savings-hierarchy/)!

&amp;#x200B;

|Account|Limit|
|:-|:-|
|401(k) or 403(b)|$19,500 as pre-tax or Roth|
|*Catch-Up for those 50+ in 401(k) or 403(b)*|*$6,500 as pre-tax or Roth*|
|*401(k) or 403(b) maximum limit w/ standard limit, co contributions, &amp; after-tax*|*$58,000 or $64,500 for those 50+* |
|401(a) - Pre-tax or after-tax, growth is tax deferred|$58,000|
|IRA or Roth IRA|$6,000 as pre-tax, after-tax, or Roth|
|*Catch-Up for those 50+ in IRAs*|*$1,000 as* p*re-tax, after-tax, or Roth*|
|SEP-IRA or Self Employed 401(k) - Always pre-tax|$58,000 but depends on business revenues|
|HSA - Always pre-tax|$3,600 individual or $7,200 family|
|*HSA Catchup for those 55+*|*$1,000 per 55+ spouse*|
|457(b) for gov or non-profits - Always pre-tax|$19,500|
|*457(b) special catchup those within 3/yrs of retiring*|*$19,500 or amount not used prior years*|
|457(f) - Always pre-tax|No limit - can be forfeited|
|Non-Gov 457 Top Hat Plans - Always pre-tax|No limit - can disappear if company goes bankrupt|
|Non-tax preferential accounts - Always after-tax|No limit|
|Whole Life Insurance or Deferred annuities|No limit|

*Note: For 401(k), 403(b), and SE-401(k) accounts, they are inclusive of a single $58,000/$64,500 limit. This single limit is separate of the SEP-IRA $58,000, meaning one could do both limits if they have the financial means*

\*As of 2021 tax year contribution limits, this figure can and will change in the future, and I will do my best to update when it does, but this information is provided as-is.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# C. Additional Assumptions

The full list of my assumptions can be found in Ep. 1. See links at top of post.

*SHORT ATTACK MAGNITUDE IS ALWAYS MAXIMUM*

In the last post, I mentioned an excerpt from Finnerty's paper, which should sound familiar:

&gt;""...suppose the manipulator realizes at time 2 that the firm’s share price the next period will be *H*, rather than *L* as originally expected, say, due to favorable developments in the firm’s business. Suppose further that the securities regulators or the clearing house require all securities dealers to clear up all fails to deliver. The manipulator would face potentially large losses on his short sales. By short selling an additional *2A/(3B)* shares at time 2, he can drive the share price close to zero."" (Pg. 56, par. 3)

The quantity *2A/3B* is double the amount the manipulator usually sells at time 2, which indicates to me that they have to increase the magnitude of their short attacks to compensate for the change to a higher value. I will not be using the quantity strategy described above as its mathematical parameters are different, but the I feel the circumstantial similarity provides reasonable basis to assume that during and after the Sneeze, they were always shorting the maximum amount of shares.

With all this in mind, and the fact that GME is a *H* company, I will no longer calculate/use variable *L*.

&amp;#x200B;

*ELASTIC DEMAND CURVE*

This assumptions ONLY applies to during the Sneeze as a result of them turning off the buy button. Using the elastic coefficient resulted in the lowest reasonable estimates as well. This makes sense as they can manipulate an elastic demand curve with less shares.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# D. Price Pattern

With buy pressure pretty much neutralized. Its hard for me to judge the how much each contributed to price drop. I tried to identify if there were any clear trends. **The first attack dropped price by 40 percent (normally it drops 33 percent), the second by 60 percent (normally it drops 50 percent) and the third by 40 percent (normally takes price close to zero)**. Not too much deviation, in fact, I expected more, but I assume that letting us buy limited amounts of shares on the way down stiffened out demand curve a little to maximize their profit.

All credit goes to [u/nydus\_erdos](https://www.reddit.com/user/nydus_erdos/). This is part two of his series, both posts are top tier IMO and deserve more love. You can find them here:

The TLDR is that u/nydus_erdos is using the Finnerty formula to estimate the total number of cumulative shorted shares and the total SI up to the Jan ""sneeze"". SPOILER ALLERT: the number of shares will jack your tits into the thermosphere.

Steve Keen's alternate reality strawman of mainstream economics,https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/oi9frl/steve_keens_alternate_reality_strawman_of/,smalleconomist,1,2021-07-12 02:07:52,37,/r/badeconomics/comments/oi9frl/steve_keens_alternate_reality_strawman_of/,NaN,"[Podcast with Steve Keen.](https://outline.com/JwsCrx)

The podcast is a bit lengthy, so I'll just focus on a few points, I have neither time nor willingness to go through the whole thing.

&gt; We just got in the U.S., for example, Personal Income and Spending data, and the story is that income replacement has been extremely effective and successful in the U.S. And that's not what you expect in a recession.

Why exactly would you expect that giving money to people in a recession is a bad thing? Increasing transfers in a recession is Fiscal Policy 101.

&gt; One of the big things that happened is we had the Covid shock in 2020, and we finally had this exogenous shock that economics is kind of obsessed with and things didn't necessarily pan out exactly the way that a lot of economists would have expected based on traditional principles of how things actually work.

So this is kinda vague and not really RI-able, but as far as I know things panned pretty much the way you would expect based on traditional principles: short-lived but deep recession due to a combination of supply and demand shocks, followed by what looks like probably a quick recovery once the exogenous shock is gone.

&gt; In some sense, I wasn't surprised because when the crisis first hit, I get on my Patreon blog and wrote that we should have the government pump as much money as they can into the economy to make it possible for people to not to have to go to work and not go bankrupt through the whole process. And I suppose in one sense, it's not amazing that when a crisis strikes like this economic textbook gets thrown out the window — where it desperately deserves to be thrown by the way.

Again, if you open up an economics textbook, pumping money in the economy during a recession is one of the most fundamental policy levers available to the government; it's what the U.S. did in 2008 and it's what they did again this time around. I have no idea why Steve Keen thinks this goes against conventional thinking.

&gt; Now of course that happened back in the Great Recession as well, but we very rapidly switched over to balancing the government's books and all this sort of stuff.

Yes, and many (I would say even most) mainstream economists disagreed with that quick shift to contractionary fiscal policies.

&gt; And actually a lot of Americans ended up getting a pay rise out of the fact that 600 bucks from the government to meet their bills for a while. And I think what actually has started to soak into people is that, “Hey, maybe the world's financial system doesn't work the way the textbooks told us it works.”

So wait, because I end up with more money due to COVID-19 fiscal stimulus, I end up thinking the financial system doesn't work the way textbooks say it does? Why?

&gt; ""Oh, that was a weird crisis because it was this exogenous shock. It was a health thing. We have to go back next time in a downturn. We have to go back to the old way.""

What is this ""old way"" they're talking about? Which mainstream economists are saying you should decrease government spending in a recession?

&gt; And that includes how economists have said that climate change is no big deal.

I feel like I keep repeating myself, but again: which economists and when? Quick remainder that the 2018 *Nobel Prize* in Economics was awarded for climate change models. Hey, I can do strawman too: ""Steve Keen believes that communism is good! But he's wrong, and it's time to throw that thinking out the window!"" (But he talks more about Nordhaus later.)

&gt; It is ridiculously simple once you see it from the point of view of an accountant, and of course most economists don't do accounting.

I learned central bank accounting literally in my very first macroeconomics course in undergrad.

&gt; I saw Paul Krugman has a new masterclass program out where the two crucial slides say “Economics is about people. It's not about money.”

... which goes completely against Keen's premise that economists only care about the economy and not about people! But of course, they're *still* going to somehow spin it to make it sound bad.

&gt; Well, that's totally wrong. It is about money and how money affects people and how people affect money.

So, it's not about people, it's about people and money, which is completely different. Noted.

&gt; Well, that means the reserves rise when the government has a deficit, just like the loans rise when the private banks create loans. Both of them create money. And in that sense, there is no limit on the amount they can both create. The impacts they both have on the economy depend upon what are the inflationary impacts?

I'll ignore this because the rest of the RI makes it clear why that's inaccurate.

&gt; But in the case of the, the government, the Treasury — which creates the money by deficit spending — is the effective owner of the central bank.

We're now in typical MMT territory - ""the government and the central bank are not independent, why do you consider them independent in your models?"" Because, even if they aren't independent (which is highly debatable), you don't lose any flexibility by modeling them this way! If you want to assume the central bank accomodates any fiscal policy by the government, you can do so in your standard economic model, no problem.

&gt; So the government has effectively limitless capacity to create money. The limits are the impact of that on the economy, rather than the physical capability of doing it.

The *central bank* has limitless capacity to create money. The government has the limitless capacity to create money *if* the central bank is accomodating and stops targeting a low rate of inflation.

&gt; Now we need to do the accounting and you look at it and I've actually built a software package, which is freely available, called Minsky available on SourceForge. I'd love to have people in the finance sector, as well as academics and students download and take a look at it. And it's designed to do interlocking double entry, bookkeeping tables of the end. A company could do it. with its own books. It's designed for macro economics, it's there as a free tool.

&gt; And when you look at what actually happens, what you see is that rather than government borrowing adding to the demand of money, it actually adds to the supply of money.

So I haven't looked at that tool; maybe it has some entirely novel ideas that I've never seen before. But I'm guessing that the tool essentially makes the assumption that the Fed holds the rate of interested fixed, and thus that government spending increases the supply of money. You get that result from the most basic IS-LM models out there; how is this novel?

&gt; Now, they are quite comfortable with their ISLM models and their DSG and the RBCs and all this stuff, none of which have money in them, none of which have banks. Virtually none.

LM = ""Liquidity preference and Money supply,"" a curve that links the supply of *money* with the demand for *money* for a given rate of interest. Seriously, Keen? For banks, you can look at, oh I don't know, the [Diamond-Dybvig model,](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/bank-runs-deposit-insurance-and-liquidity) which is taught in any upper-year undergraduate or first-year graduate course on monetary economics...

&gt; Yeah, I think the way to think about private debt and public debt is like a seesaw. Because when you look at the mainstream, they treat them as both the same. Well, they ignore private debt because their attitude is well: Private debt is an act between consenting adults and we shouldn’t look inside the financial bedroom of the economy, whatever they want to do is okay by us. But other government debt, that's a burden on future generations.

Right, economists are not worried *at all* when they see private sector debt rising... [Oh, wait.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-november-financial-stability-report-borrowing.htm)

&gt; Imagine what America would have been like if there’d been no increase in the deficit. In fact, the deficit was about 30 or 40% of GDP. So without that spending, it would've been a total collapse in the private sector of the economy.

Totally correct! And also what mainstream economics models tell you.

&gt; But if I did the whole caboodle, the model that I did was giving every adult American a hundred thousand dollars over one year

Quick calculation gives a cost of $33 *trillion* for this policy (someone corrects me if this wrong). By comparison, 2020 outlays were about [$6.6 trillion.](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57170) So yeah, I don't think this is workable.

&gt; Pulitzer Prize is close. It was a work of fiction but it’s actually the William Nordhaus Nobel Prize, which itself was a work of fiction because it's not a Nobel prize. But it’s a great line, No I think we stick with that. Pulitzers are great ‘cause actually it's a work of fiction. The Nobel prize in economics is not a Nobel prize. And what the Nordhaus does is far more fiction than anything related to fact.

Oooh, okay, the fact that we gave a Nobel prize for work on climate change doesn't matter because the Nobel prize for economics doesn't really exist. Noted.

Keen then launches into a lengthy explanation of why Nordhaus' research is (according to him) crap: because it *makes simplifying assumptions* (a grave crime apparently) and reaches the ""wrong"" conclusions about possible impacts of climate change. And yes, I also disagree with many of Nordhaus' claims; I encourage Keen to submit a better model!

&gt; Now, when I put my energies and inputs of labor and capital into that function, what I get is that the so-called technology, which it still is obviously a form of issue. Technology is the energy consumption level of the typical machine of a particular generation. So if you look at the energy consumption of a James Watt steam engine, that was about 10 tons of coal per day.

&gt; If you look at the Elon Musk's Falcon rocket, that's about effectively 10 tons of kerosene per second. So that's where the dramatic increase in income has come from.

In other words, energy consumption is a good proxy for the Solow residual. Interesting, but that doesn't really imply that energy consumption is key for technological growth."
I won't be buying ETH again. My investment thesis has changed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/oiikcd/i_wont_be_buying_eth_again_my_investment_thesis/,Shatter_Hand,1,2021-07-12 10:57:02,293,/r/ethtrader/comments/oiikcd/i_wont_be_buying_eth_again_my_investment_thesis/,Discussion,"
*EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)*

So my investment opinions have changed. Up to the present time, it's been ETH and little else regarding my crypto accumulation. That's changed. I've taken a holistic view of the EVM after expertly learning my way around DeFi. I've realized its blue chip dapps—Maker, UniSwap, etcetera—which make up its system, are not only undervalued by many multiples for their future prospects, but are very much like decentralized versions of the 90s companies jockeying for position during that era's tech boom. Consider for example, the power composability will impregnate the system with. Let's case study Uber!

Uber has a piece of core code. They get the location information of a driver through *Google Maps*. They send the information to the driver through *Tulio*. They pay the driver through *Stripe*. 

If these companies didn't exist, then Uber wouldn't exist. Because they'd have to create a geolocation company, then a telecom messaging company, then a global payments system. That would've been too hard, taken too long, and been too expensive. 

This is seemingly a recurring theme for most new companies. I realize this type of *composability* is where the EVM is likely to savage the traditional financial system, along with savaging other [crypto] protocols—and these are only the first victims this apex predator is following its nose to. Because I won't even bother considering what Oracle's will do for smart contracts by bringing off-chain data *onto* the blockchain.

I've also been following mining dynamics closely since the Chinese mining crackdown in Xinjiang Province last month, which has seen as much FUD as it has miners fleeing to Borat's homeland of Kazakstan (and tax-friendly countries with cheap electricity too). I say that to say this: *The Flippening* might come much sooner than people think as a result of mining, and none of this has to do with CO2. Let me explain: 

Bitcoin's mining rewards are based on its spot price. As its price action currently trembles along a $30k flatline, its simply inflating away as miners dump their rewards to pay mining costs, all the while fiat inflation (not just a US phenomenon) is exacerbating these costs, along with the supply chain disruptions we see pretty much everywhere. If Ethereum moves up slightly (even 10%) like I expect, mining Ethereum becomes profitable enough that many mining operations will turn from mining BTC to ETH. On that last point, it's already starting to happen slowly, and it's not difficult for a mining operation to switch over, and absorb the costs of the switch.

*""But ETH 2.0—it's essentially a mining killswitch, isn't it?""*

Yes, it is.

And the business model of running Ethereum PoS nodes instead of Bitcoin PoW nodes is more profitable, not to mention the LP and Yield Farming that ETH's staking rewards can be allocated to, or how these tokens can be borrowed against, or how these rewards can be used before they're actually awarded (yeah, there's a group working on that dapp)—more on all this later. So most miners won't be investing in new equipment, or fighting politics, they don't want to keep their boots laced in case the BTC mining economy of scale (access to capital and cheap electricity) turns on them suddenly. The ones still mining BTC will dump their BTC rewards not just to pay their bills, but for ETH as well. The mining profitability dynamic we talked about above is starting to happen from the data I'm looking at, and I believe ETH will outperform BTC from now until October, by which time the mining dynamics will heavily favor ETH and the BTC/ETH ratio might get to 0.84 or so (we're at 0.625 right now). From here the gap is close enough that the flip becomes a trending self-fulfilling prophecy. Any attempts by BTC to separate itself from ETH further in price will fail, and ultimately will only benefit altcoins, especially the EVM. Speaking of self-fulfilling prophecies, or at least what was once one, the infamous S2F (stock to flow) model for BTC which was conceived by the much respected PlanB, is in dire straights right now, only weeks from breaking. I believe it will break. We all know Bitcoin has a long history making fools of people though, so don't think I haven't considered such a shadow. If BTC spikes and reclaims certain levels, S2F can turn into an incredible $100k self-fulfilling prophecy this year. There's a historic amount in stablecoins and fiat waiting idle on global exchanges too. So a tidal wave of buying pressure can come crashing in if the right gang sign gets flashed. Unfortunately, I believe those colors will flash syndicate Buterin, and that's where the money crashes in. 

I'm also watching the wrapped supply of BTC (WBTC) closely, because 1.1% of the total BTC supply is currently wrapped on the EVM—that's predatory AF. After the October flip, USDC will put a sustained move on USDT, and this will jack ERC tokens up the top token list even more, where they already dominate the mid-range. 4 ERC tokens in the top 10 list isn't crazy by late 2022, and by that point, I hope people invested in other protocols can see the linear inevitability of what's happening, which has been happening in slo-mo for years—EVM hegemony. Then we might see some of the tenets of *fat protocol thesis* actually take hold:

https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/

It just never ends with the EVM does it? Its ecosystem and innovation moves so quickly it's difficult to keep up. 

There's one more thing, a seed I'd like to plant in people's heads. This seed grows questions far more important than the weed: *Wen Lambo?* And far too many people are not prepared for its answers, which in turn breeds hostility and fear:

**CBDC's** (Central Bank Digital Currency)

Do not fear these. They'll make you millionaires. Let's assume ETH 2.0 is implemented successfully. Here's how you get the One ring of power:

There are three matches that will set off DeFi and burn the traditional financial system anew. Let's reimagine them as the three rings of power from *Lord of the Rings:*

 - Vilya: CBDC's
 - Narya: Composability
 - Nenya: Friction

Many crypto advocates on and off this sub hold a terrible belief. They've been shilled into believing decentralized cryptocurrencies (like BTC and ETH) will replace fiat. 

THEY. WILL. NOT. 

At least not for any transactional activities in the real [non-digital] world, like buying a coffee or car. That's ridiculous. Eonmt happen this decade. Only digital fiat (CBDC's) can replace paper fiat. Trust me, this is how you want it. So let's briefly review the US financial system in a dumbed down white heat. We won't get into fractional reserve or the creation of money by purchasing financial assets: 

 - 1) The US Central Bank sets the USD interest rate. This rate is currently 0.75%.

 - 2) Chartered banks (Chase, PNC, etc) borrow money at this interest rate.

 - 3) Through these chartered banks,  money is loaned to consumers, businesses, etcetera, at a considerably higher interest rate than it's borrowed for. 

 - 4) The money is then loaned into existence by the US Central Bank and added to the books.


*And here's the Bank of England's version:*

https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2017/10/31/how-bank-lending-really-creates-money-and-why-the-magic-money-tree-is-not-cost-free/

Continuing on: 

So if global CBDC's are plugged directly into decentralized finance, what purpose do banks have besides being middlemen, whom's job we know is to make themselves a necessary evil? None. They serve no purpose but to make everything more expensive and inefficient. When the gas station and Starbucks accept the digital USD at their counter terminal, things become seamless (they lose friction), and banks don't even serve the role as a custody solution anymore, unless they want to provide insurance, or offer spectacular incentives. This also extends to stablecoins, which have ZERO future. Fiat-backed stablecoins are overpriced custody solutions which cost way too much to borrow (12% on average) for consumers. Middlemen. Lots of rich people have exited deposit banking services and opt for holding stablecoins because the interest rates are huge (8.8% on Celsius, and DeFi protocols much higher). Expect these to become even more popular as money moves from all-time-high stocks to cash, waiting for opportunities, and finding a well-paying limbo in stablecoin deposits. Eventually though, these fiat-backed stablecoins will visit the Smithsonian's Fossil Hall of dinosaurs, and the EVM ecosystem will lose nothing with their passing, and in fact will benefit from their replacement: CBDC's. Bitcoin however, will not. Neither will any *one-trick-pony* cryptocurrency protocol outside the EVM (Nano anyone?) with the exception of Monero, which would survive a global crypto ban wearing a smile.

""But Central Banks will never plug their CBDC's into DeFi you moron.""

They have to. They have no choice. If they don't, competitors will, and they'll wreck havoc metastasizing and gaining trust inside a rapidly growing system. China can plug their digital Yuan into DeFi (they already let this slip a few months ago), and call it USDxi, Dollar1, or anything. Why would I borrow USDC at 12% when I can borrow USDxi for 2% and swap it for whatever tokens or coins I want? China is just an example. As an aside, if I were Germany, I'd exit the EU in this storming fashion. Anyway, all this reminds me of what happened when NFT's exploded on the scene earlier this year. Maybe I can capture what I mean there:

Some skilled independent artists started putting out Batman NFT's selling them for $100,000 and much much more. DC Comics came out condemning their actions but, they were powerless to stop the sales. So they [DC Comics] were left with no choice: they had to join the network and start releasing their own official NFT's—which they did—and it killed the market for unofficial Batman. 

That's another power of the EVM dear reader:

It will challenge the notion of wether or not intellectual property (IP) is a function of the free market. 

This is a fascinating argument within libertarian circles, but put me down for *let's make this work*, because if it can't be stopped, fighting is wasteful. Let's get this NFT programming wizardry going (like what Zen.Run is doing) and make it work.

Speaking of fighting, if governments try using drug war tactics to fight down crypto, they'll find themselves surrounded by a cartel of voters, strengthened enemies, and economic devastation. Places like Singapore and El Salvador (LOL but I'm serious), could syphon a whole number percentage of the world's wealth.

Right. So now CBDC's get the plug-n-play treatment and you become the bank, capturing the margins (profits) that traditionally belonged to them. This allows you to play global CBDC interest rates off one another for borrowing. You see, you'll never actually have to sell your crypto per se. You simply borrow against it if you want to spend. The staking rewards you're earning on it (or the LP yield), will offset the loan's interest rate by several percentage points. You're left holding the deflationary, censorship resistant, permissionless asset—the hard money. And this is where what I talked about above (about mining) comes into play. Lot's of cool things you can do with a system like this. This will also have the effect of strengthening the reckless behavior of global Central Banks, otherwise they won't be able to participate, or I guess *compete* would be a better word. For all the flak the US Treasury gets for printing the USD into an inflationary hell, we print far less fiat than most other countries. There's a relativity here: everybody is printing, but we happen to print the world’s reserve currency, and we issue bonds in that same currency. A lucky Bretton Woods bunch we are. This is how we [the US] are able to keep interest rates so low without any major problems. So it's this kind of...check and balance system. I always had this saying before the EVM's ecosystem came together a couple years ago:

""The biggest threat to Bitcoin is sound money.""

But there is no such thing as centralized sound money, so the threat was always going to come from inside the decentralized world. It's arrived. 

Volatility remains a question, but I believe volatility will be more than halved by the end of 2023 for ETH and its top EVM tokens. The new regime of profit making will be yield, along with the margin capture we talked about. Speculation will be reserved for the newest dapp tokens looking to leverage composability, solve some new problem, entertainment too, etcetera. 

We talked about CBDC's a little bit, and composability in a bunch of places. The last ring is friction. Let's define friction here as *the number of steps required to complete a task*, or just *technical difficulty*. 

DeFi's friction is WAY too high. 

The difficulty curve of learning and executing transactions in DeFi is unreasonable for most people. The US average IQ is 98. That ranks 27th amongst world countries. Most here on this sub can do that stuff because you're here so early in the cryptotech revolution, you're smart, and motivated to capitalize on what equates to about 1996 in the 90s tech explosion. But don't expect your mom, many of your friends, or your neighbor to understand what you know. For the masses to use DeFi, it will require a UI/UX with a difficulty equivalent of TikTok or CashApp. This will come eventually. Absolutely. Consider the absurd number of steps and difficulty required to stream video in 1996. Fast forward today, and everyone has at least three video streaming options in their pocket. 2-year-old kids know how to use it talking to mom on a business trip or watching cartoons on Netflix. 

But...knowing how to operate on the level beneath the pretty UI/UX that the masses know well...well, my thoughts are simple: there are enormous opportunities waiting for those willing to learn DeFi now and stay current with it. If you want to be your own bank, own One ring, and control your own assets with 100% independence, then you need to learn this shit at an expert level, and learn how to protect your assets. I won't get into it, but Meta wallets will come soon enough, and because these are like your own personal high-powered Dapp, knowing this stuff now will really help. This also goes for all the individuals running and securing the network(s), wether that's operating a node/validator, aggregating data for an oracle, doing the manual duties required of a DAO, etcetera. Learn and don't stop learning. 

I'd like to apologize for the absurd length of this rant. But before I let you go, here's my new EVM investment thesis:

Keep ETH at 25% of portfolio max. Anything more than this should be sold/swapped and used to buy all the blue-chips at the top of their respective utility. So the oracle might be ChainLink, and the borrowing/lending might be Maker, and the DEX might be UniSwap, and the derivatives Synthetix, and the L2 solution Polygon, etcetera. 

I would like opinions on this before Bitcoin loses it's dominance, Tether gets kneecapped, and Litecoin embarrasses itself further. 😌"
How the Oasis Network Can Unlock a New Generation of Privacy-Enabled Scalable DeFi Applications,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Equivalent-Way3759/comments/oilks0/how_the_oasis_network_can_unlock_a_new_generation/,Equivalent-Way3759,1,2021-07-12 14:23:37,0,/r/u_Equivalent-Way3759/comments/oilks0/how_the_oasis_network_can_unlock_a_new_generation/,NaN,"2020 is unquestionably the year of decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked in DeFi protocols shot up from $660M in January 2020 to $12B in October 2020. New projects like Yearn, Curve, and Aave received major interest while established players like Compound and Uniswap launched their own governance tokens. Despite the growth rate being impressive, $12B is still a measly figure compared to traditional markets. So as the growth in DeFi has begun to slow down, the question now arises: how do we take DeFi to the next level?

There are many answers to this question. **The expansion of DeFi is currently limited by high fees, behaviors of self-motivated traders, and lack of a reputation system or identity**. The result is an overloaded and expensive system that requires to ‘trust’ borrowers by asking them to over-collateralize their assets to access loans.

While there are other causes for this such as crypto’s volatility, the main reason for the over-collateralization is that there is no way to “trust” a user as there are no robust on-chain identity solutions. **Even if DeFi is able to just move from the 150% collateral factor to a 50% factor, the amount of usable capital in DeFi can increase 2x.**

The Oasis Solution

The Oasis Network offers a potential solution to these problems. Oasis is a privacy-enabled, scalable blockchain built for decentralized finance and a responsible, user-owned data economy. Using a combination of confidential compute and blockchain, the Network enables protection of business interests such as trades, low fees, and the creation of identities based on user-controlled data.

This unlocks new use cases like private lending, under-collateralized loans, and private automated market makers. Users can upload and control identity data such as their credit scores without exposing that information publicly. This then allows them to apply for under-collateralized loans as the lender can now place more trust in the borrower. By bringing privacy and scalability to DeFi, the Oasis Network can expand DeFi beyond early adopters to a mass market. With the Network’s unique ParaTime Architecture that separates consensus (Consensus Layer) from computation (ParaTime Layer) the network can also address many of the scalability issues common in DeFi today.

DeFi Use Cases

Since Oasis is backwards compatible with Ethereum thanks to its ParaTime architecture, developers are bringing Ethereum-native DeFi protocols onto Oasis as well. Applications and protocols being built on or brought to the Network include Uniswap, Balancer, Chainlink, Wyre, Stafi, Meter, Torus, and others. In fact, Oasis just announced a [partnership with Balancer](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/defi-needs-privacy-to-reach-mass-adoption-20482017a44f) to fund a joint grant to bring Balancer to the Oasis Network.

Other Early Use Cases

The Oasis Network’s privacy-enabled design is already being put to use. Current use cases that leverage the network’s privacy include:

**1.** [**Binance CryptoSage Alliance**](https://www.cryptosafe.org/)

Crypto theft and attacks are on the rise, and exchanges need a platform to identify and ban bad actors. Building on top of the Oasis’ technology, the CryptoSafe platform enables exchanges to share threat intelligence data. Because of the Oasis Network’s support for confidential computation, exchange data is kept confidential even while it’s being compared.

**2.** [**Nebula Genomics**](https://nebula.org/)

Nebula Genomics wanted to differentiate their product from other competitors by giving their users control of their genetic data. Using Oasis’ framework, customers can retain ownership of their genomic data and Nebula Genomics can run analysis on the data without seeing the customer’s raw information. This product is already available to Nebula customers in Beta today.

**3. Fortune 500 Healthcare Provider**

A Fortune 500 healthcare provider wanted to share data with external parties while retaining control of the data and protecting the confidentiality of patient data. Using an Oasis Labs-built API, this leading healthcare company is able to track, trace, and control data usage even when shared with third parties.

Layer-one blockchains are becoming more composable and migrating to new chains has become increasingly easy for DeFi projects. Similar to how DeFi protocols like Project Serum are moving to blockchains like Solana that best serve their purposes, DeFi protocols may begin moving to Oasis to take advantage of the network’s built in privacy, scalability, and ParaTime architecture."

# History of Yearn Finance

Released by [Andre Cronje](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech) in February 2020, Yearn has quickly become established in the decentralised finance (DeFi) industry/ecosystem. Unlike centralised institutions (e.g. your bank) which are often managed by a single entity, a DeFi institution is governed by its community, whoever and wherever they are. Measured by total value invested/locked, Yearn is currently the 7th most popular in the industry, and the number 1 yield aggregator (to define) ([www.Defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/))

With significant funds (over $3 billion at the moment) locked on Yearn over recent months (above), it looks as though the platform/protocol/product has got the trust of its users. This is despite an unfortunate part of Yearn’s history whereby an attacker profited approximately [$2.8 million in February 2021](https://www.rekt.news/yearn-rekt/). [Those users who were insured had their lost funds reimbursed. ](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1358562352690384896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358562352690384896%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-21578153431832924304.ampproject.net%2F2106030132000%2Fframe.html)

# What value does Yearn bring?

Yearn enables users to earn rates of return that they would find difficult (but not impossible) to achieve on their own, within the Ethereum ecosystem.

This is because Yearn pools funds together, enabling individual users to save on transaction fee (gas) costs. Additionally, Yearn’s computer code/smart contracts are reactive to changing market conditions. So rather than monitoring the markets yourself, if you deposit on Yearn, this is done autonomously for you. So if at 4 AM - while you are asleep - it becomes profitable to deposit ether to Curve for 5% instead of Aave’s 4%, Yearn will do this. 

* Not too dissimilar to a fund manager at your stockbroker, Yearn charges a 20% performance fee and a 2% management fee ([docs](https://docs.yearn.finance/yearn-finance/yvaults/overview)).

# How do Yearn strategies work?

[After the YFI token holders voted](https://snapshot.org/#/yearn/proposal/QmdoQr44Q8rCPd7mfQsMhQwt4o3X4MZ2k89uLAe4fEXCwf), it was decided that strategists earn 10% of the fees earned for the 'strategies' they propose for the Yearn Protocol to earn a rate of return for users funds.

How do these strategies work though? That is something i'm still getting my head around. In simple terms, the cryptocurrency deposited by users is shifted around looking for opportunities that may include lending, liquidation, arbitrage, or something else.

**Convex Finance Overview**

By [Jonathan Man](https://messari.io/research/jonathan-man)

Jul 7, 2021 ⋅ Pro Research

Convex is a DeFi protocol built on top of Curve to facilitate higher returns for liquidity providers and [CRV](https://messari.io/asset/curve) stakers. Launched on May 17, Convex quickly exceeded $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) in its first two weeks. As of June 28, Convex has attracted approximately $3.9 billion in TVL and generated approximately $15.1 million in protocol fees. What does Convex do and how did it manage to grow so quickly in such a short period of time?

   
 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9dt8s7ts4ta71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea655dcc8668f38f99cd59740ff919810d1dab2

   
 

**Curve Refresher**

In order to understand the value proposition that Convex offers, we first need to review how Curve works. Curve is an automated market maker (AMM) that specializes in liquidity pools with like-assets that are pegged to one another. Curve has liquidity pools with various stablecoins and pools with different flavors of wrapped or synthetic [BTC](https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin), [ETH](https://messari.io/asset/ethereum) and [LINK](https://messari.io/asset/chainlink). What makes Curve attractive to liquidity providers is that users can earn yield in the form of trading fees without having to worry about impermanent loss as long as the assets maintain their peg.

   
 

In addition to trading fees, Curve rewards liquidity providers with its governance token, CRV. What’s interesting about CRV tokens is that users can lock-up their CRV tokens for up to 4 years to receive vote-escrowed CRV or veCRV. The longer users lock their CRV tokens, the more veCRV they receive in exchange. Holding veCRV has three benefits: voting rights for the Curve DAO, a share of 50% of the trading fees on the Curve platform and up to 2.5x boosted CRV rewards for liquidity provisions. What Convex does is allow Curve liquidity providers to boost their CRV rewards without locking their own CRV tokens.

   
 

**Enter Convex Finance**

Curve liquidity providers benefit from Convex by receiving boosted CRV rewards that are made possible by other users who lock their CRV tokens with Convex. CRV holders irreversibly deposit CRV onto Convex and receive cvxCRV as a tokenized representation of their staked deposit. It should be noted that while converting CRV into cvxCRV is irreversible, one can swap cvxCRV to CRV via a liquidity pool on Sushiswap, though it is not guaranteed that they will trade 1:1. Users holding cvxCRV earn Curve trading fees as well as receive a share of the boosted CRV rewards that were made possible by the CRV that they locked. To further incentivize the use of the Convex protocol, CRV stakers and liquidity providers also receive Convex’s governance token, [CVX](https://messari.io/asset/convex-finance) as liquidity mining rewards. Users can stake CVX on Convex to earn a share of protocol fees.

   
 

**Convex Tokeneconomics**

Convex charges Curve LP token stakers a 16% platform fee of which 10% goes to cvxCRV stakers in the form of CRV, 5% goes to CVX stakers in the form of cvxCRV and 1% goes to harvest function callers in the form of CRV (to reimburse gas for calling contract functions). Fees are only taken from CRV revenue. No fees are taken from non-CRV incentives that are paid on certain Curve pools, nor from Curve protocol fees paid to cvxCRV holders. Note that the 5% paid as cvxCRV to CVX stakers sits in the rewards contract as CRV until users claim their rewards. When a CVX staker claims rewards, the CRV tokens are locked in Convex and cvxCRV is minted and paid out to the user.

   
 

The amount of CVX minted is proportional to the amount of CRV rewards earned through Convex. The ratio of CVX to CRV emitted is reduced after every 100,000 CVX that is minted. The total supply of CVX is capped at 100 million. Eventually, CVX holders will be able to participate in the Convex DAO and vote on things such as reward rates.

**Comparisons to Yearn**

When Convex launched in May, the DeFi community noticed the similarities between Convex and Yearn and perceived them as competitors. As Curve is such an attractive source of yield in DeFi, Yearn also has a vault for locking CRV to boost rewards as many of Yearn’s vaults depend on strategies that farm CRV. There even seemed to be a race between the two protocols to see who could attract more staked CRV.

In less than one month, the CRV locked on Convex exceeded that of Yearn.

   
 

The introduction of Convex seemingly caused the price of CRV and the cost to borrow CRV on Aave to temporarily spike. Borrowing rates and the price of CRV both reached local tops on June 4, 2021 as the frenzy to lock CRV reached a crescendo. Borrowing rates for CRV remain elevated on Aave and it’s no wonder as Convex is currently advertising 82.49% APY for CRV stakers.

The following table illustrates how Convex and Yearn compare from a user’s perspective.

The value proposition that Convex offers is clear - the ability to increase yields for CRV and Curve LP stakers at a lower cost than Yearn, with the added benefit of CVX liquidity mining rewards. The drawback of Convex is that, unlike Yearn, returns are not automatically compounded.

   
 

**Convex as Middleware**

However, calling Convex a competitor to Yearn doesn’t quite paint the full picture. In short order, Yearn migrated all of their existing Curve based strategies to include Convex and farm CVX rewards. Yearn currently harvests approximately 21% of CVX minted.

Other yield aggregators have followed suit. Harvest Finance also migrated their Curve based strategies to Convex and Badger is in the middle of a guarded rollout of their own Convex strategies that will eventually replace their Curve based ones.

   
 

In hindsight, it seems obvious that a product like Convex would exist to bring CRV holders and liquidity providers together to enhance returns for both parties in a mutually beneficial way. The rapid growth in Convex’s TVL is a testament to its product-market fit. It was also inevitable that aggregators such as Yearn would ultimately choose to incorporate Convex into its yield strategies. All in all, the creation of Convex and its subsequent usage is proof once again of the compelling nature of composability in DeFi."
"Curve Finance is the Base Protocol for Andre Cronje's new Fixed Forex application. Forex does $6.6T in daily volume....if the defi forex protocol took even a small percent of that volume, Curve stakeholders would be massive incentivized by their portion of transaction fees.",https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/oiv83g/curve_finance_is_the_base_protocol_for_andre/,afirebrand,1,2021-07-13 00:50:18,59,/r/defi/comments/oiv83g/curve_finance_is_the_base_protocol_for_andre/,NaN," On July 2nd, Andre Cronje, the programmer behind Yearn Finance, announced a new project that he was launching: Fixed Forex. 

The interesting thing is that the project is notable for being built upon the Curve protocol for stable coin liquidity….a protocol with low slippage and minimal impermanent loss. 

Although the project is experimental (and currently unaudited), the concept is bold and potentially a groundbreaking use-case for decentralized finance (defi). 

To understand the potential significance of this project, it is important to understand the massive amount of volume which move through the traditional finance (tradfi) Forex market everyday. 

The foreign exchange or forex market is the largest financial market in the world – larger even than the stock market, with a daily volume of $6.6 trillion, according to the 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey of FX and OTC derivatives markets.

If Fixed Forex was able to take even 1% of the transaction volume away from tradfi…that would be 66 billion dollars moving across the Curve protocol every day.

Fees and pool parameters are decided by the Curve DAO. Currently, the fee on all pools is 0.04%, of which 50% goes to liquidity providers, and 50% to veCRV holders (members of the DAO). As such, veCRV holders get .02% of all transaction fees. 

.02% of 66 Billion daily fees is: 13,200,000 a day. 

Since rewards inception on 10/7/20, a total of $30,059,590.81 has been generated for stake holders. Imagine if forex volume could equal those rewards in 2.5days. On chain growth would be extraordinary with significant value accrued by stake holders.

US Debt Analysis: June 2021. Treasury starting to convert short term debt to medium term,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/oj46u3/us_debt_analysis_june_2021_treasury_starting_to/,exploring_finance,1,2021-07-13 08:24:01,14,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/oj46u3/us_debt_analysis_june_2021_treasury_starting_to/,Due Diligence," This article first appeared on [SchiffGold](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/us-debt-analysis-june-2021/).

## Introduction

The US Government is on an unsustainable debt trajectory. Even though the Federal Reserve has acknowledged this fact, most mainstream figures consider it a distant problem or even not an issue at all. The argument highlights that debt fears have raged since the debt crossed $1T decades ago and no negative consequences have materialized

This analysis digs into the detail of the debt to show why the US Government is at much greater risk than even a few years ago. By downloading Cusip level data back to 2000, the analysis is both deep and wide. It starts with a trend analysis specifically focusing on the debt rollover by product. The most recent numbers show how the Treasury is managing the debt post Covid. A deeper look into history demonstrates the changing debt makeup. The analysis concludes with commentary on how this is relevant to gold and silver.

*For readers looking to just see the latest month over month numbers, skip ahead to the section: “Digging into the numbers”*

## Understanding the Trends

The loudest critics of the US Debt and Fed monetary policy will point to $28T in US Debt and quickly calculate that every .25% interest rate move costs the US $70B a year. The debt is amajor problem, but the real story is much more complicated. It’s important to understand the makeup of the debt, maturity schedules, and current interest rates. To start, the chart below breaks down how the debt is organized by instrument.

There is $6T+ of Non-Marketable (Non-Mrkt) securities which are debt instruments that cannot be resold. The vast majority of Non-Mrkt is money the government owes to itself. For example, Social Security holds over $2.8T in US Non-Mrkt debt, almost half the total Non-Mrkt amount. This debt poses zero risk because any interest paid is the government paying itself.

The remaining $22T is broken down into Bills (&lt;1 year), Notes (1-10 years), Bonds (10+ years), and Other (e.g. TIPS).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Total Debt Outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/xmu44ffhhva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ad64636708c393c61391a78f89b3c0183f95b28)

 

While it may help that 20% of debt is owed to itself, it still leaves a massive $22T to wrestle with. Another point of relief is the $5T held by the fed, which is an interest free loan (more on this below). Even with the $11T in interest free loans, the primary risk the government faces is not new debt issuance (it could just cut spending), but instead rolling over existing debt.

Rolling over debt is using new debt to pay back debt that is maturing. The chart below shows the amount of debt issued and matured going back 7 years. It also looks forward to see what is maturing in the future. As shown below, the majority of debt issued each month is actually rollover, with only a small percentage being new debt (red bar), which can even bring total debt down when more matures than is issued (on occasion).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Monthly Rollover](https://preview.redd.it/og3wr25iiva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b455868ed8d718a5bde9c01020c013e28999ed)

 

*Note “Net Change in Debt” is the difference between Debt Issued and Debt Matured. This means when positive it is part of Debt Issued and when negative it represents Debt Matured*

From 2012-2016 about $500B a month was rolling over (mostly short term as shown below). This started moving up in 2017, reaching $1T a month by 2020 before jumping to $1.5T as Covid hit. Another important factor is the red bar showing how much of the Issued debt is new debt, being added.

While it may look like the government is about to get relief with a lot of debt maturing in the coming months, most of the debt will be refinanced into short term debt and the rolling will continue at above $1.5T.

#### T-BILLS (&lt; 1 YEAR)

There is currently $4T outstanding in short term treasury bills, up more than double the amount 3 years ago. The Treasury tends to finance surges in spending with Treasury Bills because they are well accepted by the market. The plot below shows the [Bid to Cover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidtocoverratio.asp) ratio for short term T-Bills. A higher Bid-to-Cover indicates stronger demand. While demand is off from its peak during 2012-2015, a bid-to-cover above three is still strong. Especially considering how much more short term debt has been issued in recent years.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 3: T-Bill Bid to Cover](https://preview.redd.it/ac8jqtjkiva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de964707884574cff2b1fa1bc7c47550586c034)

 

While demand for T-Bills may be strong, it poses a risk to the Treasury. Each month almost 35% (1.5T) is rolling over, and as the chart below shows nearly 100% rolls over within a six-month window. This means any Fed hike will be felt almost instantly in the Treasury Bill market. Each .25% rate hike will translate to $10B a month in additional annual interest payments within 6 months.

As discussed below, the Treasury is making an effort to convert some of the Treasury Bills into Notes. If this effort is successful, the short term risk will decreases some; however, it may prove more challenging to restructure most of its short term debt, especially with all the new spending planned. Even if successful, it’s mostly rolling into 1-7 year debt which only provides some short term relief.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 4: Short Term Rollover](https://preview.redd.it/45gc600riva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca1a3dd27e298cabaff3d503a1a0639dd82f58c)

TREASURY NOTES (1-10 YEARS)

Although the Treasury talks about taking advantage of low interest rates to lock in expenses, it’s easier said than done. The plot below shows the bid to cover for 2 year and 10 year debt. Unlike Bills which range between 3-3.5, Notes are closer to 2.5. The Treasury cannot flood the market with new debt because there wouldn’t be enough demand and interest rates would be pushed up.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: 2 year and 10 year bid to cover](https://preview.redd.it/iwiqk2otiva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c159af8a5ec3596599821d6eae13068cbdec5cd3)

 

Notes also present their own problem. While rates do get locked in, the Treasury really only buys relief for a couple years. The chart below shows the annual rollover for Treasury Notes. As shown, the amount rolling over has picked up significantly in recent years even though net change in debt is still below the levels in 2008 and 2009.

2022 will be the largest year ever in Notes that need to be rolled over. This is just showing debt that already exists and needs to be refinanced. What also needs to be considered is the new spending and also the efforts to convert T-Bills into Notes as mentioned above. Furthermore, the last /red bar represents 2021 through June, which means if the current trajectory maintains, total Note issuance for 2021 could approach $4T (the light green bar of $1T+ still needs refinancing in 2021)! It will be important to watch this chart in the coming months to see how the Treasury handles Note issuance.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Treasury Note Rollover](https://preview.redd.it/8v7e48xviva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee91bf38403c4b6c8813de1a023966b9716d54e)

 

#### INTEREST RATES

Finally, a look at interest rates shows how the Treasury has been able to maintain low interest payments despite a ballooning deficit. Rates have been declining for 20 years. The actions by the Fed to hold short term rates at 0% and also engage in Quantitative Easing have been critical for the Treasury to manage its debt load. Unfortunately, rates have come up against a floor at zero, so there may not be much room for either the Fed or Treasury to maneuver.

This is why [the Fed cannot raise rates](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) or even [taper QE](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-2-they-cannot-end-quantitative-easing/) without significant ramifications.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/gupirdhyiva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d135a654006943e8d7f43997309c02d0021654ff)

Recently, the 10 year and 2 year rates have started moving back together. While there is still distance before the yields invert (as shown below), it is a trend to watch. Perhaps driving this convergence is the debt issuance by the Treasury over the last few months, focusing Note issuance at the shorter range rather (1-7yr) than the longer end (7-10yr) as shown in the tables below. 

[ Figure 8: Tracking Yield Curve Inversion](https://preview.redd.it/cq6dokp0jva71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15b9a485d43c9a2f95786156ac0e4e4bc03950df)

 

## Digging into the numbers

#### RECENT DEBT ISSUANCE ANALYSIS

The table below looks at the most recent month of debt issuance, compared to the previous month, and also the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) average. More history is shown on the right comparing the last 3 TTM periods (the last 36 months).

While these numbers are skewed due to the massive debt issuance during Covid, it doesn’t change the fact that managing the debt has become more complicated. These tables show how the Treasury is trying to restructure while also dealing with new debt issuance.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 9: Recent Debt Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/r66eo9r2jva71.png?width=2940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141375ada3a2527bee279176967f0839a93b8f73)

 

The takeaways:

* Short term debt is maturing and rolling into long term debt. The last twelve months have seen &lt;6 month debt change by -71.4B on average, which accelerated in May and June to -260.2B and -76.2B.
* The difference is being made up across Notes, with June more than tripling the TTM average in 3-7 years (64.5B to 209.5B) and 7-10 years (12.5B to 83.9B)
* Comparing the TTM periods shows the true strength of this trend:
   * &lt; 6 month totaled 2.5T through June 2020 but changed by -856B since
   * 1-3 year and 3-7 year are both more than 2.5x larger in the recent TTM vs Jun 2020
   * 7-10 year issuance is actually *down* and long term bonds are up 50%

The end result is that debt is being refinanced into longer maturities but it is still heavily concentrated on the short end of the curve (1-7 year). This will only create more risk in the years to come. The Note Rollover chart (Figure 6) shows that 2022 will be a record year for Note maturity, but given these trends that record will undoubtedly be broken in the near future.

#### HISTORICAL DEBT ISSUANCE ANALYSIS

While recent years have seen a lot of changes to the structure of the debt, with risk being brought forward up the yield curve. Looking at a longer historical period shows an even more stark picture of how dramatic the changes have been. This table explains why “it hasn’t been a problem for decades”, but refutes the notion that it can hold true going forward without *signicant* and *continued* intervention by the Fed.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 10: Debt Details over 20 years](https://preview.redd.it/217qsys4jva71.png?width=1754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44850dc60e548b728dcbf9d69d6140ef3ab086f5)

 

It can take time to digest all the data above. Below are some main takeaways:

* Bills have increased from 620B to 4.2T over 20 years yet Annualized interest has fallen from 28.1 to 3.1
   * The impact of a .25% interest rate hike is up 7x from 1.6B to 10.7B
   * As recently as 3 years ago, annual interest on Bills was 36.7B, despite half the current size. Rates only reached 1.7%.
   * Returning to 4.5% on Bills from 20 years ago would cost the Government $180B a year!
   * Bills still make up 15% of the debt, up from 11.7% 20 years ago but down from 20% one year ago
* Notes made up 28% of total debt balance 20 years ago but has surged to 43%
   * 20 years ago 46.5% of debt was Nonmarketable (owed to itself - posing no risk), but that well has seemingly gone dry
   * Notes increased nearly 10 fold 1.4T to 12T, yet interest has only doubled 86.1B to 177.4B
   * If avg interest rate returned to 5.8%, total annualized interest would clock in at $700B!
* Bond balances are also up 6x while interest is only up double (51B vs 100B)
* Avg maturity has been extended some increasing from 2.7 yrs to 3.5 in Notes and from 18 yrs to 21.8 in Bonds

## What it means for Gold and Silver

The Treasury is out of tricks. Interest rates have bottomed and the intra-government debt well cannot keep up with debt issuance (not to mention at some point those bills will come due also - e.g. Social Security). While an increase in interest rates would take time to work its way through Notes and Bonds, the impact would be felt immediately in Bills. That being said, with Notes having an avg maturity of 3.5 years, it wouldn’t take long to feel the increase in Notes as well which would prove devastating given the balance size.

Thus the Fed cannot raise short term rates and it needs to keep long term rates contained. Given the amount of Notes to rollover in the years ahead, any effort to taper will be “transitory” at best. With the Fed forced to continue aggressive monetary policy indefinitely, it is almost certain inflation will prove much more persistent than the Fed is leading on. Other countries do not have the same risk/exposure as the Treasury which means the dollar could come under significant pressure as the Fed is unable to act to combat inflation while foreign central banks do. Gold and silver offer a great protection against a devaluing dollar in this environment.

#### A CRITICAL POINT

Not only does the Fed alleviate pressure on the Treasury by keeping interest rates low across the curve, but the debt the Fed buys equates to an interest free loan. Any interest the Fed receives from its balance sheet is returned back to the Treasury. “Only” $5.2 of the $8T balance sheet is in Treasuries, but it is almost all in Notes. While this does offer medium term protection, the Treasury is still exposed to short term rates. Furthermore, it also means the Fed will be unable to shrink its balance sheet or the medium term protection will be immediately lost. This should be considered when reviewing the information above and the impact of rising rates. A breakdown of the Fed balance sheet is forthcoming.

Iron Finance - The ICE age,https://www.reddit.com/r/IronFinance/comments/ojasqy/iron_finance_the_ice_age/,SnoopHappyCoin,1,2021-07-13 15:44:21,29,/r/IronFinance/comments/ojasqy/iron_finance_the_ice_age/,NaN,"A while back I posted my thoughts on Iron Finance. I said it looked promising but was very high risk, especially the TITAN token. It was doing quite well for 3 weeks but then TITAN lost almost all it's value because of whales selling, bad tokenomics, FUD.

The developers called it a bank run as if they were not to blame. They should have taken some of the blame because the tokenomics never took into account that a huge amount of people would sell TITAN and IRON. With those high APR's anyone could have predicted there would be a mass sell in the future, the only question was when.

Now they are back. In a few hours they already had a TVL of 1 billion. Most of it went to the stable farm USDC-DAI-USDT. When I checked yesterday the APR for that pool was 800%. This is of course extremely high for a stable pool. So I can see why a lot of people were tempted to ""ape in"" into this pool.

The ICE pools, the new farm token (high risk, just don't do it, it's a farm token of a new DeFi, why, why why?) where both at 5 million TVL. They had an APR of 44,000% (which is ridicules) Still, people investing in ICE surprised me. Why on earth would you put money in ICE? After what they pulled. Right now, Iron Finance V2 is not special in any way. It has a stable coin farm and two farm token farms, just like any other shit farm out there. Their ""new and improved"" stable coin is not even out yet. They have not proven anything yet.

That 5 million in both shit farms is now halved. So people already left the risky farm pools. Maybe because ICE went from 30$ to 2.5$ in 17 hours. Yes, that is correct, it already dropped 1200%!! But surely everyone was expecting this?

Why on earth are people giving the Iron Finance team enough credit to invest in their shit farm coins again? 

The stable farm is down to an apr of 58%. Still high for a stable farm but nothing spectacular. Yet it currently holds 1.4 billion TVL. I read some messages about high slippage when withdrawing money so even investing in this seemingly low risk farm might have been a mistake.

So everyone, please stop, you like Iron Finance? Just wait a month, see where it is, if it's not dead, than maybe check it out, but right now it's poison.

If you really want to get into Defi, check out the safer options like AAVE, Curve, maybe Beefy (but not in pools with native farm tokens). Balancer on Polygon is looking good too. Pretty good APR and the team is NOT anonymous (like Iron Finance dudes) and it already exists on ETH network. It's all risky but at least it's no Iron Finance. Put that shit on ICE."

These people are working day and night to find ways to exploit the weaknesses of the platforms, and to cause irreversible damage. 

CipherTrace’s “Spring 2020 Cryptocurrency Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Report” states that the crypto hacks, frauds and thefts accounted for a total of $1.36 billion in the first five months of 2020. 

However, many projects and DeFi institutions are working on solutions for these issues, for example, BTCV are aiming to tackle certain issues such as, unauthorized access to private wallets by getting access to the user’s private keys. They are also trying to find solutions for the human errors in sending transactions, like using wrong address or wrong amount. 

In order to solve these issues BTCV created a 3-key security solution. this helps users generate three Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys. One of these keys is stored automatically in the application, while the other two need to be managed by the user. 

1- The standard transaction key is the one generated automatically and stored in the wallet, it is used to recover the wallet in case of any issue, and to initiate transactions.

2- The cancel transaction key is used to cancel initiated transactions within 24 hours after 144 blocks are generated.

3- The fast transaction key is the third key that enables secure and fast transactions.

We do need numerous projects like this one, in order to make DeFi a safe replacement of the traditional banking sector! What do you guys think?"

# 0. Speculation vs. Conjecture

&gt;Speculation is  the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence...  
&gt;  
&gt;Conjecture is something which is suspected to be true due to preliminary evidence, but no proof or disproof has yet been found...([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture))  
&gt;  
&gt;Conjecture is an idea, hypothesis is a conjecture that can be tested, and consensus emerges when other colleagues agree that evidence supports a hypothesis... ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389200/pdf/Beilstein_J_Org_Chem-13-620.pdf))

I try to keep the speculation to a minimum and be transparent with potential sources of error that could be distorting my answer. However, I feel like I haven't been as clear as I should with that line so I'm going to be much more explicit on when I'm doing which and have re-labeled/re-flaired my previous posts accordingly. Some posts fall in neither category since I'm just regurgitating information.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I classify the following post as weak conjecture

(IMPORTANT NOTE: Currently, the exponential trend is being re-evaluated, but it is technically no longer valid. I am giving my conjecture on why I think it at least has valid basis and speculate it will re-emerge.)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A. Exponential Price Trend

In the next post, I will continue to present my estimate of the shares shorted from the end of the January Sneeze until the near present and cumulatively since the short position was opened in 2015. Before we move on though, I need to touch on a few things.

Part of what started this whole endeavor was to find out the the cause and implications of the exponential trend. Recall, the previously held exponential trend equation is:

[Exponential Trend](https://preview.redd.it/n55yp96gwza71.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f093dfffa1dca737ea1a503db0ff6be6082beee4)

At a point in the following post, I will use this equation as a price trend and use it for data. Of course this requires some justifications. I don't have hard evidence, only some concepts I've learned exist in the realm of economics which might be able begin to explain what we're seeing:

&amp;#x200B;

**EXPONENTIAL DEMAND**

It exists, take it from someone way more wrinkled than mine:

&gt;""...exponential demand is not much more challenging mathematically than linear demand, and in fact it has some nice features...it has a simple and intuitive elasticity function (proportional to price)."" ([source](https://wernerantweiler.ca/blog.php?item=2018-06-30))

Not only does it exist, but we've been kind of looking at it the who time, we just didn't know we were.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONSTANT ELASTICITY**

Don't forget, slope and elasticity are related, but not the same. Slope is constant along a linear demand curve, but elasticity is not, in fact:

[source](https://preview.redd.it/167umw5nxza71.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d67a22cb52991c12b874e1d3280622491c470669)

This is what curves with constant elasticity look like. Tilt the graph 90 degrees and the curve might look familiar.

[source](https://preview.redd.it/jw5jmwn3yza71.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b601f2f4941ed3e67565922da08a17e9a4ee93a)

&amp;#x200B;

**GIFFEN GOOD**

'But Nydus, the curve is downward sloping and the exponent is negative, plus you told us all demand curves are downward sloping!' Turns out its ALMOST all of them:

&gt;""A Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa—violating the law of demand."" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giffen_good))  
&gt;  
&gt;To be a true Giffen good, the good's price must be the only thing that changes to produce a change in quantity demanded."" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giffen_good))

What is mathematically significant is that:

&gt;""Only goods which do not conform to the law of demand, such as Veblen and Giffen goods, have a positive elasticity..."" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand))

Let me be clear, I'm not implying that Giffen goods all have exponential demand, I'm saying that a good exists in the realm of economics with a positive elasticity.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# B. IMPLICATIONS

I believe the existence of these concepts allow us to extrapolate a bit more on what this trend might indicate.

Furthermore, I speculate it is highly likely that the linear expression in the exponent is directly related to constant elasticity of the demand curve and that constant elasticity is presenting itself as exponential on the price chart. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to construct a demand curve. I will, but it'll involve crunching volume numbers over this time frame, which will probably take awhile.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# C. Why Has The Trend Broken Then?

* Recall, a monopoly has no supply cure. Its behavior is dictated by the market demand curve and their marginal cost curve (coming soon). Either something about our demand has changed or their cost of shorting has changed.
* One likely explanation is that the the ATM offerings affect quantity, which would likely affect elasticity and the behavior
* As far as a change in cost, I speculate that they are leaning on their crypto assets more now.
* Also keep in mind, the trend in the past has been to go parabolic, trade sideways in a wedge for awhile and repeat. That doesn't guarantee it will happen again, but it is worth noting.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# D. Next Posts

* Short &amp; Shorter, Ep 3. - how many shares were shorted from post January to near present and combining it with the counts we've gotten in previous posts.
* Haven't fully decided, but it will involve the marginal cost curve"

I've shared this method with several friends to great effect over the years, so I figured I'd post it here for your benefit as well!

This is one method to purchase a reasonable and affordable used car, then periodically upgrade to a newer vehicle over time.

Step 1: Determine an affordable payment given your cash flow situation (there are a million posts on this topic. I won't go into depth, but the ""&lt; 10% of take-home"" rule of thumb tends to make sense!) Let's say $250/mo is an affordable payment for this scenario.

Step 2: Use a loan calculator to determine a total loan amount based on the payment established above. Make sure the loan term is no more than 36 months. You can also use the PV function in excel! Let's assume we get a 3% annual interest rate (remember to divide that by 12 in excel!). This gets to a loan amount of $8,596.62.

Step 3: Determine your total purchase price by multiplying the loan amount above by 2. Basically, we're going to put 50% down on a $17,193.24 (or thereabout) vehicle and finance the other half.

Step 4: Find a 3-year old vehicle with reasonable mileage (&lt;36k ideally) for $17k. If you don't have $8,600 to put down, the take the amount you do have, and multiply that by 2 to arrive at your purchase price. I'm seeing a 2018 Toyota Corolla (writing this in 2021) on Autotrader.com for $16,988. After some negotiation, and sales tax, I'd bet you can keep the final price under $17k.

Step 5: Plan to own the vehicle for 6 years. In the first 3 years, you'll simply pay your minimum loan payment. in years 4-6, you'll continue making that same payment, but into your own savings account. In this scenario, at the end of six years, you'll have saved up $9,000 ($250 X 36 months)

Step 6: Sell the car after 6 years. Caredge.com suggests that a 3-year old Toyota Corolla that was bought for $17k might have a resale value of roughly $11k after 6 years.

Step 7: You should now have roughly $20k available to put toward your next vehicle ($9k saved, plus $11k resale proceeds). One option is to buy another 3-year-old car for cash. Another option is to upgrade your ride. Simply re-calculate your new affordable payment per Step 1. Assuming your income has kept up with a 2.5% inflation rate, you should be able to comfortably afford a $290 payment by then, meaning a $9,972 loan amount, and a vehicle costing between $19,944 ($9,972 X 2) and $29,972 ($9,972 + $20,000). Another search of autotrader.com says I could potentially upgrade to a 3-year-old Lexus IS 300 for under $30k. Repeat the 6-year payment and saving process to come away again with ~$26k for your next purchase in year 12.

Questions: 
Why a 3 year old car? For one, the depreciation curve has generally begun to level off after 3 years. Additionally, there tends to be a strong supply of vehicles coming off of a 36-month lease, and these vehicles seem to be well cared for in my experience.

Why own for 6 years? If you're like the average driver, you'll tend to put about 12k miles on the vehicle per year. If you purchase at 36k miles, this would put the vehicle at 108k miles when you sell it. Again, in my experience, this seems to be the time when major work is required (timing belt) and the interior niceties tend to wear out (plastic knobs, dash lights, etc.). It also seems like there are still a healthy number of buyers in this 9-10 year age range, especially for particular makes/models. Finally, when you do purchase your next vehicle, a six year difference in model years will feel like a really great upgrade.

While I generally caution people away from getting into debt, if you're like me, you probably need a car before you've saved all of the money up front. I thought this strategy was pretty genius when it was originally explained to me. What do you think? Have you heard this strategy before? Are there ways to improve upon it? Any other ideas?"

# Uncharted Territory

I feel like I've managed to stay in the conjecture zone up till now, barely at some points, but still in the zone. In this part we're going to probably start violating the speculation zone. Reasons things might get a little weird:

1. This will be our third and fourth iteration. Its very likely that my margin of error grows with each iteration of this process (one wrinkle brained ape estimated that I'm probably at about 10-15% error as of the end of last post).
2. I will stick to Finnerty's equations and theories, but use my own conjecture to apply them.
3. I will be using the exponential trend as price data (justifications in previous post)
4. Past a certain date, ATM offerings would have to be factored in. It adds complexity so I try to cut off the timeframe before it starts happening. I want to integrate these into the model into the future but not now.
5. Price drops get smaller and smaller, making it harder to identify the price drop pattern.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Time Frame

The layout for this time frame will be slightly different. Originally, I had planned to identify the price drop pattern, do a normal 3 event shorting cycle, then move on to the next pattern.

As I tried to identify the next full price pattern, no obvious one presented itself. The only substantial price drop consisted of just two points. On top of this, they may overlap with the first ATM offering. However, I am at a woeful lack of data points so I figured a way to include them.

The full 3 event shorting cycle will be called ""Leg A"", and the 2 event shorting cycle will be called ""Leg B"".

In earlier posts, I point out what I call a ""scramble strategy"" in Finnerty's paper. This is when the manipulator is hit by an unexpected positive catalyst and must increase the magnitude of their short attack at time 2 in an effort to compensate. Originally, I said I was not going to use this scenario, but it seems to fit our exact situation.

**LEG A**

* Time 0 - March 12; P(0) = $264.50
* Time 1 - March 15; P(1) = $220.14
* Time 2 - March 23; P(2) = $181.75
* Time 3 - March 24; P(3) = $120.34

&amp;#x200B;

**LEG B**

* Time 0 - March 30; P(0) = $194.46
* Time 1 - April 12; P(1) = $141.09
* THIS LEG ENTERS THE SPECULATION ZONE

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Multiplicative Demand Shock

&gt;""In economics, a demand shock is a sudden event that increases or decreases demand for goods or services temporarily."" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_shock))  
&gt;  
&gt;""...even if the linear demand is defined in a restrict production range so that the price is positive, with a negative stochastic variation of Y the positive price could become negative (a problem of economic consistency). In order to prevent this, **one alternative is to consider a multiplicative demand shock...**  
&gt;  
&gt;""**A good feature of multiplicative demand shocks, that is, P = Y \* k, where k can be a deterministic demand function**, that is: if Y follow a GBM then the price P also follows a GBM and with the same parameters like drift and volatility! The vice-versa is also valid."" ([source](http://marcoagd.usuarios.rdc.puc-rio.br/dema-unc.html))

I will be using this property in the last part of my calculations. My point in mentioning it is there exists a precedent for a multiplying a scalar or another function times your demand curve to simulate a demand shock.

# Conclusion

This began as a mathematical ritual, so I feel I should end on that note with a bit of mathematical symbolism I found to be prophetic about the ominous doom hanging over Kenny's head.

In the paper, time 3 is the reckoning. This is when the true value of the stock is revealed and the whole market demand curve shifts.

I know I've mapped out several time 3's but think of those as 'dummy' time 3's I used to help me divide the time frames up and make the math easier (think of mini-waves within a bigger wave for the Elliot apes). The REAL Time 3 has yet to come. 

All the manipulators in Finnerty's model, no matter what the strategy the they devise. He cannot escape time 3.

At all other times they can choose not to act, but they must act in someway at time 3. Whether that be rolling over their FTDs or pushing the price to near zero. They must act, or they must cover and close. In this model, it is a mathematical certainty."
"Let me take a step back and actually explain why I’m so euphoric about Beam, and why I’m working with them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/beamprivacy/comments/ollimu/let_me_take_a_step_back_and_actually_explain_why/,americanpegasus,1,2021-07-17 01:23:34,56,/r/beamprivacy/comments/ollimu/let_me_take_a_step_back_and_actually_explain_why/,DISCUSSION,"Here’s the first thing you need to know, I am on Beam’s payroll these days.  I want to avoid any of the silliness that recently plagued the Monero community.  But *why* did I accept the position with them?  Ever since I got back into crypto heavy this year, I have been looking for the next big big thing.  When Bitcoin and Dogecoin came around waaaay back when, I saw something no one else saw.  I saw magic before the masses discovered it.  It was the same story with Monero.  Privacy was the next big advance in crypto technology (and the masses still haven’t quite gotten up to speed on it). I admit, I was mistaken about the power and potential of defi when it first launched, and as a result I underestimated Ethereum back in 2016.  But that’s not a mistake I’ll repeat.  The power of defi allows a financial universe to build on top of itself in new dimensions.  It creates infinite games *within* the game.  And a quality financial game alone, a well-designed one, is priceless by its very nature. To have an entire financial ecosystem inside that same game?  That’s something with enough power to *actually* topple the worlds financial oligarchy - not just threaten to do it.  

The underlying potential of defi is sheer magic, and smart contracts can now do things even the smartest giga-nerds didn’t see coming half a decade ago.  In 2015 we would never have dreamed that automated market making could take over like it has. And this is just one example of the kind of powerful tools humans will build if you give them defi capabilities. I’m sure there are others that we haven’t even thought of yet that will become mainstays throughout the 2020s.

Privacy is needed though. That part is not just a gimmick. It protects you: from dystopian governments, from the nefarious individuals, and from any financial competitors.  Privacy also brings fungibility on the layers that embrace it, and it allows true freedom of money - not just money as a public joy toy spectacle.  
  
The worlds wealthy and powerful are not going to transact and shift the weight of their balances into a chain where everyone can constantly observe them.  They’re not fucking goldfish who want to be on display.  They’re *whales*.  Those public chains might seem like the big dogs in town, but they’re babies toys compared to the potential of confidential ones.  And so I began to ask myself earlier this year: *Who is doing private and confidential defi?*  And the answer was that at first glance nobody was.  A few chains I had some rudimentary designs for smart contracts, but none of them were close to delivering.  And in my cursory search I overlooked what would become my new darling: Beam.  
  
I did hear about Mimblewimble back in 2019 when the proposal first came out; I try to stay on top of any new groundbreaking math in the space.  MW is a new way to do confidential blockchains that is more elegant than Cryptonote or any of its permutations.  Like many world changing white papers, the MW proposal was dropped off in deep-nerd-territory anonymously, and it humbly described a novel way of solving an existing problem: in this case a more scalable, still fundamentally private, decentralized blockchain.  In the beginning, there were two main chains launching Mimblewimble projects.  Grin was one, and I trolled it endlessly for their linear emission schedule.  Because of the way they are emitting coins it’s going to take a long ass time for them to develop solid liquidity in their economy, and as a result it gives them very little margin for error in adoption during these early years.  Sadly (from what I’ve seen) it sounds like they are taking that small margin of error and seeing just how far outside the lines they can scribble.  This is not the official position of the Beam team, it’s my own personal opinion.  Other than that, I do like their community funded approach.  Up until a year ago I was a blockchain purist (as you may know) and many of their idealistic principles speak to me.  

Beam was the other chain launching a Mimblewimble project.  They seemed like they had some talent and a firm vision behind them, but I trolled *them* endlessly because of the dev mine built into the emissions for the first five years.  As a blockchain purist, the idea that they would take a small percentage of every block for centralized governance, management, and development seemed like total bullshit to me at the time. I didn’t like the idea that a chain could be bootstrapped by a centralized authority at all, and I thought they would squander the tokens and that centralized bootstrap decision would haunt them forever.

But then something strange happened: *I was wrong*.  I’m allowed to be wrong.  It happens sometimes, even to someone as loud and self-righteous as me.

Beam took that founders reward, and has created something that has *no right* to be as advanced as it is two years after launch.  They accomplished their mission and proved the doubters (me) wrong.  They have nearly perfected a solid Mimblewimble base layer in the time it’s been around.  It has a slick and attractive mobile app, they’ve improved the privacy versus the original protocol, and they’ve even incorporated advanced features like payment channels already.  Now they’re moving on to something even bigger.  

2021 will see the launch of the age of defi for Beam. This was the holy grail I’ve been looking for. Confidential decentralized finance, featuring smart contracts where the amounts you’re sending and the amounts you’re holding aren’t on display for the whole world to go look at, follow, and take aim at.  It’s real, and it’s already working in small test capacities. The first large scale test, staking for a governance contract, is set to start in the next month. This isn’t some vague ERC20 bullshit pancake waffle token with the promise of building something one day. This is a real blockchain with next-generation technology already running and performing miracles. *And if it’s this good now*, just a couple of years after initial deployment, imagine how good it’s going to be by 2025 (when the emissions curve really starts to tighten btw).  

We are early, and the tokens are still being mined at a pretty rapid pace.  Think thirty cent Monero early.  They have the same (more or less) schedule of emissions as bitcoin so the block rewards will drop off sharply over the coming few years. They certainly won’t be $.40 each for very long. The market cap on this motherfucker is like $50 million right now. **That’s like finding $5 million Monero in 2015**. For what it represents, the value proposition, it’s absurd and offensively low.

Serious players, and even small fish in this world who may eventually become serious players, aren’t going to want to transact on a public defi chain if they have private options.  Large whales don’t want their transactions front run and monitored by the world. People trying to escape and operate in hostile governments don’t want large powers that be to be able to monitor their finances.  To believe that they would just lay down and let the world see the cards in their hand is just foolishness.  
  
So earlier this year, I did what I do when I find an undiscovered gem: **I got excited**.  I started writing in their telegram all hours of the day, pointing out little ways they could improve, and helping my friends and crypto family get into this.  After a couple of months of sustained euphoria, they wanted to meet me and offer me a position on their team.  I mean, y’all know when I get hyped about something, I get. fucking. hyped. about it.  It only made sense to work with them in a more intimate capacity.  Even Monero offered me a moderator position on their subreddit; this isn’t a new concept that I work with the projects I love in am official capacity.  So make of it what you will, this is just me being honest with you.  A *lot* of projects have wanted me to work with them over the years, and I turn them down.  I can’t be involved with something I’m not passionate about, and that I don’t believe in down to my core.  
  
If you are reading this you have a chance to be involved with something truly special, one of those world changing financial weapons that only comes along once or twice a decade.  Here it is. It’s new, still being developed, Elon fucking Muskrat isn’t tweeting about it yet, Tik-Tok isn’t tocking about it yet, it’s the real undiscovered gem of the cryptocurrency world.  And *you* now know about it.

I mean, I should say ‘undiscovered for now’.

Over the past 10 years I have received hundreds, maybe thousands, of DM‘s asking me: “*Pegasus you were so on the money here and here and here, what now?  What do I do?*”  Bros, I’m not a financial advisor.  I’m an idiot who’s lost all of his money time after time.  I’m probably going to lose all my money again.  But I take those risks because I see potential and power in unlikely places years before the rest of the world.  Just like when I was euphoric about Bitcoin in 2013.  Just like Dogecoin in 2014.  Just like Monero in 2015.  

I can’t tell you what to do with your money.  All I can do is tell you what I’m doing with mine.  I’m all in Beam.  That’s it.  I can say that in 10,000 words, or four, doesn’t change the truth of the matter.  I can see the 2020s as they’re coming, and barring a few doomsday scenarios, Beam is *the* fucking move.  If it blows up, I’ll lose everything.  That’s how sure I am.

You wanna know where my chips are for the next few years?  It’s here.  You’re welcome."

&amp;#x200B;

Smooth-brained dipshit here. If you are like me (retarded), you probably don't have the full picture on exactly where we have come from, where we are where we are heading (hint: MOON). Fortunately for you, someone else smarter than me explained it me (actually lots of people). Here is my best attempt to give you a digestible segment of GME history. To do so, we have to understand **how** the world we live in came to be.  


What follows is an imperfect attempt to explain the FTDs, tactics of SHFs, and a heavy dose of macro event analysis and speculation as to their future current. What has happened, who we are up against, **and what should be, IMHO, the true meaning and purpose of our movement will be treated on**. I am not an FA. You would not be in this sub if you believed that people could easily be trusted. 

Let me say this, trust **NO ONE**, not even dear OP to tell you where the bear shits in the woods. I am just one dumbass . No one owns this movement. No single person speaks for it. I understand history and econ *decently*. (Also, fuck Trotsky, Redchessqueen, and Ken Griffin.) 

This is a history summary. Not a soapbox where I tell you my beliefs (except as they relate to GME or scumbag government shit).

However, History, the story of those who change the world, is being written this very moment, by the very readers of these words. Just by removing GME shares from circulation, you have joined, whether you know it or not, the last shot left in the barrel against a **highly** imbalanced society. Don't fuck this up.

Before I make myself an ass by proving how little I understand, I would like to implore every reader to keep something in mind as you read this, as it had a massive impression on me recently when I encountered it. I will link the sauce in the comments, as I don't want this post removed for ""anarchist shenanigans (I identify with my own philosophy, not anarchism or any other ideology mentioned in this post (if you are curious about my beliefs, listen to *Written In Uncertainty's* video ""What happened to the Dwemer"", the BEST lorecast on TES, I deny reality as real, don't take shit I say seriously)

In PM Bergman's introduction to *The Anarchist Cookbook*, he mentioned this while explaining anarchism as a philosophical postulate:

"" as recently expressed more simply in a note left in a bank burned by Anarchists in West Berlin: “Make kaputt what makes you kaputt.” 

The bank robbers from the heist in question did not rob that bank to get money.

*They robbed the system of the means which it robs them (the people) of and by.* 

In case any of you apes have not realized this yet, the system does not value you. It does not want you to succeed. Want to have the American Dream? Want a car? Debt. House? Debt. Money to pay for debt? College. Debt. It is even worse for non-US citizens, since their governments have effectively tied their ships to the US, even if Bretton Woods is dead.

PART I: Money For Nothing

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf3z2eo1kpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1737be0ca8db8c01c84c06cd019a2722c76d9f0d

Okay. The Federal Reserve is founded in 1914 as a replacement to the First Bank of the US, which Andrew Jackson famously gave a epithet to on his own gravestone: ""I Killed the Bank."" US policymakers supposedly observe that in Europe, crises and flights on their financial and capital markets occur *less frequently* in countries with central banks. The effective purpose of a central bank is to issue currency *in the name of* a government. Fast forward.

Pretend you're Uncle Sam. The Federal Reserve (The Fed), more specifically. The year is 1945, and after the abject destruction unleashed on the world through the fury of World War Two, economies (to pay for the stupid war) the world over have inflated their currencies to the point of being unable to redeem their bank notes with gold. (In fact, from the outset of the War, the British engaged in a *highly* successful seizure of foreign exchange assets belonging to Germany).

&amp;#x200B;

[Bretton Woods Resort, circa 1970](https://preview.redd.it/nzhm9nevkpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dd426eaa88564be06697eb704b245e9e800065c)

The feeble economies of Europe, who have now for the second time required your aid to prevent the destruction of the Anglo-American hegemony over the globe, agree that they will base the value of their own currencies off the dollar. You, Uncle Sam, agree to (continue to) tie your currency, the Dollar, to gold. This means that if people desire to do so, they can bring 32 (later 35) dollars to a US Federal Reserve Bank, and receive an ounce of gold. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/on9nfb74kpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=623a79bde058cb7ba0a733721ca92999e0c7548b

Cue the Cold War. The world is carved up into ""three"" groups: 

The First World - The developed capitalist, Western states of the world who politically align with the United States, NATO, United Nations, IMF, and World Bank (America's global military, diplomatic, monetary, and investment vehicles of influence, disrespectfully respectively)

The Second World - The communism aspiring, socialist/anti-imperialist states of the world, who mostly model political and economic regimes after the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) or the People's Republic of China (China \[versus Taiwan\]. It exercises its military alliance system through ""The Warsaw Pact,"" later referred to as ""The Eastern Bloc.""

The Third World -  All undeveloped countries of the world, newly freed (mostly) from the collapse of imperialism (ruling over a polity other than your own) which was a result of two world wars. These are up for grabs between Uncle Sam and Uncle Stalin.

Capitalism, in brief, is both the function of capital throughout economies as well as an ideology. It (usually) postulates the argument that private property and freedom are mutually inclusive. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v3aq67l7kpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c1acd40bba917f9c7e7509269b54f2d4f843ac0

Communism is the political section of a philosophy known ""dialectical materialism."" It's basic postulation is that history, and therefore the progression of society, occurs in ""dialectical"" relations. The consequences of this theory of history in conjunction with the Marxist assertion that capitalism, as a stage of history, would be deposed by communism (eventually), made Communism a force *inherently antagonistic to the capitalist US*. Under Stalin, communism was fused with the power of the state (dictatorship of the proletariat \[or in ""the name of,"" nominally.\]) It typically views private property and freedom as being mutually *exclusive*. Some argue that Trotsky argued for *world revolution,* versus Stalin's ""socialism in one country."" (Investigation of first-hand sources, such as actually reading the essay by Stalin ""Socialism in One Country,"" will show that Trostsky mischaracterized Stalin's arguments. He \[Stalin\] never argued for socialism in *only* one country. As a side note, if you liked Cold War history, read Kotkin's new bios on Stalin).

You, being the big-brained boy you are, decide to defend your newly found (after WWII) status as global hegemon and power broker. You develop a geopolitical strategy to halt the spread of Communism as well as increase your own power. So what do you do? Incentivize the world into joining you. Want access to the largest consumer economy in the world? Want the protection of the world's **biggest** brother?

So in return for political compliance, the US will protect you, invest in you, and allow you to cheaply finance US deficit spending.

CUE THE GREAT INFLATION ""Guns &amp; Butter""

&amp;#x200B;

[Guns](https://preview.redd.it/bhfxa4f2lpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2f4ddf34398c8f70423f6eb02b578b21d4881bb)

[Butter](https://preview.redd.it/wghz2tx5lpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b438687e9d62b0491ecab864a1584ca9b704814)

While America was busy investing huge amounts of money rebuilding the destroyed places of the world, things were great. The US was, increasingly, in possession of trade surpluses. It was further cementing its role as global hegemon, and leveraged access to its markets in exchange for (usually) political compliance to something the Americans can palate. 

This, on paper, looked as though capitalism and America might actually be saving the world from something worse.... Communism. Countries organized themselves along the above battle-lines. In some places like Cuba and Vietnam, Americans set aside peace to fight the spread of Communism. In the former, it almost resulted in nuclear ash, and in the latter, America found her innocence, pride, and trust cleaved from the bosom of her idealistic people. In time, the Darkness the war unleashed on the world would reach her shores. But people carried on much as they had, believing that their way of life would not change.

Cue LBJ.

The decade of the 60's has begun its slow degeneration of trust American's held for the instruments of governance. The war in Vietnam, supposedly a struggle to halt the spread of communism (oh yeah, definitely does not interfere with the principle of self-determination), combined with the massive spending incurred from the Great Society Reforms, has led the US to massively increasing the amount of dollars circulating throughout the world economy. 

Unfortunately, when  there is more of something (decrease in scarcity, the axiomatic problem economics seeks to address) it is less valuable. Beginning famously (within the realm of state actors) with the French, government treasuries around the world began to exchange their dollars for gold (because Uncle Sam did not change the gold exchange ratio when he shat all over the Dollar). The French sent their **armed** navy to pick up the gold, just to make sure there were no... problems.

&amp;#x200B;

[Tricky Dick](https://preview.redd.it/8ukjew2onpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00eaae55054180cb0631b2283b8977505d8c5366)

In April of 1971, after the US went from possessing 50% of world gold reserves to **12%**, US President Kissinger... I mean Nixon, suspended the convertibility of the US Dollar into gold. As years unfolded, the US figured it could create demand for its currency if the world's majority of oil was sold in US dollars (USD), as well as another method discussed below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jqw6jj8xnpb71.png?width=721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38649826d7b60d858c41506d2aa5addce64fbda8

In order to defend themselves, most currencies abandoned the dollar, and let the values of their currencies be determined relative to competition (on an open market called today FOREX \[foreign exchange\]). Given that **all** currency is only worth what people acknowledge it as being worth, personally, fiat currency (which has no assets you can redeem them for) is just as phony as asset-backed currencies. The major advantage, though, that the latter has over the former, is in the theoretical impossibility that inflation would exceed the supply  of the asset backing up the currency. America is proof that that is mostly bullshit.

And so, the war against communism faded into the background, as America realized greater problems. At the same time Americans fulfilled a generational wish to end the war in Indochina (Vietnam), massive increases in prices of consumers good causes extreme domestic discontent. The dollar losing its asset backing in gold did **so** much damage to the US. It was clear, however there was no going back.

In Keynesian economics, there is something known as the Phillips Curve. It looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/94wrdbhaipb71.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72ce6ff8ccaec098ffdac6448142a760b0a8d8ac

In case you're a dumbass (like me) and needed others to explain this to you, effectively what you are looking at is the **theoretical attitude** towards the relationship between inflation and unemployment that predominated central bank monetary policy worldwide for over three decades. The period of history we are entering effectively renders the above a curious artifact of the past. The above suggests that inflation and unemployment have a correlatively *inverse* relationship to one another. However, as we now know, correlation does **not** equal causation.

Unfortunately, the experience of the 1970's would obliterate viewing the above as a ""law"" of economics. Going into the 1980's, unemployment and inflation both hit record highs. Americans saw their buying power diminish year after year, as all the while, Arthur Burns makes money printer go BBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRR!! Powell would cum if he could see Burns at work. 

Let's talk about Burns for a sec. Here is his mug.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/osa76j4jopb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8866970d0f638477f5c78af613c89c0511584ec1

[This man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_F._Burns) was the Chairman of the Fed for quite some time (1970-78, two terms). He resisted the ""hard"" duty of a good Fed chairman: controlling inflation. With imposing and intimidating statesman like LBJ and Nixon on the political scene at the time, it is not hard to see how the Fed was swept up in a larger expression of the growing centralization of power in the US government. Aside from some war powers that were revoked from the President ([War Powers Act](https://www.e-ir.info/2014/11/19/presidential-war-powers-in-vietnam/)). Despite chairing the Fed during the *most fiscally irresponsible period of US history* at that time, Burns did not control inflation.

\---------------------

PAUSE:

So how exactly does the Fed affect the money supply? Isn't it as simple as just unplugging the fucking printer? Well... no. The Fed actually puts the currency it prints *into* the economy by *selling US Treasury Bonds*. What? Why does the Fed do that, I thought the Treasury did that. Well, it is true that the Treasury *issues* the bonds. But the Fed has **power**.

This power is called **monetary policy**. Monetary policy is when, through the raising and lowering of interest rates it controls, the Fed either contracts or expands, respectively, the amount of money in circulation, effectively ""setting the price"" of money itself. The Fed achieves this in several ways. The biggest, most notable method is through **Federal Open Market Operations (FOMO** lol**)**. The Fed, through the FOMO **buys** treasuries (and nowadays MBS and other shitty assets) from the market. (Foreign countries, retirement funds, and private investors frequently hold T-bonds because there is no other product on the globe that is easier to find a buyer or seller for).

\------------------------

After 8 years of nervelessly raising and then immediately cutting rates, it was clear to everyone that Burns would **not act** against inflation.

Fortunately, [a peanut farmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_carter) would end up as POTUS and made what is arguably the best decision (certainly the farmer's best) of any US president in the given century. After **years** of having absolutely no discipline on the fiscal or monetary policies of the US, ONE MAN was called. ONE MAN answered that he would do whatever to defend the United States' currency's status as the world's reserve currency (the currency most often used to conduct international balance-of-payments).

This man... was Paul Volcker.

https://preview.redd.it/7saig07aqpb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=817a3de1419fe48ad36513c22739b52fa43b2488

PART II: The Final Salvo

After it was a sure-thing that the USD would not be exchangeable for gold, the US rushed to justify its currency's existence. The US had a **hard** time making this argument: every year, the government increased its deficits, spent more, achieved less, and kept that printer going BBBBRRRR!

After all, if currency is not good for any particular utility, what is it good for?

Well, what if I told you how you could cheaply export to the largest, richest consumer market in the world, and *at the same time* make money off of loaning to the world's **safest creditor/debtor**: The United States Treasury. What if I explained **how** you can do this by 1. creating a currency and central bank. 2. Using that currency to buy US Treasury Bonds (increasing US Deficits). This gives **you** HARD currency to make purchases in the global economy, a means of defending your currency's value if it comes under attack in currency capital markets, and the endearment of the biggest kid on the block, Uncle Sam.

After you, say Angola, have done steps 1 and 2, you say that"" America is right! Markets are cool."" Americans are buying **your** shit that **your** people produced in **your** countries from your **materials**. ""What do you know, not only has the economy grown in real GDP terms, but so have standards of living and incomes. This is awesome! WIN-WIN All the way around,"" You think to yourself.

One day, you, the Federal Reserve chairman equivalent of Angola wake up. You put on your ""monkey \[we should call them ape-suits **when** we win\] suit,"" grab your coffee and smokes, and sit down to watch CNN on a quiet Sunday morning.

Some bitch with fake tits appears on the screen talking about how the Angolan dollar is taking a shit. You rush to work and summon a meeting of the cronies. As it turns out, because the economy has grown, so have prices. Inflation. When you printed all that money to buy T-bonds from Uncle Sam (to lower the value of your currency, making it cheaper and easier for you to export your goods to consumerist-addicted soccer moms), you did not **buy enough** T-bonds relative to the amount of your own currency in the world. This is **exactly** what happened to the US when people wanted the gold instead of dollars. Now, the investors and foreign governments of the world are *selling your currency for USD.*

Most of you apes are probably already aware that if *supply* for a product outpaces *demand*, then according to the Autist Retail Investor's Code of Hammurabi, **that ASSet's price will fall.**

You don't have enough dollars on hand to go out into the global market to buy your currency off the market to stabilize its price relative to other currencies. SO, what do you do? Just buy more US T-bonds, increasing the number of dollars you have. 

Remember, Central Banks cannot keep large amounts of their own currencies on hand, at the expense of foreign currencies, because you cannot use a currency (whose value is declining in real time) to buy the *same currency*. Your money is not really money if it can't be bought. 

If you *don't* buy more US debt, which allows its indebted citizens to get debt to continue buying cheap consumer goods coming from your third-world economy, then you will turn into 1998 Asia. Asia, particularly Thailand, was unable to turn the tide on the run on their currencies, and yet most managed to still cause massive inflation. Indonesia and the Philippines inflated the most.

If you succeed (UK fighting fuckers like Soros), eventually you will buy US T-bonds, use those dollars to buy your currency off the market, and stabilize the situation. Unfortunately, this **guarantees** inflation, since you have to increase the money supply to buy T-bonds from the Fed. It also means prices for consumers in your country will rise, and if you are lucky (Japan) growth will stagnate.

If you are not lucky (Zimbabwe), you will have problems. 

The end result of this process is the following:

1 Demand for US dollars is created, since you can experience real economic gains by buying dollars from the Fed with your own bullshit currency (pretend you are still Angola).

2 You modernize your country to a degree by maintaining the system of ""Imperialism with extra steps,"" before ultimately,

3. Learning that the whole debt-driven process is designed to **enslave every world government, treasury, and citizens to US debt. &lt;------------------------- YOU APE READ HERE**

Okay, let's go back to that handsome, tall fucker Paul V.

So fast forward to 1980. This time around, you won't be Angola, you get to be the average US investor. You just heard that some no named loser at the Fed disappeared. Some tall fuck who fucks called Volcker *is the Fed* now. Rumor has it he is going to fight inflation. The rumors are, unbeknownst to you, very true.

Taking interest rates on short term debt to ***higher than 20%,*** Volcker was successful in destroying inflation. Unfortunately, the commensurate rise in the cost of money put the economy into the worst recession since the Great Depression. For a decade now, Americans have lived with inflation and high unemployment coming and going. 

Now, Volcker has **exterminated** inflation by responsibly **doing his fucking job and raising rates.** Whether he possessed designs over remaining at the Fed, by the late 1980's, with inflation dead and unemployment decreasing, Volcker is expendable. 

A new man comes to the fore, a man with very different opinions on how capitalism works and should work.

Cue Lovefool by the Cardigans.

In 1987, Alan Greenspan was made Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Nominated by Reagan and ultimately surviving three Republican and one Democrat presidents spanning an 18-year period. 

Almost immediately [upon his confirmation](https://www.c-span.org/video/?150949-1/greenspan-confirmation-hearing), in which early days he expressed a **sharply** hawkish view on inflation that **completely disappeared,** the markets died.

Between portfolio insurance, corporate raiding, algo programs on computers that sell off entire asset portfolios **during declines in prices**, a shitstorm was out of the basket to be sure. See that scary long red line. That is one day. One day. Yeah, they called it Black Monday. The more the computers sold, the more computers sold. Traders **panicked**.

So what did our newly minted Chair Greenspan do?

After the Great Depression and Great Inflation, the Fed understood that as a result of its inactions, major crises were caused or accentuated. Unlike after the Great Depression, the Fed would do what it took this time to keep credit unfrozen so that the real economy did not seize up for a lack of financing or a withdrawal of existing financing \*\*\*. (Wrinkle-brained apes may like to study more about how when providing funding to corporations, different creditors can just **take their money back from you**. This is done by use of an ISDA clause. THIS right here is the exact reason Enron collapsed so suddenly. Investors (corrupt banks) literally withdrew money from the business).

The Fed lowered rates, especially the overnight lending rate, to provide cash to the economy after a whole fuck load of cash was wiped out instantly. The situation, after serious problems with Savings and Loan institutions which required a government secured bailout, stabilized.

Greenspan, aside from a comment in a speech, would never do anything to seriously raise rates again. The ""Great Moderation"" had begun.

"6 months into DeFi and Crypto, here's what I've learned—",https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/om24os/6_months_into_defi_and_crypto_heres_what_ive/,Cle4ncuts,1,2021-07-17 19:02:10,110,/r/defi/comments/om24os/6_months_into_defi_and_crypto_heres_what_ive/,NaN,"Hey there everyone, this is going to be a long post. 

Been a longtime lurker and I'm thinking my karma is finally high enough to post.

I've spent six months now in this space (which seems like a short time but really feels like two years), been through the highs and the lows. 

I wanted to do a public ""debrief"" with the aim of informing others who are just starting, and also to collect my thoughts so I can learn better. Without doxxing myself of course.

My first crypto buy was Bitcoin back in January, and yes, it means I got it for under 35k or something. And I traded it in the following weeks for about 10% gain each trade. My take on crypto was: it's highly speculative, very risky, and you should only commit a small amount of money to it, but you shouldn't commit 0. 

Lesson learned, I also bought ETH for under $800 an sold it for $880 or something. 

So when I first discovered DeFi projects in March, I started to see the real potential of adding more crypto to my portfolio. After all, what if crypto is not just a speculative asset, but part of an ecosystem with competitive benefits compared to banks? Then its true value, its fundementals, would be much higher. 

So slowly I got to know more and more about it, and that eventually resulted in my ""all-in"". I decided to put most of my savings into ETH and started using ETH apps. 

My first mistake: underestimating transaction costs. 

It feels easy to click buttons and do things on the Ethereum blockchain, especially back when 5-15 gwei was the norm, and transactions took maybe 3 minutes to confirm on average. But man was it expensive. 

All in all, in my first three months of DeFi I spent 1.5k USD on all my transactions. I had invested less than 4k at the time. It was devastating to realize that, but I came to terms with it and moved on. That's also what got me more interested in projects that saved gas cost like Dracula. 

I was getting the hang of providing liquidity on Sushiswap and collecting sushi rewards, but I was still heavily in the red. Then one of the worst things happened: one of the tokens I was holding took a 90% plunge. I was devastated. My 3k was now 300. 

But I collected my thoughts and sought to understand where it went wrong. I looked at the numbers on etherscan. One advantage of the blockchain is that you can always see what was happening, if you could make sense of the data. I saw that 99% of the token holders were still in, which meant the community still believed in the project, and long story short, I decided to become more active in the community. 

I wouldn't say I was ""fighting FUD"", but mainly I presented the numbers and facts, as well as learn more about how the protocol and space worked. I was eventually doing copywriting for the project, and even got offered a position. 

This is where I got the drive to continue. I saw that a community could hold on strongly even after a 90% plunge, so long as the facts were presented, and the devs come clean. 

So I continued farming on ETH. It still wasn't profitable due to the gas cost, but every new token I farmed helped me understand a little more about the Ethereum economy. I look through and researched about 15-30 projects a month while farming on Sushiswap. Every onsen launch was an opportunity to learn. 

One of my regrets: not getting into OHM when it was still in the early liquidity mining phase on Sushi. 

When I discovered Polygon, and moved my funds over, that was a breakthrough. Suddenly, I could use the protocols that I've been hearing about all the time, but we're too cost-prohibitive to use (due to the ratio of gas fee to earnings). 

I used AAVE, Curve, Sushi Kashi, and more for the first time on Polygon. And it was beautiful. All the research I had done, I could finally see it in action. 

Also the fluidity of funds in Polygon is amazing. You can switch your tokens from one farm to another in a flash. And it basically cost nothing. I was able to get in on Polycat when it was still $5 Fish, and rode it all the way up to $50. I was also in $1. 45 Titan, but we all know how that turned out. 

Basically, Polygon was like a special commercial zone with low taxes. It invited innovation, but unfortunately also profiteering. A lot of sketchy BSC inflationary farms came in and started crowding the space with nonsense tokens. 

I can't lie though, it was insanely profitable for a while. And through the market downtime of April-May, I still made around 5-7k in profits, because polygon tokens were mostly pegged to stables. 

I rode one shit coin farm from an extremely profitable launch, right into the ground in 24 hours. 

I also got in deep with Iron Finance V1. 

I was getting wary when mcuban got in on Titan. I sold my pot and put half into Terra LUNA, and kept the other half in stables. 

I should've stayed out, because the next thing I knew, Titan plunged back to 29 and I was buying back in, hoping to get a  quick profit. 

And that would become the transaction confirmation screen that haunts my dreams for the rest of my life. 

I slept soundly too, believe that this dip would correct itself just like the many others before, that Titan was ""too big to fail"" at 2.x Billion liquidity. 

All of that vanished the next morning. I couldn't say anything. It was 0. 

Honestly I kept it together for longer than I thought. I wrote a post on my personal insta about lessons learned, and I checked on my other funds just in case. They were safe. 

But I had lost close to half my net worth that day. And all within 8 hours. 

It wasn't until I called my partner and told them about it that I could cry out loud. But that felt good. I could finally talk to someone about it. 

Even though most of it is money I didn't have before DeFi, it's still a good year's worth of salary to me. It represented future possibilities, moving abroad with my partner, or putting a down payment for an apartment. Finally coming to terms with that gave me cathartic release. 

Anyway, I wasn't perturbed. I knew my risks going in, I just wish I followed my own advice a bit better. From then on, I decided to write my own investing rules. For example, no trading on my phone. No re-entering a project that I just exited, because I probably exited for a good reason. 

Anyway, I started investing in stuff I really saw long term value in, and that's given me a lot of peace of mind since. I don't watch the price as closely anymore, cos that didn't matter to me as long as the team behind the token was building things and had sound ideas. That's what got me to invest in LUNA and the Terra ecosystem, and finally, that paid off recently when it hit $9. 

I knew it might be temporary, and yeah, at the time of writing it's receded back down to something like $6.30, but I still believe in it, and I trust my convictions and instincts. 

I realized that community has value in DeFi. Dracula, BAYC, Punks, and OHM would be nothing without their stalwart meme lords and smoothbrained APR-crunchers. I make sure that every project I'm in now has a great community that's able to welcome newcomers, and also discuss high level tokenomics while explaining it to layman terms. 

I'm also invested in a few other projects that I think have long term value, and I've reduced my Polygon holdings to less than 1/5th of what it was before. Most of it is in Balancer, which is simply a great way to diversify your assets. 

The rest is in a dividends contract with a yield aggregator.

I'm not done with farming coins, but I'm definitely allocating my risk better now. I think TITAN was my biggest lesson to date, and though I wish it did not happen, I still got something out of it. From now on, my instincts will be sharper, and my nose for good/bad fundementals will be too. 

Most of my journey and thoughts I post on Twitter, including a spreadsheet and guide on how to use Mirror Protocol V2. You can check it out at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/DrCle4n)

I hope that this thread was a good read for you, and that you gain something from my experience. 

If you'd like to have a conversation, or if you have any thoughts/questions, do feel free to comment, or drop me a DM on Twitter where I'm more active. I'd love to engage with you.

TL;DR I spent six months in DeFi, got rekt multiple times including with TITAN. I recovered, learning from my mistakes, and started investing in long term projects instead, especially the ones with a great community. Since then, I sleep a lot better."

Start from Flowcoin ，foresee the future of the traffic era,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FLOWCOIN_/comments/omlr98/start_from_flowcoin_foresee_the_future_of_the/,FLOWCOIN_,1,2021-07-18 15:15:56,0,/r/u_FLOWCOIN_/comments/omlr98/start_from_flowcoin_foresee_the_future_of_the/,NaN," Since the arrival of the Crypto bull market in 2021, the tracks of various industries have also been competing for the highest position in the market. Concepts such as DeFi, distributed storage applications, non-homogeneous tokens NFT, and metaverse have become popular in the market in a short period of time. With the end of the bull market climax in May, the FOMO sentiment in the market has slowly dissipated. Behind the crazy market, do people need to rethink the distinction between hype and value?

Immediately afterwards, with the diminishing market enthusiasm, many countries began to issue corresponding policies to contain the encryption market to a certain extent. At the same time, people also discovered that countries have begun to build national-level development plans with distributed storage applications. Engineering facilities. Why can distributed storage applications stand out in many industry tracks at a time when the encryption market is constrained? Does distributed storage application have important significance for social construction?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3gezjn789xb71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=661f7b02a51ba417bb950f1c0b42d739eb55c054

Distributed storage applications are obviously more valuable in landing applications than the tracks in several other sectors. Concepts such as DeFi decentralized finance, NFT non-homogeneous tokens, and metaverse are more services from a macro perspective. The type of application track itself does not provide regeneration value for production. The distributed storage application is a practical application track, which in essence can bring reasonable solutions to the actual problems in today's society and provide strong underlying support for the development of the world Internet. With the rapid development of the Internet industry, mankind has now entered the stage of the third industrial revolution, and the Internet effect has accelerated the speed of social economic development and organizational structure improvement. The essence of interconnection is data competition. If a large amount of data cannot be effectively preserved, it will definitely cause the most severe obstacle to the development of human civilization in the future. Distributed storage applications are the frontier track of global development by solving the problems of intelligent data storage in the current era.

Distributed storage applications can be divided from the user perspective and the implementation perspective

From the user's point of view, a single application has more and more data, and commercial stand-alone storage has been unable to meet the market's demand for large amounts of data storage. Continuously increasing storage capacity will increase application costs. Another way of thinking is to gather many machines to provide services to the outside world. The most traditional interfaces are file systems and databases, but their interfaces are relatively complicated. Therefore, the initial distributed storage is looking for simple interfaces, the purpose is to focus on In solving the problem of distributed systems.

From an implementation point of view, distributed storage divides data into multiple slices so that each slice layer can be saved by any single machine. In order to ensure data integrity, each slice needs to be idled, including EC encoding and backup of multiple copies. By uploading fragmented data to the server, backups can prevent data loss caused by problems with a certain server.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kso91x099xb71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af8776b1849cc251058a8e0637c93cedfcc6784

Since the development of the Internet, the term traffic has coexisted with the Internet. Every time people browse a webpage or log in to a certain platform, traffic data will start to be generated. Under the huge traffic system, the current traffic data storage ecology cannot meet market demand. At the same time, the traffic data storage market has been under centralized integrated control for a long time, and the price is set by the traffic data storage company, and market users cannot choose. In addition, this type of data storage cannot guarantee the security of flow data. A new flow data storage solution called Flowcoin is proposed. Flowcoin is an ecological network that uses a staged storage solution for flow data retention. It uses the high transparency, traceability, and non-tampering characteristics of blockchain technology to solve the problem of privacy, security and easy loss of flow data. At the same time, Flowcoin adopts the DSN structure, which is a storage system that can be reviewed and publicly verified. It is also a decentralized storage network designed to motivate users. Flowcoin uses FLW ecological tokens as the underlying incentive. Users can store traffic data by paying FLW tokens. Digital miners can store and check traffic data by providing hard disk space and idle bandwidth. It reduces the cost of traffic data storage, simplifies the tedious operation process, and provides unprecedented technical support for the development of the Internet ecology.

Through the recent remediation of high-energy-consumption computing power digital mining represented by BTC in various countries, it can be understood that the project application in the blockchain field has ushered in another iteration. On the one hand, people hope that the blockchain industry can reduce energy. Consumption, use a more green and reasonable application mechanism, on the other hand, people hope that the application of blockchain projects has substantial social value and not just a competition between computing power and energy. Flowcoin uses hard disk storage space and network idle bandwidth as computing power to replace traditional energy computing power mining, and realizes a more green and environmentally friendly digital ecological mining concept. At the same time, Flowcoin provides a revolutionary ecological value solution for flow data storage, which can solve the problem of excessive storage of flow data caused by the development of the Internet industry. It conforms to people's expectations of blockchain applications in the future, and reshapes the value curve of the blockchain industry.

What truly reflects the value is the practical application that the project itself can bring. If there are only concepts, visions and ideas, it will not be able to pass time and market considerations, and eventually lead to damage to the funds of all participants and waste of social resources. For laymen to leave a negative impression on the blockchain industry, the blockchain industry has been severely blocked and its development is slow. At present, our Internet is still in the Web 2.0 stage. The value at this stage will be generated by the user's time, data, and privacy in exchange, and the value generated cannot be returned to the user in a true sense. With the development of the blockchain industry, Web 3.0 is coming soon. Web 3.0 will no longer only focus on the platform, but will serve the users themselves. Through the development of Web 3.0, every participant in the future Internet ecology can contribute to the value network, obtain due benefits, and return value to everyone's rights and interests."

BUX Crypto Newsletter #27

Hi,

We're bringing you the twenty-seventh newsletter of BUX Crypto! ✨

If you want to tune in to BUX Crypto on a daily basis, please follow us on Twitter or Telegram for more frequent updates and insights.

In this newsletter we're starting with something new: Crypto market insights.

From now on, every two weeks we will share the most important developments in the crypto market so that you are completely up-to-date with what's hot and happening in the space 🔥
 

Paraguay set to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

After the exciting news that El Salvador is set to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender it seemed like many Latin-American countries were soon to follow suit. Paraguay was leading the way and the first, highly anticipated, draft of the legal proposal concerning crypto was released this week. 

The country seems to take an embracing approach to the new asset-class, but refrained from declaring Bitcoin legal tender and instead takes a clear headed approach. The bill includes tight regulations for Bitcoin mining, a variety of systems to ensure investor protection and the introduction of various crypto licenses for operating in the country. 
 

Central Banks are feeling the crypto heat

On July 14th, the European Central Bank released more details on their Digital Euro project. While the message states that it still is an explorative project, it is becoming clear that cryptocurrencies are pushing the central bank to innovate. The message included the assurance that the Digital Euro’s environmental footprint would be “negligible compared to crypto-assets such as Bitcoin” while possibly maintaining privacy. 

On the other side of the Atlantic, FED chair Jerome Powell stated this week that central bank digital currencies would make cryptocurrencies unnecessary. All and all, the battle between centralized and decentralized currencies is clearly heating up. 
 

Compound Finance goes institutional 

In a blogpost earlier this month, Compound Finance announced the launch of their institutional DeFi treasury. With this new feature, the promising DeFi protocol aspires to bridge the gap between the world of crypto and traditional financial industry. Through this new Compound treasury, institutional investors can gain exposure to the benefits of the burgeoning DeFi sector, especially its lucrative yields, in a way that meets their high standards. And as you may know, Compound (COMP) can be traded on BUX Crypto! 


What we've worked on in the last weeks:

Listing two new assets: Curve DAO Token (CURV) and Basic Attention Token (BAT) can be traded directly with Euro! 🚀
 

BUX Zero integration. By offering BUX Crypto in BUX Zero users will be able to create a uniquely diversified portfolio of all popular stocks, ETFs and cryptos all from one app! More details about this will follow in our product roadmap update. 
 

Token bridge. Setting up the bridge between Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum so that token holders can also swap BUX token on Uniswap or Sushiswap in the future. Currently, the bridge is live on the test nets of BSC and ETH. Next step is to further build the user interface for swapping between the two chains. 
 

Utility improvements. Currently, the main utility of the BUX Token is that it gives users the option to trade with 0% commissions (100% discount) when users hold 1,000 BUX tokens or more in their portfolio. In the next iteration we are considering to create a more advanced token model that offers a broader range of incentives for our platform users. 

We will be working on these topics the coming weeks:

All product roadmap items mentioned above.
 

Adding new crypto assets to the platform. As the crypto ecosystem is expanding, demand for investing in other crypto-assets is also significantly growing. Therefore we continue our efforts to add new crypto assts to the platform in the coming weeks! 
 

Crypto deposits and withdrawals. As a result of the recent developments regarding the Bitonic and DNB court case, the new requirements from the DNB are becoming more clear. In the coming weeks we are working on a new solution to open up crypto deposits and withdrawals again!

In order to accelerate all our plans for development this year, we are looking to hire new developers and fill other positions!

So, if you are interested or know someone who might be interested to join our team, feel free to check out the open positions:

To be upfront, I know nothing about oil, or travel, or anything really. This is a assortment of information through discords, social media, and forums I've compiled and gonna parrot back to you because some of you are very intelligent beings in this field who could use this in

&amp;#x200B;

===

**OIL**:🛢⚫🥇.

Every so often I find myself perusing around, looking at charts, listening to people I think are smarter than me, or more knowledgeable and reading comments along the lines of:

&amp;#x200B;

👨: ""There's large potential for a supply shock.""

&amp;#x200B;

👩: ""We are primed for a energy crisis""

&amp;#x200B;

👨‍💼: ""We WILL see WTI to 100 easily.""

&amp;#x200B;

👩‍💼: ""Right now with the prices being as tight as they are, we stay in this 70-80 golden zone.""

&amp;#x200B;

👶: ""OPEC+ is just bullshitting and it's noise""

&amp;#x200B;

👪: ""WTI is going to $100 not even the wise Cathy Ark saw $70.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well let's get to the bottom of this. And let's look at some charts that I needed to ask a thousand to decipher.

===

""The Price is Tight""

&amp;#x200B;

   👩‍💼:  ""Prices are Tight, it's where we at and most likely where we are heading.""

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a visualization of that tightness in the physical market.

&amp;#x200B;

[ \(Fig 1\)](https://preview.redd.it/p0hole01zvb71.jpg?width=1247&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16f64429976adceb07016976f9a2915c29c1549f)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""IEA (Jul 13,) noting the seriousness of crude inventory situation. As usual, their warning is \*too late\* oil market will over-tighten in Q3 as shale discipline, delayed Iran deal, OPEC restraint drain OECD tanks. Inelastic supply response could equal shock"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""OCTG capacity is even further behind. Talking to a mill yesterday they are not making OCTG because the raw material pricing is above spot of the finished product.""

&amp;#x200B;

👶: ""OPEC+ is just bullshitting and it's noise""

&amp;#x200B;

OPEC+, is just creating a diversion, The deficit in oil markets right now is such that a 5md/d increase is necessary to stifle the fall in inventories to dangerous levels come late '21. Oil traders are calling for a likely out come of OPEC agreeing +0.5mb/d.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is inventories, seasonally adjusted below. Fig 2 displays the previous 10 years. Fig 3, shows actual floating storage with adjustment for potential unreported  (2021 in Orange)

&amp;#x200B;

[2021 In Orange  \(Fig 2.\)](https://preview.redd.it/enn7xxez0wb71.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289f7a9c2025481c40453e3549fe8befce6207fd)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let's compare that actual floating storage, adjusted for potential unreported.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Fig. 3](https://preview.redd.it/emt12cxd1wb71.jpg?width=1270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6041eca8207320c83c9a7f04c5677a54ec20c49f)

&amp;#x200B;

US, oil production recovery, coming in slow (Fig. 4 below). High output expected to not make a difference before next year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And if WTI stays sub 80 through August, shale production in U.S. perhaps couldn't pick up supply needed even through end of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Fig. 4](https://preview.redd.it/z635pkpq2wb71.jpg?width=1235&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80fae9dc34e3fec2e0af0e6f351eda3d89024c9c)

From here, OPEC+ reaching a deal, are most likely built into forecasts and is unlikely to affect the trend of higher spot prices going into the end of summer. I figure failure to reach a deal has bullish outcomes.

&amp;#x200B;

The downside scenario for spot: undercutting leading to a price war, given the lack of agreement with a shift in compliance could cause a drop.

&amp;#x200B;

👨: ""There's large potential for a supply shock.""

&amp;#x200B;

👩: ""We are primed for a energy crisis""

&amp;#x200B;

""IEA (Jul 13,) noting the seriousness of crude inventory situation. As usual, their warning is \*too late\* oil market will over-tighten in Q3 as shale discipline, delayed Iran deal, OPEC restraint drain OECD tanks. Inelastic supply response could equal shock"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""OCTG capacity is even further behind. Talking to a mill yesterday they are not making OCTG because the raw material pricing is above spot of the finished product.""

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Let's look into ""Supply Shock"" risk.  The Charts and Snippets above have oil investors thinking US Oil Production is indeed underwhelming. Well, what are the factors underneath this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's turn to CAPEX!

&amp;#x200B;

[CAPEX for MSCI ACWI O&amp;G \(Fig 5.\)](https://preview.redd.it/9ou8osxb7wb71.jpg?width=1349&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da69d0f4f3f4b36e28ac34777a45d22019840b8b)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gathering (been spoon-fed) that the graph above (Fig 5.) is useful, because underinvestment teamed with sharp shale declines are circumstances that can be the recipe for a surging energy price for a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the Capex graph brings up the question of ""What is causing this underinvestment?""

&amp;#x200B;

And that devolved into more graphs, charts and discussion:

&amp;#x200B;

1)     Central Banks, and ESG hinderances. Institutional investors (presumably) aren't so keen to put out monies to ""dying"" oil and gas industry for new investments.  Private and public companies, explorations and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

2)     The difficulties of acquiring crediting through the fractional reserve banking system. Coupled with regulatory structures deteriorating in the US and discussions of tax code changes to enhance the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

   Challenges of drilling cost reductions potentially being eliminated. The driver being inflation. Capital goods inflation is the source of pain through commodity pass-through and obliterating a industry in need of capital. 

&amp;#x200B;

3)     A big challenge to investments is the need to repair transmission and distribution of the electric grid. This ancient issue has been postponing new power connections for the pas two years

&amp;#x200B;

And so on and so forth... To the point I have 30 or so tabs on a separate browser in order to fully comprehend what is trying to be conveyed here.

&amp;#x200B;

So,  👨‍👦‍👦🛢, The Cartel (OPEC) has gained the high-ground again as price setter. If the hydra could stop fighting its own heads first. They can potentially eat well in the $70-$80's by letting it range and allowing complacency to set in. H

&amp;#x200B;

However, there's even more discussion for the triple digits via greed, but oil bulls always dream big.

&amp;#x200B;

This goes back to that ""sweet spot,"" comment.

&amp;#x200B;

👩‍💼: ""Right now with the prices being as tight as they are, we stay in this 70-80 golden zone.""

&amp;#x200B;

Simply:

&amp;#x200B;

🔼 80, Major oil producers will increase production.

&amp;#x200B;

🔽Below 70, they'll cut. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not as cut and dry I imagine, it's a general support and resistance you could say.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to get into another thing I don't know about by spiraling into Delta COVID; vaccinations rates, infections, travel restrictions. This already sucks and all I'm really doing is paraphrasing and posting charts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll let one of you chime in to that.

**In Relation Travel: A Snippet (Because this sucks and I'm Lazy)**

&amp;#x200B;

Aviation, and Air Travel painting a rosy picture with a rapid recovery (👀🔺🦠). Think a little hard and right tail risks as it concerns oil prices become more apparent.

&amp;#x200B;

Not a revolutionary discovery as this was common knowledge (not to me) to those who closely follow. 

&amp;#x200B;

The trend has been crystal clear. New discoveries were replacing 1 in 3 barrels used in '13. The replacement ratio has declined to 1 in 7 in '19 well prior to COVID.  Reluctance or hesitance to revive capex despite the price recovery and the issue of ESG  has clouded the industry in risks everyone should be preparing for.

&amp;#x200B;

===

**Afterthoughts?**

&amp;#x200B;

An Important point: A favorite thing I hear anytime I study this junk, ""BIG Backwardization."" Most Creditors require guaranteed sales prices before lending for reopening an operation. Which mean selling out of the curve for $50 is not smart business.

&amp;#x200B;

How Long can a upcycle last? Producers are very, FCF positive so can contribute capex again, if prompt prices continue to rise further, across months as legacy hedges roll off. Paired with flaccid demand then upside is limited.

&amp;#x200B;

And perhaps they aren't commit already because investor insistence on  invested capital rather than pursue volume.

**What about Beyond Meat:**

🌱🐄⁉

&amp;#x200B;

How does Beyond Meat fall into this? It doesn't. The title was pretty sick when I thought of it on the spot. Additionally, I thought the chart looked pretty sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just playing around looking at some stuff that goes into a period a slumber only to blow short/long's up every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, I'm a man of my word, there's no correlation beside inflation I suppose. Let's checking some sentiment from Tradingview, Stocktwits, Reddit, and my favorite Yahoo Finance comments.

An introduction to MODA DAO,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/on8qd5/an_introduction_to_moda_dao/,syed0403,1,2021-07-19 14:51:19,0,/r/CryptoMoon/comments/on8qd5/an_introduction_to_moda_dao/,DISCUSSION," Redefining  the future of Web3 music ownership, publishing and licensing via NFT  standards, decentralized governance and automated finance. We call it,  Music3.  


Since 2015, the music industry has been playing close attention to the world of blockchain. We’ve been talking about it at conferences for years. We’ve seen projects rise and fall; some disappearing forever, others making progress in an exciting direction. But in 2021, the Web3 space has advanced in a more rapid way. The time has come for the music industry to come together, embracing what looks less like another industry iteration, but an entire paradigm shift.

Welcome to MODA DAO.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next few weeks we will share the ingredients that are going into this project; ideas, creative, code, thoughts and thinking that comes from 30+ years in the music industry, 20+ years of start-up work, 6+ years in the blockchain space and 4+ years at the intersection of blockchain and music.

&amp;#x200B;

Here on Medium we’ll share information about the roadmap, the team, governance, technology, tokenomics and our innovation lab. We will also keep you, the MODA community, up-to-date with details of our token generation events and product launches.

&amp;#x200B;

Follow us here and on Twitter to get the news, hit telegram for quick engagements and look out for an invite to our discord for deep interaction with the community of like-minded artists and technologists.

Problems with music

&amp;#x200B;

The music industry has always been broken, corrupt and highly exploitative. In fact, the industry term for monetising music is literally ‘exploitation’. Beyond the known bottlenecks and middlemen lay some lesser-known problems like multi-billion dollar royalty blackboxes and a global collections system that takes years to distribute revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

In the modern streaming environment, the behemoth platforms have a stronghold on the pathway between the studio and listeners’ ears. Now that these platforms have all the music and hundreds-of-millions of paying subscribers, their goal is to reduce the amount of royalties paid to rights holders. Notice that Spotify often tries to push you to a podcast? Or are you wondering why they bought The Joe Rogan Experience? It’s because every minute you listen to their ‘owned content’ is a minute they don’t have to pay artists.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter what you are told, traditional corporate entities have one main goal: to make money between their suppliers and the customer, to deliver that value back to their shareholders and line the pockets of company executives.

&amp;#x200B;

MODA DAO is being built on a non-profit foundation where that middleman cut is reduced, automated, improved and streamlined and the value that’s created goes to the token holders and back into the ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

What progress have we made so far on that end? We have engaged a top legal firm to set-up the MODA Foundation drawing from their experience helping Synthetix become a fully decentralised ecosystem. The MODA Foundation will be incorporated within 6 weeks.

Problems with blockchain

&amp;#x200B;

Junk-in, Junk-out. The industry often heralds blockchain as something of a magic wand; a quick fix for any out-dated or corrupted system, instantly cleansing it. This simply isn’t true. This year we have seen countless copyright infringements, fake works and improper monetisation of creative output. Blockchain, like any system is only as good as the data that goes in. MODA’s primary goal is to ensure the Web3 world does not become the wild west of music, dragging us back 20 years to the days of p2p torrenting.

&amp;#x200B;

The old system won’t work. A new entertainment world is emerging; Interactive music experiences and VR metaverse performances with decentralised ownership and governance. Anonymous, global NFT marketplaces, multi-currency liquidity pools, yield farming and loan collateralization using digital assets. Most of these worlds are completely untapped by the legacy music industry and frankly, they don’t know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Bridges between networks. While designed to be democratic and open, the blockchain ecosystem is evolving as a tribal and somewhat segregated space. In order for the entire space to work towards evolving an industry like the music industry, there needs to be some standardisation and interoperability between technologies and networks. MODA is focussed on the ethereum ecosystem (inclusive of sidechains and L2 scaling solutions) due to the network effects, but with problems like transaction fees and gas costs top of mind, we will be exploring various EVM-compatible communities and L2 scaling solutions like ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. It is paramount that any new model for the music industry is secure, scalable, and trustless.

&amp;#x200B;

Bridges between the legacy industries and Web3. Music3 (as we call it) exists already; it’s predominantly a stand-alone part of the music industry with little integration with the rest of the world; NFT sales, blockchain streaming, fractional ownership and social tokens that don’t heavily interface with the standard lifecycle of a song, the global royalty collection system or the meta-data standards of DDEX, ISRC and ISWC.

&amp;#x200B;

The solutions to these problems, both technical and strategic, will be addressed in the MODA Light Paper and form the basis of the Founding Board’s first open standard projects.

Three pillars of operation

&amp;#x200B;

MODA is being established as a not-for-profit foundation (with a tokenised value structure) for the sole purpose of pushing Web3 music forwards and establishing a more sustainable future for audio creators. Therefore, the token model itself contains a balance of free and open-source tooling for the music world, and value-creating functions which will drive its long-term growth:

Pillar #1: Music3 Infrastructure and creator tools

&amp;#x200B;

MODA will offer tools for the music industry to be fairly and transparently compensated for the value they bring to the world by leveraging Web3 technologies. While these are not aggressive drivers of the Value Model, users will be required to sign the MODA constitution and hold at MODA tokens as a member, as well as staking MODA behind each track that they wish to ‘exploit’ in the Music3 way.

&amp;#x200B;

Each of the following would need to be voted on by the DAO:

&amp;#x200B;

Membership structure for ensuring authenticity and network effect

Open on-chain music registration

International Standard Collaboration Code (ISCC) contract creation

&amp;#x200B;

Pillar #2: dPub — A publishing ecosystem for Music3

&amp;#x200B;

MODA is building a new backbone for the future of the music industry, by replicating some of the old structures in a new, decentralised, autonomous and highly streamlined way. Some of these functions are also powerful value-drivers for the token economy and the future of the DAO:

&amp;#x200B;

A (dPub) publishing DAO structure that plays the role of maximising the monetisation opportunities for the musical composition and songwriting side of each song in MODA Publishing.

A global, digital, autonomous and decentralised licensing and collections agency designed for Web3, NFTs and virtual performances here, in the metaverse and beyond planet earth.

Autonomous, DAO-voted grants and decentralised finance options will replace old-school album advances.

&amp;#x200B;

Pillar #3: MODA Innovation Lab

&amp;#x200B;

The MODA Labs Innovation zone will produce highly innovative and experimental products, designed to test the future of Web3 &amp; music in a live, real-world environment. When successful, these experiments will scale out of the lab and add value to the MODA ecosystem. Teams who join the DAO will be able to apply for technology grants. Some concepts have already been conceptualised by the launch team and are moving into production.

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-release music-hype market

Music Genesis NFTs

A user-generated content revenue share engine

NFT based autonomous micro-licensing

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward, in some cases, development bounties may offer the community an opportunity to help bring concepts to life. We believe in decentralisation and democratisation of all aspects of creative work, and adding to the platform is no exception.

The MODA Value Model

&amp;#x200B;

The MODA Value Model is designed to give token holders exposure to the MODA DAO ecosystem at 3 levels:

Layer 1: The MODA Layer

&amp;#x200B;

Holders of the MODA Tokens can join the MODA Foundation DAO. MODA tokens will be taken out of circulation when songs are moderated out, when release NFTs expire, or when new DAO members join. MODA publishing will earn revenue from any song it manages, and revenue will be split three ways with a % going back to the MODA Fund, another % buying tokens back on the market for recirculation into the reward pool, and a small % burned to drive continual growth and liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

In September 2020, Trent McConaghy (the founder of Ocean Protocol) introduced the “Web3 Sustainability Loop” which OCEAN is currently testing in Beta. MODA’s macro model is derived from this, using music as the source of value rather than data.

Layer 2: The Artist Layer

&amp;#x200B;

A level deeper, MODA members may be able to back certain artists as a way to increase their exposure and ranking within the DAO. In some cases, artists may choose to return rewards to their backers in the form of Artist tokens, NFTs or MODA Rewards. What artists choose to do with their NFTs and how they reward fans and backers will be entirely up to them.

Layer 3: Song Layer

&amp;#x200B;

At the song layer, MODA members could stake into new songs before they are released as a way of increasing their visibility within the MODA catalogue. Staking into a song might mean receiving NFTs and receiving trade fees as new Music Genesis NFTs are bought from a Bonding curve. This model again takes inspiration from Ocean Protocol, with reference to the Ocean Data Market.

Operational Pillars + MODA Value Model

&amp;#x200B;

Below, you can see how the Operational Pillars combine with the MODA Value Model to deliver a new iteration of the Web3 Sustainability Loop; a market-proven token model that has now been applied to the music world.

Technology

&amp;#x200B;

The Web3 landscape is one of the fastest developing technology spaces in the world. It is essential that projects remain nimble and open-minded when it comes to blockchains and scaling solutions. The undeniable truth about the space in 2021 is that Ethereum has developed a stronghold on network-effect, developer community, investor network and industry adoption. Networks like Matic/Polygon now extending that base layer into new territory with a very high degree of interoperability, For this reason, MODA will launch with an ERC20 as the base digital asset and transaction fee / gas reduction will be one of the primary goals of the project right out of the starting blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

The MODA tech team prefers optimistic roll-ups as a scaling solution in the short-term, but others will be considered seriously as the project evolves. Smart contracts involved in the network will use a proxy pattern to allow the project to adopt new functionality and approaches as technology matures.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, alternative chain solutions and low-impact options such as WAX may form part of the solution over time.

&amp;#x200B;

At the core, MODA is designed to bridge not only the legacy music industry with Web3 but to also bridge existing networks through standards and interoperability. MODA is about allowing people freedom, not locking them into walled gardens.

&amp;#x200B;

This article is not intended to be technically deep, our team are working on the V1 Lightpaper now in conjunction with Coinage who were instrumental in the development of not only the Synthetix tokenomics, but also the smart layer of the SNX multi-currency trading platform. MODA is also working closely with Ocean Protocol, and looking to leverage the base layer data-market contracts for V1 of the Music Genesis NFT product with potential to extend this integration into our core publishing framework.

Roadmap

&amp;#x200B;

The MODA Roadmap is being carefully modelled as the initial board is brought together. While dates are not yet set, all of the following will be proposed for the first 5 years of DAO activity.

2021

&amp;#x200B;

Completion of private sale

Token Generation Event

Launch pad, fair auction or IDO

Staking and rewards dashboard

Voting portal

Publishing company launch

Innovation lab launch

&amp;#x200B;

2022

&amp;#x200B;

Music provenance program

Music NFT standards board

Metaverse music licensing standards program

Web3 ISCC standard creation and launch

Metadata and music classification standardisation program

Cross-chain music metadata program

Legacy industry bridge

&amp;#x200B;

2023+

&amp;#x200B;

Catalogue acquisitions

Dedicated Music3 storage and data network

Fractional ownership legal framework

&amp;#x200B;

It should be noted that MODA is taking a progressive approach to decentralization and in the beginning, the Founding Board will have controlling decision-making abilities. This will be covered in a forthcoming article.

The Innovation Lab

\#1 Music Genesis NFTs

&amp;#x200B;

Every song that is released into the world creates value. Often, that value is not recognised for months, years or even decades. MODA Genesis NFTs capture the magic of new music before it is released, front-loading value when music is new and hype train is moving! MODA Members will be able to stake into new tracks as a way of generating new NFTs, burn NFTs to recover their MODA stake, or export them to other markets.

\#2 Tokenised Microlicensing

&amp;#x200B;

What if licensing a song was as easy as purchasing an NFT? Whether for an exclusive personal stream, broadcast rights on your digital radio station, inside your metaverse experience or for officially recognised NFTs, UGC or derivative content. What if all of this was done in a new market, available before the music is released to the rest of the world? Our thesis is that Web3 has the power to make music monesition open to anyone and therefore, the potential to regress us back to the days of torrenting. So, legitimate licensing needs to be easy and incentivised.

\#3 On-chain provenance

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned in the introduction to this article, blockchain data and media is only ever as authentic as the person putting it on-chain. Additionally, many music industry complications arise when deviation of a song’s provenance occurs after the first studio sessions Regardless of whether the track was recorded in a Hollywood studio or a Berlin basement, the issues persist. MODA Labs will explore a range of audio provenance tools that combine the latest in audio-recognition and fingerprinting technology with the best blockchain use-cases.

\#4 Revenue Share Rails

&amp;#x200B;

As part of our launch partnership deal with Blockchain Music Pty Ltd (Emanate/RAREZ), MODA has been given access to IP that relates to a new User Generated Content monetization platform which utilises smart-contracts to align incentives between viral content creators and artists/labels. This product will help demonstrate the power of MODA’s Web3 music monetisation framework.

Tokenomics

&amp;#x200B;

MODA Basic token metrics are as follows:

Target TGE: June/July, market dependent

Value Drivers

&amp;#x200B;

Members must stake MODA and sign the constitution

Partners must meet the MODA holding requirement

Board members must stake and hold at least 1% of supply (TBC)

Every song on-chain must be backed by at least 1 MODA (TBC)

MODA Labs project should utilise the MODA token to align incentives with the foundation

Ongoing buy-back to support the Web3 Sustainability Loop and ongoing growth

&amp;#x200B;

Thank You

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for getting involved early in the MODA journey. Our lives have become dedicated to the evolution of blockchain and creative media and we are excited about the next stage.

Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 2. Good Bad Ugly

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don’t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# Apply To Your Project

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add.

 

**TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution."

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

The adoption curve is S shaped. Lead by tech enthusiasts. Early majority who are tech savvy. The late majority will comprise mostly of the poor and those who are financially illiterate. They will suffer the most if there's a major shift in capital. 

The world is cruel. It's a finders keepers game. Despite how nice you try to paint it. The early adopters have and will always have an advantage.

Grayscale Unveils DeFi Fund Linked to New CoinDesk Index,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onihwo/grayscale_unveils_defi_fund_linked_to_new/,BTCrrsr,1,2021-07-20 01:13:26,6,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onihwo/grayscale_unveils_defi_fund_linked_to_new/,FINANCE," 

Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency investment manager, said Monday it has started a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, based on a new DeFi-specific index produced by CoinDesk’s TradeBlock division. 

The companies, both subsidiaries of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), wrote in a joint press release the Grayscale DeFi Fund provides “exposure to a selection of industry-leading DeFi protocols through a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.” The idea is that investors can allocate money toward DeFi without having to buy the tokens directly. 

DeFi, which consists of blockchain-based software protocols designed for the trading and lending of cryptocurrencies, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital-asset industry. The amount of collateral locked into the protocols has increased 19-fold over the past year to [about $50 billion](https://defipulse.com/), and prices for many of the platforms’ associated tokens have soared. 

“Based on the user adoption that we’re seeing around DeFi and DeFi protocols, we do think the future of this area is bright,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Monday on CoinDesk TV’s [First Mover](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/first-mover) program.

The fund is only open to “eligible individual and institutional accredited investors,” according to the press release. Grayscale said it “intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market” but added that “there is no guarantee this will be successful.” 

The CoinDesk DeFi Index is a new product from TradeBlock, one of the first firms to develop an index for professional investors to track [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) when it launched the [XBX Index](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/xbx) in 2014. CoinDesk announced its [purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-acquires-tradeblock-adding-indexes-and-pricing-to-news-events-offerings) of TradeBlock for an undisclosed sum in January.

The new index joins a growing list of offerings designed to help investors track prices for DeFi tokens and invest in them. Last month, the technology firm Amun [launched](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/25/2253105/0/en/Amun-Launches-Two-New-index-Tokens-To-Simplify-Access-To-The-Ethereum-DeFi-Ecosystem.html) two new crypto token products, the DeFi Index Token and DeFi Momentum Index.    

The cryptocurrency data firm Messari has a dedicated screening tool tracking 164 DeFi tokens. The average price of the tokens is up 395% this year, versus 8.3% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, and 160% for No. 2 [ether](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum).  

According to the press release, the CoinDesk DeFi index aims to provide a “broad-based, benchmark representation of DeFi protocols,” with assets [weighted](https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/) by their market capitalization.

As of July 1, 2021, the CoinDesk DeFi Index consisted of the following assets, with their market-capitalization-based weightings:

* [Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/price/uniswap) (UNI), 49.95%
* [Aave](https://www.coindesk.com/price/aave) (AAVE), 10.25%
* Compound (COMP), 8.38%
* Curve (CRV), 7.44%
* [MakerDAO](https://www.coindesk.com/price/maker) (MKR), 6.49%
* SushiSwap (SUSHI), 4.83%
* Synthetix (SNX), 4.43%
* [Yearn Finance](https://www.coindesk.com/price/yearn-finance) (YFI), 3.31%
* UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.93%
* Bancor Network Token (BNT), 2.00%

Russel 3000

**And about 3000 tickers from Yahoo finance:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME)

It's about 50mb in it's entirety and don't have a great means of hosting it, but can confirm that this data is scrapable using Seleneum.

Code to import the python libraries:

The ticker list modified to remove those stocks

Why I'm holding CLOV until at least 2024.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/oo4l1d/why_im_holding_clov_until_at_least_2024/,livinittt,1,2021-07-20 23:42:54,13,/r/CLOV/comments/oo4l1d/why_im_holding_clov_until_at_least_2024/,NaN,"There are two keys to success in the Medicare market:

1. [Membership growth](https://livinittt.medium.com/clov-catalysts-part-1-growth-b4cab7b41bbf)
2. [Star ratings](https://livinittt.medium.com/clov-catalysts-part-2-stars-d594ee6a065e)

Membership growth is fairly straightforward to understand. You need to grow membership in order to grow the monthly recurring revenue received from Medicare. Star ratings are a little more complicated but equally important.

Due to the impact of COVID on healthcare utilization and outcomes, star ratings aren’t likely to change until 2023. Therefore, growth is the key determinant of CLOV’s value over the next 12 months. The higher the growth achieved, the larger the stars bonus will then be since it’s based on the number of members enrolled. **Riding CLOV up the growth curve and holding through 2023 for the first 4+ stars bonus will be a formula for success.**

//

# Membership Growth ([full post here](https://livinittt.medium.com/clov-catalysts-part-1-growth-b4cab7b41bbf))

The average growth rate for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans is [9.2%](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/medicare-advantage-booming-why-so-few-payers-winning) nationally. CLOV has proven a unique ability to grow its MA plan membership [over 30%](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) annually. That’s [4x](https://humana.gcs-web.com/static-files/8d618487-409e-4417-a852-90b8633310aa) the growth rate of leading incumbents like Humana (HUM) and UnitedHealth (UNH). That’s why it has a 4x higher EV/Sales multiple than the large incumbents.

CLOV’s growth rate is comparable to [Alignment Healthcare (ALHC)](https://livinittt.medium.com/short-sellers-are-betting-against-a-high-growth-business-thats-undervalued-4933024161cb), another MA insurer that went public in 2021. If you look at ALHC’s valuation multiple, CLOV should be worth **$8.87 per share just based on its MA members**. However, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing MA plans in the country, CLOV has now become the largest Direct Contracting (DC) entity. They currently have [65,000 DC members](https://livinittt.medium.com/short-sellers-are-betting-against-a-high-growth-business-thats-undervalued-4933024161cb), while ALHC only has [1,500](https://livinittt.medium.com/short-sellers-are-betting-against-a-high-growth-business-thats-undervalued-4933024161cb).

If CLOV can report expected unit economics in its DC business line, the stock should [more than double](https://livinittt.medium.com/short-sellers-are-betting-against-a-high-growth-business-thats-undervalued-4933024161cb). The market is effectively valuing CLOV’s DC business at $0.

//

# Star Ratings ([full post here](https://livinittt.medium.com/clov-catalysts-part-2-stars-d594ee6a065e))

Medicare uses a [star rating system](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2021-star-ratings-and-bonuses/) to rate the performance of every Medicare Advantage (MA) plan each year. They created the system to prevent MA plans from cutting costs and maximizing profits at the expense of the member. Some examples include denying reimbursement or reducing customer service staff in the pursuit of higher profit margins. The star rating system prevents this.

MA plans care about star ratings because it has a huge impact on their top and bottom line each year. A higher star rating directly improves enrollment rates, revenue growth, and profitability.

4-star is good, and each year that a plan gets a 4+ star rating they end up getting a [$500 bonus per member](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/impact-of-star-ratings-on-medicare-advantage-plan-success.html). That directly increases their top line revenue by [5%](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/primer-the-medicare-advantage-star-rating-system/) and represents pure profit. They already incurred all their expenses for the year, so the bonus payment after the year ends drops directly to the bottom line. With an average profit margin of [5%](https://www.kff.org/report-section/financial-performance-of-medicare-advantage-individual-and-group-health-insurance-markets-issue-brief/) across the industry, the 4+ star bonus payment effectively represents all the profits of the industry.

The other benefit of star ratings is improved enrollment rates. Star ratings are published online for Medicare beneficiaries to see. People typically choose to enroll in higher-rated plans. In fact, each 0.5-star improvement is correlated with [6% higher enrollment rates](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/star-ratings-jump-strengthens-enrollment-performance-medicare-advantage-plans).

CLOV is in an interesting position these next 12 months. Most of their plans (i.e. market-level contracts) are new, which means they won’t receive a star rating for a couple of years. COVID has also resulted in their mature plans being fixed at 3-stars for a couple of years.

**2023 could be the first year CLOV ends up achieving a 4+  star rating.** If they do, it will be driven by the member experience measures. These measures currently have double-weighting for 2021. Medicare is increasing their weighting starting in 2023 to [quadruple weighting](https://icariohealth.com/blog/2021-star-ratings-a-year-for-member-experience/), at which point they will represent [46%](https://icariohealth.com/blog/2021-star-ratings-a-year-for-member-experience/) of a plan's overall star rating. CLOV scored 4+ on 7 out of 9 member experience measures for 2021. That’s a strong sign that the re-weighting of member experience measures will naturally boost CLOV’s overall star rating starting in 2023. The 2023 star ratings will be announced in October of next year, which could be a big catalyst. **If CLOV achieves 4 stars, I would expect the stock to have a huge rally.**

**2024 star ratings will be the first true look at CLOV’s performance since launching Clover Assistant features in the second half of 2019.** 2024 star ratings will be based on 2022 performance, so the up-and-down impact of COVID on claims and data collection should finally be over. These ratings will be announced in October of 2023. This could be the ultimate catalyst because it will finally show the impact of Clover Assistant on health outcomes, star ratings, and profitability. The value of Clover Assistant will also be extrapolated across all of CLOV’s members and markets at that point, which should be 140,000+ MA members and 400+ MA markets at their current growth rate. The value of the Clover Assistant also applies to DC members, where profits and losses are based on health outcomes and controlling costs.  **If the Clover Assistant starts to drive better performance and profit margins, I would expect huge multiple expansion.**"

Our professor (Who is new to the university, top 50) is going far beyond the fundamentals. It can take 10% of the test time to solve one of his mathematical problems, and his class is heavy on mathematics, which I am more than proficient in. I aced all finance and cost courses. It is to the point that this class is negativity affecting my time, as I am now putting in 15 hours of study a week into one of my 4 courses.

Uranium vs DeFi: a Comparison to keep in mind for the impatient,https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/oons3g/uranium_vs_defi_a_comparison_to_keep_in_mind_for/,GeorgKung,1,2021-07-21 19:14:40,22,/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/oons3g/uranium_vs_defi_a_comparison_to_keep_in_mind_for/,Speculation,"Some of you have compared the Uranium market to companies: ""The market cap of uranium is less than Pinterest!""

I'd take it one step further, just for the lols.

This is the one-year chart of DeFi (decentralized finance). As you can see, it went from practically nothing to about $95B in less than a year. Currently at around $55B. 

https://preview.redd.it/duzv5ks1rjc71.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0088c62cf49cdc7d2fe33cd8431ebb53c4504887

For reference, the Uranium Market cap is at roughly $27B.

So, what is my point? 

Here are three observations:

1) If DeFi, which is currently a near-useless asset, can grow like that in 6 months, then the uranium market (which is essential and has a strong and long demand) should be able to do so too. Under the right circumstances....

2) Probably not as quickly, as the crypto PR-machine is 1000x stronger than the uranium markets. But it does go to show *just how fast it CAN go, once critical mass is achieved.* Or as they like to say in the crypto community, ""slowly, then suddenly.""

3) Even so, this extreme effect in DeFi could only happen due to the liquidity and ease of entering the new market from existing crypto fans. The closest analogy I can think of for Uranium would be ETFs and other commodity investors joining, creating the first wave, which is then hopefully caught on and amplified by the interest of the wider masses. A bit like the adoption curve."

China Dam Problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ooq5et/china_dam_problem/,BlazingJava,1,2021-07-21 21:43:01,87,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ooq5et/china_dam_problem/,Discussion,"# China has been ignoring dam problems and that's not a good sign.

Recently on July 19  Two dams in China's northwestern region of Inner Mongolia have collapsed after torrential rain.  
 16,660 people have been affected

 53,807 acres of farmland submerged

China has more than 98,000 reservoirs used to regulate floods, generate power and facilitate shipping. More than 80% of them are four decades old or older, and some pose a safety risk, the government has acknowledged.

**Problems are to arise as most of the infrastructure has the limited lifespan of 50 years.**

# Three Gorges Dam

Fears re-emerge periodically over the structural integrity of the Three Gorges Dam on the upper Yangtze, the world's largest hydroelectric dam, built in an area criss-crossed by geological faultlines.

A simulation of what would happen if it were to collapse: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjHWkCdZdOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjHWkCdZdOE)

# China money problem:

As ex minister of economy points out government revenue dwindles as there's no expense cuts planed.

Recently the CPP celebrated it's 100th anniversary which by the looks of it was costly.

Every new chinese ministry of water resources enters office he reports on the number of dams with problems and every time the number grows.

What concerns me a lot is china lent billions to other countries to build their infrastructure, this might be problematic because most countries can't pay and will lease the infrastructure they built for a period of years. Will they seek new terms for those loans?

# China rainy season:

The East Asian rainy season, commonly called the plum rain , is caused by precipitation along a persistent stationary front known as the Meiyu front for nearly two months during the late spring and early summer in East Asia between mainland China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. 

The wet season ends during the summer when the subtropical ridge becomes strong enough to push this front north of the region. These weather systems can produce heavy rainfall and flooding.

# Conclusion:

There's a clear ticking bomb waiting to blow in chinese mainland, I only talked about Three gorges dam but there's many more dams at risk.

This will hit hard china's industrial cities and population, and will be a blow to the economic recovery of the world as china is still the main supplier."

Lost job in pandemic so I went back to school for finance/accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/oozh7d/lost_job_in_pandemic_so_i_went_back_to_school_for/,foodboy69,1,2021-07-22 05:28:09,5,/r/Accounting/comments/oozh7d/lost_job_in_pandemic_so_i_went_back_to_school_for/,NaN,"Hey all! Been lurking here for almost a year now and have learned so much from just reading your posts, so thank you!

I used to be a chef (childhood dream and a dream accomplished!) but lost my job during the pandemic so I decided to go into a direction that would pay better and I would feel like I'm getting something out of it. During the pandemic, I found finance (especially securities) super interesting. I took an accounting 101 course at my local community college and really enjoyed it (It seemed like important work, and was getting the fulfillment I got from cooking in it as well.) I am sitting at a 3.9 GPA, have A's in all my accounting classes, only have Managerial Accounting left before I'm done with accounting classes for my transfer degree to a University, also I'm finding I like math A LOT more in my older age. I took an excel course and found it pretty exciting as well. Although I am very lucky to find something outside of cooking that brings me joy, I am also stuck in a rut. I'm 30 and have been a cook since I was 18, so I don't have any experience in accounting. I've been wanting to post here for a while now (3 months), and have come up with 3 fairly vague questions. Those questions are:

  
1. How do I get a foot in the door? I know internships are the way but I also didn't have the school requirements by the time the deadline for applications for internships came around so I'm trying to find a way around it until next summer. I'm having a hard time actually finding jobs, and have been on LinkedIn, Indeed, and USAjobs.gob but everything is asking for more experience than I have. coming from a hospitality background (which is going on poached and throw some resumes in) I don't have those job searching skills in finance. 

2. What should I be doing right now to make myself more competitive for when I graduate and start working in the field? I was thinking about getting my tax preparer license and go through at least 1 tax season, but is this the way?

[3.](https://3.Is) Is there anything I should know about this industry that can really get me ahead of the curve of other students? What are these things? (licenses, experiences, job opportunities, etc.)

I'm a sophomore in college and still have a long way to go, but the things posted here have really helped me out, and I don't have any contacts in the field of finance. Thank you all for your knowledge, and for taking the time to help out someone on the path to their CPA."
Bio,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Snowball_Capital/comments/opbccs/bio/,Snowball_Capital,1,2021-07-22 18:45:13,0,/r/u_Snowball_Capital/comments/opbccs/bio/,NaN,"**Introduction:**

I am a systems trader who builds trading systems for various financial markets with the intention of making a profit. Thus far, I have focused on cryptocurrency, but I have much larger ambitions.

**Goals:**

1. To make a big snowball.

2. To make my clients big snowballs of their own.

**Education:**

1. Bachelor Science in Geology from University of New South Wales (UNSW). 

2. Certificate 4 in Finance &amp; Mortgage Broking.

**My Story:**

At the age of 24 (2014) I became interested in becoming financially independent. This was about 3 months after starting my first job as a fulltime employee, lol. 

Daily since then, I have contributed in some way to that goal. For example, I began listening to a lot of podcasts while travelling between home and work. I realised, broadly speaking, there are 2 primary ways to become financially independent. Firstly, via business ownership or secondly, through investing. I chose investing, particularly related to digital investing in assets like cryptocurrency, stocks, futures, and options. I do like property as an asset class, but I reason that the entry level for property investment, especially here in Australia, is quite steep. Therefore, if you do not have a lot of capital to start with, you are probably not really diversified, are probably taking a lot of risk due to a large amount of leverage by borrowing most of the capital required from a lender and taking a high level of liquidity risk given that it takes several weeks or months to sell a property, hence why I prefer digital investments for the moment. 

In November 2018, I left my job as a scientist to become a council worker. The work-life balance is much better as a council worker compared to working on construction projects. This transition allowed me to begin studying intensively, devouring books, audiobooks, investment courses, podcasts and spending a considerable amount of time, probably several thousand hours or more, studying the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price charts all the way back to 2012 and 2016, respectively. The purpose was to identify patterns in price behaviour so that I could build an investment system with buy and sell rules that I could follow to reduce the emotional impact of investing, reduce risk, and gain some expectations in terms of likely future performance as I would have a backtest to gauge win rate, risk/reward (max drawdown vs compound annual growth rate) among other statistics. 

Since November 2018, I have built many trading systems, both long term and short term, manually backtested by hand. I now share the best performing systems I have built for both BTC and ETH. I plan on including other asset classes in the future. 

**Strategy Description:**

The System:

I presume that like most other reasonable people, I endeavour to target high reward, low risk opportunities and this mantra transcends onto the systems that I build.

The long-term strategies I have built for both BTC and ETH, and I can probably build more systems for other coins if I get the time, is a reversal strategy that aims to identify key long term reversal points, and essentially ride the new trend, if one develops, for as long as possible till the next major reversal. Being a reversal system, it can go either long or short which I strongly believe is a healthy perspective to have since you are not an emotional slave to the longside. Importantly to note though, the longside in cryptocurrency, just like stocks, can earn more money on the upside than the downside, given that downside returns are capped at 100% should the price go to zero.

I have learned that longer term systems for BTC and ETH have several advantages over shorter term systems that I have also traded, namely:

1. Potentially larger returns since you are capturing more of the trend. For example, if the shorter-term system were to sell after some down move but the price then moves back higher than the sell point, one would be forced to re-buy higher to “chase” the trend upward just to get back in, thereby missing a chunk of the trend. Note that this comparison I have drawn is relative only to the shorter-term systems that I have built. Also, it does not factor in taking any leverage that other shorter-term systems may be capable of.

2. Less work since there are fewer trades, leaving more time to reflect and expand.

3. Lower commissions, slippage and bid-ask spread fees given fewer trades.

Is the strategy curve-fitted? I believe there is some curve-fit to this strategy. But I would argue that every successful strategy is somewhat curve-fit since they have probably been derived from some observation of a past profitable market occurrence, otherwise the strategy probably would not have worked in the past, nor will it likely work in the future. The key question that I would ask is whether it is over-curve-fit, and the answer to that in my opinion is, no. Why is it no? I believe it is no because I have identified rules-based patterns that have worked over a long period of time, I have aimed to keep the number of rules to a minimum, that is, less than 10, and I have aimed to reduce cherry picking numbers just because they worked in a one-off scenario.

Position Sizing: Note that to maximise returns, for longside positions I may utilise up to 100% of available capital. Naturally, this is a riskier approach than employing a small percentage of capital, however, I shall not be leveraging any higher than 100%. Shortside positions will be capped at about 50% of available capital, however, positions should generally be in the 15-30% position size range, relative to total available capital.

**Research History:**

In addition to investment activities since 2014 such as selling a property, trading stocks, options, and cryptocurrency, I have also studied over 50 books, audiobooks, and video courses so far and listened to thousands of episodes of investment related podcasts. I think that I only read about 2-3 books during my whole education at university in comparison. 

Reading books certainly helps in my opinion, but it does not replace market experience, observational learning or backtesting ideas. Therefore, I have also spent literally thousands of hours studying numerous price charts, particularly BTC and ETH so far. 

As a special side mention, I have also listened to about 150 episodes of the “Chat With Traders” podcast and recommend this as a good show for anyone interested.

Please refer to the attached images for a complete list of the resources I have studied thus far to gain an idea of the depth of knowledge I have gathered.

\- effects of war on production in the game (how does war affect productive capabilities, how does preparation/battle affect production choices in the economy)

\- the tax haven system/taxation in general. We've only passed this superficially, but apparently there is a elaborate system of bases that allow you to evade taxes? What's the history (and future?) of this system

\- Finance and investments. Apparently there was very little possibility to put your ISK to passive use, but the invention of war bonds brought a financial system to the game. Anyone got experience with war bonds? How does contracting work?

Please excuse us if this request might seem naive to some, we're total noobs and really curious to learn more. Please DM me so that we may set up a zoom to chat whenever you have time! Thanks in advance."
Balancer (BAL) is now free and live on Coinbase - Free Crypto,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oq6zad/balancer_bal_is_now_free_and_live_on_coinbase/,Browfey,1,2021-07-24 01:17:00,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oq6zad/balancer_bal_is_now_free_and_live_on_coinbase/,EXCHANGE,"For those who are able to, the latest free coin is available on coinbase, worth $3 at the moment, worth getting if you have an account.

Some information on balancer - 
Balancer is a software running on Ethereum that seeks to incentivize a distributed network of computers to operate an exchange where users can buy and sell any cryptocurrency. 

An emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Balancer uses a combination of crypto assets to provide this service, enabling trading without a financial intermediary like an exchange.

It might help to think about Balancer as a kind of index fund, where users create funds based on the cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. These funds are known as Balancer pools, and any user wishing to provide liquidity to a pool can do so by simply depositing an asset in them. 

Users who provide liquidity to a Balancer pool then earn a portion of the trading fee paid to the network for the use of their funds, and are rewarded with a custom cryptocurrency called BAL. 

These deposits are essential to the network, providing the liquidity needed for users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on the platform. 

This means Balancer must incentivize both sizes of its market in order to operate – crypto users who might wish to make some of their holdings available to be traded, and traders seeking the best possible price for an asset.

In this way, Balancer works in a similar fashion to other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap (UNI) and Curve (CRV). However, Balancer offers additional features, including the ability to bundle up to eight tokens into pools.



Who created Balancer?
Balancer began as a research project at a software consulting firm called BlockScience in 2018, founded by Fernando Martinelli and Mike McDonald. 

The project then independently raised $3 million in funding as Balancer Labs in 2020. The round saw some 5 million BAL tokens sold to investors and 25 million tokens awarded to shareholders and employees (out of a total supply of 100 million tokens). 

An additional 10 million BAL were set aside, with half being reserved for a fund used for contributors to the Balancer ecosystem and half reserved for sales to future investors. 

How does Balancer work?
Just as an index fund can be composed of different stocks, Balancer pools are composed of up to eight different cryptocurrencies. 

A Balancer pool’s value is determined by the percentages of each token within it, a weight chosen during the pool’s creation.

Self-balancing index fund
Balancer uses custom programs called smart contracts to ensure each pool retains the correct proportion of assets even as the prices of individual coins in the pools might vary.

For example, a Balancer pool might start off with 25% ETH, 25% DAI and 50% LEND. If at some point, the price of LEND doubles, the pool automatically reduces the amount of LEND it holds so that it can retain 50% of the pool’s value. 

So, where does the LEND go? Balancer’s smart contracts make them available to traders looking to buy LEND as prices go up. 

Of note, liquidity providers still earn fees while their index funds get rebalanced, compared to traditional index funds where investors pay fees for the rebalancing services.

Balancer pools 
Balancer offers private and public pools, aimed at users with different risk appetites. 

Public pools allow any user to provide liquidity by adding or withdrawing assets. The parameters of public pools are set, and cannot be changed, before their launch. 

This means they may be useful for users with smaller holdings seeking to earn fees from the most popular – and most liquid – pools.

A private Balancer pool is one where only the pool creator can add or withdraw assets. The user can also adjust all the other parameters of the pool such as fees, weightings and the types of assets it accepts. 

Private pools are useful to asset managers with a large portfolio seeking to earn fees on their specific assets.

Lastly, smart pools are a type of private pool owned by smart contracts. This feature allows pools to be programmed to perform additional functions, such as changing weights, or creating an index fund that tracks a property portfolio. 

Why does BAL have value?
Balancer’s cryptocurrency, BAL, will be essential for distributing its operations, ensuring that no central party can make decisions about how the platform operates.

Further, it also functions as an incentive mechanism, as users who deposit assets into Balancer pools earn BAL tokens. While there are no defined rights or uses for the token as of 2020, holders of BAL will eventually be able to determine rules around how Balancer works. 

BAL owners may be able to, in the future, vote on the weekly rate of BAL distribution, Balancer protocol fees or even the possibility of launching Balancer on other blockchains. 

Like many other cryptocurrencies, the supply of BAL tokens is limited, meaning that there will only ever be 100 million BAL.

While 15 million BAL were distributed or saved during Balancer’s inception, the remaining 65 million tokens are distributed to Balancer users providing liquidity to the protocol. 

Balancer plans on distributing 145,000 tokens a week to users, meaning that the total supply will have been distributed by 2028.

Why Should I Use BAL?
Balancer may be of interest if you are an existing cryptocurrency investor with an idle portfolio that you wish to put to work. 

It may also be useful if you are an active trader or portfolio manager, as it allows users to buy units in creatively constructed indices that exist on the protocol.

Holding BAL is useful in the long term if you wish to influence the development of the platform by voting on important decisions about some of its features. 

Users can also invest in BAL if they believe that decentralized trading of cryptocurrencies will gain in popularity in the future.

Theory Discussion: Central Banks Need Reverse Repo Cash to Finance Liabilities?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/oq71gh/theory_discussion_central_banks_need_reverse_repo/,SirWhateversAlot,1,2021-07-24 01:19:56,10,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/oq71gh/theory_discussion_central_banks_need_reverse_repo/,Question,"I am researching a theory that the Federal Reserve is using the reverse repo facility to siphon cash from money market funds to finance the liabilities (dollars/deposits) on their balance sheet.

I had interpreted the reverse repo spike as a combination of the following:

1. Loss of confidence in traditional counterparties has created more demand for Federal Reserve reverse repos.

2. The Federal Reserve us reducing M2 without having to sell bonds / raise interest rates. This gives them another tool to adjust inflation pressures.

3. Federal Reserve is able to conduct ad-hoc yield curve control without increasing their balance sheet.

However, this new theory proposes that the Federal Reserve has assumed too many liabilities (dollars/deposits) in purchasing assets (treasuries), and is raising cash using the reverse repo facility.

I am trying to evaluate this theory and want to know if anyone has any insights as to why they would need to generate cash.

""Why can't they just print the cash?"" you may ask.

Whenever the Federal Reserve sends a dollar out, they are creating a liability, so they need an asset to balance their books, so they buy treasuries. Creating a liability without balancing an asset is a no-no.

Could they be running a shell game where new cash is needed to finance existing liabilities? Can anyone expand on this topic?"

The following days saw a significant jump in the stock and Business Insider attributed this to me in this article here:

 [**https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/workhorse-stock-price-reddit-traders-target-short-electric-amc-meme-2021-6**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/workhorse-stock-price-reddit-traders-target-short-electric-amc-meme-2021-6)

I see the stock now reaching its bottom around the $10-$11 mark as the momentum from my DD has died down a bit.  This is where it was trading prior to my posting of my DD.  It seems that the stock now has downward pressure for the following reasons, with #3 and #4 being the most important:

1. Short interest
2. Lack of production of vehicles
3. Supply chain limitations and bottlenecking, mainly batteries
4. Loss of USPS contract

If these issues are addressed I think most investors and traders would admit that WKHS has a good shot at taking off.  How are these issues being addressed:

1. Short interest is simple.  It's us against them.  I don't believe in HF conspiracies or short ladder attacks, etc.  I don't even see HF as being evil.  They're just trying to make money as we are.  It's really a battle of wits and who can hold on longer.  It would be hard to short it any further at this point.
2. USPS losses have already been factored into the stock price and no one believes that this contract can be won.  There is a small chance that it can be won again so anything that happens with this contract will only push the price up and not down from this point forward.
3. Production and assembly have been addressed by partnering with EAVX a subsidiary of JB Poindexter.
4. Supply chain/battery issues have been addressed by partnering with Coulomb Solutions, Inc., the North American distributor of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL). CATL is the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.

So, #3 and #4 are the most important factors at this point and the most important question now is how will these partnerships pan out and will they increase production.  Well, thanks to u/Odd_Squirrel_5010 we have a local ape who collected excellent data from the field.  He took pictures of about 60 trucks which you can find here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/op1g0s/union\_city\_in\_pics\_taken\_7212021\_looks\_like\_50\_60/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/op1g0s/union_city_in_pics_taken_7212021_looks_like_50_60/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

These are most likely definitely workhorse trucks, probably the C650.  Just look at the door and the other features.  No other door that I've found on last-mile trucks matches this.  Plus, the picture is in the workhorse parking lot.  Check out the comparison pics here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/opi5fy/looks\_like\_the\_c100\_to\_me/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/opi5fy/looks_like_the_c100_to_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

On top of this, there may or may not be a few hundred more trucks parked across from the workhorse factory in the AAA Interstate Transportation, LLC.  AAA only transport trucks and they do not have their own.  These may or may not be workhorse trucks.  Perhaps someone local can snap a few pics.  You can judge for yourself here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/oq4uiy/google\_maps\_of\_workhorse\_trucks\_parked\_outside/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/oq4uiy/google_maps_of_workhorse_trucks_parked_outside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Either way, WKHS delivered 6 trucks for the 1st quarter so if this all falls into place it means production is really ramping up and the partnerships are working out.  This can definitely lead to increased revenue and the catalyst which is needed to set off the chain reaction resulting in a short squeeze.

I've bought and sold WKHS shares, Puts, and Calls and have made about $30,000 so far.  I'm back in again at 10,000 shares at $11.22.  No way would I sell a naked call at this point as IMO this position has a much better chance at moving up rather than down.

Feel free to let me know why I'm wrong.  I appreciate a good debate.

Informational purposes.  Do your own homework.  Not a solicitation or financial advice. I may be completely wrong and you can lose all of your money on this or any stock.  Good luck either way.  

Feel free to read my original updated DD below from several weeks ago.

**The case for why Workhorse (WKHS) will moon, UPDATED**   
  

Allow me to summarize: 

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones. 
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and **FORCE** this to happen.  
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and	diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.  
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its	efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.  
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see	pictures).  The trucks have a control center and charging	capabilities.  No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back.  Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers.  Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this.  Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure?  Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund.  She has since sold.  	This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below).  Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago.  Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called 	Organizational Shorting.  It's a complex process where market makers	unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them.  I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless. 
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's **6230** trucks equating to **several hundreds of millions of dollars!!!** That's an enormous number of trucks and	that's only from one wholesaler. 
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery.  The reasons why: 
   1. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components.  This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales.  In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries.  This company distributes for the **largest** EV battery manufacturer in the world. 
   2. Electric trucks are a relatively	new industry.  Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited.  Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can.  They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
10. There are several EV players.  Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail.  Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.  
11. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly. 
12. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in. 
13. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt. 
14. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February.  It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.  Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front.  In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity.  There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions.  Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor.  If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it.  If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock.  Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
15. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in expensive option pricing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.  
16. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS.  Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy.  NONE recommend a sell.  It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling.  Some of the analysts' recommend price targets 	are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
17. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
18. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
19. This stock has an **AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL**.  It's shorted about 40% of its float.  It is one of the most, if not **THE MOST**, shorted stock out there.  

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight.  It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now.  The short sellers have 	borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they 	know you get fearful when this happens.  They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it everyday.  They've learned to process this emotion and to not act upon it.  However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear.  They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top).  If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because everyday you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when 	borrowing their short shares.  Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money 	calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the 	stock price rises.  

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will.  Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose.  This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC.  AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took awhile and 	a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did.  WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!  

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are.  They don't make their money from making good stock picks.  They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people.  They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow.  Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them.  The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution.  The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things.  Look it up if you don't believe it.   
 

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze.  It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced.  Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all 	recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell.  Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed. 
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.  

I am not a financial analyst. I am a physician with a love of finance. I do not give financial advice. This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong. You can lose all of your money on this stock or any stock for that matter. You must do your own homework and research before buying any stock.  I personally love this stock and I own over 10,000 shares of it."

I am a systems trader who builds trading systems for various financial markets with the intention of making a profit. Thus far, I have focused on cryptocurrency, but I have much larger ambitions.

**Goals:**

1. To go to the moon.
2. To take my clients to the moon with me.

**Education:**

1. Bachelor Science in Geology from University of New South Wales (UNSW).
2. Certificate 4 in Finance &amp; Mortgage Broking.

**My Story:**

At the age of 24 (2014) I became interested in becoming financially independent. This was about 3 months after starting my first job as a fulltime employee, lol.

Daily since then, I have contributed in some way to that goal. For example, I began listening to a lot of podcasts while travelling between home and work. I realised, broadly speaking, there are 2 primary ways to become financially independent. Firstly, via business ownership or secondly, through investing. I chose investing, particularly related to digital investing in assets like cryptocurrency, stocks, futures, and options. I do like property as an asset class, but I reason that the entry level for property investment, especially here in Australia, is quite steep. Therefore, if you do not have a lot of capital to start with, you are probably not really diversified, are probably taking a lot of risk due to a large amount of leverage by borrowing most of the capital required from a lender and taking a high level of liquidity risk given that it takes several weeks or months to sell a property, hence why I prefer digital investments for the moment.

In November 2018, I left my job as a scientist to become a council worker. The work-life balance is much better as a council worker compared to working on construction projects. This transition allowed me to begin studying intensively, devouring books, audiobooks, investment courses, podcasts and spending a considerable amount of time, probably several thousand hours or more, studying the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price charts all the way back to 2012 and 2016, respectively. The purpose was to identify patterns in price behaviour so that I could build an investment system with buy and sell rules that I could follow to reduce the emotional impact of investing, reduce risk, and gain some expectations in terms of likely future performance as I would have a backtest to gauge win rate, risk/reward (max drawdown vs compound annual growth rate) among other statistics.

Since November 2018, I have built many trading systems, both long term and short term, manually backtested by hand. I now share the best performing systems I have built for both BTC and ETH. I plan on including other asset classes in the future.

**Strategy Description:**

The System:

I presume that like most other reasonable people, I endeavour to target high reward, low risk opportunities and this mantra transcends onto the systems that I build.

The long-term strategies I have built for both BTC and ETH, and I can probably build more systems for other coins if I get the time, is a reversal strategy that aims to identify key long term reversal points, and essentially ride the new trend, if one develops, for as long as possible till the next major reversal. Being a reversal system, it can go either long or short which I strongly believe is a healthy perspective to have since you are not an emotional slave to the longside. Importantly to note though, the longside in cryptocurrency, just like stocks, can earn more money on the upside than the downside, given that downside returns are capped at 100% should the price go to zero.

I have learned that longer term systems for BTC and ETH have several advantages over shorter term systems that I have also traded, namely:

1. Potentially larger returns since you are capturing more of the trend. For example, if the shorter-term system were to sell after some down move but the price then moves back higher than the sell point, one would be forced to re-buy higher to “chase” the trend upward just to get back in, thereby missing a chunk of the trend. Note that this comparison I have drawn is relative only to the shorter-term systems that I have built. Also, it does not factor in taking any leverage that other shorter-term systems may be capable of.
2. Less work since there are fewer trades, leaving more time to reflect and expand.
3. Lower commissions, slippage and bid-ask spread fees given fewer trades.

Is the strategy curve-fitted? I believe there is some curve-fit to this strategy. But I would argue that every successful strategy is somewhat curve-fit since they have probably been derived from some observation of a past profitable market occurrence, otherwise the strategy probably would not have worked in the past, nor will it likely work in the future. The key question that I would ask is whether it is over-curve-fit, and the answer to that in my opinion is, no. Why is it no? I believe it is no because I have identified rules-based patterns that have worked over a long period of time, I have aimed to keep the number of rules to a minimum, that is, less than 10, and I have aimed to reduce cherry picking numbers just because they worked in a one-off scenario.

Position Sizing: Note that to maximise returns, for longside positions I may utilise up to 100% of available capital. Naturally, this is a riskier approach than employing a small percentage of capital, however, I shall not be leveraging any higher than 100%. Shortside positions will be capped at about 50% of available capital, however, positions should generally be in the 15-30% position size range, relative to total available capital.

**Research History:**

In addition to investment activities since 2014 such as selling a property, trading stocks, options, and cryptocurrency, I have also studied over 50 books, audiobooks, and video courses so far and listened to thousands of episodes of investment related podcasts. I think that I only read about 2-3 books during my whole education at university in comparison.

Reading books certainly helps in my opinion, but it does not replace market experience, observational learning or backtesting ideas. Therefore, I have also spent literally thousands of hours studying numerous price charts, particularly BTC and ETH so far.

Below I have listed all the resources I have studied thus far. As a special side mention, I have also listened to about 150 episodes of the “Chat With Traders” podcast and recommend this as a good show for anyone interested.

Thoughts on stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqzqyx/thoughts_on_stablecoins/,sickvisionz,1,2021-07-25 06:37:23,12,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqzqyx/thoughts_on_stablecoins/,FINANCE,"**TLDR: There are no good stablecoins that fit in with the** ***ethos*** **of crypto. For now, you have to pick your poison.**

Just some thoughts I've had about the current state of stablecoins.

* **Tether** isn't mystery money but it's shockingly little cash (although that's less cash a gov could shutdown via calling a bank) and financial products that definitely aren't going to be liquid during a non-crypto financial crash.
* **USDC**... Tether got a super F.  Like they got a 30 on the test.  They'd still get an F even if you graded on a 25 point curve.  They knew nothing about the material.  USDC is like a 60.  In some schools, Fs are 59 and lower so technically this *could* be a passing grade somewhere.
* **DAI**... a crypto backed stablecoin, operated by a DAO. This is seemingly the best crypto stable asset.  It's so crypto... then you read it's 60% USDC.  If you wanted all the cons of USDC and thought *let's really spice things up by throwing in some smart contract risk*...
* **BUSD**... 96% backed by actual money in a bank.  Nice.  That also means it's easy as hell for a government to shut them down given that it's just money in a regulated bank account. Not to mention that the regulators of Earth have seemingly teamed up and decided *hey you know what... f\*\*\* Binance*.
* **GUSD**... another centralized coin except they've coded the ability to censor addresses into the damn smart contract.  This is like the test case for the *digital yuan* and a company telling regulators and the government *we're the best... we already added all the features and backdoors you'd need to censor coin holders.*  
  
I could go on longer but why bother?  Most of the rest are just *we're backed 75% by USDC and our shitcoin* or amazingly decentralized/censorship resistant and were dollar pegged and trading at $0.86 three days ago.  We're still very early in the crypto game and there is no *crypto ethos* stable coin as far as I can tell that's:

1. Actually stable (lives between $0.99 and $1.01 most of the time)
2. Backed by the peg
3. Decentralized
4. Censorship resistant

&amp;#x200B;

From what I can tell...

1. If you want **stability** then you're in luck because there's a decent amount of them. That's actually not difficult. If that's all you care about and nothing else, you've got plenty of good options.
2. If you want a **collateralized by the peg** token then you're in luck.  You get the bonus of the more it fits this criteria, the more likely it is to also have **stability*****.***  However, the very nature of holding cash (in a regulated, not anonymous bank account) makes getting this feature *and* decentralization or censorship resistance incredibly difficult. They might actually be diametrically opposed ideas unless you want the organization storing cash in some unregulated way.
3. If you want **decentralization**, you're screwed. Those tokens exists but they fail miserably at maintaining their peg which makes them interesting tech ideas but not actually usable as a stablecoin.  Or they're just pulling a MakerDAO: you're decentralized but the primary thing you use to collateralize the coin and the primary asset that keeps it stable is a 100% centralized, 0% censorship resistant token. If regulators squeeze them, you're squeezed by default. 
4. **Censorship resistance** just doesn't exist to me. Not that it can't exist but we just don't have one yet. Stable coins are financial products that directly compete with cash payment systems and yield bearing products. Finance will come around to crypto but the banking industry could literally be destroyed. Literally.  You are not censorship resistant when massive chunks of your collateral and the primary item that keeps your token stable is held by and regulated by titans of said industry you will destroy and you have to go to them to access your funds.

Anyways, that's that. Just my thoughts. Almost a rant but less angry sounding (hopefully). I'd be curious to know what you all think."

How interesting is non-strategy consulting compared with finance/law etc.? Does it justify the pay cut?,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/oryfbk/how_interesting_is_nonstrategy_consulting/,Aureum11,1,2021-07-26 21:12:30,3,/r/consulting/comments/oryfbk/how_interesting_is_nonstrategy_consulting/,NaN,"I am based in the UK, and I was considering going into either consulting or commercial law. Most of the people on my degree course (economics) want to go into finance, but I've ruled that out. This is because my verbal ability is a lot better than my math(s) skills, which are 'good, but not great', so it makes sense to optimise for that given that I am otherwise indifferent between finance and law.

Anyway, I was leaning towards consulting because I had hoped the work would be more interesting than, say, the endless document reviews you (apparently) do in commercial law. However, having thought about it, I'm no longer sure this is the case. I go to a decent university, but not one of \[Oxford, Cambridge, LSE\], so the odds are that I would end up in ops/tech/some other kind of non-strategy consulting. A lot of the tasks involved with this kind of stuff (e.g. process mapping, etc.) seem just as menial? 

Another factor specific to London/theUK is that Big 4 consultants don't tend to get paid a lot here compared to the US. For example, the starting salary for a Big 4 analyst in London is about £32,000 ($44,000). However, this London vs US disparity doesn't seem to hold as much in finance or law. Working for a top US firm in London gives you a starting salary of £140,000  ($200,000), while 'magic circle' firms pay £90,000-£100,000 ($124,000 - $138,000), and 'silver circle' firms a rung down pay £70,000 ($96,000). People have posted stuff about this before and gotten responses along the lines of 'well, you get a lot of state services and guaranteed paid leave in Europe vs the US'. That might be the true, but I think an explanation that might explain why there is less of a disparity for finance or law might be that those are 'superstar' industries in London at the forefront of the productivity curve, whereas the kind of productivity that corporate America has isn't to be found in London more generally. 

Whatever the reason, my issue is that it seems I could be earning a lot less to do work that is just as menial and uninteresting as working in commercial law. While obviously I wouldn't go in expecting to be working for a top US firm, there is still a pretty huge pay premium for working in a silver circle law firm vs Big 4 consulting. In addition, I feel like I would be passing up the opportunity to work in an industry that is super-productive where I live. Obviously, you might work longer hours in law, but is it really over double the amount of hours?

Anyway, apologies for the long post. I'm not expecting someone on here to be like 'yeah, I've worked in those two exact industries and can compare both in detail...'. I just thought I would post for any thoughts and opinions on which track I should try and optimise for while at university."
Ethereum-based DeFi lending protocol Credefi migrates to Polygon’s L2 solution and on-boards a new strategic partner - LucidBlue Ventures,https://www.reddit.com/r/Credefi/comments/orzwzc/ethereumbased_defi_lending_protocol_credefi/,Credefi,1,2021-07-26 22:32:49,0,/r/Credefi/comments/orzwzc/ethereumbased_defi_lending_protocol_credefi/,NaN,"The team behind Credefi has announced its upcoming migration from strictly ERC-20 to Polygon’s (formerly Matic) Layer 2 solution. This move is a major step towards the protocol’s multi-chain future goals, and it will ensure higher network throughput, low transaction costs and most importantly, it will tackle Ethereum’s scalability hurdles. 

The Polygon Network immensely boosts the adoption of DeFi in the crypto space by its innovative features. It is currently available for end users and developers alike. 

Polygon has had massive success with a wide array of projects in the past year by becoming the side-chain of choice for protocols like AAVE, QuickSwap, Curve, SushiSwap, Cream Finance to name a few, where users benefit from fast and cheap transactions, while maximizing their profits. This has had a tremendous impact on the DeFi sector, by outperforming Ethereum-only platforms in many key aspects.

By expanding onto Polygon, Credefi will ensure a seamless user experience for its diverse community and enter the DeFi market with a considerable competitive edge, right after its anticipated public sale. 

**LucidBlue Ventures Partnership**

The expansion coincided with the news about Credefi’s new strategic partnership with LucidBlue Ventures. The fund became a direct investor in Credefi and both teams merged their expertise, focusing on Credefi’s future interoperability goals. 

Lucid Blue Ventures has had an impressive portfolio of backed projects, focusing on DeFi, Gaming and NFT’s, such as Cryptonovae, Fanadise and Ulti Arena. Furthermore, LucidBlue’s managing partner Yechuan (Charlie) Hu is also Polygon’s Head of China.

The importance of such strategic partnerships in the industry is manifested through the innovation they bring to the crypto space. Polygon’s use-case is evident and the ever-growing community of DeFi investors deciding to entrust their capital with robust DeFi protocols is increasing. Credefi’s revolutionary 3-layer security mechanism, combined with the stability of Polygon’s network and its high speed, low-cost nature, creates a synergy capable of disrupting the DeFi sector for years to come. 

***- Ivo Grigorov (CEO, Credefi)-***

*“Our partnership with LucidBlue Ventures is invaluable. It combines the best of both worlds in DeFi - extensive expertise and guidance, provided by the best in blockchain - Polygon! Everyone at Credefi is proud, grateful and excited about this huge step!”*

## Partnership Expansion Accompanies $4 Million in Incentive Campaigns

On Thursday, [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/), a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network focused on cross-chain transactability, unveiled a decision to broaden the partnership agreement with [Sushi](https://sushi.com/), a community-driven defi platform offering a full stack of decentralized finance services.

After deploying Sushiswap on Harmony back in May, the freshly strengthened collaboration paves the way for Sushi to deploy the remainder of its product suite onto the effective proof-of-stake (EPoS) blockchain.

Sushiswap is the second runner-up in the space with an 11% share of dex trade volume, according to today’s Dune Analytics seven-day stats. The leading dex is Uniswap with 61% of the seven-day volume. Based on the most recent data, while Sushiswap’s seven-day volume is $2,079,972,559, Uniswap is well ahead with $10,793,064,634.

Additionally, up and coming players like Curve and 0x Native are racing to close the gap, with Curve at $1,427,401,281 seven-day volume and Ox showing $1,091,283,123 in seven-day trade volume.

Corresponding with the second anniversary of Harmony’s mainnet launch, the expanded partnership aims to strengthen the protocol’s cross-chain defi capabilities, while leveraging Harmony’s 2-second transaction speeds and low transaction costs.

The Sushi full-stack deployment will be accompanied by two incentive campaigns. This includes a $2 million liquidity mining campaign to encourage yield farming with $1 million of ONE and $1 million 1Sushi token rewards.

[Kashi](https://docs.sushi.com/products/kashi-lending), a lending decentralized app (dapp) built on top of Sushi’s Bento Box, is also natively deploying on Harmony. The lending and margin trading platform will be the destination for another $2 million incentive program that will contain $1 million One and $1 million 1Sushi tokens. Bento Box, a vault for asset deposits, will not be deploying on Harmony. However, the stored assets will be accessible for dapps built on top of it.

## Addressing Defi’s Deficiencies

As defi protocols seek to avoid the high costs and low throughput associated with Ethereum, the race is on to deploy on competing networks and solutions.

Sushi operates in an ocean of defi solutions and is far from the only platform making a move to new horizons, echoed by Aave and Curve’s adoption of [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/). Sushiswap is also on Polygon, highlighting the platform’s rapid adoption.

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) is also attracting defi’s attention as an alternative to the scalability and cost limitations of Ethereum. [Acala](http://acala.network/), which aims to be the Ethereum-compatible defi hub on Polkadot, has seen its own Karura platform win the first parachain auction on Kusama, Polkadot’s canary network, potentially shifting the ultra-competitive defi landscape in yet another direction.

With the costs and difficulties of switching between blockchain networks continuing to fall, it remains to be seen whether Ethereum’s upcoming shift to proof-of-stake will be able to stave off the migration of platforms seeking better conditions elsewhere."

1. After reading this disclaimer, are you confident that you're truly educated about Merrill's specific routing practices and destinations?  
2. Do you know whether or not Merrill routes to Citadel, Virtu, Susquehanna, Jane Street, or Two Sigma?  
3. If direct routing of your buy orders is a deciding factor for you (as it is for me), does Merrill's disclaimer—as written—give you enough specific information to decide whether or not to open a new account with Merrill Edge or keep your existing account with Merrill Edge?

&gt;BofA Securities, Inc.:   
&gt;  
&gt;Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated (""MLPF&amp;S"") is a broker-dealer that executes its customer orders in National Market System (“NMS”) securities as agent.   
&gt;  
&gt;MLPF&amp;S routes the bulk of its customer held orders in NMS equity securities and NMS option contracts to its affiliated broker-dealer under common control, BofA Securities, Inc. (“BofAS”), for further order handling, and leveraging BofAS’s connectivity and other infrastructure. As further described below, BofAs then may either further route, as agent, MLPF&amp;S customer orders to other venues for execution or execute such MLPF&amp;S customer orders on a principal basis.   
&gt;  
&gt;BofAS acts as a registered market maker in numerous Nasdaq and other exchange-listed securities and may execute customer orders in such securities on a principal basis. BofAS also may principally commit capital to facilitate customer transactions or serve as the contra-side to customer orders executed internally through one or more alternative trading systems operated by BofAS. BofAS, however, does not transact on a principal basis with respect to any orders executed on behalf of MLPF&amp;S investment advisory customers. BofAS stands to realize 100% of any profits or losses generated when BofAS trades as agent or principal with respect to MLPF&amp;S customer orders.   
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, BofAS may route MLPF&amp;S customer orders to other venues including but not limited to national securities exchanges, multi-lateral trading facilities, other alternative trading systems or external liquidity providers, or broker-dealers. For information about BofAS’s routing of its customer orders in NMS securities and the material aspects of its relationships with its identified trading venues, see BofAS’s quarterly public disclosure, available at [http://public.s3.com/rule606/mlco\_gwim/](http://public.s3.com/rule606/mlco_gwim/).   
&gt;  
&gt;When BofAS routes orders to certain SEC-registered securities exchanges, BofAS pays fees and receives credits in accordance with that market center’s published fee schedule, and may receive incremental pricing benefits if certain volume thresholds are met in accordance with such published fee schedule. In some cases, the credits offered by a market center to BofAS over a period of time may exceed the charges assessed. Likewise, the charges over a period of time may exceed the credits. For NMS equity securities, but not for options, BofAS passes through to MLPF&amp;S the net credit or net charge attributable to MLPF&amp;S customer orders. This net amount for January was a fee of $195,699 or .0065 per 100 shares. The net amount in February was a fee of $319,566 or .0104 per 100 shares. And the net amount in March was a fee $398,064 or .0153 per 100 shares.   
&gt;  
&gt;Aside from holdings that MLPF&amp;S affiliate BofAS may acquire from time to time as part of its ordinary market making, block positioning, client facilitation and related hedging activities, an MLPF&amp;S affiliate under common control may acquire equity stakes in market centers as part of a strategic investment. In this regard, an MLPF&amp;S affiliate owns a minority equity investment stake in the following market centers and therefore stands to participate as a shareholder/investor in the profits that each market center realizes in part from the execution of securities transactions, including the execution of MLPF&amp;S customer orders: MembersX; CME; Tokyo Financial Exchange; Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX); JapanNext; Borsa Instanbul (BIST); Mercado Abierto Electronico (MAE); eBX (LeveL); Turquoise; BIDS LP; BIDS GP; Curve Global; Trumid; MTS S.p.A.; iSwap; Philippine Dealing Systems; IHS Markit; Equilend; and FXSpotStream.

Once upon a time I exaggerated and crapped on Desautels. I am back to tell u why Desautels is the best circus u can join.

1. Your undergrad isn’t just about how much theory you learn, it’s about how much you learn that is actually useful. Desautels is by far the best at teaching u transferable soft skills and a general understanding of how any business or organization works. If you want to get employed, choose management over math or science. In a real STEM classroom you really will learn more, but u will most likely never use any of what you learn. In a business class, u use more of the concepts you learn even if you don’t learn as much theory. People underestimate the value of 4 years of presentation practice, fiscal appreciation / basic money sense, and people skills. These are what help you go from a mindless employee, to one that can actually bring value to your organization. And a general understanding of business functions (HR, IS/IT, Marketing, accounting, finance, sales, operations, etc) will always provide you with a competitive advantage in any role. In any job, u will touch on most, if not all, of these areas and your knowledge of how these functions work make you stand out from the crowd. Education and experience is your competitive advantage on the job market. Learning about the kernel of a vector will never be as valuable as knowing how to present your latest project to your manager.

2. Easy classes are good for you. If not your mental health, then ur GPA. Easy classes will always be so much better for your well-being. There are plenty of hard classes in Desautels, but when compared to their out-of-faculty equivalents (IE. Comp Sci vs business analytics), Desautels classes are far easier from an academic perspective. The most important part is that with easier classes, you have time to actually explore clubs, career options, and have free time to do the things you enjoy. I don’t know why you wouldn’t want easier classes.  

3. Management is diverse-er. We have like 40% of students being international, we have a SOMEWHAT diverse student body that makes it a bit more interesting - even if some kids are snobby. You will also always be able to make out-of-faculty friends and u don’t have to get swept up in the snob-lifestyle of Desautels. In the end, meeting snobby kids is inevitable, but having the connections with these peers may one day benefit you. Which faculty do u think the middle manger that helps you get into ur dream company is gonna be from?

4. The curve still sucks, but with some elbow grease and a tiny bit of hard work, u can score above the curve if u try.

5. Desautels is old fashioned, but the old folks are the ones that are hiring. This sucks to admit, but we know that unless ur in the valley, old folks will be the ones that hire us. You might as well know how boomers operate and how to get the best of your interactions with them.

Desautels is a horrible choice if u want to go into an extremely technical role or you want to pursue a close-to-pure sciences career. If you are studying math, comp sci, stats, arts, etc… you should really consider an mba or just come to BComm. You are gonna be more employable, work less hard for the same pay, and will be LESS of a victim of capitalism. If you can’t be it, be it, until u can do something about it (IT being capitalism). Again, I’m exaggerating, but Desautels is a great option if u don’t know what to do because it prepares u for all jobs in some way or another. A Bcomm isn’t an academic degree, it’s a career development degree. The degree helps you succeed in a career, not in academics, and in the end, 99% of people don’t end up on academia. 

Management is the best Faculty and you truly gain more value for your future by learning about business than you do by learning about mitosis. I’m happy to be in commerce because I have the free time and flexibility I need during school. I’m happy to one day be a commerce grad because I know I will have prepared for 4 years for a career in my area of interest - I’ll be graduating with a career and not just a degree."

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

-	Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
-	The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
-	**Template of a debt crisis**
-	Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
-	Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
-	During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
-	Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
-	Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
-	Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
-	Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
-	Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
-	It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
-	No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
-	During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
-	Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
-	It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
-	By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
-	Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

-	Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period
-	Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
-	The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
-	The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
-	The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution
-	Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
-	Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

-	Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
-	If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one"

UBE Post Mortem thoughts...,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/otycsh/ube_post_mortem_thoughts/,plurplepeople,1,2021-07-29 22:17:53,5,/r/barexam/comments/otycsh/ube_post_mortem_thoughts/,NaN,"Now that it's over I just wanted to shout to the world how I feel about this process and exam. 
1. (The issue is.... just kidding never again.) Background: I went to a top 25 law school, graduated top 1/3 of the class and secured a biglaw job. I previously worked in finance, I have a Masters degree from a good school for my field. I have taken and done well on SAT, GRE, 4 financial licensure exams, MPRE, and NYLE. This is not a humble brag, obviously, for any trigger happy redditors I'm just trying to set the stage. I did Barbri and completed 96%, I wrote 3 additional essays for each MEE testable topic and did another 600 MCQs as additional practice. I also had Critical Pass flashcards and JD Advising MEE one sheets. I was averaging 78% correct over thousands of MBE practice questions, scored 91st percentile in simulated MBE (154/200), and 86/100 on MBE final prep. I started studying early in the game like the week after classes ended and just plugged along methodically. I didn't really crunch until the final 3 weeks because there's only so much you can absorb in one 24 hour period anyway - I felt really good about my overall study plan and performance. I knew MEEs were my weak suit and that's why I did the extra practice, but I also knew that the best way to do well on them is to know law. I truly learned a lot of law in my study and I thought, as Barbri advised, that knowing the core 80% of the law tested was a recipe for success. 

None of us know how we did on the MBE. I was super consistently crushing it and every time I hit submit on an MBE practice I was like well I missed every one of those. So I would say, it's more likely than not our MBE scores are pretty in line with what we did in practice. We'll see. However, that 200 we just did looked a lot different than all the practice I did and was particularly tricky so who knows. 

This brings me to my real issue. The MEEs. I felt good about my knowledge of Family, Corp, Agency/Partnership, Secured Transactions, and Wills based on my Barbri practice. I wasn't solid on Trusts and Conflicts. That being said, I have no idea how I was supposed to study for and do well on that MEE. Barbri did not prepare me at all. I feel like the stuff I learned on Barbri was the basics of the MEE topics and a majority of the essays were not that. It seemed really nuanced and exceedingly diabolical. I honestly don't know who to blame and in what proportion. In a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction Barbri, NCBEx, and I were probably all negligent to some degree. It just feels so unfair to have gone through all of law school, studied my butt off for this bar (using the ""gold standard""), and then very likely failed. 

I know the sunshine pumpers will say, ""you probably passed, you just feel bad now."" And statistically they would be correct. And also, they're doing God's work by picking us all up off the floor we just got beaten down on. But I know myself. I know what I wrote on those essays was wrong - it was clearly, unequivocally, compellingly wrong. And you know, maybe I destroyed the MBE and that will save me. Very possibly not. 

In sum, I know that out of all the hard things I've done in my life, all the tests and interviews, work assignments etc., it all pales in comparison to what I just attempted. I would rather take any combination of prior tests than to do this bar again. It just all feels so unfair. And this isn't even addressing the inequity issues with access to bar prep and the bar and all that stuff is even worse than what I'm talking about. I'm just fortunate to have had all these resources and I know that (so I'm sorry for complaining). But I have no idea how I could possibly pass in February if I didn't now. I'll be working 70 hour weeks (again,  I know I'm lucky in this regard and not minimizing anyone whose situation is different than mine) and the curve is not nearly as generous. I got my dream job and will probably lose it because of this God forsaken hazing ritual that exists just to support an industry whose sole mission of preparing and weeding out applicants to the bar could be accomplished in a more equitable, and economically efficient manner. And it would probably have better outcomes anyway, that's why NY is changing their approach, and good for them. It will better serve a whole new generation of aspiring lawyers and their clients. It'll just come too late for me. Thanks for all the posts on this subreddit. Y'all really are cool and great people and made me feel better reading your dark humor and memes. I genuinely hope you all achieve everything you wanted and more. July 2021 -  Over and OUT!"

Survivor's guilt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/ou4it3/survivors_guilt/,Wordswastaken,1,2021-07-30 03:32:50,2,/r/CFA/comments/ou4it3/survivors_guilt/,General information,"I guess I should start by saying I passed Level 1. Score line on the graph looks about 1/4-5th of the way from 90th percentile to the MPS line. 

I registered for June 2020 back in October '19, and was rescheduled to December, then May. Mind you, I hadn't picked up a book by the time I got the first reschedule email, and barely skimmed Fixed Income by the time I got the second one.  Self studying is a nightmare for me, and I was mostly banking on my undergrad studies for Econ, Quant  and PM. My resources were mainly print 2019 SchweserNotes and a few VODs from a local prep provider, and I decided to start late March with Fixed/Deriv/Alts, since they looked like the most efficient score-wise. As thin as that book is compared to the others, I barely finished it by mid April, and decided to continue with FRA, again, most efficient score (and now time) wise.

Three pages in, it hit me that 2019 and 2020/21 material may differ, and quickly  confirmed that FRA had some major revisions.  Since I cannot productively read from a screen, the next logical was to get print versions of the 2020 Notes. However, I figured that with a month to go, I was pretty much doomed, and cheaped out in the dumbest of fashions (20$ print job &gt; 700$ exam I guess). How can I cram the largest amount of content in my remaining time? CFA qbank and mocks seemed to be the answer, even without touching CorpFin/Equity/Ethics.

I am confident a good chunk of L1 candidates have gone through this stage of ""learning"" at one point or another, and it could work if one's missing a few readings per topic, but not for topics as a whole. Doing the thing where you try to rationalize the answer explanation as a primary learning strategy really, really shouldn't work. Come mock time, I got 55 AM, 65 PM, which made sense considering what I had studied; but then again, that 55 AM felt like complete luck, as I didn't fully understand many of the questions. Reading the subreddit and MPS estimates for May, the idea of failure dug deeper, since most were expecting mid 70s. Yeah, I thought, it is doomed.

Bar cheating, I must have taken most of the shortcuts an L1  candidate could take. Quicksheets, summaries of summaries, you name it. I read Ethics the day before the exam (Schweser, not Handbook). The questions on exam day felt surprisingly underwhelming, but I told myself that maybe I was too far back in the study curve to realize their true complexity. Now, after seeing the higher(?) MPS and brutal pass rate, I don't feel at all like I should have passed. Probably less than 100 hours, definitely less than 150 hours of study, should not work even for fin/econ undergrads, nor should it net you 70+% on all topics, specially the ones you haven't read at all.

It's easy, almost insulting, to say that I wish I didn't pass after I've done so, just so I can dedicate myself properly for my next attempt. I have always thought that finance is the field I want to work in and that I can get a good grasp of it quickly, but that alone can't be enough to get through the program. I won't sit for L2 at least until late next year. Whatever luck I had, I must have used all of it by now.

TL,DR: don't take shortcuts studying. Even if you succeed, you'll feel like you failed and took something away from more deserving people."
