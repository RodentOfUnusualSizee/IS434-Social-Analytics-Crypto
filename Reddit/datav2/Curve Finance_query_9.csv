Shibance | Multi-chain meme dex on BSC and KCC. Lotteries launching on the 1st (tickets available to buy now)! $16k initial incentive for the Lottery 🎰,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/pf9te1/shibance_multichain_meme_dex_on_bsc_and_kcc/,ietsistoptimist,1,2021-09-01 00:51:40,19,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/pf9te1/shibance_multichain_meme_dex_on_bsc_and_kcc/,BSC Token,"‼️Lotteries and NFT farming coming very soon, IWOs (launchpad) not too long after that. Super secret game-changer code name: Project FLOOF in the works ‼️

To celebrate the launch of this much anticipated feature, the **initial funding for the Lottery is 800,000 in WOOF tokens!** This doesn’t include the extra tokens added from purchase of tickets so the prize pools are really nothing to be sniffed at!

Official Twitter announcement: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1432014234053840900?s=21

*In this article I will explain why I think this could be your last chance to ever get Shibance tokens at this price again* 📈

I’ve done a lot of the DD leg work for you to save you some time but make sure to check it all out for yourself 🕵️‍♂️

**For the degenerates among you, yes you, I’ve added a TL;DR for each section to help you understand in a quick skim** 🦍⏩ 

#*Right around the corner for Shibance 🔜*

The lottery and NFT farming utilities are very close to being launched now. They will be launching on BSC first and half a month later will be added to the KCC network DEX as well. This coincides with the 2nd halvings for both chains, after which the halvings are yearly. 

If you don’t know why halvings can be such a positive event I’d suggest you have a look at BTC price action post-halving or any of the other numerous examples.

**TL;DR : more demand, less new tokens added to supply** 📈

//

#*First up - Lottery 🎰*

Launching on the 30th - the lottery prize pool is initially funded with a whopping 800,000 in WOOF tokens!! This comes to around $16,000 at the current price (but in a year that amount could make anyone very very happy). The lottery system looks amazing and with the chance to win so many tokens you could leapfrog a whole load of long term investors with just one win! I know where some of my staking rewards are going!

The incentive funding is split between the first two lotteries. It has already proven to be very popular as the first of which is already up to 692k WOOF ($13,500!!). Prize tiers that haven’t been won will be rolled over into the next lottery to keep that jackpot going!

**Oh, and it burns!!** 20% of the funds for the lottery pools will be allocated for burns - introducing another deflationary mechanism to the tokenomic structure of Shibance. Even if you’re not the lottery type, who doesn’t like stuff that makes each of your tokens more valuable!

**TL;DR: Chance to win big, inbuilt deflationary element to control supply and make your tokens more valuable** 🎰🔥

//

#*NFT Farming 👨‍🌾🖼*

Stake tokens, earn NFTs, easy enough right?! NFTs are so hot right now and with the potential of this project, earning some of these early rare NFTs could be one of the most profitable things you’ve ever done in a few years time.

**TL;DR: more demand, super cool limited edition artwork by the very talented in-house artist** 🎨

//

#*End of September - Initial Woof Offerings (Launchpad) 🐶🚀*

The launchpad is scheduled to be released at the end of September for both chains. We have had 2 weekly teasers for how this will look in practice. So far we have been shown that there will be guaranteed allocation tiers for loyal puppers and a mechanism to earn interest on tokens locked for the Launchpad. 

Launchpads have shown to be a very valuable asset for DEXs and tend to result in greatly increased demand for the native tokens (in this case, WOOF and KWOOF).

1st teaser here: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1428705675228573708?s=21

2nd teaser here: https://twitter.com/shibance/status/1431258906743902211?s=21

**TL;DR: Groundfloor access to the hottest new meme projects. Locking mechanism to reduce effective circulating supply** 🔒

//

#**The Economic Moat of Shibance 💪**

Also sometimes known as the unique selling point (USP), the economic moat for Shibance is the first mover advantage of servicing the huge and fast-growing demand for meme projects in the DEX space. 

The addressable market here is absolutely massive and it’s growing at a frankly ridiculous rate.

To get some idea if you’re in the dark here, have a look at this article on TVL growth in the DeFi market: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/05/20/after-growing-88x-in-a-year-where-does-defi-go-from-here/amp/

And unless you live under a rock, I’m not sure you need to be informed about the size of the meme market. Just look at Doge coin, Shiba Inu and Safemoon. A lot of people got very rich very fast on these and many many others, this could be your chance to do the same. Finding the next Doge is hard but getting exposure to the whole meme market is now easy!

The team aren’t looking to be a Pancakeswap or a Curve. They’re looking to be a ‘Shibance’ - there are no direct competitors for what they’re trying to do. The team have been nothing but impressive and very competent so far, evidenced by what they have achieved since launch already. Great idea, great team and great potential for massive gains!

**TL;DR: DeFi to the moon, memes to the moon, Shibance to the moon!** 🌝

#**Summary of the the Shibance Ecosystem**

Shibance aims to build an entire ecosystem dedicated to meme tokens. Ticker symbols: WOOF for BSC and KWOOF for KCC.  

*Launch Features:*  
* 		DEX platform  
* 		Farming rewards for partner projects  
* 		WOOF staking pool  

*Post Launch (Lotteries and NFT Farming very soon):*
* 		Initial WOOF/KWOOF offerings (‘IWOs’), on our launchpad  
* 		WOOF/KWOOF lotteries  
* 		Weekly votes on farming boosts for meme tokens  
* 		Top-secret development update (project codename: FLOOF)  
* 		NFT farming  
* 		Cross-chain support  

The UI/UX is amazing and very user friendly - if you’ve ever used a dex before you’ll have no issues with Shibance. Even if not, the Docs section on the DApp and the Medium articles contain all the information you need to get started. Plus, you can always pop in the TG chat where there is always someone willing to help with whatever you need.   

Shibance already have a very respectful collection of farms and staking options given its been less than 2 months. I won’t mention them for fear of the automod but check out the pairs you can farm currently - It’s got some of the hottest meme coins right now and the team is always working hard to add more!  

Staking is done in the “DoggyPound”, so you can earn extra tokens without the risk of IL! Shibance have already partnered a few of the bigger meme projects to launch this year! You can currently earn a few different and very popular tokens in the DoggyPound too! Expect more of this to come in the future.  

**Check the official Twitter for the latest or join the telegram and check the pins. Links included at the end of the post.**

What’s the best part about all of this? With a huge addressable market and great core team, oftentimes when you find a project this good, it’s already 100x’d and you don’t know if it’s worth jumping in still.  

This time however, you’re not late! Mcap is criminally low for both tokens and the APR/APY is still very *very* good. I’m not saying it’ll moon tomorrow or the next day but DYOR and a lot of you will see the potential this one has got. Speak to anyone in the chat and you’ll start to understand why we’re so bullish on this.  

The smart contracts for both chains have been audited already by ApeAudits. Links to medium articles regarding the audits (the audit report can be found here):

WOOF: https://shibance.medium.com/initial-audit-release-fe55c6c998c2

KWOOF: https://shibance.medium.com/shibance-kcc-completes-first-official-audit-158a65406c2c

The team are very professional and proficient at what they do. In the telegram you’ll also find a strong community of holders and as mentioned before, we’re always happy to help.  

*Why should you trust what I have to say?*  

First of all, I’m not a shill. Look at my history, I’ve been active on Reddit for a while and often contribute to finance, econ and crypto themed subs. My recency bias and arrogance tells me I can also pick a winner pretty well, I had two projects recently each turn less than $50 into over 8k (one of which has two active farming pairs and a staking option on Shibance and rhymes with DumPocket 😉). I then held through the subsequent fall from ATH, so I’m not an oracle and none of this is financial advice. I don’t have a crystal ball, but I know a growing market and a great dev team when I see it. The whole DEX (and wider DeFi) sector is growing very fast. This industry is unstoppable at the moment and the same can definitely be said about meme projects.

**This could truly be your last chance to get an entry price at this level!** Put your straw hat on and get out in them fields where there’s seeds to sow, crops to grow and great yields to show! 👨‍🌾

My recency bias and arrogance tells me I can also pick a winner pretty well, I had two projects recently each turn less than $50 into over 8k (one of which has two active farming pairs and a staking option on Shibance and rhymes with DumPocket 😉). I then held through the subsequent fall from ATH, so I’m not an oracle and none of this is financial advice. I don’t have a crystal ball, but I know a growing market and a great dev team when I see it. The whole DEX (and wider DeFi) sector is growing very fast. This industry is unstoppable at the moment and the same can definitely be said about meme projects.

Does anyone else ever feel like nobody actually knows what they're talking about with crypto predictions and advice? Like it's almost always wrong and is about as predictable as gambling on a game of cards?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pfbv8f/does_anyone_else_ever_feel_like_nobody_actually/,tomatoketchupandbeer,1,2021-09-01 02:33:33,401,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pfbv8f/does_anyone_else_ever_feel_like_nobody_actually/,SPECULATION,"Since first investing in crypto back in march, and going off of advice from all four trillion corners of the internet, I've realised nobody actually knows what they're talking about.

I have a friend who pays 30 GBP a month for 'solid' advice from crypto gurus, and after following his tips have actually lost. 

I've read countless articles from so many different financial and investment 'experts' and after following their 'predictions' have ended up at a loss. 

I've read plenty of articles using a tonne of crypto lingo that makes it sound like they know what they're talking about, and half the time it's right and half the time it's wrong.

The majority of the serious crypto community said doge coin was a joke and then we're in uproar when it soared nearly 400% (from my 0.17 investment) in a few days/weeks to an ATH of 0.71 USD after being just 0.06 a few weeks before. 

Everyone was so sure that Elon musk's appearance on SNL would send doge coin ""to the moooon"" when it did the exact opposite. 

Just to list a few predictions I've seen parroted all over the internet and on multiple sites in the past few months -

- there will a crypto winter around August or September where the bullrun will end and there'll be a massive crash ( this ended up happening in July)

- bitcoin will hit 100k towards the end of the summer (no sign of that happening any time soon)

- the ripple Vs sec case will end in April and xrp will shoot up to 2-3 USD (case still ongoing) 

- shiba inu will kill doge and hit a dollar at the end of the year (bs)

- doge coin will die (still remains a top five crypto)

Basically predictions either turn out to be rigt or wrong. Nobody knows what's going to happen. Yet people with a lot of influence can change (or manipulate) how the market moves. A simple tweet from Elon musk moved doge coins price a bunch of times. An article from Forbes can tell the world that ADA or ETH has a big bull run coming and that's enough to make it happen due to massive buying. A billionaire can buy 1 billion USD worth of any crypto and that sends the price skyrocketing by retail investors and then the whale sells and they've made an easy profit in a few hours or days. 

I constantly come across people or articles who just use words that sound impressive but how many of us actually know what's going to happen? Were mostly a bunch of gamblers hoping to get rich, thinking we're ahead of the curve by investing in crypto before it becomes the global norm for finance, but really most of us are just people who heard about bitcoin seven years too late and still want to get rich quick. 

Let me demonstrate how easy it is to pretend I know what's going on with the cryptomarket using trigger words and crypto jargon that makes it sound like a legitimate prediction ....

DOGE and XRP continue to dominate inflows to institutional crypto investment products, while demand for  DOT weakens.

 Institutional inflows to altcoin investment products have continued to increase this past week, but the same cannot be said for Bitcoin (ETH).

The capital flows mark the second consecutive week of inflows to altcoin funds, with investments into altcoin products increasing by 24.1% compared to last week’s $16 million.

Binance Coin price struggled with its uptrend as it encountered a massive resistance level. Failure to stay afloat dragged BNB lower, where it currently retests a support barrier. Investors can expect a comeback from the buyers, pushing the altcoin higher. 

However, considering the big crypto’s choppy market structure, Binance Coin (BNB) could kick-start a consolidation phase if it fails to reclaim the said resistance barrier.

BAT followed a Fibonacci retracement sequence the past quarter indicating an uptrend that will retest a support barrier, potentially creating demand for comeback investments from buyers. After a recent crash, BAT price is currently consolidating under the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 0.76. This descent might continue to head lower and retest the high probability reversal zone ranging from 0.72 to 0.80. 

The 70.5% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.71 could be a perfect spot or reversal as it coincides with the demand zone extending from $0.69 to $0.73

Anyway I think that's enough but i just made all of that up, and maybe 10% of you will have any idea what any of the words mean but the average person will look at it and think ""I should invest in BAT"". 

Its basically all just gambling

Tl;Dr - don't believe any predictions on crypto, unless you're a hedge fund manager, billionaire, politician, or a founder of a major coin, you don't know what's going to happen. 

Hopefully this post didn't come across as too negative and more of a warning to remember that this is all jut gambling and most of us have no idea what we're doing.

# Quick Background

For the past three months, I've fallen down a rabbit hole in the form of a 2005 academic paper called [SHORT SELLING, DEATH SPIRAL CONVERTIBLES, AND THE PROFITABILITY OF STOCK MANIPULATION by John D. Finnerty](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf).

[Finnerty's Abstract](https://preview.redd.it/r38xhft1jjk71.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b45979b217911d29b447875d69dfb4b5ca8455b)

[Finnerty](http://www.finnecon.com/), a [finance professor](https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/faculty/full-time-faculty/john-finnerty/), lays out his analytical model describing naked short selling and mathematical equations governing it.

**Over the course of several posts, I examined his theories then applied them to get an estimate of shares shorted from December 2015 to April 2021. Here is a** [**POST DIRECTORY WITH TL;DRs TO ALL THE PREVIOUS POSTS**](https://www.reddit.com/user/nydus_erdos/comments/p8xu12/post_directory_summaries/) **and my current estimates.**

I hadn't planned on adding to the estimates because I thought the hedgies had shifted more towards options fuckery than naked shorting (which they did during May), but after Criand's revelation about them basically naked shorting by proxy through swaps I figured the game was back on.

Now, Finnerty's method is analytical. Let me explain...

\---

# Why I Prefer Anal(ytical) Methods

There are two main ways to solve a problem:

1. **Numerically** \- a numerical solution means making guesses at the solution and testing them to see how good the solution is. This involves framing the problem and using trial and error across a set of candidate solutions.
2. **Analytically** \- an analytical solution involves framing the problem in a well-understood form and creating a set of logical steps to follow to calculate the exact solution.

Both of these methods can be useful, but because I'm a simple ape who also happens to be quite lazy, I try to avoid complexity as much as possible without sacrificing the accuracy and/or precision. A powerful equation that is quick, relatively simple and can be applied in general cases is always preferred. For me its always the anal(ytical) route.

https://preview.redd.it/3afu5z39pjk71.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ab292521c924bf0f7fbd4b9ed74805b3009faf6

The only data I use in these calculations is price data. If you've read the past posts you know that one of Finnerty's main points is that there is a pattern to the price decline when naked short selling is present.

What? Basing calculations on patterns and price? The two things we've found to be impossible to apply and wrong, respectively? Just hear me out.

The manipulator controls price by saturating supply. There is no other way for the naked short seller to directly influence price. It stands to reason that by studying the price behavior we can surmise the quantity needed for that price drop.

**The price is wrong, but HOW the price is wrong can tell us a lot too.**

There are downsides to an analytical approach. If you frame the problem incorrectly you're fucked from the get go and probably won't find out till much later when you've wasted a bunch of time on it. That makes it especially difficult if no one's done any previous work on the topic you're working on. Fortunately for us, that isn't the case since we have the Finnerty's equations and well laid out model.

If this method ends up being correct (which we'll only really know after all this is done) than that means there's a way to calculate an accurate short interest using easily available price. All the hedgies' efforts to obscure data would be moot.

# Quick Restatement of Main Assumptions:

[Detailed list of assumptions in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogi75b/the_chronicles_of_short_shorter_ep_1_before_the/), [and this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oh8fcz/the_chronicles_of_short_shorter_ep_2_during_the/)

*(1) SHORTS HAVE NOT NET COVERED*

[ I DID NOT MAKE THIS! IT WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED BY u\/MisterFinishLine https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/nii1s6\/short\_shorter\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/xlgv7hrcqjk71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e23e78ba39e1a50aa1349b8bea69703d79aae82)

* They may have rolled over FTDs, but their short position has not decreased. The short position's net growth has always been positive
* They have had very little incentive to cover (until recently) as naked short selling has zero cost and provides immediate cash returns
* **The Finnerty equations take into account whether shorts would've covered or not based on the size of their short position at that time. The equations indicate they have likely not covered.**

*(2) MONOPOLY MARKET*

* Kenadel-Sus72 have sole control of GME shares (a monopoly)
* Monopolies have no supply curve
* **Output decision of a monopoly is only based on market demand curve and marginal cost curve**
* Monopolies usually sell on the elastic part of the demand curve

*(3) SHORT SELLILNG ON AN INELASTIC DEMAND CURVE*

* Normally, a monopoly wants to work on the elastic part of the demand curve. However, if Kenny &amp; Co. naked short sell an elastic curve they'd drive the company to bankruptcy with less shares shorted.
* **I say Kenny &amp; Co. figured they could maximize profit by naked short selling on an inelastic demand curve, as they could short more shares over time. More shares sold means more profit.**

*(4) DOUBLE-HALF CONJECTURE*

* **The strategy of shorting usually leaves a pattern. The first attack drops the price sharply by about one-third (\~33%), the second attack slowly bleeds that price in half (\~50%) and the third kicks it down close to zero**
* **As the amount of naked shares increase, the magnitude of the price drops in the following attacks decreases, but the pattern is the same: sharp drop, slow bleed and final kick**
* I assume that around the time the price is cut in half the manipulator has naked shorted the same amount of shares outstanding
* Going on this I assume that every time the price is approximately cut in half, the naked short seller has doubled the shares in existence

*(5)  PRICE ELASTICITY OF TIME IS ANALOGOUS TO PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND*

* Because monopolies output decisions can be based on the market demand curve, I assume that price behavior over time is highly related to market demand
* The elasticity (normalized/unitless) from the Price vs. Time charts is analogous to the elasticity on the market demand curve (Price vs. Quantity)

[Elasticity is denoted as a lower case epsilon](https://preview.redd.it/bdkkzl29hqk71.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dabe4e58aaefcd332f86755b9b92d752f93a7c1)

*(6) CONSTANT ELASTICITY*

Although our demand is not completely inelastic, I do think it is relatively constant.

\---

# Time Frame

Since this is the 4th complete short attack cycle the magnitude of the price drops has decreased significantly and the amount of shares needed to achieve the price drop has dramatically increased. The price drops still follow a pattern, but with much lower amounts of decrease.

These dates and prices are approximate. They're only need to capture the general price decline (for explanations of the times check [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8281/math_black_magic_vol_1_why_it_is_mathematically/))

* *Time 0 - 6/9/2021*
   * Initial conditions
   * Price at time 0 =&gt; P(0) = $ 302.56
* *Time 1 - 6/10/2021*
   * Price at time 1 =&gt; P(1) = $ 226.92
   * 25 % drop, should be 33 %
* *Time 2 - 7/15/2021*
   * Price at time 2 =&gt; P(2) = $ 170.19
   * 25 %, should be 50 %
* *Time 3 - 8/4/2021*
   * Price at time 3 =&gt; P(3) = $ 145.88
   * 14 % drop
   * Normally, the third amount does not cut the price by a specific amount, but it is always much more than this. When the amount of shares is undiluted, the third attack is powerful enough to kick the price close to zero. (Check previous posts to see how the price drops diminish)

# Equations &amp; Variables

I'm not going to spend too much time here. Check previous posts for more detail on the equations and variables, particularly [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8281/math_black_magic_vol_1_why_it_is_mathematically/) which covers all the basics.

&amp;#x200B;

***Finnerty Equations***

[Finnerty Equations](https://preview.redd.it/l6s7qv79njk71.png?width=919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9662c890c2bb5017002b65d1d68030c7ebbe8f06)

***Variable A***

It represents initial price at time 0.

A = $ 302.56

&amp;#x200B;

***Variable B/Elasticity***

Variable A is pretty straight forward, Variable B? Not so much. 

This topic requires a little more explaining. The only reason I'm including it is because of how important it was to getting consistent answers.

Variable B is essentially the elasticity of the demand curve. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of1lz2/malleus_oeconomica_a_compressed_primer/) covers elasticity more in depth. I'll just review the high points really quick.

Elasticity is the percentage change in a variable in response to a given percentage change in another variable. Why is it necessary? Because elasticity is unitless (i.e. normalized), so we don't have to worry about errors coming from changes in units.

**For example, say hypothetically there an ape in another country doing the same calculations I am. Since we are using different currency, we would not get the same answers unless we normalized our answers first.**

Throughout the whole process our demand has been fairly inelastic, meaning price change doesn't influence the level of demand (FOMO IS OUR STRENGTH).

However, unless a curve is perfectly inelastic, the curve will become more elastic as price rises. Good news is, while our curve has become more elastic, the values do seems to confirm there is a sort of floor they can't push us past. 

**The demand curve below is not our demand curve!** I don't know what our demand curve looks like at this point (have some theories), but I highly doubt its linear. However, most demand curves do have the three sections pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Example Demand Curve. NOT OUR DEMAND CURVE!](https://preview.redd.it/ktgmdfbafkk71.png?width=528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5eee4207a0af3078bcd4ce2a51a053304c3c0d7)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, they can't (or won't) push price to the inelastic area of our demand curve. I'm not sure if this is the only reason for the floor, but I def think its part of it.

Recall, there are two ways to calculate elasticity. This time point elasticity gave the more reasonable answers and I chose the most inelastic value:

&amp;#x200B;

[Variable B](https://preview.redd.it/s5jp5ekclqk71.png?width=143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3815f15333ce44183e248ed909b9f13982e6d554)

&amp;#x200B;

*Variable H*

Think of H as the price the the stock wants to rise to during that time frame. It changes each time we analyze a new attack cycle.

H = $ 390.22

&amp;#x200B;

*Constant of Proportionality &amp; Log-Liner Form*

If you've read my previous posts, [I believe that exponential floor guy is still correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oji000/short_shorter_interlude_why_i_still_think/). The exponential price and logarithmic trend was as follows:

[Former Exponential Price Trend](https://preview.redd.it/ifgi2eixmjk71.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a76b227ef8ea791bb51ca124abf3ff1301c8439)

&amp;#x200B;

[Logarithmic Scale ](https://preview.redd.it/ptogyjpumqk71.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04052d87b1af12bcd37c9bd585956a03d2a1add5)

What caught my eye was this:

[Constant of Proportionality](https://preview.redd.it/1jzob1prlqk71.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7628d29308a5f54d7b12d6d8652662afd41b6daa)

And this:

[Log-Linear Form](https://preview.redd.it/cfh8imc5nqk71.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358e1ac8c63a99e3108dbc573757cc5c66f74664)

&amp;#x200B;

Particularly this term:

&amp;#x200B;

[Elasticity times log of price](https://preview.redd.it/2plawgaynqk71.png?width=73&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b99a5f32bf977077bc041ade1e0efdba9f6ec3e)

This supports the theory of some sort of multiplicative demand shock ([discussed previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oji000/short_shorter_interlude_why_i_still_think/)) is being applied somewhere. As in past calculations I'll be using the the constant of proportionality to represent the multiplier that has to be applied to overcome the diminishing power of their attacks.

The Finnerty equations are slightly modified

[Multiplicative Demand Shock](https://preview.redd.it/06f3v4unpqk71.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=974c852c246528b0e0a1204af78bb43b42885d51)

&amp;#x200B;

The value of n depends on the scenario. I'll let you know the value.

# Results

(Share Counts in Millions, unless otherwise indicated)

I got high and low estimates by considering two scenarios:

1. Banks and SHF were unable or unwilling to bypass the new rules/regulations and were conservative in their naked short selling  (lololololol). \[For these calculations n =2\]
2. Banks and SHF say ""fuck that shit, I'm a filthy thief!"" and continue to blatantly counterfeit shares.  \[For these calculations n =3\]

Defidollar products,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFi_Dollar/comments/pgd4oa/defidollar_products/,gallantmayor,1,2021-09-02 15:38:41,1,/r/DeFi_Dollar/comments/pgd4oa/defidollar_products/,NaN,"DefiDolllar (DUSD) now DefiDollar Finance is an index of stable coins that uses Defi primitives to stay near the dollar mark and subsidize the collateralization ratio. DefiDolllar Finance aims to provide amplified utility and simplify DeFi for the average  user. DefiDollar evolved into DefiDollar Finance to bring this vision to fruition and eventually aims to transition into a DAO.  
DefiDollar Finance is a multi-chain DeFi Protocol Lab. DefiDolllar Finance is building a range of products  that will  enable taking DeFi to the masses. DeFiDollar DUSD is a stablecoin index backed asset designed to reduce volatility induced risk.


DUSD has the following features:

☑ Yield Farming
Earn yield rewards by Hodling or Staking DUSD

☑ Modularity
Ease of integration with various DeFi liquidity pools 

☑ Volatility Cushion
Staked DUSD acts as insurance against volatility

☑ Diversify Risk
Own a meta asset backed by multiple stablecoins




DefiDollar Finance Products 

DefiDollar Finance product suite comprises of the following :

☑ DUSD - The Stablecoin Index
It mitigates the risk of volatility and systemic failure to stablecoin holdings by creating an index initially backed by Curve LP tokens. DUSD, which is the stablecoin Index achieved a great milestone by becoming the first meta stablecoin on BSC. 
DUSD has been live on Ethereum since late August. The DeFi summer and yield farming led transaction explosion has resulted in high fees and consequently priced out retail users. It has become a whale’s game and average users find it increasingly uneconomical to access open finance primitives like yield farming and diversification across. DUSD directs all of the earnings to the DefiDollar Savings Account. The savings account has the best product market fit for DUSD and isn't being incentivized by DFD via inflation. Therefore the protocol directs revenues to Savings in order to offer higher APY's to attract more capital to DUSD. 


☑ bBTC - Interest bearing Bitcoin 
An interest bearing BTC index built in collaboration with BadgerDAO. To reward DefiDollar Finance long term stakeholders they have decided to share fees being generated from ibBTC with the community.
It works in a simple manner, DefiDollar Finance runs a script to calculate the amount and duration for which tokens were staked for each user and then ibBTC fee collected during the week is distributed pro-rated to the stakers.
A Mint fee of 0.2% and a Redeem fee of 0.1% is being distributed to the stakers in the DFD v2 staking vault.  

☑ Opeth - Option backed synthetic assets
A put option fused with underlying collateral that among other use cases will also  enable capital efficient stablecoin loans. Opeth is currently not generating any income."
Some of the Most Interesting Yield-Farming Platforms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pgdpdd/some_of_the_most_interesting_yieldfarming/,LeomaDegnan,1,2021-09-02 16:28:35,29,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pgdpdd/some_of_the_most_interesting_yieldfarming/,META,"Yield farming is the popular strategy DeFi users take advantage of to put their cryptocurrencies to work to earn high interest.   

There are multiple types of yield farming projects offering different financial services, mostly to earn astonishingly high interest. Large banks might earn you 0.01% to 0.25% a year, but these sub-percent yields can’t compete with the 20% to 200% earnings some DeFi platforms tout. Often, the higher the interest, the riskier the staking pool is.  

Here are some of the most interesting yield-farms in 2021:  

1) Uniswap: 20-50% APR Uniswap is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) behind Curve Finance by total value locked with more than $5.5 billion in the platform. The platform offers swaps with Ethereum and thousands of ERC-20 tokens and staking in liquidity pools to provide the swaps. Liquidity providers earn a percentage of trading fees for every swap, and with a large enough principle deposited, they earn significant interest. Interest rates on Uniswap and all other DEXes vary by the pool and market fluctuations.  

2) Aave: 0.01-15% APR Aave is the reigning DeFi king in terms of total value locked with a staggering value of over $10 billion, according to [DeFiPulse.com](https://defipulse.com/). Aave is a decentralized platform on Ethereum (and the Polygon sidechain) that offers low-interest cryptocurrency borrowing and lending. Because investors have deposited so much crypto into Aave to earn interest, its borrow APRs are some of the best on the market. Variable borrowing of stablecoins (like DAI, USDC and USDT) range from 3% APR to 7% at the time of writing.   

3) ZooKeeper: 5-58% APR Zookeeper brings a new and interesting farming experience, leading to experience higher mining rewards and richer and more interesting NFT gameplay. ZooKeeper is a brand new project built as a Wanchain Dapp. It is entirely conceived and developed by passionate members of the community with some collaboration from the Wanchain team. ZooKeeper drastically improves the functionality of NFTs by giving them a real use case within their platform. They provide a dual farming experience while embracing the popular crypto trend of NFTs.   

4) PancakeSwap: 8-250% APR PancakeSwap, like Uniswap, is a decentralized exchange (DEX). It functions similarly to Uniswap but is on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network instead of Ethereum and has a few more features focused on gamification. It holds the highest total value locked of all BSC DeFi projects by a mile at about $7 billion. PancakeSwap offers BSC token swaps, interest-earning staking pools, a gambling game where users predict the future price of BNB and even non-fungible token (NFT) art.  

What are some of the other interesting yield-farming projects you've come across?"
"The 'Defi Wars' are on full swing, with Defi currently sitting at an all-time-high valuation of $169B!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pgj5qn/the_defi_wars_are_on_full_swing_with_defi/,M00OSE,1,2021-09-02 22:37:03,9,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pgj5qn/the_defi_wars_are_on_full_swing_with_defi/,FINANCE,"Decentralized finance (Defi) chains are on the move and most developers seem to have identified this September as a make or break point, piling up upgrades after upgrades, each network fiercely competing for their cut of the pie. At times like this it's hard to keep track of the space so here's a run-down of what's happening in Defi.

Total value locked in Defi is currently sitting at an all-time-high of $169B, breaking the previous ATH of $154 set back in May 2021. Since June, Defi added $62M! But this only accounts for 7.5% of all of the money in crypto right now. Here are the major chains to look out for by alphabetic order:

1. **Arbitrum**, a built-in layer 2\* solution for Ethereum, just launched it's public mainnet on August 31, expecting *blue chip* defi dapps like AAVE, Curve, MakerDao, Sushiswap, and Uniswap to integrate soon. One of their partners Huobi, a centralized exchange, also has announced support for direct withdrawals to Arbitrum, which will allow users to circumvent Ethereum's gas fees when moving assets. 
2. **Avalanche** has an ongoing liquidity mining incentive pool worth $180M, seeking to attract users into their network. They recently announced a $15M allocation to Sushiswap and we're still awaiting news on the likes of AAVE and Curve's allocation.
3. **Celo**, a mobile-first defi platform that recently launched, also raised $100M for ""educational initiatives, grants, and incentives,"" with a $34M allocation split between the usual culprits: AAVE, Curve, and Sushiswap. 
4. **Cardano's** *Alonzo Purple* hard for is a public testnet due to launch of September 12, the culmination of more than three years of development. 
5. **Terra Luna's,** a Layer 1 chain known for it's influence on the Korean demographic, *Columbus-5* upgrade will take effect on September 9 and will introduce a similar upgrade to Ethereum's burn mechanism (EIP-1559). For Terra Luna, they will burn all *Seigniorage* or the cost to produce their native token, LUNA, effectively making it a deflationary token.
6. **Optimism,** another built-in Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, recently added a bridge for all ERC-20 tokens, which removes the added step of swapping for users who want to bridge from Ethereum to Optimism. Optimism is one of few chains that was able to pull Uniswap, which is still the king of DEXes, trading $1.5B a day; almost three-time more than it's closest competitor PancakeSwap.
7. **Solana**, one of the fastest Layer 1 chains, just launched *Igntion*, a hackathon with up to $5M in prizes, for developers to add to their budding ecosystem and build more defi, NFTs, and gaming applications. 
8. **Fantom,** a highly scalable Layer 1 launched in 2019, recently announced a $370M incentive program for developers to build on their network. Fantom's TVL is up 48% in the past week, the highest among the networks aged +3 months. 

That's a total of nine networks with major updates over the past month either through incentive programs, which will benefit developers and/or defi users, or mainnet launches. And that's only the *recent* news.

Other chains like Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon are still trodding on and building more and more partnerships along with sleeping giants like Harmony, Tezos, and xDai. And Polkadot isn't even here yet. We're also seeing Dapps integrating on different networks. Sushiswap, for example, is currently building on eight different chains! Ridiculous progress! I'm sure a the chart above will experience some major changes in next few months.

I was wondering what the consensus among this community is on the best and worst exchanges for cryptocurrency beginners, and those new to investing, as well as best ones for those experienced traders in any market  What platforms help ease the user into being comfortable within this environment, and which ones are not foot for beginners, but great for the experienced cryptocurrency pro?

I think Coinbase is 8/10 all around. Haven't had any issues, but I have seen the hate it gets regarding customer service and wait times. Earlier in the year it went down during a pump, some users were'nt able to log on and lost out on gains. Their tracking tools could use some work, but this lackluster approach seems to be pretty ubiquitous among exchanges, plus CB Pro offers a decent API with the ability to increase requests per second, up to 30, for a monthly fee. This isn't a newb feature, but definitely something to learn once comfortable trading in this field of finance.

Any info you would like to add about Coinbase or Coinbase Pro would be helpful, as well as any other exchanges/wallets you feel are  good for beginners and pros. There is a steep learning curve when breaking into this market initially, what platforms make it easier by being intuitive, easy to use, best customer service etc. 

Input is appreciated, discourse is welcomed."

MARKET UPDATE: 10 Year T-Note 1.29% -0.00 Down -0.39%

The 'Big Short' Michael Burry will soon have to close out his TLT puts/expires worthless. LOL

Yields are going to stay lower and for much longer!!!

No economy in today's world can afford higher rates. NONE!

If rates head higher naturally due to supply and demand dynamics, it will be brought right back down artificially by Fed intervention. The Fed can also go out into the longer end of the yield curve. They have many tools at their disposal to combat higher interest rates. The Fed is keeping rates low to help finance America's twin deficits.

'QE forever' will probably still be ON despite the Fed tinkering with its taper plans by end of this year or early next.

Covid/Delta cases and new variants will cause the Fed to reassess their current position.

I say, QE continues unabated.

Short-term rates are expected to stay at or near zero way pass years 2022, 2023 and even out into 2025!

Inflation is truly transitory because of pandemic caused supply chain disruptions, and for a  longer term outlook, inflation will return to 2% or less due to demographic changes (population is aging fast) here in the US, and even in China!

Pandemic related stimulus and unemployment benefits will only last so long, and is limited to the general population. What do ordinary people do when all the ""free money' dries up? Get back to work and/or scale back on spending!!!

We are already seeing signs of consumer confidence deteriorating, economy noticeably slowing into the end of the year. Watch this Friday's jobs report for confirmation. I'm betting hiring has slowed.

And with AI, automation, technology improvements with manufacturing etc, prices will continue to trend lower over time!

All the trillions and trillions of $ dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus will find their way into the stock market, and even in cryptos like Ethereum!

So any market pullbacks/corrections will be mild, and bought right back UP!

'Buy the Dip' has worked since the 2008 financial crisis. Nothing has changed since then! QE is still on and zero/negative real interest rate will be with us into the foreseeable future.

In closing, the only inflation you will see is in housing and healthcare.

What Is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinCarp/comments/pgvpcj/what_is_a_decentralized_exchange_dex/,CoinCarp,1,2021-09-03 10:00:17,0,/r/CoinCarp/comments/pgvpcj/what_is_a_decentralized_exchange_dex/,NaN,"Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are a type of cryptocurrency marketplace that connect crypto sellers and buyers directly, allows for peer-to-peer(P2P) cryptocurrency transactions online and without the need for an intermediary agency. It means you can exchange assets on DEX without having to trust your funds with another entity. These kinds of exchanges have become quite popular in recent years since they align with the fundamental philosophy of blockchain technology--*Decentralization.*

## How Does a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Work?

To realize the decentralization, third-party (e.g. banks, stockbrokers, online payment gateways, government institutions, etc.) which take custody of user funds and oversees the security and transfer of assets are replaced by a blockchain or distributed ledger. Smart contracts were used by DEXs to execute market transactions by allocating transactions' operations to autonomous code, although there are multiple variations of order fulfillment with differing degrees of decentralization. In this way, users remain in control of their private keys when transacting on a DEX platform.

&amp;#x200B;

## How Many Types of Decentralized Exchanges?

Actually, most of the DEXs are semi-decentralized, using their own servers and off-chain order books to store data and external programs or entities for the exchange of user assets. With the degrees of decentralization, there are 3 types of decentralized exchanges.

* On-chain order books: Everything is processed on-chain including modifying and canceling orders. By placing all stages of order onto the blockchain, they go through a time-consuming process of asking every node on the network to permanently store the order via miners, as well as pay a fee.
* Off-chain order books: Off-chain orders are posted elsewhere such as a centralized entity that governs the order book. Through smart contracts, a DEX can provide a framework for parties to manage off-chain order books. Hosts can then access a larger liquidity pool and relay orders between traders. Once the parties are matched, the trade can be executed on-chain. Off-chain order books can provide faster speeds because it takes less congestion and confirmation time.
* Automated market maker (AMM): These platforms typically employ liquidity pool protocols to determine asset pricing. AMMs decentralize this process and allow users to create a market on a blockchain. No counterparty is needed to make a trade, instead of transacting directly with another person, exchange, or market-maker, users trade with smart contracts and provide liquidity.

## What Are the Pros and Cons of Decentralized Exchanges?

Pros：

* Diversity: Many altcoins can be listed on DEXs, where P2P transactions can occur without high trading volumes. This provides a wider opportunity for engagement in digital assets and enhances financial inclusion.
* Privacy: Users aren't typically required to complete KYC and AML procedures when using DEXs.
* Custody: Users don't need to provide private keys.
* Lower Fees: With the use of self-executing smart contracts, DEXs charge a low fee than centralized Exchanges.

Cons:

* Liquidity: Because DEXs are still relatively new, market segregation has a negative impact on market liquidity.
* Lack of support of fiat: Lack of fiat is a barrier to entry for novice users.
* User Experience: It is more complicated to use, compare to centralized exchanges.

## What Are the Differences Between Decentralized Exchanges and Centralized Exchanges?

Although these two types of cryptocurrency exchanges provide a vital source of liquidity to the global cryptocurrency market, facilitating billions of dollars in trading volume on a daily basis, decentralized exchanges operate differently from Centralized exchanges:

## Is Decentralized Exchange Safe?

* There are several possible risks associated with decentralized exchanges, which can be avoided to some extent on centralized exchanges. These include fake tokens with the same ticker as the real coins, high slippage that resulting in buying a token at a price different than the market's average, transaction delays, and lack of trading pair data.
* Also, because of DEXs' non-custodial framework, you will responsible for the custody of your cryptocurrency. However, this comes with the risk that your keys could get lost, stolen, or destroyed, and if no one knows your password, your will lost your assets.
* Operators of decentralized exchanges can face legal consequences from government regulators, they may face the risk of money laundering.

## What Are the Top 10 Decentralized Exchanges?

Based on trading volumes, market share of DeFi markets, there are 10 well-known decentralized exchanges:

What a day. I didn't expect my little DD post from yesterday to catch on, but boy am I happy it did. I also don't think there's any way people reading this are primarily responsible for the trading that happened today.

So what happened yesterday? I think we saw the spring being set. The stock was up 7% at its highest today and landed up only 1.7% at close. BUT, demand for calls has skyrocketed pushing up prices and IV. The $20 calls I was buying this morning for $.15 were trading at $.60 at close. As IV has popped, it's driven up delta increasing the demand for shares to hedge. I really think this is the 1st or 2nd inning, and the real volatility is coming. I can't say if that will definitely be tomorrow, but I sure hope so.

Call volume went through the roof and so did open interest numbers. Boy are they good!

Let's take a look at where things sit today given updated OI, delta, and gamma as of close. Again, I'm pulling data from here: [https://www.cboe.com/delayed\_quotes/irnt/quote\_table](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/irnt/quote_table) It's a real pain to find, and CBOE does not make it easy to navigate to from their home page; however, data sources matter (I almost threw my phone this morning when I saw the OI numbers on Yahoo finance. They were clearly wrong.) 

In the same format as yesterday:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bxh0c7wkkal71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52a607f8c9f9af88610025b33cf4837b92b44831

Total September OI went up 3k, or about 9%. However, delta went up across the board driving demand for share hedging. $12.5s are down, $17.5s and $20s are up big. As available float shrinks, volatility will go up. This isn't an exact science. Market makers will be managing exposure via lots of ways - net call/put ratio, increasing IV to slow call buying and drive selling, but most importantly buying the underlying.

Hedged shares now represent 35% of float instead of 31%, while a gamma change associated with a $1 increase in price has gone from 11% to 10%. That's a significant tightening on float from yesterday even though the gamma sensitivity has fallen.

Regarding IV. IV moving up is flattening the whole curve of ""likely outcomes."" If you imagine calls as representing points on a bell curve, the higher IV the flatter the tails. That means gamma, which is the slope of that curve or ""rate of change,"" falls. I still think this is positive, because it locks up a larger base number of shares regardless of what happens to the underlying.   

I'm not done, but I'm hitting send because the price is taking off and I need to watch my position. Good luck everyone!"

# The Truth About Impermanent Loss and Common Misunderstandings

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xouubqxapcl71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60f8e0d672054fbce6c313d768adf51bc88e07ef

 

Impermanent Loss…the dreaded term. You’ve heard about it, you’ve read about it, but do you really understand it? In this article, we senior alpacas will give our take on the subject that haunts all yield farmers. So put on your reading glasses and let’s explore IL together.

# 📉What is Impermanent Loss?

&gt;Impermanent loss(IL) occurs as a result of asset rebalancing by the Automated Market Maker(AMM) as prices of the assets(tokens) in an LP position diverge from their starting ratio to each other. IL is the equity loss of an asset in an LP when compared to simply holding said asset by itself.

Still doesn’t mean anything? Don’t worry. let’s walk through a simple example together so this definition becomes clearer to you.

Let’s assume Alice has **10 BNB and 3,200 BUSD,** and decides to provide liquidity in the BNB-BUSD LP pool. For simplicity, we will assume 1 BNB = 320 BUSD so her assets are in an exact 50:50 ratio, which is necessary for the LP.

&gt;*t= 0 (time period = 0, starting time)*  
*Alice’s assets = 10 BNB + 3,200 BUSD =* ***6,400 BUSD worth***

Some time passes and BNB price has gone up by 25% to 1 BNB = 400 BUSD. Because her assets were in the LP pool during this price movement, they were re-balanced to maintain the 50:50 ratio of BNB:BUSD. Thus, her assets in the pool became:

&gt;***Farming in LP***  
*t=1*  
*Alice’s assets = 8.94 BNB + 3,577.71 BUSD =* ***7,155.42 BUSD worth***

*(8.94 \* 400 = 3,577.71 \* 1)*

So overall, Alice has made a profit of 7,155.42 — 6,400 BUSD = **755.42 BUSD**

Profits are always nice, but why do some people complain about Impermanent Loss in this type of scenario? Where is the loss? Well, let’s compare this to what would have happened if Alice hadn’t put her assets into the LP pool but rather held them in her wallet from t=0 to t=1.

&gt;***Held in Wallet***  
*t=1*  
*Alice’s assets = 10 BNB + 3,200 BUSD =* ***7,200 BUSD worth***

So by being in an LP position, Alice’s loss was 44.58 BUSD, 0.62% worse off than if she had just held the assets. **This difference of 44.58 BUSD is an example of Impermanent Loss.**

You may have seen a chart like the one below that shows the effect of Impermanent Loss as price moves away from your entry. At first, the chart might seem terrifying, with a steep curve to the left going all the way down to -100%! However, upon closer inspection, we would argue that IL is no different than other types of investment risks where if you have a proper understanding of the risk and a sound game plan, you can mitigate any potential losses and bring this risk well within acceptable boundaries.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8xd0y5udpcl71.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94ebdac04b804bebd243b25d0b7305aeeb18a10f

 Let us zoom in a bit on the IL chart and only consider the price range near your entry point(chart below). The slope in this region is quite gentle. In fact, **Impermanent Loss remains &lt; 2% as long as the relative prices of the asset in your LP pair stay within 50% of your entry!** In other words, IL is actually not a big factor in the short-term, or even medium-term with less volatile tokens. It’s something to be aware of, but not necessarily something to be feared, as long as you have a good understanding of it. We’ll help you with that now.

# 🤔Is Impermanent Loss really a loss?

One common suggestion we see time and time again in articles is for users NOT to remove their LP positions, to avoid the Impermanent Loss becoming permanent.

&gt;“Wait until the exchange rate returns to the initial rate before removing your LP position.”

**However, this suggestion is misleading.** This saying is no different than stock traders saying, “It’s not a loss until you sell.” In reality, there is nothing magical about an LP position that would make the loss more “impermanent” than if you were holding a stock that has gone down in price since you bought. In both scenarios, the price would have to move back to your entry point for the loss be to erased.

As proof that removing liquidity in an LP does nothing to affect Impermanent Loss, imagine the following scenario. If the prices of the assets in your LP position shifted and you accrued some Impermanent Loss, you can remove liquidity from your LP position. This is what the authors of the aforementioned quote would advise you not to do, implying the loss would become permanent.

However, if you were to remove liquidity from your LP, you could then add that liquidity right back in the same ratio of tokens, and find yourself in the exact same position you were in before you removed liquidity. Relative to your earlier entry prices, your Impermanent Loss would be the same. If prices of the assets returned to where they were at your first entry, your Impermanent Loss would become 0. How is that possible if by removing liquidity, your Impermanent Loss became permanent? **The answer is it’s not.**

What’s more is that if you removed liquidity and held the tokens outside of an LP, and then their prices returned to where they were at your first entry, you would have actually earned more than the “recovered Impermanent Loss.” That’s why Impermanent Loss is actually a misnomer, and there are other, better frameworks by which you can look at the concept.

# 💡Other ways to look at Impermanent Loss

We propose alternative ways to look at Impermanent Loss which shed light on ways in which you can use IL to your advantage.

## What is actually happening during AMM asset rebalancing?

Asset rebalancing is the cause of Impermanent Loss, but how does asset rebalancing work? The truth is much simpler than you might think. Let’s say you have an LP pair of BTC-BNB at a starting ratio of 50:50 at entry. The actual prices of the assets are not important when considering asset rebalancing, only their relative price to each other. So instead of 50:50, let’s simplify the ratio to 1:1.

If BTC price rises 10% more relative to BNB price, then 1.1:1 becomes the new ratio before asset rebalancing. Now, the AMM needs to rebalance this into 1:1, so how does it do that? Simple: it sells BTC and buys more BNB, until the value ratio becomes 1:1. As BTC price continues to rise relative to BNB, the AMM continues selling BTC and buying BNB. When the price of BTC moves back down relative to BNB, the AMM does the opposite; it sells BNB and buys BTC.

Traders may be thinking to themselves that this looks familiar, and that’s for a good reason. This is similar to a strategy often used by traders called dollar cost averaging(DCA, or averaging). In essence, what the AMM is doing is a DCA on your tokens.

When the price of BTC rises relative to BNB, as in the example given before, the AMM is DCA selling out of your BTC position. As BTC’s relative price drops, the AMM is DCA buying, increasing your BTC position. Now, with that clear, another question surfaces: since this is a strategy traders often use, then can you utilize an AMM’s asset rebalancing as a trading strategy? The answer is yes!

## Dollar-cost averaging accumulation

Suppose your goal is to accumulate BTC and you would be happy to buy more of it if the price went down because you think its price will rise in the long run and believe crypto is the future of finance(who doesn’t 😎). Instead of holding cash and setting buy orders at lower prices, another way to achieve this goal is to simply provide liquidity to a BTC-stablecoin LP pair. Because of the asset rebalancing that happens in the LP pool, your position would accumulate more BTC automatically as BTC price moves down! Your LP position, through the AMM’s algorithm, would perform dollar cost averaging, buying BTC at lower prices for you!

It’s true that your average buying cost would not be as good as catching the bottom. However, if we’re honest, how many of us truly manage to catch the bottom every time? 😅

Doing this through LP’ing can be seen as an automated strategy that executes while you’re sleeping, and it will avoid having to do guesswork on where the bottom might be. Most importantly, you’ll be earning yields the entire time! That’s why yield farming in LP positions is a great strategy for new to moderate traders with a long-term investment horizon!

As a supplement to this strategy, we’d also like to flip another concept on its head by suggesting that if you believe the price has bottomed, you‘d be better off exiting the LP and taking the “Impermanent Loss,” because you would benefit more as BTC’s price later rose!

Let’s walk through an example of how this would work:

**Example:**

Bob has **1 BTC and 40k BUSD** in hand and decides to provide liquidity in the BTC-BUSD LP pool. For simplicity, we will assume 1 BTC = 40k BUSD at the time so his assets are in the exact 50:50 ratio for providing LP.

&gt;*t= 0*  
*Bob’s assets = 1 BTC + 40,000 BUSD = 80,000* *BUSD worth*

Some time passes and BTC price has dropped to 30k BUSD.

&gt;*t = 1*  
*Bob’s assets = 1.15 BTC + 34,641 BUSD = 69,282 BUSD worth*

Bob believes that 30k is a strong support for BTC and likely the bottom. He thinks price will go up from here so he decides **to withdraw his LP.** Now, he receives back 1.15 BTC + 34,641 BUSD in his wallet.

Moving forward, let’s say Bob was correct and the price subsequently rose back to its starting price of 40k.

&gt;*t=3*  
*Bob’s assets =1.15 BTC + 34,641 BUSD = 80,641 BUSD worth*

By withdrawing his LP when BTC was at 30k BUSD, Bob didn’t get exposed to asset rebalancing which would have sold back some of his BTC into BUSD as BTC’s price went back up. This resulted in him earning an extra **641 BUSD vs. where he started (not counting yields).** As Bob became more confident in his future price prediction, he was able to make a relative profit by exiting his LP and shifting to simple holding.

## Dollar cost averaging distribution

The following is the inverse of the above example. Suppose you are happy to partially take profits on a crypto asset when the price moves up. In this scenario, you can put some into an LP position. As the price rises, you will automatically dollar-cost-average sell your position through the AMM’s algorithm.

Similarly, if you think the price has topped, you can remove your LP and sell your tokens, to avoid the AMM buying them back as price moves down. If you wanted, you could then reenter at a lower price. Or, by using Alpaca, you could open a [short position](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/alpaca-academy/lesson-1-alpaca-finances-unique-use-case-shorting-at-a-profit)!

## Betting on a sideways market, or uncertain market bias

As illustrated in the previous two sub-sections, LP’ing can be very useful for helping you hedge into and out of positions, to reduce risk when you don’t have certainty on market direction. For most that are not full-time professional traders, isn’t this usually the case? In reality, this is true even for professional traders, of whom many are correct on market direction only 55% of the time.

So although many of us are bullish on crypto and various assets, we don’t know if that inevitable breakout will happen in 1 month, 1 year, or 5 years. If it’s a longer period and we hold these assets in our wallets, we’d be missing out on a whole lot of potential interest that we could’ve earned if we participated in yield farming at a protocol like Alpaca!

That’s why you can also see **LP’ing as a hedge against market timing!** Even in the unfavorable scenario, if the breakout happens in a short time and you have some impermanent loss, the yields you earn can still make up for that!

Let’s examine the above circumstances in more detail. Traditionally, when you’re investing in a market, you would take the following actions:

If you’re bullish on a market or asset, you can buy it aka take a long position.

If you’re bearish on a market or asset, you can sell it aka take a short position.

But what if you’re uncertain? Should you just sit out with cash in the bank that’s earning close to 0 interest?

Or what if you think the market is in a period of rest? That it needs to consolidate for a while before a major up or down movement can occur, as often is the case in markets after periods of high volatility. After all, anyone who has traded for a while knows that markets can consolidate for long periods of time.

**In a scenario of consolidation or uncertainty, a good investment strategy is deploying assets into an LP position.** An LP position earns yields even if prices don’t move. Due to the DCA effect when an asset’s price goes up or down, you also have a hedge to the asset in both directions.

In this case, one example of a strategy you could use is simple LP’ing, such as opening an [**auto-compounding LP position without leverage**](https://medium.com/alpaca-finance/profiting-with-alpaca-strategy-2-hold-a-token-pair-to-earn-auto-compounded-yields-without-b989c7fb4bdb?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------). If you wanted to earn greater yields, you could use leverage and open a [**2x position, borrowing a crypto asset at neutral**](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/alpaca-academy/lesson-2-hedging-with-double-sided-borrowing), or take greater leverage on a long or [**short position**](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/alpaca-academy/lesson-1-alpaca-finances-unique-use-case-shorting-at-a-profit) with an asset of your choice. You could even open a [**hedged neutral position**](https://medium.com/leverage-farming-with-alpaca/pseudo-delta-neutral-with-alpaca-4df49289e167) if you wanted extra risk mitigation, which would be easier to manage if asset prices didn’t move much.

The point is that **almost any LP strategy will be profitable in a sideways market**, much more profitable than a standard long or short due to earning yields, and you could further customize the type of strategy based on your risk tolerance and desired APYs using [**Alpaca**](http://alpacafinance.org/). So whatever you decide to do, just know that as soon as you step onto the farm, you can be sure it’ll be all green as far as your eyes can see.

We hope this article shed some light on the topic of Impermanent Loss and how if you look at it through the lens of dollar cost averaging/hedging, it could turn into a tool that works in your favor, rather than something to be feared.

Thanks for joining us and that’ll be all for today, young alpacas. If you want to read more articles like this, don’t forget to check out our [Alpaca Academy](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/alpaca-academy). Happy farming!"

Defi Launches SIL.Finance ( Sister - In - Law ),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/pietpi/defi_launches_silfinance_sister_in_law/,SuddenBus1974,1,2021-09-05 23:11:21,8,/r/CryptoMars/comments/pietpi/defi_launches_silfinance_sister_in_law/,NEWS,"The recent exponential rise of the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors has astounded everyone in and around the industry.

What is SIL (Sister in Law)?
SIL.Finance is a smart contract-based decentralized automatic investment platform that focuses on providing consumers with DeFi Financial Management services. More specifically, it's an open-sourced, single-sided yield aggregator (1 click hedging) with perfectly functioning #NFT farming card add-ons, or more explicitly, it's Tradeable on PancakeSwap. As a result, the SIL Token is our native governance token, with a total supply of 30000 $SIL across all networks and no pre-allocation. Smart contracts in the ERC-20 and BEP-20 formats are supported.


Why SIL (or, more importantly, what value does it add to the DeFi space)?

One of the most risks offered by AMM swapping in recent years is Impermanent Loss/Gain, an intrinsic learning curve that most users would experience while delivering liquidity to any automated market maker (AMM) swaps. SIL addresses two major essential concerns: impermanent loss and capital utilization. Individual Volatility (Yield) or Shared Volatility (Yield) (Hedging).

SIL launched a smart contract-based matching engine to mitigate volatility bias, providing a further alternative for current LP miners employing only a single-side token. That's incredible, because you don't have to worry about impermanent losses or capital utilization with SIL.

1. Dual-token liquidity for variable swaps, 
2. Automatic LP matching, and 
3. Automatic compound interests are some of the services provided by SIL.

Factors that SIL deems to be in the user's best interests
1. The annualized rate of return, 
2. The safety factor, and 
3. The financial management cycle are all factors to consider.

SIL uses the activities in line above to effectively select and customize solutions that best fit clients' requirements, enabling enhanced liquidity mining effortless. In the DeFi space, the SIL's concept is unique: its single-sided feature is fully provided by users, and the product provides the community with all possible alternatives, making it significantly more open than comparable solutions.

Mining is also supported on SIL, and mining profits are shared evenly to all users; 
No intermediate or main commission expenses will be incurred. It's reasonable and equitable. A cutting-edge platform built by crypto enthusiasts from all around the world, with all SIL holders sharing management of the network (community).

SIL architecture
1. SIL Master, 
2. MatchPair and
3.  StakeGatling.


A closer look of each feature;
1. SIL Master is the entry management contract, processing transactions and the distribution of SIL Token. 
2.  MatchPair is responsible for matching. This also ensures that users with priority recharge are in a relatively safe queue position.
3. StakeGatling is responsible for collateralizing the matched LP to the mining contract, but then, according to the configuration strategy, it will automatically roll out the profit, CLAIM income, and convert CLAIM income into LP through Swap/Mint, as well as re-mortgage to obtain income to ensure the maximum benefit.

SIL features ;
1.LP Grouping: Similar concept to the DeFi “Vault”.
2. Compound interest mechanism 
3. Multiple Gain 

SIL Products 
1. Hedging
2. Yield
3. xSIL (Single Token Yield) 
4. NFT (SIL token can be used to buy unique NFTs to boost your mining efficiency)


SIL's product also has no transaction fees, however clients must pay the blockchain transaction cost, which fluctuates depending on which blockchain is used.

What I think is the root behind why America is crazy now and a possible solution,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/pin9hj/what_i_think_is_the_root_behind_why_america_is/,FinancialSubstance16,1,2021-09-06 06:56:52,14,/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/pin9hj/what_i_think_is_the_root_behind_why_america_is/,NaN,"As you probably know, politics in the US is getting crazy and it keeps on getting crazier. In fact, the country is probably as polarized now as it was during the reconstruction era. How did it get like this?

I think a case can be made that it's caused by structural factors. I go more into detail in the other answer. To sum it up, people expect to be able to start a family and live well. If they can't do that for whatever reason, they become discontent.

One thing that annoys me about out of touch boomers is when they say that young people should be grateful that they have internet. While it is true that we have more fancy gadgets than people half a century ago, it was accompanied by the rising costs of healthcare and college tuition as well as rising inequality. You don't see people protesting over low quality televisions or not having internet, you do see those things with high unemployment, bad healthcare, and people all the sudden being unable to afford anything.

Ultimately, societal stability revolves moreso around expectations than around raw living standards. There weren't revolutions in the medieval times over the lack of internet.

Economists point to what's called creative destruction in reference to disruptive industries. This is when a new way of doing things completely overturns the old way. Current examples include email, online retail, and automation. Previous examples include automobiles, airplanes, grocery stores (as opposed to farmers markets), and factories. Disruptive innovation dates all the way back to the printing press. However, disruptive innovation on a massive scale didn't begin until the industrial revolution. Many people say that there are four industrial revolutions but I prefer to break them up into two with two parts each. We are currently near the end of part 1 of the second technological revolution. The problems that we are dealing with are somewhat similar to the issues faced by people during the industrial revolution.

For some context, British lands had gone through a process called enclosure over the course of centuries. This was when lands were seized by the government and handed to private landowners. For awhile, agricultural laborers were still needed to grow crops. That all changed with the industrial revolution. One of the biggest societal changes was caused by the mechanization of agriculture. This meant that fewer people were needed to grow the same number of crops. As people were laid off, they had to leave the lands that their ancestors had decided on for centuries and make their way to cities to find work. In all fairness, there were plenty of jobs in cities from the need to make these machines in the first place. The IR also made many products cheaper to produce such as textiles, glass, and paper. The increased demand for these products propelled economic growth. But this was still a very hard time for society. A group known as the Luddites formed in opposition to textile machinery. You see, weaving took quite a bit of skill which made it a well paying job. However, the machines could be operated with much less skill, putting weavers out of business and paying new workers less. British workers actually did make more money than before the 19th century but cost of living went up. Due to the rapid population growth in cities, housing construction could not keep up with demand, so many low income British had to reside in shantytowns. These cities were often very dirty with all of the animals on the streets, pollution in the air, and waste in bodies of water.

Another societal change was caused by a decrease in child mortality rates. For most of history, the average fertility rate was 4-7 children per woman (depending on how much land was available). However, diseases such as smallpox frequently killed people at a young age, preventing them from having children of their own. The result was often linear population growth as only about 2-3 children would make it to adulthood. Two things changed that. The first was the British Agricultural revolution which allowed for more food per person. The second was the decline in mortality from diseases. The second was the establishment of modern healthcare. The result was that people were much more likely to survive childhood, allowing them to have children of their own. The result was a population explosion. In 1700, England's population was 5.2 million. In 1801, it was just shy of 8.3 million. Just half a century later, it was 16.7 million. Although food production was becoming more efficient, population growth kept food prices high (though the corn laws didn't help matters either). And as stated before, it was the most pronounced in the cities. Because of all of these factors, it was a landlord's market.

Part 1 of the industrial revolution introduced mechanization which revealed the potential to disrupt every single industry and increase production. Despite this, real wages in Britain only increased by 15% from 1780 to 1850. This was likely due to bargaining favoring business owners. If you're in the working class, you need a job or else you starve. Your employer needs you to work but he doesn't need you in particular. The scale typically depends on the labor supply. If there's a labor shortage, the scale will tip moreso in favor of the workers. However, employers can deal with a slight labor shortage by reducing production. Employees absolutely need a job. This discrepancy favors employers. Labor unions changed that by introducing collective bargaining. This meant that if the workers weren't getting their way, they could go on strike. In the early 19th century, the labor union was often repressed by the state. Destroying machines (which is what Luddites did) was a capital offense and until 1824, it was illegal to be part of a union.

The US had much fewer social pressures because land was in abundance. In contrast to Britain where the government took land from commoners through the enclosure acts, the US granted access to commoners through the homestead acts. Because of this, real wages were higher in the US than in Britain. However, following the era of good feelings in the 1820s, social pressures began to mount, not because of the lack of land but rather because cash crops such as cotton and tobacco crowded out edible crops such as grain. The effect was a decline in stature of Americans (due to inferior nutrition) known as the Antebellum Puzzle. This occurred because the cotton gin as well as other basic machines from part 1 of the IR began to manifest in the US. Cotton was then sold to the industrializing European countries where demand for textiles was rising.

1870 was when part 2 of the IR began. It saw the rise of standardization and the Bessemer process which made steel easier to produce. They were mundane on their own but they disrupted the economy in every conceivable way. Standardization meant that replacements were interchangeable, making repairs much easier. The Bessemer process made steel much cheaper, allowing for larger bridges, better ships, taller buildings, and railways. Accompanying this was electricity and industrial chemicals. The result of all of this was a rise in living standards unparalleled at any point in prior history. Part 1 laid the groundwork while part 2 revolutionized every aspect of life.

This time in the US was marked by an era called the Gilded Age, lasting from the end of Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century. This time was one of strong economic growth, perhaps the best economy in American history. Accompanying it was a wave of immigration, primarily from Europe. At the same time, there was a growing upper class. The US was urbanizing, especially in the Northeast. And with it came all of the social pressures of living in a city. By 1890, the US was running out of land. The only land left was in the west which was arid and mountainy. The railroad had enabled large corporations to exists which benefitted from economies of scale but also had more leverage on the economy. By the start of the 20th century, a few companies became very powerful such as Standard Oil, Vanderbilt's railroads, Carnegie Steel, and American Tobacco Company. All of this led to the Progressive Movement which sought to deal with corruption and increase state involvement in the economy. However, by the 1920s, although the progressives made some progress (founding the FDA, establishing national parks, and breaking up Standard Oil), the movement had lost its steam. The red scare really helped scare people from looking to government for answers. Another thing that happened was a 1920 law which stemmed the flow of immigration. It didn't prohibit immigration but it limited the number of immigrants to 2% of the existing population from each nation (for example, 10,000 Italian immigrants would mean that 200 are allowed in for the year).

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, Russia was industrializing. Modernization dates back to Peter the Great in the late 17th, early 18th centuries. However, industrialization didn't really begin until the mid 19th century. This was when Tsar Alexander II abolished feudalism. This sent the newly freed peasants to the cities for industrial work. Once that happened Russians pretty much endured the same social pressures that British endured 75 years prior. Alexander II was assassinated by the Narodnaya Volya, a far left terrorist group. This would only foreshadow what would later come. As you all know, Russia eventually became a Communist state. You may have heard that the unpopularity of WW1 catapulted the Bolsheviks into the spotlight but this was merely the catalyst. Everything that built up to it helped pave the way for the Bolsheviks to take over.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the west, the roaring twenties paved way for the great depression which led to high levels of unemployment. People were looking for any solution, any solution. The US which had previously been mostly lazzes faire gave way to more progressive policies as the same happened elsewhere. Germany was much more interesting. To understand the historical context, Germany was a constitutional monarchy. Near the end of WW1, there were growing pressures due to the war and the Kaiser tightening his grip. In 1918, there was an uprising from the labor movement and socialists. To make a long story short, Germany became a liberal state instead of a socialist one. As you might of heard in history class, one of the underlying factors for Hitler's rise to power was the humiliation at the end of the war. Germany had to pay 133 billion German marks ($450.45 billion 2021 dollars) in reparations for the war. Germany was forced to disarm which meant being relegated to a light military (100,000) and was prohibited from having an air force. And lastly, some territory got ceded to other countries with the prohibition of merging with Austria. I think what's certainly the most telling about what catapulted the Nazi Party into power is the numbers. In the 1928 election, the National Socialist German Workers Party had just 12 seats. In the 1930 election, it had 107.

&amp;#x200B;

And we all know what happened afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

After WW2 was over, the economies in the west plus Japan were thriving. With a strong middle class and a good economy, social well being was strong, thanks to strong unions which ensured that workers were being paid well.

&amp;#x200B;

The post war boom was caused by a few factors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pent up demand from the GD and second world war. People were ready to buy consumer goods as soon as the war economy transitioned into a normal one

2. Better wages allowed people to afford more, increasing demand

3. National policy made home mortgages really easy to obtain, spurring suburbanization.

4. Family farms began to get outcompeted by large scale commercial farms. While tragic for the family farms, it was a more efficient method of agriculture and the farmers who lost their jobs obviously had to get different jobs, usually in the cities.

5. The television was beginning to make its way into American homes

&amp;#x200B;

In the aftermath of the war, a fixed exchange system called the Bretton Woods System was established. The top income tax rate was 94% on income above $2.5 million in today's money. By the early 70s, the Bretton Woods System was proving to be unsustainable. In 1971, Nixon abruptly pulled the US out of the system in an event known as the Nixon Shock. By 1973, the system was completely dissolved. Another thing that happened in 1973 was the oil embargo. Although the embargo eventually ended, the age of cheap oil had ended as well. The result was an end to the post war boom.

Although the recession ended in 1975, unemployment would not drop below 6% until 1979. The fed responded to the recession by increasing inflation rates which did not reduce unemployment. This went counter to the Phillips Curve which states that there's an inverse correlation between inflation and unemployment. This undermined trust in government intervention for politicians and the general public. This led to lowering taxes (the top bracket had already been lowered to 70% though) and deregulation. The deregulation primarily affected three sectors: communication, transportation, and finance.

This was around the time that real wages became uncoupled from productivity. There were a few underlying factors

&amp;#x200B;

1. Labor union participation hit an all time high in the early 50s when a third of American workers were part of a union.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The post war boom marked the peak of American dominance in the economy. The period from the 18th century to the mid 20th century was one where western civilization rose above the rest of the world. In the 60s, aside from Japan and a few Latin American countries, the world outside the west was fairly backwater. From the 70s onwards, some of these countries began to catch up. The first to do so were the four asian tigers followed by China when it started opening up. These countries didn't have much to offer, so they offered cheap labor. The result was that American firms began outsourcing production to those countries. Eventually, those countries began production of their own and competing with American firms (Japan was relatively developed but Japanese companies like Toyota were providing serious competition with American companies). The result was that demand for American workers in manufacturing went down. Automation also reduced the need for manual labor. The result was an increased emphasis on the service sector (which tbf is dominant in almost every developed country). The thing with the service sector is that it's split into two categories: high skill and low skill. Secondary sector jobs tend to be mid skill which means that a fair amount of on-the-job training is required or maybe it's a vocational job. High skill jobs require college degrees, putting them out of reach of most Americans. Low skill jobs require minimal training but don't pay much. This change reduced the welfare of many Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The increased labor force participation from women has had its ramifications. More women working means more workers which is good for the economy. However, it has also brought with it a set of challenges, mainly revolving around who will care for the children when both parents are working. The obvious solution is childcare but that can be quite expensive. And people wonder why the US is stuck with sub fertility rates. This doesn't even touch on single parent households which only have one source of income.

&amp;#x200B;

These factors have helped lead us to today. We are currently in part 1 of the IT revolution. In my opinion, the 2008 financial crisis was the catalyst for the current wave of populism, both for the right and for the left. Coal mining and manufacturing once provided stable middle class union jobs but are becoming increasingly scarce. People who did those jobs flocked over to Trump. Millennials are now worse off than their parents despite increased productivity. This causes them to be more favorable towards leftist candidates like Bernie Sanders and AOC. The cause of this trend can stem down to changes in society and in the changing economy.

&amp;#x200B;

You may have seen the graph which shows real wages being decoupled from productivity. But when it's broken up by educational attainment, the root cause becomes clear. People with more education are seeing the gains of economic change in the past few decades. gains for those with less education has been less so. In fact, those without a college education saw their living standards fall since the 70s. The reason why is because they're not the ones growing the economy."

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 2. Good Bad Ugly

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don’t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add.

**TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution."

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don’t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

Beware Of The Concealed Co-Pandemic That Could Kill You. An Unrecognized World-Wide Problem An A Call For Universal Screening Of Vitamin D Deficiency.,https://www.reddit.com/r/PopularMedicine/comments/pizf0i/beware_of_the_concealed_copandemic_that_could/,TYangMD,1,2021-09-06 21:27:46,0,/r/PopularMedicine/comments/pizf0i/beware_of_the_concealed_copandemic_that_could/,NaN,"**Beware Of The (Concealed) Co-Pandemic That Could Kill You**

by Tai F Yang, MD

Now that I got your attention with this purposefully sensationalistic but realistic title, please read on, if you are concerned about the COVID-19 and/or your overall health.

At the very beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in US, around February 2020, when not much was known about this pandemic, I had some information that was deemed crucial and could impact the outcome of the then rising deadly and sinistrous disease.

I believed the information to be too critical and important to be kept for my own selfish glory and self esteem booster, by knowing that I had the advantage of possessing the information and the ideas of how to use that knowledge to improve the outcome of my patients. I wanted to get it out in the hopes of bringing a better outcome in the community. After spending 12 hours on a beautiful Saturday writing a 6 page letter, filled with graphics, references and explanations, including my suggestions on how to act upon the information being presented, I made the mistake of sending it to a few governmental authorities. Not only did the letter get lost in the deep Dark Hole, but also no acknowledgement was received. That’s when I learned a deeply saddening real life lesson: political influence can be so powerful it can supersede the moral, professional and simply humane obligation to do the right thing or act on a crucial information, for the benefit of our peers.

This time I will not make the same mistake. I have another piece of information and ideas/suggestions that could impact the lives of millions, if not billions, but I want to send it out straight to the public. I hope this news media will do its part, and you, if patient enough to finish reading this article, will spread the news.

Ever wonder why some relatively young people, previously healthy, without predisposing conditions, who caught COVID-19 fare much worse than some older ones? Have you heard of a friend or a relative who was diagnosed recently with an auto-immune disorder such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or Lupus, or Multiple Sclerosis, just to mention a few?  The next few paragraphs may explain, at least in some cases, the possible common factor for all the above conditions.

It all converges to an interesting fat-soluble hormone called vitamin D. The active form of vitamin D is the Calciferol, or Vitamin D3. You may have heard of it in bits and pieces of information. To understand my concerns, however, it will be necessary to connect the dots of information you might have and deepen your knowledge, so you can fully grasp the severity of the issue (or so you can show off your knowledge about this issue next time you are drinking with your friends).

Since its discovery in the early 1900’s, a lot of researches have been published. Initially it was studied as the substance that controls the metabolism of calcium and bones. It was the concomitant efforts of researchers from US and England while studying rickets that finally led to the discovery of the chemical structure. For many years Vitamin D was viewed as synonymous to bone health ( prevention of rickets, osteomalacia and improving osteoporosis). For the last decade or so, however, several publications have emerged showing an extremely interesting and exciting new role for this underestimated micronutrient. It is clear now that Vitamin D has another completely independent function in our body by *Modulating* the immune system.

Please note that I used the word **Modulate**. What that means is that it can, at the same time, dampen ***and*** strengthen the immune system. In other words, it works on both ends of the complex immune system by “cooling off” and avoiding excessive activity and by strengthening and building up a complex army of different cells and chemicals, when it feels your body is being attacked by enemies, such as in an infection.

To make a very long story short, let’s go over that briefly.

Our immune system has different functions. On one end it helps us fight an intruder, whether a viral infection, bacterial or another agent. On the other end of the spectrum, it does a continuous surveillance looking for “foreign” antigens (proteins, chemicals, etc), that does not belong in our body. It also detects debris of dead cells and recognizes cancer cells and destroys them. There are three famous superhero cells that work as “Avengers” in our system: B-cells, T-cells and monocytes.

**B cells**: Upon stimulation, produce the famous weapons (antibodies) to fight the enemy.

The B cells differentiates into more mature cells: Plasma Cells, which is the actual producer of antibodies (Immunoglobulins) and Memory Cells. The latter one stores the information from the “enemy” (foreign antigen) and is responsible for the rapid response the next time the same intruder invades our body. Of note, this is the mechanism by which the vaccines work.

**T cells**: Upon stimulation, will differentiate into other functional ready-for-combat cells (Helper cells, Cytotoxic or Killer cells, and Regulatory cells). The Helper cells secrete chemical messengers called cytokines (remember cytokines bursts in Covid-19? The knowledge will start to all connect…). They assist the B cells in their production of antibodies. Cytotoxic cells are the soldiers that do the actual killing (hence, Killer cells). When activated by the cytokines, they bind and kill enemy cells, such as cancer cells, or infected cells.

Finally, there is Regulatory T cells. As the name denotes, their job in this Army is to regulate, or suppress the other T-cells, to turn down or off the cascade of reaction that prompted the attack on the “enemy”. That is how the immune system controls and tells itself to stop the counter attack. Without these cells, the immune system could “overreact” and destroy its own body.

**Monocytes**: they are large lymphocytes that differentiate further into Dendritic cells and Macrophages. They have two distinct functions: patrol the body for microbial cells and orchestrate the immune response during an infection and inflammation.

They are called *Phagocytes*, which means they like to eat the enemy. They are also *Antigen-Presenting Cells*, or in other words they present the intruder to other immune cells to destroy the invader. Pretty much like the Incredible Hulk, crushing, eating and holding up the enemy to the other Avengers to come shoot and kill them.

To make matters more confusing, Dendritic cells and B-cells are also Antigen-Presenting Cells.

So, the purpose of this somewhat complex and confusing illustration is simple. To make a point demonstrating how complex ( beautiful and fascinating, if you ask me) the immune system is, and to show that in our wonderful body, all body parts are connected and interacting continuously and harmoniously all the time. This harmony is called **Homeostasis**.

When the Homeostasis is broken, trouble may start…

That is the case, when some cells in our body decide to grow uncontrollably and without a purpose, such as the case of cancer cells. Luckily enough, we have the immune system doing the surveillance, as exemplified above, which will eliminate these rogue cells. Our immune system does that continuously.

What would happen if the surveillance system fails? That’s correct. People would have a higher chance of developing cancers.

What about if the system fails to control the response? Remember the Regulatory T-cells? They are one of the ways the body modulates the immunity to avoid excessive action. What would happen is an excessive activity of our immune system, which basically means your body is attacking your own tissues. This could lead to an AutoImmune Disorder, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Celiac Disease and Crohns Disease, just to mention a few.

On the other end of the spectrum, if the immune system is too weak or not coordinated and working properly, it could lead to increased chance of infections and/or worse outcomes.

Enter the next super-hero, which is the main reason for this article: **Vitamin D**.

All those immune cells cited above have *receptors* on the cell surface. What that means is that they can interact, or be controlled by the Vitamin D. Think of Vitamin D as the charming and smart Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Without her, Iron Man would be lost. Iron Man (immune cells) may have the ability, willingness and power to destroy the enemy, but without Pepper’s information, instructions and constant updates, he could be killing good citizens (normal cells) and not acting when he should (fighting infections).

My main concern that prompted this article is the lack of widespread knowledge and the truly world wide pandemic scale of vitamin D deficiency. Since vitamin D regulates the immune system, both upwards and downwards, you can image the potential implications of that. That’s right. People will have a higher probability of having cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Combine that with the current COVID-19 pandemic and voila! Perfect recipe for disaster.

**Vitamin D deficiency.** Just how bad is it ? According to a publication by Nair R, 2012 (1), about 50% of the world population have a Vitamin D insufficiency, and 1 billion people have vitamin D deficiency. (Insufficiency= 21-29 ng/mL; Deficiency= less than 20 ng/mL; Normal levels=30-100). It is a major public health problem. The prevalence varies by age, ethnic group and socio-cultural factors. The deficiency is highest in the elderly, overweight patients, nursing home residents, and hospitalized patients. Age and latitude corrected, obese subjects still had a 35% higher rate of deficiency (2). In US 50-60% of hospitalized and nursing home residents have deficiency (3,4).

The deficiency can also be affected by darker skin color (melanin) and coverage of body parts (long clothing). As a comparison, one study published in 2015 where they analyzed more than a 100 articles, showed that about 50% of US infants are deficient in Vitamin D while more than 90% of infants from India, Iran and Turkey are deficient. In the adult population overall 35% of US people are deficient while over 80% of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh adults are deficient (5). Being of asian descent, I can attest to the cultural factor causing vitamin D deficiency. Most asian women I know, including my family circle, are afraid of and hide from the sun more fiercely than the vampires.

Please note that the same population that has less vitamin D is the same that is most susceptible to COVID-19, namely nursing home residents and hospitalized patients!

Also realize that the above epidemiological studies, although recent, were all conducted before Covid-19. My suspicion is that the actual percentage of people all over the world with vitamin D deficiency is much higher now due to social isolation leading to decreased sun exposure.

**How concerned should I be?** The combination of COVID-19 pandemic and the vitamin D pandemic is a perfect mix for the perfect disaster. There is only so much we can do to bring down the curve again. The Delta variant is the proof that this pandemic is going to behave like a roller coaster ride, up and down in cyclic manner, and the spread of the disease is not going to stop until most people are:     
a) vaccinated, b) dead, or c) get sick, survives and become immune (temporarily) to the SARSCoV-2.

You can only fit in one of the three categories. There is no magic bullet. Make your pick, or let “luck” do it for you.

The reason I believe this roller coaster ride is not going to change (unless vaccination rates improve) and furthermore believe that another new variant will be here before the end of the year is because the SARSCoV-2 mutates every 11-15 days! Last time I checked there were more than 12,700 mutations.

The only other variable we can change in this battle against the virus, besides what has been promulgated extensively, such as taking the shot, mask, etc, is to try to maintain as good health as possible, and fix the possible problems to the best of our ability. Being aware of the vitamin D Pandemic and how to fix it is a good start and most crucial step at this time in history, in my opinion.

**What to do?**

***Step 1***\*\*.\*\*

The very first thing to ask is: when was the last time you had a well check with your doctor? Go do a check up with your primary doctor and request, among all the other regular tests that we usually do annually, to add vitamin D levels.

***Step 2***.

If your levels are low, there are a few ways of fixing it.

1. By sun exposure;
2. By vitamin D3 supplement. The recommended dose is 2,000 to 6,000 IU (International Units) per day. You should recheck the levels again in about 2 months.
3. Do both, and while you are at it, enjoy the process, such as jogging outdoors, water sports, walking at the beach in a sunny day, etc.
4. By eating more vegetables ( improves your overall health) and especially the ones with higher content of vitamin D, such as mushrooms exposed to sunlight (portobello mushroom). Also rich in vitamin D: Cod liver oil, trout, salmon, fortified milk, fortified cereals, sardines and egg.

**Comments.** Diet alone is unlikely to provide enough vitamin D, as you can tell by the short list above. Other than taking indefinitely pills of supplement, the other natural way should be by having enough sun exposure. Let’s have a few words on that, before my dermatologist colleagues start screaming and jumping up and down from their chairs accusing me of predisposing the world population to skin cancer.

There are two ways of putting this concern to rest.

*1. Scientifically.* When your skin is exposed to the sun, it produces a precursor of vitamin D. This precursor has to pass through two organs before it becomes fully active. First the liver and then the kidneys. The production of vitamin D comprises 50-90 % of the total amount in the body. You only need 20 minutes in the sun per day and 40% of body skin exposure (6). Also use a little common sense: do it when there is not too much UV. Before 10 AM or after 4 PM, depending on where you are (Florida or Maine) and time of the year. Darker people may need more exposure, since melanin blocks the ultra violet B light (UV-B), which is the light responsible for inducing skin production of vitamin D.

Other fun and important factors: house windows and car glasses block the UV-B, so being indoors or inside a car with windows up won’t help, even if there is light hitting you. Older people, unfortunately also produce less vitamin D through the skin, and since they also have a higher probability of skin cancer, my suggestion is for you to just give grandpa or grandma her vitamin D pills and take him/her to the park for a walk whenever possible.

2. *Common sense, logical thinking.* If you believe in God, think of this: why would God make the sun just to kill us by causing skin cancer? It has to have a function and benefit. If you are an atheist, this is the reasoning: everything in nature has a purpose and all elements in nature are interconnected somehow and affect one another. Sun provides energy for the plants to produce photosynthesis without which life on Earth would not exist. Sun cannot be only a bad thing. Even good things can kill you. Take for instance water. It is one of the most essential elements for all creatures to survive, and yet in excess it can kill you ( a drowning person can die from excessive ingestion of water causing brain edema and death, after he/she is rescued!).

**The other side of the coin.** Despite several studies correlating low vitamin D levels and increase incidence of cancers (7,8,9,10), there are a few studies that did not show correlation of low vitamin D and some specific types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer (11,12,13 ). In trying to sort this out, some recent large analytical studies using meta-analysis have been conducted, but the comparison is problematic, due to different methodologies of different publications. The results are either inconclusive or not strong enough to allow the The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to proclaim definitive guidelines recommending universal screening of all asymptomatic patients (14).

Similar situation occurred with cardiovascular disease, MS, Depression and DiabetesType 2. Even though observational studies of large population showed correlation with vitamin D and above conditions, clinical trials provided little evidence of benefits of vitamin D.(15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24).

My take on this “inconclusive” or “insufficient evidence” to correlate Vitamin D and the above conditions is the difference in the designs, besides the fact that the observational studies usually involve thousands of subjects, while the clinical, prospective trials usually involves only a few hundred.

“Lack of strong evidence” does not mean it is not accurate; it just means that at the moment in time, we, scientists, with our current knowledge and technology, do not have enough capability to sort it out yet.

**Final words/ Suggestions.**

1. Due to the fact that no study has looked at whether universal screening of vitamin D deficiency can improve the overall health of the population (26), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) statement is that there is “ insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults”. That recommendation, however, was drawn in 2015, well before COVID-19 (27).
2. In times of *quasi* despair, when people are dying, hospitals are at full capacity and the curve of COVID-19 is showing exponential pattern again, anything possible to keep us healthier, especially at low cost and with simple fix, should be attempted.
3. My suggestion is that we should start checking vitamin D levels of every single patient who comes in for well check, or whenever possible. Being in the Sunshine State, one would never imagine that kids would have Vitamin D deficiency. I have been checking the levels on my patients for about a year now, and to my shock and disbelief, of the hundreds of tests ordered, only 4 have come back normal! If my population of patients is representative of the general population, that would imply that at least more than 95% of kids in Florida now has vitamin D deficiency/ insufficiency! One can only imagine the Northern States!
4. If you, the reader, are the nurse that sits behind a desk and makes decisions on what tests and medications we doctors can and cannot order (aka: case manager), hear me out: the test to check vitamin D levels costs U$ 50. The cost of an admission for a COVID patient ranges from $51,000 to $78,000.(Health Care Finance News, Nov. 2020). My prediction is that it will go up due to more availability and options of medications and potential for increased survival rates and thus, increased length of stay over time.
5. One word of caution: Vitamin D, together with A, E and K are all lipo-soluble (fat soluble) vitamins. They can accumulate in our body and could build up to toxic levels. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Excessive vitamin D and hypercalcemia (excessive calcium in the blood) can cause , among other symptoms, damage to the kidneys such as kidney stones. In extreme cases, it can even cause kidney failure, calcium deposit in the heart leading to cardiac arrhythmia and even death. There are also cases described of accidental excessive contents of vitamin D in the nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, there were also cases of incorrectly prescribed vitamin D by physicians (29, 30).
6. Last but not least, even if part or all of my arguments are incorrect, just by bringing awareness to this issue, readers will develop a subliminal desire to pay more attention to their overall health and who knows, maybe even avoid a disease or two…It’s been forty years since I read George Orwell’s “1984” book, but the one statement that I never forget reads along these lines: “even if the whole world is against you, it still doesn’t mean you are wrong…”.

Your guide to earning passive income with Crypto - DeFi the right way.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pjl8mh/your_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with_crypto/,Nexion21,1,2021-09-07 19:30:52,134,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pjl8mh/your_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with_crypto/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"Ladies and gentlemen,

 
I am here today because of the post made by /u/thechadley [Using Cryptos to Earn Passive Income]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using_cryptos_to_earn_passive_income_my/). They have an excellent post on all the different options of passive income from crypto, and I wish to expand upon that post with concrete examples. Specifically, I will be focusing on Yield Farming in this post and Prestaking/Prefarming in the next post.

This post will be two parts, Blue Chip and Small Cap farming. The only coins I’ll be mentioning here are stablecoins (USDC and DAI), ETH, and BTC. All protocols mentioned here will be on the Polygon ecosystem. Those wishing to use Avalanche, Solana, or Fantom ecosystems will benefit from this post as well.

 [A guide on how to bridge funds from Ethereum to Polygon.](https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-using-the-matic-bridge-to-bridge-tokens-from-ethereum-to-polygon-c3e66cf3d334) There are many ways to get onto the ecosystem, I’ll focus on what to do once you’re here.

**Summary**

With Blue Chip farming, your average returns will be about 10% APY, depending on what cryptos you own, and your risk level will be as close to 0% as it gets in DeFi. We will be using Aave and Curve, two of the largest DeFi protocols in crypto.

With Small Cap farming, your average returns will be from 15%-50% APY, with a slightly higher risk factor. I won’t be sharing any projects that haven’t been thoroughly audited, as those will be in the next post about Prestaking/farming. In this section, you’ll be introduced to several protocols that you’ve likely never heard of before, but do not fret! They are fully audited by some of the most respected smart contract auditors in the sector. If the code is solid, your money is safe.

 

**Blue Chip Farming Step 1 – Aave**

Lets get started! As /u/thechadley mentioned, yield farming is not as complex as it seems. The very first thing you should do is check out [the Aave protocol website](https://app.aave.com/markets) and go to the Polygon section in the upper right. Here you can see all the assets you can deposit, and the massive *Four billion USD* of liquidity deposited, with another *$21 billion* on the Ethereum mainnet.

[Scroll down a bit and you can see the WETH (wrapped Ether)]( https://imgur.com/tNUu62v). You deposit your ETH here, and you’ll get ~0.2% APY in ETH, and ~1.4% APR in WMATIC, paid out continuously, which you can trade for more ETH if you wish. That’s about 2% APY returns just for supplying WETH to the protocol. Note: you can also supply stablecoins here for up to 14% APY. USDT cannot be used as collateral, so I recommend DAI/USDC.

Once you’ve supplied your crypto, head on over to the Borrow section. Here, you can choose to borrow stablecoins, but I like to borrow BTC, as ETH and BTC generally trend together in terms of price. You can see on the borrow page that it costs ~0.35% APY to borrow, but you’re PAID 1.53% APR in WMATIC! You read that right, you’re PAID to borrow BTC! This incentive from the Polygon development team lasts through April of 2022 [source](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-launches-40m-liquidity-mining-program-with-aave/).

The risk here is getting liquidated (5% of your ETH will be used to close out your bitcoin position), which will happen if your Health Factor goes too low. With ETH, your Maximum LTV is 80%, so you can borrow up to 80% of the total value of your ETH in Bitcoin. $10,000 deposited? You can borrow $8,000. This would put you at 1.00 health factor, so you’re at a ridiculous risk of getting liquidated. I always keep my health factor above 1.3, but someone who isn’t paying attention to the markets as much would want to go safer, with 1.8 or higher.

At this point, you’re getting about 1.5%+1.4% in WMATIC for a total of 2.9% APR and your bitcoin/ETH basically cancel each other out. Lets pump up these numbers a bit, eh?

**Blue Chip Farming Step 2 – Curve**

Now you’ve got your BTC, in the form of WBTC. Head on over to https://polygon.curve.fi where you will see a list of pools they have. In this case, we’re interested in the renBTC pool. [Read up on renBTC here](https://renproject.io/). The base vAPY is .21%, and the rewards tAPY is currently 2.81% in CRV + 4.13% in WMATIC. So you’re directly paid 0.21% in BTC, and given a total of 6.94% APY in two other tokens. Now we’re at just about 8% APY, with the rewards from the bitcoin being deposited and staked with Curve and the WMATIC rewards from Aave, assuming you borrowed about 70% BTC against your ETH.

You also have the option of depositing your WBTC into the “atricrypto3” pool for a huge 2.43% + ~21% in the two reward tokens, bringing you up to about 20% APY on your total ETH investment. I won’t cover the downside of LP farming in the blue chip section, but you can go ahead and [read up on Impermanent Loss (also known as Divergence Loss) here](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/).

TL;DR: Blue chip farming with just ETH gets you a whopping 8% APY on your ETH and BTC with a negligible amount of risk. You can raise this APY by depositing stablecoins, but then you lose your upside of ETH. You also do protect yourself from market crashes.

 

 

 

**Small Cap Farming: The Gains are Real**

Lets start with an extension of the gains from the Blue Chip section. You may have noticed that you’re getting paid in CRV/WMATIC tokens daily, but those probably aren’t the tokens you’re trying to collect! You want BTC and ETH, not CRV and WMATIC (or maybe you do want CRV, I don’t judge). Enter: Autocompounding services.

Autocompounders do the work for you, at minimal cost. They’ll take your rewards, exchange them for the coin you’re providing (in our case, WBTC), and re-stake that into the autocompounder. You can get better APY with faster compounding because the fees on polygon network are extremely low.

You’ve got three big players here, with many others as well. I exclusively use [Adamant.finance](https://adamant.finance/), but [Beefy.finance](https://polygon.beefy.finance/#/) is a great option as well. Check out Autofarm as well; they provide the same service as Beefy.

You can check out the renBTC pool from curve on the beefy site, and you’re getting about 9% APY. Using Adamant.finance, you can get up to 14% APY with their vault boosting utilities, where you lock the native asset up for a specific amount of time and it boosts your returns. There’s quite a lot going on with Adamant, but just know you’re paid 70% in the original tokens (WBTC) and the other 30% is converted into a bonus amount of ADDY, which is vested for 90 days. If you originally were going to get 18% APY in BTC, you might get 14% APY in BTC and 12% in ADDY, for example.

**Time to check out the other WBTC pool on Adamant!**

You’ll notice a vault very similar to Curve’s, except this one has the name “Gravity” next to it. Gravity is a small cap Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and it is providing a significant amount of its native token, GFI, to entice liquidity to come to its marketplace. These kind of farms pop up frequently. The WBTC pool from gravity currently shows **33% APY** boostable to 50% APY!! You’ll notice that Gravity supplies many different pairs with similar APY, although these will trend down as more people provide liquidity. [Check out their DEX here](https://v1.gravityfinance.io/app/), where you can provide liquidity in 50/50 renBTC/WBTC to get started.

Gravity is the best one I can find right now, as it is quite new. There is also [Wault.finance](https://app.wault.finance/polygon/index.html), [exchange.Dfyn](https://exchange.dfyn.network/#/popular-farms), [Mai.Finance](https://app.mai.finance/vaults), and many others.

All of these can utilize autocompounding services such as Adamant or Beefy, which makes life easy and you can mostly set and forget for gains that are completely unheard of in traditional finance.

I’m happy to answer questions, and I hope I’ve shown a bit more concrete examples of where you can put your crypto to good use.

Stay tuned for part 2, where I’ll cover the real degenerate stuff. Medium/high risk, high reward."

I took a look at their strategies and they have very good APRs on a lot of solid assets. [https://app.tetu.io/](https://app.tetu.io/)

The Tetu co-founder is a well-known developer in the Harvest Finance community - I took a look at their tokenomics page in Docs and from what I can tell it's very early in development. Fourth or fifth week of token emissions, the tokenomics emission curve closely resembles the BTC tokenomics distribution encouraging early adopters with many tokens.

It looks like a micro cap. Just hit 1M valuation, seems to be the best micro cap project in terms of quality.

Super legit from what I can tell, they have very informative documentation. [https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/](https://docs.tetu.io/tetu-io/)

their discord community is still small but very active, they answer questions quickly. [https://discord.gg/xs8VESN4yz](https://discord.gg/xs8VESN4yz)

As I understand it, xTETU rewards distribution decision is renewed every 28 days, some vaults may have the incentives increased or decreased after each 28 day period. I'm still getting to know the platform and so far I'm really enjoying it. Possibly the most stable and profitable defi project I've found to date."

El Salvador buys 200 bitcoins as the digital currency becomes legal tender

President Nayib Bukele announced late Monday that his government has purchased another 200 bitcoins ahead of El Salvador's formal adoption of the currency. El Salvador now holds 400 bitcoins, which are worth nearly $21 million at current trading levels.

Bitcoin will be used as legal tender in El Salvador alongside the US dollar starting on Tuesday. Bukele tweeted that the country's brokers ""will buy much more as the deadline approaches.""

Bukele, a right-wing populist who rose to power in 2019, announced the plan to start using bitcoin in June. The law designating bitcoin as legal tender says that all ""economic agents"" shall accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment. It also says that tax payments can be made in bitcoin.

Salvadorans will be able to download the ""Chivo Wallet"" an application created by the government which will deliver $30 worth of bitcoin to people to promote its use.

""The process of #Bitcoin in El Salvador has a learning curve. Every step toward the future is like this, and we will not achieve everything in a day, nor in a month"" Bukele tweeted. ""But we must break the paradigms of the past.""

El Salvador has partnered with digital finance company Strike to create the infrastructure required.

Cryptocurrencies are held in digital wallets, rather than through a traditional bank account — meaning that people in poorer communities with less access to banks could use bitcoin as a way to gain increased access to their finances.

However, social organizations have asked the Salvadoran government to repeal the law, largely because they fear the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has recovered some lost ground following a dramatic crash earlier this year, but it remains well below its record high of nearly $65000 set in April. The price was $51360 on Tuesday, down 0.7% (...)

My thinking is that if I pay cash for the car, I am tying up the cash and due to the fact that the insurance company will most likely not give you what you paid for the car (even if it’s a used car and the depreciation curve is pretty flat) if it got totaled a week later that I could possibly lose any and all cash that I used as a down payment.

So, it seems to me that it would be safer to finance as much as the bank will allow on the car (especially since interest rates are so low) and simply purchase GAP insurance, which is less than $10 a month.

If my thinking is reasonable, it seems like it would be best (I’ll be it a hassle) to refinance a car every time you pay the loan off and cash out the equity.

Is there something that i am missing here?"

# About NAOS Finance

[NAOS Finance](https://naos.finance/) is a decentralized real world asset (RWA) lending protocol that facilitates the borrowing of crypto native assets by using RWA as collateral. NAOS has established a large network of corporate borrowers and is operating with financing licenses in multiple regions. In the effort of connecting CeFi with DeFi, NAOS takes an ecosystem approach and looks to engage in meaningful strategic partnerships to expand the boundary of decentralized finance.

Our team is creating a decentralized financial network that:

* Enables the origination and funding of loans without traditional intermediaries
* Instills full transparency in the previously opaque risk assessment and loan application process
* Breaks the geographic boundaries for lender/borrower to transact in a borderless fashion
* Transfers financial value from financial institutions to lenders and borrowers
* Offers the best interest rate on any comparable loan of the same risk profile and terms
* Transfers custodial ownership of accounts from financial institutions to individuals
* Democratizes irrefutable and immutable loan performance data that was held closely by centralized institutions
* Accelerates the growth of the overall DeFi ecosystem with real world applications

We envision a permission-less and transparent loan marketplace where borrowers can access funding quickly and lenders can deploy capital freely. To accomplish this, the NAOS Finance protocol will replicate most, if not all, of the functionality of centralized intermediaries on the Ethereum blockchain. Our goal is to create an environment that combines the operational familiarity of traditional financial institutions and the technological benefits of DeFi.

# 🔒Security Score Card on NAOS

# Have the contracts been audited by professional auditing firms?

NAOS contracts have been audited by Quantstamp. The detailed audit report can be found [here](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/naos-formation).

# What is the project’s inception date?

The project started in October 2020, and IDO on April 30, 2021.

# Has your project even been involved with a hack or exploit?

No.

# What safety measures are in place to secure your protocols from centralization risk? What contracts are not under timelock? Who has multi-sig?

The team uses Gnosis-safe multi-sig to control the contracts. Currently multi-sig consists of only team members. We will add additional independent advisors to the multi-sig and as well as implement the timelock feature in the future.

# Does your token have a maximum supply cap?

Maximum supply is 300 Mn NAOS. 30% of the max supply (90Mn) is allocated for liquidity mining.

# Mint function. If Token does not have maximum supply, how is the mint function controlled?

There are only two addresses with the authority to mint the NAOS Tokens on Ethereum. One is NAOS staking pool and the other is NAOS foundation.

The mint function is for liquidity incentive only and must be approved by team multi-sig. As for BSC, the NAOS mint function will only be called when users bridge their NAOS tokens from Ethereum.

# Centralized treasury. If the protocol collects fees, where do they go and how are they controlled? Is there any kind of treasury or insurance fund under centralized control?

The fees collected from NAOS protocol are sent to the multi-sig address. These fees will be used for development of the protocol and for the buyback of NAOS tokens.

# Migration Function. Is there a migration function in the code? Why is this there and how to control this function from making a malicious action?

The NAOS token contract does not have a migrate function. However, we do have a migration function on NAOS protocol, which is used to migrate funds between vaults.

# Upgradeable contracts. Are the contracts upgradeable? Why is this there and how to control this function from making a malicious action?

No.

# Third-party risk. What underlying external parties do your contracts rely on?

The NAOS protocol relies on Yearn and Curve protocol. The NAOS token on BSC relies on AnySwap (for bridging asset from the Ethereum network -&gt; BSC)

Our protocol allows users to deposit their DAI which will be put into Yearn to get interest.

A nUSD3CRV-f pool, which is a permissionless on Curve, is also created on crv.to to provide the liquidity for NAOS synthetic stable coin nUSD.

# Where are tokens currently listed?

On centralized exchange (CEX), we are listed on MEXC and Gate.io

Moonbeam en Lido kondigen samenwerking aan om Liquid Staking naar Polkadot te brengen.,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Crypto-Vito/comments/pl7dpn/moonbeam_en_lido_kondigen_samenwerking_aan_om/,Crypto-Vito,1,2021-09-10 05:44:26,0,/r/u_Crypto-Vito/comments/pl7dpn/moonbeam_en_lido_kondigen_samenwerking_aan_om/,NaN,"**Gebruikers kunnen staken en liquiditeit krijgen voor $DOT op Moonbeam en $KSM op Moonriver**

Boston, MA – 9 september 2021 – Moonbeam, het Ethereum-compatibele slimme contractplatform op Polkadot, heeft plannen aangekondigd om te integreren en samen te werken met Lido, het grootste liquid-staking derivatenprotocol, dat momenteel wordt ingezet voor Ethereum en Terra. De samenwerking zal worden aangestuurd door MixBytes, die door de Lido DAO is geselecteerd om de technische integratie voor het Polkadot-ecosysteem te leiden. Deze integratie introduceert liquid staking voor Moonriver en Moonbeam en biedt DOT-houders de mogelijkheid om hun munten in te zetten en tegelijkertijd toegang te krijgen tot de liquiditeit van die uitgezette positie. De inzet van Lido vormt een cruciale bouwsteen voor het groeiende DeFi-ecosysteem op Moonbeam, en biedt tokenhouders een manier om productief gebruik te maken van hun Polkadot-ecosysteem middelen.

Geregeerd door de Lido DAO, is Lido naar voren gekomen als het grootste en meest gebruikte protocol voor liquid staking ter wereld. Met wortels in Ethereum staking, breidt Lido zich uit om liquid staking te bieden aan andere protocollen zoals Terra en Solana. Voor hun uitbreiding naar Polkadot selecteerde Lido Moonbeam om de onderliggende parachain-infrastructuur en cross-chain-integraties te bieden vanwege de Ethereum-compatibele smart contract-functionaliteit waarmee Lido bekende Ethereum-tools en bestaande codes  kan gebruiken om snel op de markt te komen.

""Na het bekijken van een reeks mogelijke parachain-partners en implementaties, waaronder het bouwen van een onafhankelijke parachain, waren we diep onder de indruk van het Moonbeam-team en de ambities"", zegt Misha Putyatin, CEO MixBytes. ""Moonbeam voldoet aan onze technische vereisten met zijn EVM smart contracts, cross-chain integratiemogelijkheden en sterke ondersteuning van onze afhankelijkheden op protocolniveau via hun DeFi-ecosysteem dat stableswap AMM's, uitlenen en lenen omvat, en andere protocollen die Lido nodig heeft om echt succesvol te zijn .”

Lido biedt ook een cruciale mogelijkheid voor het groeiende DeFi-ecosysteem van Moonbeam. Een belangrijke motivatie voor projectteams die zich inzetten voor Moonbeam, is om DOT als een native te kunnen dienen. Door DOT-houders toegang te geven tot een op parachain gebaseerd vloeibaar stakingsderivaat, hoeven DOT-houders niet langer te kiezen tussen stakingsrendement op de Relay Chain en DeFi-opbrengstmogelijkheden op Moonbeam. Liquid staking derivaten zullen naar verwachting het volume van activa die naar Moonbeam stromen aanzienlijk vergroten en extra TVL- en transactiegroeimogelijkheden creëren voor DeFi-protocollen die in Moonbeam worden geïmplementeerd.

""Vloeibare derivaten zijn een essentieel onderdeel om de groei van het DeFi-ecosysteem op Moonbeam en Polkadot te ondersteunen"", zegt Derek Yoo, oprichter van Moonbeam. “Sinds we elkaar voor het eerst ontmoetten, zijn we onder de indruk van de technische verfijning van het Lido-team, de diepgaande domeinexpertise en de markttractie van hun protocol. We zijn verheugd om met hen samen te werken om stDOT en andere staking-derivaten naar het Polkadot-ecosysteem te brengen.”

De engineeringteams van Lido en Moonbeam werken nauw samen om een eerste liquid staking-implementatie te leveren op Moonriver, het in Kusama gebaseerde zusternetwerk van Moonbeam. Deze integratie zal een belangrijke eerste use case zijn voor het Polkadot-native cross-chain messaging protocol (XCMP), dat zal worden gebruikt om veilig toegang te bieden tot KSM en relay chain staking-functionaliteit vanuit de Moonriver-gebaseerde EVM-omgeving. Lido zal naar verwachting later dit jaar op Moonriver worden ingezet. Eenmaal bewezen op Moonriver, zullen de op XCMP gebaseerde integraties en het Lido-protocol worden geïmplementeerd in Moonbeam om DOT te kunnen bedienen.

by Tai F Yang, MD

Now that I got your attention with this purposefully sensationalistic but realistic title, please read on, if you are concerned about the COVID-19 and/or your overall health.

At the very beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in US, around February 2020, when not much was known about this pandemic, I had some information that was deemed crucial and could impact the outcome of the then rising deadly and sinistrous disease.

I believed the information to be too critical and important to be kept for my own selfish glory and self esteem booster, by knowing that I had the advantage of possessing the information and the ideas of how to use that knowledge to improve the outcome of my patients. I wanted to get it out in the hopes of bringing a better outcome in the community. After spending 12 hours on a beautiful Saturday writing a 6 page letter, filled with graphics, references and explanations, including my suggestions on how to act upon the information being presented, I made the mistake of sending it to a few governmental authorities. Not only did the letter get lost in the deep Dark Hole, but also no acknowledgement was received. That’s when I learned a deeply saddening real life lesson: political influence can be so powerful it can supersede the moral, professional and simply humane obligation to do the right thing or act on a crucial information, for the benefit of our peers.

This time I will not make the same mistake. I have another piece of information and ideas/suggestions that could impact the lives of millions, if not billions, but I want to send it out straight to the public. I hope this news media will do its part, and you, if patient enough to finish reading this article, will spread the news.

Ever wonder why some relatively young people, previously healthy, without predisposing conditions, who caught COVID-19 fare much worse than some older ones? Have you heard of a friend or a relative who was diagnosed recently with an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or Lupus, or Multiple Sclerosis, just to mention a few? The next few paragraphs may explain, at least in some cases, the possible common factor for all the above conditions.

It all converges to an interesting fat-soluble hormone called vitamin D. The active form of vitamin D is the Calciferol, or Vitamin D3. You may have heard of it in bits and pieces of information. To understand my concerns, however, it will be necessary to connect the dots of information you might have and deepen your knowledge, so you can fully grasp the severity of the issue (or so you can show off your knowledge about this issue next time you are drinking with your friends).

Since its discovery in the early 1900’s, a lot of researches have been published. Initially it was studied as the substance that controls the metabolism of calcium and bones. It was the concomitant efforts of researchers from US and England while studying rickets that finally led to the discovery of the chemical structure. For many years Vitamin D was viewed as synonymous to bone health ( prevention of rickets, osteomalacia and improving osteoporosis). For the last decade or so, however, several publications have emerged showing an extremely interesting and exciting new role for this underestimated micronutrient. It is clear now that Vitamin D has another completely independent function in our body by *Modulating* the immune system.

Please note that I used the word **Modulate**. What that means is that it can, at the same time, dampen ***and*** strengthen the immune system. In other words, it works on both ends of the complex immune system by “cooling off” and avoiding excessive activity and by strengthening and building up a complex army of different cells and chemicals, when it feels your body is being attacked by enemies, such as in an infection.

To make a very long story short, let’s go over that briefly.

Our immune system has different functions. On one end it helps us fight an intruder, whether a viral infection, bacterial or another agent. On the other end of the spectrum, it does a continuous surveillance looking for “foreign” antigens (proteins, chemicals, etc), that does not belong in our body. It also detects debris of dead cells and recognizes cancer cells and destroys them. There are three famous superhero cells that work as “Avengers” in our system: B-cells, T-cells and monocytes.

**B cells**: Upon stimulation, produce the famous weapons (antibodies) to fight the enemy.

The B cells differentiates into more mature cells: Plasma Cells, which is the actual producer of antibodies (Immunoglobulins) and Memory Cells. The latter one stores the information from the “enemy” (foreign antigen) and is responsible for the rapid response the next time the same intruder invades our body. Of note, this is the mechanism by which the vaccines work.

**T cells**: Upon stimulation, will differentiate into other functional ready-for-combat cells (Helper cells, Cytotoxic or Killer cells, and Regulatory cells). The Helper cells secrete chemical messengers called cytokines (remember cytokines bursts in Covid-19? The knowledge will start to all connect…). They assist the B cells in their production of antibodies. Cytotoxic cells are the soldiers that do the actual killing (hence, Killer cells). When activated by the cytokines, they bind and kill enemy cells, such as cancer cells, or infected cells.

Finally, there is Regulatory T cells. As the name denotes, their job in this Army is to regulate, or suppress the other T-cells, to turn down or off the cascade of reaction that prompted the attack on the “enemy”. That is how the immune system controls and tells itself to stop the counter attack. Without these cells, the immune system could “overreact” and destroy its own body.

**Monocytes**: they are large lymphocytes that differentiate further into Dendritic cells and Macrophages. They have two distinct functions: patrol the body for microbial cells and orchestrate the immune response during an infection and inflammation.

They are called *Phagocytes*, which means they like to eat the enemy. They are also *Antigen-Presenting Cells*, or in other words they present the intruder to other immune cells to destroy the invader. Pretty much like the Incredible Hulk, crushing, eating and holding up the enemy to the other Avengers to come shoot and kill them.

To make matters more confusing, Dendritic cells and B-cells are also Antigen-Presenting Cells.

So, the purpose of this somewhat complex and confusing illustration is simple. To make a point demonstrating how complex ( beautiful and fascinating, if you ask me) the immune system is, and to show that in our wonderful body, all body parts are connected and interacting continuously and harmoniously all the time. This harmony is called **Homeostasis**.

When the Homeostasis is broken, trouble may start…

That is the case, when some cells in our body decide to grow uncontrollably and without a purpose, such as the case of cancer cells. Luckily enough, we have the immune system doing the surveillance, as exemplified above, which will eliminate these rogue cells. Our immune system does that continuously.

What would happen if the surveillance system fails? That’s correct. People would have a higher chance of developing cancers.

What about if the system fails to control the response? Remember the Regulatory T cells? They are one of the ways the body modulates the immunity to avoid excessive action. What would happen is an excessive activity of our immune system, which basically means your body is attacking your own tissues. This could lead to an AutoImmune Disorder, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Celiac Disease, and Ulcerative Colitis, just to mention a few.

On the other end of the spectrum, if the immune system is too weak or not coordinated and working properly, it could lead to increased chance of infections and/or worse outcomes.

Enter the next super-hero, which is the main reason for this article: **Vitamin D**.

All those immune cells cited above have *receptors* on the cell surface. What that means is that they can interact, or be controlled by the Vitamin D. Think of Vitamin D as the charming and smart Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Without her, Iron Man would be lost. Iron Man (immune cells) may have the ability, willingness and power to destroy the enemy, but without Pepper’s information, instructions and constant updates, he could be killing good citizens (normal cells) and not acting when he should (fighting infections).

My main concern that prompted this article is the lack of widespread knowledge and the truly world wide pandemic scale of vitamin D deficiency. Since vitamin D regulates the immune system, both upwards and downwards, you can image the potential implications of that. That’s right. People will have a higher probability of having cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Combine that with the current COVID-19 pandemic and voila! Perfect recipe for disaster.

**Vitamin D deficiency.** Just how bad is it ? According to a publication by Nair R, 2012 (1), about 50% of the world population have a Vitamin D insufficiency, and 1 billion people have vitamin D deficiency. (Insufficiency= 21-29 ng/mL; Deficiency= less than 20 ng/mL; Normal levels=30-100). It is a major public health problem. The prevalence varies by age, ethnic group and socio-cultural factors. The deficiency is highest in the elderly, overweight patients, nursing home residents, and hospitalized patients. Age and latitude corrected, obese subjects still had a 35% higher rate of deficiency (2). In US 50-60% of hospitalized and nursing home residents have deficiency (3,4).

The deficiency can also be affected by darker skin color (melanin) and coverage of body parts (long clothing). As a comparison, one study published in 2015 where they analyzed more than a 100 articles, showed that about 50% of US infants are deficient in Vitamin D while more than 90% of infants from India, Iran and Turkey are deficient. In the adult population overall 35% of US people are deficient while over 80% of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh adults are deficient (5). Being of asian descent, I can attest to the cultural factor causing vitamin D deficiency. Most asian women I know, including my family circle, are afraid of, and hide from the sun more fiercely than the vampires.

Please note that the same population that has less vitamin D is the same that is most susceptible to COVID-19, namely nursing home residents and hospitalized patients!

Also realize that the above epidemiological studies, although recent, were all conducted before Covid-19. My suspicion is that the actual percentage of people all over the world with vitamin D deficiency is much higher now due to social isolation leading to decreased sun exposure.

**How concerned should I be?** The combination of COVID-19 pandemic and the vitamin D pandemic is a perfect mix for the perfect disaster. There is only so much we can do to bring down the curve again. The Delta variant is the proof that this pandemic is going to behave like a roller coaster ride, up and down in cyclic manner, and the spread of the disease is not going to stop until most people are:           a) vaccinated, b) dead, or c) get sick, survives and become immune (temporarily) to the SARS CoV-2.

You can only fit in one of the three categories. There is no magic bullet. Make your pick, or let “luck” do it for you. The reason I believe this roller coaster ride is not going to change (unless vaccination rates improve) and furthermore believe that another new highly contagious variant will be here before the end of the year is because the SARS CoV-2 mutates every 11-15 days! Last time I checked there were more than 12,700 mutations.

The only other variable we can change in this battle against the virus, besides what has been promulgated extensively, such as taking the shot, mask, etc, is to try to maintain as good health as possible, and fix the possible problems to the best of our ability. Being aware of the vitamin D Pandemic and how to fix it is a good start and most crucial step at this time in history, in my opinion.

**What to do?**

***Step 1***

The very first thing to ask is: when was the last time you had a well check with your doctor? Go do a check up with your primary doctor and request, among all the other regular tests that we usually do annually, to add vitamin D levels.

***Step 2***.

If your levels are low, there are a few ways of fixing it.

1. By sun exposure;
2. By vitamin D3 supplement. The recommended dose is 2,000 to 6,000 IU (International Units) per day. You should recheck the levels again in about 2 months.
3. Do both, and while you are at it, enjoy the process, such as jogging outdoors, water sports, walking at the beach in a sunny day, etc.
4. By eating more vegetables ( improves your overall health) and especially the ones with higher content of vitamin D, such as mushrooms exposed to sunlight (portobello mushroom).           Also rich in vitamin D: Cod liver oil, trout, salmon, fortified milk, fortified cereals, sardines and egg.

**Comments.** Diet alone is unlikely to provide enough vitamin D, as you can tell by the short list above. Other than taking indefinitely pills of supplement, the other natural way should be by having enough sun exposure. Let’s have a few words on that, before my dermatologist colleagues start screaming and jumping up and down from their chairs accusing me of predisposing the world population to skin cancer.

There are two ways of putting this concern to rest.

*1. Scientifically.* When your skin is exposed to the sun, it produces a precursor of vitamin D. This precursor has to pass through two organs before it becomes fully active. First the liver and then the kidneys. The production of vitamin D comprises 50-90 % of the total amount in the body. You only need 20 minutes in the sun per day and 40% of body skin exposure (6). Also use a little common sense: do it when there is not too much UV. Before 10 AM or after 4 PM, depending on where you are (Florida or Maine) and time of the year. Darker people may need more exposure, since melanin blocks the ultraviolet B light (UV-B), which is the light responsible for inducing skin production of vitamin D.

Other fun and important factors: house windows and car glasses block the UV-B, so being indoors or inside a car with windows up won’t help, even if there is light hitting you. Older people, unfortunately also produce less vitamin D through the skin, and since they also have a higher probability of skin cancer, my suggestion is for you to just give grandpa or grandma her vitamin D pills and take him/her to the park for a walk whenever possible.

2. *Common sense, logical thinking.* If you believe in God, think of this: why would God make the sun just to kill us by causing skin cancer? It has to have a function and benefit. If you are an atheist, this is the reasoning: everything in nature has a purpose and all elements in nature are interconnected somehow and affect one another. Sun provides energy for the plants to produce photosynthesis without which life on Earth would not exist. Sun cannot be only a bad thing. Even good things can kill you. Take for instance water. It is one of the most essential elements for all creatures to survive, and yet in excess it can kill you ( a drowning person can die from excessive ingestion of water causing brain edema and death, after he/she is rescued!).

**The other side of the coin.** Despite several studies correlating low vitamin D levels and increase incidence of cancers (7,8,9,10), there are a few studies that did not show correlation of low vitamin D and some specific types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer (11,12,13 ). In trying to sort this out, some recent large analytical studies using meta-analysis have been conducted, but the comparison is problematic, due to different methodologies of different publications. The results are either inconclusive or not strong enough to allow the The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to proclaim definitive guidelines recommending universal screening of all asymptomatic patients (14).

Similar situation occurred with cardiovascular disease, MS, Depression and Diabetes Type 2. Even though observational studies of large population showed correlation with vitamin D and above conditions, clinical trials provided little evidence of benefits of vitamin D.(15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24).

My take on this “inconclusive” or “insufficient evidence” to correlate Vitamin D and the above conditions is the difference in the designs, besides the fact that the observational studies usually involve thousands of subjects, while the clinical, prospective trials usually involves only a few hundred.

“Lack of strong evidence” does not mean it is not accurate; it just means that at the moment in time, we, scientists, with our current knowledge and technology, do not have enough capability to sort it out yet.

**Final words/ Suggestions.**

1. Due to the fact that no study has looked at whether universal screening of vitamin D deficiency can improve the overall health of the population (26), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) statement is that there is “ insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults”. That recommendation, however, was drawn in 2015, well before COVID-19 (27).
2. In times of *quasi* despair, when people are dying, hospitals are at full capacity and the curve of COVID-19 is showing exponential pattern again, anything possible to keep us healthier, especially at low cost and with simple fix, should be attempted.
3. My suggestion is that we should start checking vitamin D levels of every single patient who comes in for well check, or whenever possible. Being in the Sunshine State, one would never imagine that kids would have Vitamin D deficiency. I have been checking the levels on my patients for about a year now, and to my shock and disbelief, of the hundreds of tests ordered, only 4 have come back normal! If my population of patients is representative of the general population, that would imply that at least more than 95% of kids in Florida now has vitamin D deficiency/ insufficiency! One can only imagine the Northern States!
4. If you, the reader, are the nurse that sits behind a desk and makes decisions on what tests and medications we doctors can and cannot order (aka: case manager), hear me out: the test to check vitamin D levels costs U$ 50. The cost of an admission for a COVID patient ranges from $51,000 to $78,000.(HealthCare Finance News, Nov. 2020). My prediction is that it will go up due to more availability and options of medications and potential for increased survival rates and thus, increased length of stay over time.
5. One word of caution: Vitamin D, together with A, E and K are all liposoluble (fat soluble) vitamins. They can accumulate in our body and could build up to toxic levels. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Excessive vitamin D and hypercalcemia (excessive calcium in the blood) can cause , among other symptoms, damage to the kidneys such as kidney stones. In extreme cases, it can even cause kidney failure, calcium deposit in the heart leading to cardiac arrhythmia and even death. There are also cases described of accidental excessive contents of vitamin D in the nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, there were also cases of incorrectly prescribed vitamin D by physicians (29, 30).
6. Last but not least, even if part or all of my arguments are incorrect, just by bringing awareness to this issue, readers will develop a subliminal desire to pay more attention to their overall health and who knows, maybe even avoid a disease or two…It’s been forty years since I read George Orwell’s “1984” book, but the one statement that I never forget reads along these lines:    
“ even if the whole world is against you, it still doesn’t mean you are wrong…”.

It's all connected. All of it. And the plan started being laid out around 1972. Slowly, at first. Little snippets in the media who barely covered the topic. And then it picked up steam later on. But it's real and it's happening. 


#The First Global Revolution

&gt;Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, ""new enemies must be identified."" 
 ""In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""   
[Source Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution)    

I know I'm rehashing quotes, but there's a reason. So just bear with me. Why would they call their book, **The First Global Revolution**? It was supposed to be a book about the environment and the future, and you called it the  First Global Revolution? Ok. Sure. Whatever. But don't you find it strange they predicted the year 2020 as the first year that Climate Change would start a **cascade** of environmental disasters which would lead to failed nation states and corporations becoming the ruling authorities of the planet? And the planet just happens to be in a **PANDEMIC LOCKSTEP** at the same time they declare were facing a **CLIMATE EMERGENCY**. That's convenient, isn’t it? 



&gt;The First Global Revolution is a book written by Alexander King and Bertrand Schneider, and published by Pantheon Books in 1991. The book follows up the earlier 1972 work-product from the Club of Rome titled The Limits to Growth. The tagline of ""The First Global Revolution"" is, A Report by the Council of the Club of Rome. The book was intended as a blueprint for the 21st century putting forward a strategy for world survival at the onset of what they called the world's first global revolution.    

A strategy for world survival. Sounds serious. Really serious! So serious they keep pumping out new cell phones every year, lie to us about the effectiveness of recycling, fly around the planet on private jets because they pay carbon tax, and then tell us to stop eating beef because cow farts are destroying the environment. 

&gt;The Limits to Growth theory was also heartily endorsed by such globalists as Klaus Schwab and his World Economic Forum. In 1973 in Davos, Schwab had Aurelio Peccei deliver a Limits to Growth speech at the annual WEF meeting, which Schwab says gave the Club of Rome a “platform” that helped turn the book into a global bestseller.      

Isn't that special? The **CLUB OF ROME** gave a book report called **THE FIRST GLOBAL REVOLUTION** to Klaus Schwab at the **WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM**. Because they care so much about the environment. Just like the oil loving Rockefellers. 


&gt;The most influential group that spurred the creation of Klaus Schwab’s symposium was the Club of Rome, an influential think tank of the scientific and monied elite that mirrors the World Economic Forum in many ways, including in its promotion of a global governance model led by a technocratic elite. **The Club had been founded in 1968 by Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King during a private meeting at a residence owned by the Rockefeller family in Bellagio, Italy**
[Source Here](https://americanpolicy.org/2021/04/13/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-planned-dystopia/)    


Ah. Of course. The Rockefellers. Those great protectors of the planet earth, who just decided to get out of the oil industry a short time before the pandemic (apparently, because really, who knows if they did or didn't). 


&gt;Maurice Strong, former Undersecretary General of the UN, Sec. Gen. of UN Conference on the Environment, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, was called a visionary and a “pioneer of global sustainable development. He was the secretary-general of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit which unveiled Agenda 21, the culmination of decades of scheming, planning, and cajoling to bring about a global government via the UN. **He was also a close friend of Klaus Schwab, George Soros, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger,** and many of the rogues’ gallery of One-World government advocates.    

And let's look at a portion if his resume.   


&gt;""Strong will forever be remembered for placing the environment on the international agenda and at the heart of development. He shepherd global environmental governance processes — from the original Rio Earth Summit, Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration to the launch of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Maurice Strong. Nice name. Doesn't it sound like an old school wrestler in the WWF whose about to take on Hulk Hogan? Fitting, because it seems like we're full tilt into a scripted reality. He passed away just a short while ago, and the people behind the curtains of our stage drama paid tribute to a legend.   


#Justin Trudeau: ‘There has never been a better time to look to Canada’

**For the record: Justin Trudeau's speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos**
[Source Here](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-there-has-never-been-a-better-time-to-look-to-canada/)

&gt;Thank you Professor Schwab for your warm welcome and for bringing this impressive group together.

&gt;I’d like to take a moment to recognize a **founder of the World Economic Forum** and a great Canadian, Maurice Strong, who passed away just a couple months ago.

&gt;Maurice showed incredible leadership on a variety of issues facing the world today, and in particular early and compelling leadership on climate change.

&gt;Today, we are gathered here to contemplate whether we are in the **early stages of a fourth industrial revolution.**

&gt;What a breathtaking possibility that is.    

The early stages of a **Fourth Industrial Revolution**. Curious, very curious indeed. This was the first speaking appearance by Trudeau, and he gave it at the WEF (progress report or just a plain old sycophantic speech?). Tough to tell, but Justin wasn't the only praising him. Klaus Schwab have him a glowing report as well. Klaus actually called him a mentor and said the WEF wouldn't be where it was today without Maurice.   

#Maurice Strong on climate ‘conspiracy’, Bilberberg and population control
[Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jun/22/maurice-strong-interview-global-government)    


&gt;**Nature will provide solutions much tougher than we could ever provide if we don't do something ourselves**. Secondly, I was deputy minister in the Canadian government at a very young age and I made a speech in Canada in which I said that, with a growing global population, we will have to recognise that having children is not just a personal issue but a societal issue **and at a certain point we may be faced with a need to have a permit to have a child**. My minister was getting all sorts of calls from archbishops saying, ""what is he saying?"" I had to explain that I wasn't advocating this, just that this is what might happen if we don't find better ways of doing it.      

Yikes. Nature will find a way. Sounds like a prediction.   

#How Climate Change Is Ushering in a New Pandemic Era
[Source Here](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/climate-change-risks-infectious-diseases-covid-19-ebola-dengue-1098923/)   

Yep. Ten years away from Agenda 2030, and we have a climate change emergency and a pandemic all at the same time. These guys should become psychics, they'd make a ton of cash! Oh wait, they already do! Silly me. 

&gt;I was on an MIT panel on climate change in 1968, I think it was, before the Stockholm Conference.    


So Maurice was on a panel at MIT in 1968. And then four years later MIT has a computer called **WORLD ONE** which forecasted global governmental collapse due to climate change starting in 2020. And wow, right on the money.   

&gt;In his memoirs, he spoke of his rising concerns about air and water pollution in Canada in the 1960s and his increasing awareness of the environmental issue as a whole. This included the environmental and social disruption caused by some Canadian-supported infrastructure projects in developing countries. He was heavily influenced by Rachel Carlson’s Silent Spring and **developed a friendship with the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei, the founder of the Club of Rome**, a global think tank now based in Switzerland that became very famous in 1972 with its publication: “Limits to Growth”   
[Source Here](https://www.mauricestrong.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=80)    

Yes people, he became friends with the Founder of the Club of Rome. After sitting on the MIT panel on climate change. And then MIT developed a computer that accurately predicted 2020 as the climate emergency. And then the Club of Rome have used that computer to give a speech on Climate Change at the WEF. The same World Economic Forum that Maurice helped Klaus build. Nothing. Suspicious. Going on at all.    

#Yep, it’s bleak, says expert who tested 1970s end-of-the-world prediction
[Source Here](https://www.mauricestrong.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=80)

**A controversial MIT study from 1972 forecast the collapse of civilization – and Gaya Herrington is here to deliver the bad news**

Good news. Bad news. Is there any difference at this point? Because from where I'm standing, this New Normal is more accurately described as **HYPERNORMAL**. Look it up. It's what they describe the state of the Soviet Union before it collapsed. Society had become so demoralized they didn't know what the truth was  anymore. Fact Check. Fake News. Misinformation. Sound familiar? 


&gt;In interviews that Strong did with two reporters in Canada wanting to write about their golden boy, both times he talked about his vision of the future. The early vision focused on the WEF:
“Each year, the Word Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Switzerland. Over a thousand CEOs prime ministers, finance ministers, and leading academics, gather in February. to attend meetings and set economic agendas for the year ahead.    
**What if a small group of these world leaders were to form a secret society to bring about an economic collapse? It’s February. They are all at Davos. These aren’t terrorists. They’re world leaders. They have positioned themselves in the world’s commodity and stock markets. They’ve engineered a panic using their access to stock exchanges and computers and gold supplies. They’ve jammed the gears. They hire mercenaries who hold the rest of the world leaders at Davos as hostages. The markets can’t close. The rich countries . . . I probably shouldn’t be saying things like this.”**
Does this sound familiar? Sure sounds plausible to me. In his second theoretical vision, Strong dreams, “what if a small group of world leaders were to conclude that the principle risk to the Earth comes from the actions of the rich countries? And if the world is to survive those rich countries would have to sign an agreement, reducing their impact on the environment. Will they do it? The group’s conclusion is “no”. The rich countries won’t do it. They won’t change. **So, in order to save the planet, a group decides ‘isn’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about? This group of world leaders form a secret society to bring about an economic collapse’.”**
[Source Here](https://americanpolicy.org/2021/04/13/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-planned-dystopia/)      


Here's the problem, he doesn't deny saying the above passage. In fact, he admits saying it. But. He claims it was only said as a hypothetical. Ok. Sure. Hypothesize away, Maurice. Meanwhile, society will start to hypothesize what the French Revolution would look like it if it happened in 2030. Cool? Cool. 


&gt;In his 2000 autobiography, Where on Earth Are We Going? **Strong projected that, in 2031, “the human tragedy” would be “on a scale hitherto unimagined.” He wrote that the brightest prospect lay in forecasts that two-thirds of the world’s already diminished population might be wiped out.**    
He described this as “a glimmer of hope for the future of our species and its potential for regeneration,” thus betraying a distinctly ambivalent attitude towards the humanity he claimed to be so desperate to save.
Strong’s green agenda now blankets the globe, from the UN through national governments to municipalities.     
Paradoxically, Strong freely admitted that governments were incompetent, cumbersome and resistant to change. He also acknowledged that the UN was marked by “petty politics and small-mindedness.” And yet such people were somehow to manage “the entire system of issues.”     
**The answer for Strong was always more power. “The single greatest weakness of the existing international legal regime,” he wrote, “is the almost total lack of capacity for enforcement.”**
[Source Here](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/peter-foster-the-man-who-shaped-the-climate-agenda-in-paris-maurice-strong-leaves-a-complicated-legacy)     


Well now. They need more power to prevent a human tragedy by 2031. Ahem. One year after the UN proclaimed their Agenda 2030. Which coincidentally, Maurice was also instrumental in forming. Yep. But we're just connecting imaginary dots here. That's all. Just a case of mass hysteria.   


#Final Thoughts 

This isn't looking good folks, and as I've already stated, they aren't panicking or freaking out. Not at all. This has been in the works for a long time. Since before most of us were even born. The dominoes are in place and falling. And everything is only going to fall faster from now on.    

So what's the real picture? Are we facing a climate change emergency or is this all a pre-planned psychological operation? Because there's enough information out there suggesting carbon emissions aren't as bad for the environment as had been claimed. So if this isn't the problem, is the problem a pole shift? Is it from the sun? Or is it both, and is this why all they're models have to be adjusted, because they think something is coming (**THE EVENT**) but they just don't know what or when the event will happen.    

But, keep in mind they don't care if the event doesn't happen, they will still take advantage of this to exert more control and extract more power over society. They are manufacturing the crisis even if one doesn't exist, because they need the shock and awe champaign before the hearts and minds can be won. It's the only means by which the majority of people will accept the **TECHTOPIA** they have waiting for us. And which seems to be going by the code name of **ROME**.   

As in, **ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME**. I've thrown up a post detailing this:   

Flatten the Curve. Post 113. All Roads Lead to Rome [Source Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/piizko/flatten_the_curve_post_113_all_roads_lead_to_rome/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)      

And before I lead to the conclusion, I'll leave you with the where the G7 meeting is taking place this year.   


&gt;The health ministers of the **G20** group of the world's leading economies are meeting in **Rome** on Sunday for a meeting on the ongoing battle against the pandemic and strategies for coping with future health crises.
This is one of the last G20 ministerial meetings **before the G20 leaders meet at the end of October in Rome.** [Source Here](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-digest-brazil-argentina-match-halted-over-quarantine-breach/a-59088738)       

Ok. Now even though this is a conspiracy sub, what I'm about to share should shock you. I didn't find this. All the credit goes to u/EnjoyTheRazorIII and his post about the Pfizer vaccine, A funny thing happened on the way to Rome [Source Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pjjpe7/a_funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_rome/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)     

This post shocked me. Because as usual, the truth is hiding in plain sight. I've been busy lately, and I haven't had the time I need to really think about everything. But when I first saw the name of the Pfizer vaccine I thought, something looks off. It just doesn't make sense from a marketing standpoint. **COMIRNATY**. It doesn't quite flow off the tip of the tongue, does it? They give some kind of nonsense explaining the name:    


&gt;**The meaning behind the name 'Comirnaty' Comirnaty is an agglomeration of the words “Covid-19 immunity” and “mRNA,” the latter indicating the technology that makes the vaccine work. As a whole, the word is intended to evoke “community,” a Brand Institute executive said.**    

Uh. Ok. Sure. Whatever you say boss. But I'm not buying it. Because when you look at the word **COMIRNATY** as an anagram, you get this:    

#ROMAN CITY   

Yeah. Great. And all of this is just one big old coincidence. There is absolutely nothing strange happening at all. Nope. Long Live the Glory of Rome.     

**WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER! AND WE'RE ALL NAMED SPARTACUS**

# Crypto Day Trading: Leveraged Yield Farming Strategies

* [By Brian Huang](https://thedefiant.io/author/brian-huang/)

Does leveraged yield farming sound intimidating? It’s understandable that some would feel that way. After all, leverage and yield strategies are tools that professional investors have been known to utilize, their inner workings esoteric to the every-day investor. Yet, with the growth of decentralized finance, that’s no longer the case. Easy-to-use platforms now exist to allow normal investors to take advantage of these tools and earn yields that even professional investors can’t beat. 

Of course, for professional investors, it’s also a positive situation. With these tools, they can further customize their strategies to perfectly align with their market biases, risk profiles, and target yields. And all this while participating in the high-growth high-yield sector of decentralized finance.

So let’s break down leveraged yield farming strategies step-by-step.

#### What is leverage?

Leverage results from using borrowed funds to expand your capital base and the potential returns on that capital base. In other words, you borrow funds so you can invest more, and as a result — earn more.

#### What is yield farming?

Yield farming is the innovative DeFi concept where users stake or lend their crypto assets in order to receive returns.

#### Combine the two, and you have leveraged yield farming!

In the context of yield farming, leverage involves borrowing assets to multiply your yield farming position, resulting in you accruing larger yields. 

Since leverage requires borrowing, then naturally, there is a counterparty acting as a lender. Thus, each leverage yield farming platform consists of lenders and borrowers(farmers). For the casual user, participating in leveraged yield farming often starts with simple lending, which typically provides higher APYs than other lending platforms because leveraged yield farming has greater capital efficiency.

However, participating in leveraged yield farming as a farmer is not difficult either. In fact, it can be as simple as creating a position in one click! For more advanced and professional users, there are also many interesting strategies available to customize positions based on market outlook.

Those comfortable with options will understand how certain strategies can be used to tailor to the user’s needs. For example, in option theory, if someone was bearish but they wanted to limit their risk and not simply buy a put option, they could buy a put and sell a cheaper put to limit their risk, this strategy is called a put spread. Leveraged Yield Farming is powerful because it allows for this kind of tailored approach to yield farming and crypto assets exposure. 

Here are the primary strategies that users employ on leveraged yield farming protocols and the reasons why these may be attractive strategies for you.

#### Strategy 1: Holding With Leveraged Yields

If you plan to hold a token but don’t like the idea of leverage, you can consider farming at 2x leverage, borrowing the token opposite your held token. For example, if you hold $10,000 worth of ETH, you can farm ETH-USDT at 2x leverage by borrowing $10,000 worth of USDT; or, farm ETH-BNB at 2x leverage by borrowing $10,000 worth of BNB. You are “holding with leveraged yields” because you actually have not leveraged up the exposure to your holding asset, but you will be earning 2x leveraged farming yields. When you stop farming, you simply return the borrowed tokens.

However, by earning this additional yield, you do assume some risk of impermanent loss (IL). The graph below shows how your equity will change when the price of ETH (the non-borrowed token) changes. When holding ETH in your wallet (dotted black line in figure below), your equity linearly correlates with ETH price. When farming an ETH-token pair without considering yields (solid black line), your equity is worse off than if you had just held ETH (which is commonly known as impermanent loss). However, when considering the 2x farming yields you’d be receiving over time(green line), your profits compared to simply holding would be higher in total if the held token did not appreciate significantly over a short period. **Therefore, leveraged yield farming is best used as a long-term strategy.**

If you farm a token pair with ETH and a non-stablecoin at 2x leverage (borrowing the non-stablecoin), changes in price of the borrowed token will also result in some impermanent loss (blue line = +25% change in borrowed token; red line = -25% change in borrowed token). But, again, the earned 2x yields over time oftentimes make up for this. (You can play with these models and emulate your profit/losses on a publicly available [Yield Farming Emulator](https://www.alpaca-mate.info/) and [Calculator ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pHFfo_Pe66VD59bTP2wsSAgK-DNE_Xic8HEIUY32uQ/edit#gid=0)from Alpaca Finance.)

#### Strategy 2: Leveraged Long

If you are confidently bullish on a token (e.g., ETH), you can consider farming an ETH-token pair at &gt;2x leverage, borrowing the token opposite ETH. By doing that, you will be leveraged long on ETH. For example, if you hold $10,000 worth of ETH, you can farm ETH-USDT at 3x leverage, borrowing $20,000 worth of USDT. $5000 worth of USDT will be swapped for ETH to make a 50:50 farming pair ($15,000 worth of ETH + $15,000 worth of USDT). In this situation, at 3x leverage, you will be 1.5x leveraged long on ETH.

You can also farm an ETH-(non-stablecoin) pair like ETH-BNB at 3x leverage, borrowing $20,000 worth of BNB. Again, $5000 worth of BNB will be swapped for ETH to make a 50:50 farming pair. But because $5000 worth of the borrowed BNB is sold, you will have a small short position on BNB. Whenever you use &gt;2x leverage, you will have a slight short position on the borrowed token, which gives you extra options in customizing your position. Of course, if you don’t want to worry about shorting, you can borrow a stablecoin which is effectively neutral since the price can be reliably expected to maintain its stable peg.

The graph below shows how your equity will change when ETH (the non-borrowed token) or the borrowed token (either USDT or BNB) changes. Compared to simply holding ETH (dotted black line), your equity without considering yields (solid black line) will outperform when ETH rises because you’d be 1.5x leveraged on ETH; when considering yields (green line), your profits would be even greater. If the borrowed token price rises, you’d lose equity (red line) because you have a slight short on it. And if it drops, you actually profit (blue line).

\*Green line assumes yield farming APR + trading fees APR at 1x leverage of 25%, borrowing interest APR of 15%, platform rewards APR of 10%, and a 90-day farming duration.

#### Strategy 4: Hedged Market-Neutral

If you are conservative, you could create positions where you’d have neutral or near neutral exposure to the volatile crypto market, while still capturing gains from yield farming. 

The simplest method to have zero market exposure is to leveraged farm stablecoin-stablecoin pairs (up to 6x leverage) to earn up to 50% APY, which is among the highest yield for stablecoins across all DeFi chains.

In addition, there are two other methods to capture even higher yields while maintaining *near neutral* exposure to the crypto markets. They involve farming crypto-stablecoin pairs such as ETH-USDT, which generally have higher APYs than stablecoin-stablecoin pairs.

The first method (similar to Strategy 1) is quite simple: if the BNB-BUSD farming yield is looking attractive, you could deposit the stablecoin (BUSD) and borrow the volatile asset (BNB) at 2x leverage. You’d have zero crypto exposure at position opening (although it could shift through asset rebalancing if BNB price moved), while capturing 2x farming yields. 

The second method combines Strategy 2 and 3. You’d create two positions: (1) a leveraged long position on a crypto asset and (2) a short position on the same asset. Then, in aggregate, their exposures would cancel out. We call this pseudo delta-neutral because it is a delta neutral strategy, but LP rebalancing will slightly move your position away from true neutral as prices shift, which may require some management to keep the positions neutral.

Let’s use the ETH-USDT farm (using 3x leverage) to give an example setup. For Position#1 (using Strategy 2), deposit $10,000 worth of tokens and borrow $20,000 worth of USDT (3x leverage) – you will be farming $15,000 ETH + $15,000 USDT and you will be long on $15,000 worth of ETH. 

For Position#2 (using Strategy 3), deposit $30,000 worth of tokens and borrow $60,000 worth of ETH (3x leverage) – you will be farming $45,000 ETH + $45,000 USDT and you will be short on $15,000 worth of ETH. The two positions’ exposures on ETH would cancel out and you’d be earning 3x yields on $40,000 with near-neutral market exposure.

The graph below shows how your equity would change when the price of ETH (the asset token) moves. Without considering yields (black line), if ETH price changed, you’d lose equity due to LP rebalancing(impermanent loss). When considering yields over time though, you will generally see profits. For the first method (one position at 2x leverage), the curve is flatter and broader than the second method (two positions at 3x leverage); you don’t earn as much, but the position is a bit more resilient to ETH price changes. For both methods, only large changes in ETH price would negatively affect your equity. To many, pseudo-delta neutral strategies offer gains that outweigh the risks and may be preferred over farming stable-stablecoin pairs.

\*Colored lines assume yield farming APR + trading fees APR at 1x leverage of 25%, borrowing interest APR of 15%, platform rewards APR of 10%, and a 90-day farming duration.

#### Conclusion

As the above strategies demonstrate, leveraged yield farming is a flexible tool which can accommodate a variety of trading strategies and market conditions. So regardless of if you’re bullish, bearish or uncertain, and whether you’re considering taking a position on a particular token or the market as a whole, leveraged yield farming can help you customize your position and earn high yields in almost any setup.

Cardano and Real Finance is a Great Fit,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/plfoor/cardano_and_real_finance_is_a_great_fit/,Cardanians,1,2021-09-10 14:37:58,1,/r/cardano/comments/plfoor/cardano_and_real_finance_is_a_great_fit/,Education," Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the most promising emerging sector in the cryptocurrency space. However, this sector lacks the necessary stability and reliability, two crucial prerequisites for further adoption. Cardano can bring DeFi to mainstream users and thus create real finance (RealFi). 

 

# Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies might be two different things

Many people mistakenly believe that cryptocurrencies are a suitable tool for a new financial revolution based on blockchain. The reality is that blockchain is a perfect fit for the world of finance. Unfortunately, native coin projects have little use in the world of finance. If a blockchain network is to be decentralized, it needs native coins that are used as a vehicle to reach that goal. Thus, the decentralization of the Cardano network grows along with the distribution of ADA coins among new users and the emergence of new pools. ADA coins are and will be highly volatile in the future. As the importance of the network grows, the price of ADA coins is likely to grow as well. What the value will be in 10 or 20 years, no one can accurately predict today. Since growth is expected, people mostly hold the coins as a speculative asset.

It is similar for all other projects. If the coins were stable in value, there would not be so much demand for them regarding speculation. Without the ability to do something with such stable coins, there would be no demand from this side either. ADA coins will be used for project management and also generate passive income for the holders. If the network is used, the fees will go from the hands of the users to the coin holders. The speculative nature and the desire for decision rights are important parts of the decentralization of the project.

Speculation always brings price instability. In the beginning, people assumed that cryptocurrencies would be money. That assumption turned out to be wrong and made no sense economically. The world of finance needs stability and predictability. Money has two key parameters, it is a unit of account and also a unit of exchange. People must be willing to spend money or invest it for the long term. For this to work, the value of money must ideally be stable or at least maintain an approximate value in the long run. Money is not necessarily an ideal store of value. There is no asset in the world that meets all three of the basic requirements of good money. That is, it is a good store of value and a good unit of account and unit of exchange.

Some economists believe that a store of value cannot also be a unit of account. The demand for a store of value will fluctuate over economic cycles and people will always prefer to spend other money rather than what they are saving for a rainy day. The unit of account cannot be volatile, and we cannot determine the price of goods based on how scarce money is at any given time. Increasing the value of a scarce resource would reduce the price of goods and vice versa.

Cryptocurrencies derive their value from digital scarcity. Because the number of coins in a given monetary policy of a blockchain project is rigid, it will never be stable. Even though the monetary expansion curve may be known in advance, it does not mean that the price of coins will be stable. Rather, what we can observe in practice is that new cycles may emerge in which the price fluctuates by tens of percent. Predictability cannot ensure stability. This is due to the fact that a fixed monetary expansion curve cannot respond flexibly to the fluctuations and needs of the real world.

There is no stabilizing mechanism and the value of cryptocurrencies is based on current demand, which will never be stable. Demand will be influenced by many external events that cannot be predicted in advance. When something bad suddenly happens in the world, the prices of most commodities can plummet. However, the value of money and good prices cannot fluctuate according to market sentiment, as this would have an immediate and direct effect on the purchasing power of the population.

Blockchain as a technology is an excellent tool for creating a global financial infrastructure. Blockchain is essentially a global immutable database in which all transactions are instantly available to the rest of the world. All coins, assets, and tokens are owned by the users themselves and never by a third party. If a third party is in play, it will be a smart contract whose behavior is predictable in advance and whose evaluation is automatic. The parties involved have voluntarily agreed to its use. There will be no need to look for a trusted intermediary in the physical world for the custody service, as the smart contract can do the same job cheaper, more reliably, and with complete transparency.

Blockchain is natively a global network, so it will never be a problem that a service is only available somewhere in the world. No one decides on availability and there are no economic interests at stake. You could say that Cardano connects people all over the world today. Anyone can install a wallet and start interacting economically with their surroundings. Now we need to further develop this infrastructure and deliver real financial services.

Every blockchain network is for people to interact with each other financially and for ownership of wealth to remain in the hands of users who can dispose of it freely. This cannot be replaced by centralized parties holding cryptocurrencies for people, as their services are cheaper and faster. These parties are always subject to regulation and most importantly, all the benefits that blockchain offers are lost.

Blockchain as a financial infrastructure and volatile native coins of projects are two things that can’t do without each other but discourage mainstream users from using financial services. Ordinary people on the street have no desire to speculate on the cost of the projects they use. Just like they don’t hold shares in the banks they have an account with, or shares in Google, which they use every day. Financial services have to do without volatility. For Cardano, as a platform, this is an easy target.

It would be naive to think that all the people in the world will own ADA coins and just so they can be part of the decentralized financial revolution. It’s probably an unattainable goal to convince the majority of the population to use one blockchain project as the new form of money. Even more so if that asset is volatile and thus unusable for anything other than financial speculation. People would essentially have to exchange this asset for the money they use now. That means they would have to be able to use the new money immediately. It’s okay for the decentralized infrastructure of the world to be owned and decided upon by maybe only 5–10% of the population holding ADA coins. It doesn’t necessarily have to be all users, provided the infrastructure works well and everyone benefits from it. If there is a problem with this arrangement in the future, it will be possible to change the balance of power. Let us not be closed-minded in thinking that everything that is done today must be the same in 10 years’ time. We will have to take good care of decentralization and develop it as necessary.

Most people on the planet are not interested in speculation, either because they don’t have the spare funds to do so, or it is not their life goal or interest. People from poor countries would be the last ones to participate in such a revolution. The purchasing power of westerners will always be higher. The wealth disparity between people living in developing and developed countries would be perhaps even worse than today. This is certainly not what we would want from decentralized finance. The new world of finance is not about early adopters getting rich at the expense of the rest of the population. We should stop believing the false narrative that people will buy new money and stop being citizens of their countries. Blockchain, as new financial infrastructure, and Cardano, as a global financial and operating system, is surely meant to do more than that.

# The road to stability

It is hard to find something in the world that can maintain its stable value on its own. This is because many phenomena are interconnected and this constantly changes supply and demand. Stability is expected from gold, but even its value fluctuates slightly according to the mood of the markets in the short term. Movements of tens of percent within a year are possible. Fiat currencies in developed countries are relatively stable in terms of purchasing power but at the cost of some effort by monetary banks to maintain this stability. Sometimes control can get out of hand and unexpectedly high inflation can occur.

The scarcity of a resource will never be a guarantee of price stability. A scarce resource is useful as a store of value, but there is different demand for this property in different economic cycles. Our world is too complex for the demand for commodities to be stable. Let us illustrate with an example. In a crisis, there will be less production, so, for example, the price of metals will fall, but the price of gold will rise. People will try to preserve value in a crisis and the value of fiat currencies may fluctuate. Once the crisis has passed, the demand for metals will rise, but the price of gold may fall. Gold will be sold to invest in metals. New products will be made from metals.

The road to stability is likely to lead only through a controlled process that derives stability from a basket of commodities and stable currencies. It is possible to create a digital asset whose value will be stable relative to other assets. The portfolio must be suitably constructed so that the individual components are as independent of each other as possible. It is thus possible to create a stable coin whose value will be more stable than many national currencies.

If the dominance of the current financial giants is to be disrupted at the global level, the same tools are needed as now exist. The only difference will be that these new instruments will honor the ideals of decentralization. One of the most important building blocks is certainly a stable coin. Finance can only work well if it is stable.

# What is Finance

Finance is definitely not about people sending volatile coins to each other. It makes no economic sense and it’s not good for payments as well. If you wanted to pay with a volatile cryptocurrency for a phone, for example, the thought process would be as follows. Find out the value of the phone, which would be expressed in the national stable fiat currency. Assess the price against other goods and your financial capabilities. You could then exchange some of your cryptocurrency for fiat currency and pay. You cannot use cryptocurrency directly as a unit of account in this process because you cannot evaluate the real price of the phone correctly and with a full context. Moreover, if the price were expressed in cryptocurrency, it would constantly fluctuate up and down according to the mood of the market. Normal buying would also eventually become just speculation and waiting for a better price. This is not how a complex economy can work. If we were to call this by its proper name, it would be the sale of an investment asset or the realization of a profit in order to purchase consumer goods. Unless you are in profit, you probably won’t want to do business this way. At least that’s how the majority of the population will perceive it.

A one-off transfer of value has nothing to do with the world of finance in the true sense of the word. Or rather, it plays only a marginal role. Finance is a broad term that describes activities related to banking, leverage or debt, credit, capital markets, money, and investments. Funding is basically money management and the process of raising the necessary funds. These are essential financial operations that are absolutely essential for economics. If we are unable to carry out these operations, we cannot talk about a financial revolution. The key parameter of these financial operations is the stability of the currency in which they are carried out. Since these are operations that last for a long period of time, even several years, any volatility would damage one of the partners in the contract. This is clearly undesirable. It makes sense to use blockchain for these operations, as these operations are a superstructure over money. Almost every adult on the planet has experience with a loan or mortgage. Or has at least thought about it. The problem with volatile cryptocurrencies is that they can’t perform these operations. This is the obvious difference between money in the true sense of the word and speculative investment.

Let’s take an example. Let’s say someone wanted a loan to buy a car, which they would pay back regularly every month for 3 years. The lender would provide the money to buy the car, which the buyer could immediately use for his business and earn the repayments. Let’s say the car costs $50,000 and the lender commits to pay $1,450 over 36 months. In total, the borrower would pay off 52,200 USD. In the normal world of finance, thousands of such contracts are made every day. The borrower can predict whether he will be able to repay the debt. In the worst case, he can sell the car and thus get rid of a significant part of the obligation. Could the same be done with a volatile cryptocurrency?

The amount of USD 1,450 will be the same, or at least approximately the same value, in 3 years. It is likely that a citizen living in the US will be able to earn that amount and have enough to pay off the debt. In the case of cryptocurrency, unfortunately, it does not work that way. If ADA was worth $1.50 at the time the loan was closed, the lender would have provided 33,333 ADA coins to the borrower. On the same terms as the dollar, the borrower would repay about 966 ADA coins per month. This is a value equivalent to USD 1,450. Now imagine if the price of ADA coins went up from $1.5 to $10 over 2 years. That would be about a six-fold appreciation of ADA coins. If the borrower still had to repay 966 ADA coins, that would be $9,660 per month. In just six such payments, the borrower would pay off $57,960, which is more than the price of the car at the time he took out the loan. The borrower would likely go bankrupt because he would not be able to pay off the car. The lender would have grown enormously and, more importantly, undeservedly rich on the loan or would not have seen the repayment. It wouldn’t work the other way around either. If the price of ADA coins fell, it would be beneficial to the borrower, who would more easily pay off the debt. The lender would be at a disadvantage because it would get less in dollar value. For example, he would not be able to buy half a car even if the borrower would have paid off the entire loan.

Volatility in the world of finance would have fatal consequences for the economy. No one would be able to borrow for business. People with money would lose the ability to easily expand their wealth by borrowing money. Some would get rich and others would go bankrupt. The whole decentralized finance sector could disappear, as it would be found that it cannot bring anything functional to the real economy.

Finance is about the long term in which one party provides money to another party. It’s about working with debit and credit, or it can be about long-term investing. Financial transactions have one thing in common. It is a certain algorithm involving multiple parties who transfer value to each other according to certain rules. In its basic essence, it is just a numbers game.

Many contracts are already automated in the traditional financial world. Identities are verified at the bank, bank account details are provided and terms are set. For a conventional loan, the scenario is as follows. One party receives a large sum of money to make the purchase. It could be a house, a car, or just money for a business. This amount has to be repaid over an agreed time, including interest on the loan. In practice, the borrower sends the money to a given bank account regularly by a certain date. If it is late, someone notices and sends a reminder. The legal system ensures that the borrower is forced to repay the amount borrowed.

# Blockchain and Finance

Blockchain and smart contracts are a perfect fit for the world of finance. Entering into a contract is always a multi-party act that includes the terms of the contract and the identification of the parties. Cardano will allow participants to create a decentralized identity through Atala PRISM. Entering into a contract is just a matter of creating or finding a suitable smart contract and deploying it. All financial flows within the contract will be written in the blockchain. with all the necessary details. The mission of the blockchain is to record transactions. Smart contracts will allow multiple transactions to be combined into a single context. A smart contract can react to events and automatically fulfill the terms of the contract.

As we have shown above, it is always economically disadvantageous for one party to borrow ADA coins for a longer time horizon and try to repay the loan gradually. Once you replace ADA coins with stable coins or digital currencies issued by central banks, Cardano literally becomes a global financial operating system. The difference between Cardano and traditional financial services lies in the use of blockchain and decentralization. Most commercial banks operate on a local level with a local currency. Banks dictate their own terms for loans, including interest rates. It is difficult for banks and expensive for customers if the loan is to be international. For example, it is not common to make a loan between a European and an African. The power of a global decentralized network is that it can connect people across continents and no one can prevent this cooperation. That does not necessarily mean that people cannot be involved in the cooperation. They can and probably will. Reputation, risk assessment, and identity verification in creating the digital one will still depend on people. Cardano needs to be seen as a vehicle for financial transactions and these will always be about people first and foremost. The only difference is that smart contracts and blockchain addresses will be used instead of paper contracts and bank accounts. If there is a dispute between the parties, the legal system will be available as a judge of last resort. If, for example, real estate is to be part of the contract, it will still be necessary to cooperate with the authorities. It is only a matter of time before the authorities learn to use modern technology and are willing to provide data via Oracles. It is likely that the first cadastral offices in developing countries will be established directly on the blockchain.

In the traditional world of finance, a bank or a lender has no right to force a borrower to pay. Only an entity authorized to do so under a given country’s social contract can do so. It is important to remember that blockchain is not here to resolve all sorts of disputes. If only digital assets are in play, the smart contract will be able to take them as collateral and use them to settle the outstanding debt. This can work entirely without a legal system and disputes can be resolved exactly as it is defined in smart contracts. When it is needed to punish the debtor or deprive him of physical assets, the intervention of the authorities will be necessary. Blockchain, like a conventional database, can only record transactions. Moreover, Cardano will be able to automatically execute smart contracts and do similar work that a bank would do. That is enough to disrupt the traditional banking sector.

People sometimes mistakenly operate with the idea that everything around blockchain technology must be completely anonymous and independent from the outside world. As we suggested above, without the interconnection of the physical and digital worlds, we are unable to create the stability we need for finance. Financial services need to work with liabilities and these may not be settled by the parties involved. Failures to settle liabilities can occur for many reasons. Either the failure of individuals or external causes may be involved. The legal system needs accurate information about the contract, and blockchain can provide this instantly, accurately, and without the possibility of the data being altered.

It is good to know the possibilities and limits of the tools we use. Many people have exaggerated expectations of blockchain. Replacing people in financial processes will be a gradual process and at the moment we don’t know how successful we will be. However, we are confident that changes and improvements are possible.

# Real Finance

The world of real finance exists, but it is mediated by traditional banking services or other intermediaries. It is therefore mainly available in developed countries, but even there it is not accessible to all people living in that country. The problem that decentralization solves is accessibility and openness. With Cardano, financial services will be available in developing countries and all the people of the world can be financially connected. Financial inclusion and meeting the “bank the unbanked” narrative is the ultimate goal for the Cardano project. It must be stressed that at the moment people are not even financially connected. If you don’t have a bank account, you can hardly send money to your relative who lives in the next village. If people have access to the internet, they can instantly set up a Cardano wallet and essentially get their first financial account.

If people do not have their identity, they can hardly apply for a fair loan. They may have an unfair loan available in the local context. Real finance is about making sure that all people have the same or similar conditions for starting or running a business. Once people have their financial account and identity, they can get loans from people in Western countries. The transfer of finance from developed countries to developing countries can really help people a lot to change their living conditions. Banks from western countries and in a way the countries themselves have failed to build something like this because they were only looking at their economic interests. Cardano is a global infrastructure that will be simply everywhere under the condition the Internet is available.

It’s also about making people from Western countries see decentralized lending as a relevant option. Borrowing funds to buy a car is possible through a bank. Peer-to-Peer lending must be an adequate option and must be risk-free in terms of the functioning and reliability of the technology. The needs of people from developing countries are diametrically opposed to those of people from Western countries. People from Western countries have relatively stable currencies and can take out loans for their businesses. They can send money to their friends relatively easily, or pay for goods online. In developing countries, the fact that there will be some financial infrastructure will be a big change. People will have access to stable coins and thus be able to preserve their wealth against inflation. It is possible that many poor countries will issue their national currency on the blockchain as this will be the easiest option. Here again, Cardano can play an important role as a platform that can issue tokens. If not, integration and tokenization will allow people to use financial services on Cardano with their national currencies.

Being able to send value between each other cheaply and quickly can help developing countries significantly. The need to build and use financial services comes second. It is important to remember that first-generation cryptocurrencies have no chance of delivering what Cardano can provide. Sending volatile value between each other makes less economic sense than sending stable value, essentially money. As we have shown in the example above, financial services cannot be built at all with volatile cryptocurrencies. Sending ADA coins to each other may be fine at first. People will be happy with an option that maybe they didn’t have before. However, once the price fluctuations come, it stops being fun. People will start speculating on the price and that will necessarily hinder development in terms of mutual financial interaction. In addition, poor people tolerate these fluctuations worse than rich westerners. Westerners are more likely to look for financial opportunities to invest. People from developing countries need a stable financial infrastructure. These are two quite diametrically opposed things. Blockchain is definitely a technology that can deliver that infrastructure.

# A broader change

The world needs to make fundamental changes in the world of finance, and these will also affect the way people think. The narrative of endless growth must be replaced by a new narrative, and that is the narrative of long-term sustainability. Companies, for example, cannot just strive for profits that benefit a small group around management. Companies must prioritize the long-term sustainability of their business with regard to social welfare and the ecosystem. Societal pressures can force companies not to strive to make a huge profit and rather to align corporate interests with social and environmental concerns. This is, however, easy to say but harder to do. Anyway, it should be our common goal. Greater transparency of financial flows can facilitate this endeavor and blockchain can be helpful here too.

It is possible that in the new economy the tax structure will be completely changed. The economy should work in such a way that a business that does not work will disappear and be replaced by a business that works. Failure must be accepted as the normal state of affairs. The system must make it easier to start a new attempt at business.

It is necessary to think more about the redundancy and necessity of specific expenditures. This is better done in a local context. That is, in a decentralized way. It will probably be necessary to take most decision-making power away from central authorities and decentralize it more to smaller autonomous units. This can happen at the level of local governments and companies. If the interests of people and nature are prioritized in a local context, everything can work better as a whole.

Tokenization can completely change the way we look at project ownership and management. We are technologically ready for it, and voting will expand the possibilities even further. Now it’s just about redefining the social contract. Technology alone will not force change, but it can serve as a tool to enable change.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that offices can communicate fully digitally when necessary. Offices have often operated analog, i.e. through paper documents and the need to physically visit the office. Greater digitization also goes hand in hand with decentralization.

Blockchain is a fundamental technology and will impact the way the world works. If blockchain succeeds, it can also be seen as a success for the concept of decentralization. It may have a greater impact on the structure of states than we can currently acknowledge. Technology can influence people’s thinking and it can be the cause of greater changes in society. At the moment, however, everything is open.

# Conclusion

The first generation of cryptocurrencies is not suited to the world of real finance because of the high volatility that they will probably never get rid of. Maybe decades from now, but even then it’s not certain that they’ll be good sound money. Real finance requires much more than the ability to send value from Adam to Alice. The economy needs to work with debit and credit, and it can’t do that without long-term stability of money. Cardano will enable the necessary functionality to be built and can become a global financial operating system. For this, scalability is also essential. Blockchain is useful precisely in that transactions are irreversibly written and available to the whole world. This is where privacy can come into play, and it is just a matter of improving the technology. Once transactions are moved to second layers, the whole magic of blockchain as a financial infrastructure is lost. Blockchain is a ledger and the goal is to use it for exactly that purpose, accounting. Accounting and volatility are not compatible with each other. The cryptocurrency world is riddled with a lot of false expectations and narratives that make no economic sense. It is good to call a spade a spade and look for uses where it makes sense. Digital scarcity can be a good investment, but it is largely speculative. First-generation cryptocurrencies don’t scale well and they will never be a good ledger for the developing but also the western world. Cardano can handle the volatility and maybe it is one of the projects that is a great fit for accounting and transforming the world of finance. Both will find their uses. But let’s not mix these things together and have false expectations that one project can deliver everything we need.

Digital scarcity has made it possible to create a store of value and perhaps a new monetary system of sorts. However, the monetary system cannot function well without the fiscal system, and the latter is primarily about financial stabilization. For the economy to function well, we need to align a monetary and fiscal policy. Stability requires observation of the outside world and decision-making. Perhaps this can be automated to some extent. Fiscal policy needs to work with a unit of account that is also a unit of exchange. A global decentralized stable coin whose value would be derived by a basket of commodities and fiat currencies could be the next big thing in a world of decentralization. Cardano can deliver something like this, giving a whole new meaning to the public blockchain network, as it would enable decentralization at the fiscal policy level. A volatile asset will hardly bring stability to developing countries, or to countries whose currency has high inflation. This is a job for a stable asset. Cardano will allow people to create and use such an asset."
Cardano can unleash the potential of blockchain,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/plfur7/cardano_can_unleash_the_potential_of_blockchain/,Cardanians,1,2021-09-10 14:51:43,2,/r/cardano/comments/plfur7/cardano_can_unleash_the_potential_of_blockchain/,Education," Scalability and utility are the main prerequisites to use blockchain technologies for economic and social activities. The main focus is put on decentralization and security but users take it for granted and above all, they require fast and useful services. 

 

# The network effect is the key to success

Would it be an email service useful if only you could use it and nobody else had no idea what that is? Definitely not and you would not probably care much about it as well. If you could write an email to your friends and family then the utility of the service would be significantly better. What if you could write to whomever you wish? Then the email service would become one of the most important services in the world. As you probably know, it happened. To exchange information quickly and cheaply on longer distances is a commonality nowadays but it was a revolution a few decades ago. People started to use electronic email communication and basically left the traditional mailing services that became slow, unreliable, and expensive.

Is email the predominant service today? Hard to say. The email service has a lot of competitors like chat services or social networks. Some people are daily on Facebook or Twitter but check their inbox once a week. It can be faster to send a direct message via a messenger than to send an email. People can choose from many different services based on their preferences. There is no ultimate winner. Evolution is a mother of progress. There will probably never be a single winner for a longer period of time.

Once we mastered sending information via many different protocols and added security features to ensure private communication between counterparties, we were able to transfer value in a digital manner as well. Money was digitized, or in the jargon of cryptocurrencies, tokenized. We do not need to use physical banknotes or coins. We are able to pay electronically. Hence, we can exchange digital value for physical goods. We have digitized not only money but many other assets. You can own gold digitally. In the case you trust a third party you can own and spend gold or Tesla shares via the Internet.

Adoption of technologies takes time. Users must trust new technology and they need to learn how to use it. Sometimes, there are some economical barriers. The best technology is such that it is for free and easy to use. A few early adopters start using technology and when it shows up that it is useful and beneficial others gradually join the group of users.

The network effect is a phenomenon whereby the increasing number of users has a direct impact on the growth and the utility of the service or product. When the network effect grows then also the financial and social value grows. A given user derives more value from service as other users join the same network. Especially in the case of a network aimed at communication between participants, every new user increases the value of the network for all others.

Cardano is a distributed network that provides decentralized services to users. Likewise to email service, the value of blockchain services will grow with the number of users. For example, you can wish to send ADA to your neighbor but it is possible only in the case that he or she has installed a Cardano wallet and is able to provide you with a Cardano address for the deposit.

The majority of people in the developed countries have a bank account. You can be nearly sure that your neighbor has one and you can send him fiat money. At the moment, the adoption of cryptocurrencies, in general, is very low. It can take a decade then at least half of the population will have installed a cryptocurrency wallet. It can be said that the network effect of Cardano and all other major networks is low. It is ok. Blockchain technology must mature similarly to many internet services that also needed to mature before mass adoption. The ultimate goal is to increase the network effect of Cardano.

# Scalability is needed to increase the network effect

The majority of users perceive services as a set of qualities that might be useful for them. The very basic service of blockchain technology is a Peer-to-Peer transactional network. Users are able to exchange value in a decentralized way. As we said, the utility of the service will grow with the number of entities that are able to accept the value. The network effect is important but it is not the only metric that matters when it comes to adoption. The quality of service is also important.

When too many people start using a service, congestion of the network can occur. Having too many users on the same network service can slow the speed of the network and decrease the benefit for users. The adoption depends primarily on the network effect and the network effect depends on the scalability of the network. It must be ensured that capacity can be increased sufficiently to accommodate all users. In the case of a decentralized network, it is a challenge. The current major blockchain networks face scalability issues. Transaction settlements are not only slow but users have to pay a lot for them. This is not definitely a service that would be ready for mass adoption.

Cardano, like many other blockchain projects, is naturally a global network. A public blockchain is not like a local service for a limited number of users. It is a global network where literally everyone on the planet can become a user. The population of our planet is nearly 8 billion. If only 1% of the population wanted to use Cardano for making at least 1 transaction a day then the network would have to process 80 million transactions every day. To serve 1% of the population, Cardano would need to process approximately 1000 transactions per second. The problem is that 1% of the population is a very low number of users. The network effect would be also low and thus, also the value of the network. It is needed to realize that 80 million is a lot of people if they all were in one place. The adopters of cryptocurrencies are scattered everywhere on the planet. Hence, if the adoption of cryptocurrencies in your country is 1% then only 1 person from 100 will be probably willing to accept ADA. 20% adoption in one country or city would start to be interesting from the network effect point of view. However, it would mean that Cardano would have to process approximately 20,000 transactions per second. It is likely that once the adoption reaches 16%, it will continue to grow since the early majority is the next group on the adoption curve. This group makes 34% of the population. The higher adoption will be beneficial for the network effect but it will also make high demands on the qualities of the blockchain networks.

It is obvious that we will need to develop second-layer solutions to handle such a big amount of transactions. Hydra is the second layer solution for Cardano. Hydra will be able to take over not only transactions but also the execution of smart contracts. Teams of every major blockchain network build something similar. It must be noted that second layers will never be the ultimate scalability solution. The scalability of the first layers must be also high as it is the major settlement layer and the highest source of truth.

Currently, we hold cryptocurrencies mostly for trading and speculations and we use centralized services. The mission of Cardano is to start using blockchain for real economic activities. That is why scalability is such an important topic. Building a network that is global from the beginning is challenging since it is hard to estimate the network traffic and it is technologically difficult to design the network in a way that it can handle it. Network effect and scalability will go hand in hand. If we really want to send Peer-to-Peer transactions to our neighbors, scalability is the key. In other words, a given service that runs upon a global network must succeed in a local context.

It means that the adoption rate might not be the same globally in given countries or geographical regions. For example, Cardano can massively succeed in one country in Africa for a locally specific reason and the adoption can be let’s say 50%. In other countries, it can be 5%. A nice example of that is the adoption of Cardano in Ethiopia. The government decided to adopt Cardano to improve the education sector. It is probably just the beginning. If the project succeeds then it is highly probable that surrounding countries will naturally adopt the same network. The Cardano infrastructure is available everywhere so adoption can be relatively fast. Once services work in one country it will be easy to use the same in other countries. It is the advantage of a global network.

Local economic activities can benefit from a global network that is unstoppable and the ledger is immutable. The utility of that can differ in a given local context and developing countries will probably be the early adopters. Cardano can be a trusted entity for many local contexts basically everywhere. As a benefit, all local activities are naturally available around the planet. For example, if you have a decentralized ID (DID) created via Atala PRISM, you will have the ID everywhere in the world. The same money. You can have your country currency in a wallet and quickly swap it for other currency that you need when you travel.

Among other topics, scalability is topic number one regarding adoption. New users will be judging the speed and price of transactions. The second layer solutions will probably be the major players when it comes to increasing the network effect. Overall, users will judge the quality of services and not the level of security or decentralization. These qualities are too abstract and hard to understand for the majority of users. Moreover, they take them for granted. End-users will want to easily install wallets and reliably consume services.

# More services mean more utility

The transaction service with native tokens is not the only service that blockchain can offer. At least, in the case of Cardano, you can expect much more. Besides ADA coins, users can issue and transact with other tokens. It opens the door for many other services and utilities.

Issuing tokens that are globally available and users can really own them similarly as money in their wallets is a powerful tool. We have never had something similar before since client-server architecture is not able to let you really own coins and tokens. We have experienced the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze around 2017. After that, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications appeared and now we are in the middle of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) mania. All these concepts are sound. Despite many scams that could be expected in a non-regulated environment, we can perceive it as a success.

Teams were able to collect funds for their ICO projects on a global level. We can name a few problems with the first wave of ICO. Teams bore no accountability for the delivery of promised projects and received the whole funds right away from the collection. Moreover, the team could collect money anonymously. In some cases, it was not necessary to reveal real identity. For the next wave, we will have a solution. Collected funds will stay locked in a smart contract and people will be able to vote about releasing a part of it for the next time period. When the majority of investors will not be satisfied with the results they can get the rest of the fund back. It will be easy to write a more complex smart contract and allow investors to vote on the Cardano platform. Moreover, Atala PRISM can be used to work with verified identities of the team members. It can be expected that the next wave of ICO, or other similar collective funding, will be more trusty, reliable, and protect investors. If the industry faces regulations, it is more probable that this form of ICO will satisfy the requirements.

The DeFi sector has similar problems as ICO. Anonymous individuals or teams can issue functionality via smart contracts with no accountability. The functionality of services is often buggy since it is relatively difficult to write secure and reliable smart contracts. Moreover, many teams test the application right in the production. Hence, many users lost a lot of money. In addition, the current DeFi platforms are clogged and are not able to handle a big amount of transactions. Fees are too high for ordinary users to play with applications. As a result, trust in DeFi application has not crossed the cryptocurrency industry. Cardano has a solution for DeFi as well. Plutus allows developers to write much more reliable smart contracts and test them before going live. Cardano already has Proof-of-Stake consensus and is more scalable than the current major platforms. Once Hydra is rolled out it will probably take over a significant part of transactions and execution of smart contracts.

The NFT industry is booming but it is questionable whether it is successful or not. Issuers mostly create digital images and link them with tokens. They then sell the tokens that represent the images. Buyers become owners of tokens but are they really owners of the images? Owners can use the images in their profiles or as wallpapers. If people download an image they can use it without a token. The NFT industry needs some improvements. For now, it is quite ok that people play with NFT and learn how to use the infrastructure and wallets.

In our view, the NFT industry needs to be bonded with the legal system to protect owners and ensure copyrights. Then, it will have the sense to have a token that will represent physical arts, or buy digital arts or items. In the digital world, NFT needs some additional infrastructure that will allow the consumption of digital art. For example, we can imagine a platform that allows users to play a song or video for a small payment. The platform will automatically send all payments to owners of tokens that represent digital art. An author of a song, Alice, can tokenize it. Alice will also be the first owner of the token and offer the song via a decentralized platform. Users will pay for listening to the song and Alice will receive payments. When Alice sells the tokens to Bob, Bob will receive the payments. Alice can sell only half of the token. Thus, Alice and Bob will receive half of the payments.

People can steal the song and replay it over and over for free. It usually happens nowadays and blockchain is not a solution for stealing digital arts. Some people are willing to pay authors and some not. The willingness can differ from country to country. Anyway, the legal system should prevent offering the song on other pirate platforms. What blockchain can do, is the decentralization of the service and avoid the middleman that would own the platform and take profit from authors and listeners. In theory, if the platform would be for free, then authors could receive 100% of payments. In reality, the authors of the platform will probably charge minor profits for usage. However, it can be cheaper than it usually is. Let’s add that it is generally hard to compete with existing services but it is another story. We just wanted to predict how the NFT industry could look like in the future.

What is important for our article, all mentioned sectors succeeded regarding network effect. It can be expected that these sectors will be transformed and they have the potential to be even more successful in the future. In every case, they are not going to disappear. It should be said that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is in general very low so many ideas and services failed not because they are conceptually bad but because they were not adopted or used by a sufficient number of users. Teams tried to offer brand new decentralized services but sectors lacked demand.

We can observe that for the very basic service of cryptocurrencies. As we said, it is the payment. Let’s quietly assume that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is not a problem. If a local merchant accepts payment by cryptocurrencies then probably not more than 1% of customers will use it. You can imagine how difficult it is for a team to push through other services. With a higher adoption and awareness about cryptocurrencies and other services, the number of users will also naturally rise. It will go hand in hand with maturing of technology.

They are services for which a global context is good. For example, offering a song globally via a decentralized platform is a good idea and it does not matter that service is used mostly by teenagers that are scattered around the world. There are other services, for which a local context with an overlap to a global context is important. Ethiopia decided to create identities of students via Cardano and Atala PRISM. One day, the majority of Ethiopians can have such an identity. They will use it in the local context, in Ethiopia, but they can travel and use their digital ID (DID) elsewhere in the world. They can use the identity for other services that Cardano can offer. Citizens can collectively fund a repair of a church and use real identities. Farmers can offer their products on a global market and buyers from westerns countries can verify that they are real farmers. The loan business can work without excessive collateral and it will be possible to fund the business of Ethiopians from western countries. Do not forget the payment industry. If a local currency was issued on Cardano as well then all payments in Ethiopia would go through blockchain and Hydra.

# Building and replacement of the old infrastructure

We need more pieces of Lego to build other blockchain services. Every new piece will bring new utility and thus also higher security and reliability. Regulations and involvement of the legal systems within the local contexts will also help. The financial nature of cryptocurrencies and social context cannot be separated. Thus, it is not possible to separate for example payments and the legal system.

Imagine the following scenario. Alice promises to do some physical work once Bob pays in advance. What should Bob do when he has paid and Alice refuses to do the work? The blockchain transaction is settled and it is correct from the digital point of view. What about the social context? Only the legal system can probably remedy the situation in the case Alice does not care about her reputation and Bob does not want to fight with her.

Notice that the legal system would need to resolve the situation regardless of whether the traditional bank system or blockchain is used. Alice will have to do the promised work or send money back to Bob. In general, all services built on blockchain will work better when the digital and social contexts will be more interconnected. It is often argued that for many services a database would be a better option. That can be true. However, if we want to build decentralized services we need to replicate the current services. Let’s do not suppose that we can fully avoid the social context in the decentralized world. Smart contracts are able to prevent some frauds in the digital world but it is probably impossible when the physical world is involved.

Similar issues will occur regardless of whether a database or blockchain is used. We should as to whether blockchain can bring us some benefits over a database. If yes then it is a comparable or better solution. It is not a worse solution. Cardano uses PoS and will have Hydra in order to provide similar services like a database. It does not mean that user data will be in the blockchain. Blockchain will always be only a layer ensuring immutability and serving as a base layer for additional services. We will benefit from every piece of human work that can be reliably automated in order to avoid censorship, corruption, and fraud. Cardano allows us to build a decentralized infrastructure exactly for that. In places where corruption and frauds are common, the usage of Cardano is a good idea since there is no need to use any local infrastructure that can be easily compromised. As we said, even if it is not 100% reliable and individuals can misuse their position, it can be better than using a database. For example, all records will be immutably protected by the blockchain so when a crime has been committed the proof cannot be deleted. Even if the digital record is not correct the legal system can act. Even the representatives of the legal system cannot change or delete the record.

The first PoW networks are slow and as it is often said, expensive. That is true but let’s do not forget that technology can always be improved. People are actually good at pushing the limits and innovating technologies. More than 10 years have passed since the launch of Bitcoin. In the next decade, the crypto industry will be completely different.

# It is all about economic activities

It is a paradox that holding cryptocurrencies in a wallet and waiting for the possible future rise of the price is the most spread usage of them. The narrative “hodling is using” is used to excuse the fact that nobody is willing to use cryptocurrencies for real economic activities.

Cryptocurrencies are treated as digital gold. When we have a look at the real-world analogy, we will find that only around 12% of people in the USA hold gold. Gold is only a subset of the financial system. Is a part that is useful only for rich people. The majority of people are part of the financial systems without the need to own gold. Real economic activities are independent of the existence of gold. On the other hand, money, which is used on a daily basis, is a necessity.

Do you know why the U.S. left the gold standard? The government was not able to resolve the economic crisis in 1933. Faced with mounting unemployment and spiraling deflation, the U.S. government found it could do little to stimulate the economy. To deter people from cashing in deposits and depleting the gold supply, the U.S. and other governments had to keep interest rates high, but that made it too expensive for people and businesses to borrow. So in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cut the dollar’s ties with gold, allowing the government to pump money into the economy and lower interest rates. Notice that the U.S. is arguably one of the most developed and democratic countries in the world and the government does not directly need a scarce resource.

Our society and the financial markets are based on transactions and contractual agreements among people, companies, banks, states, etc. The exchange of value is a very important part of society. One is able to produce something that the other needs and is willing to pay for it. That is a very basic pillar of the economy. Money became the means of payment. Money is exchanged for things that have similar value. There might be more complex exchanges of value between two parties that require making a contract. A contract is a record with the agreement details and conditions. Transactions and contracts are drivers of the economy and society.

Now, let’s ask a question. Have we already replicated the financial system? Definitely not. We suppose we have replicated gold and we have a digital form of it. Really? At least a few percent of people on the planet think so. The usual narrative is that once a higher number of people adopt volatile cryptocurrencies the price will stabilize and we will use them more often for payments. That is why we just hold them and wait for what is going to happen next.

As we have explained above, it is difficult to achieve a higher network effect in the global context. A globally famous company can accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method but the majority of people will still use fiat money. Probably even the cryptocurrency holders.

Stable coins and all tokens that are issued are very important since people learn how to use wallets and transact. People might be willing to experiment but not everyone is willing to face volatility. Issuing fun tokens that are for free and you can send them to your friends nearly for free is actually a big thing for further adoption. Cardano will allow users to pay fees directly in the tokens that are being sent. Users will not need to own ADA coins to use tokens.

Once we remove the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies people can use coins and tokens for real economic activities. Only a part of the population is interested in speculation. The majority of us do not care much about it or do not understand the topic well. This group of people cannot be omitted from the decentralized economy. Stable coins solve the issue nicely. In our view, further adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized services will depend on stable coins. It does not depend on issuers of stable coins. They will be many of them and the key is to ensure seamless interoperability among platforms. More complex decentralized services will be adopted once the speculative aspect will be completely removed.

Let’s ask a tricky question. Can decentralized services be used with centrally issued or controlled digital currencies? Why not. Some people might think that we need 100% decentralized money to build a decentralized economy. Well, but what if we are not able to ensure the stability of fully decentralized cryptocurrencies? Decentralization is about the ability to avoid middlemen. The issue is that when regular people should decide between decentralization and stability they will choose stability. Hence, we need to strive for both, services that will satisfy requirements for stability and decentralization. Using Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) in decentralized financial services is also a significant step towards decentralization. In the ideal case, it would be great if we could create algorithmic stable coins that would be independent of a central issuer. We believe that we will be able to do so one day.

Real economic activities require stability and as time has shown the volatility prevents real usage of decentralized services including payment. We have already found the solution and once the blockchain technology matures a new wave of adopters will join the sector. Cardano will probably be one of the platforms that will be ready for mass adoption. There are two important reasons to think so. The technological advancement and strong community.

Moreover, Cardano is the first project that has been adopted on a national level. Ethiopia is the first adopter and we will probably see others. As we have explained in the article, adoption in the local context is also very important. It is naive to think that the whole planet will switch from traditional services to decentralized ones in one moment. It will happen somehow gradually. To see one country that reliably uses blockchain in real sectors of the economy is a necessary prerequisite for further adoption. Let’s hope that Cardano succeeds in Ethiopia and will provide the first proof that it is possible. Without that, do not expect that the whole planet will use cryptocurrencies.

# Conclusion

Currently, we use cryptocurrencies mostly for trading and speculations. Some people use centralized services for holding cryptocurrencies. The mission of Cardano is to let people use blockchain technologies for real economic activities. It is a challenge from the technological and adoption points of view. Like it or not, the further adoption of blockchain technologies needs innovations. It is not only the second layer solution but many other parts of the infrastructure. In the article, we have talked about ICO, DeFi, and NFT sectors. We expect that we will see other new sectors. Cardano has added another piece of Lego. It is Atala PRISM which is the identity management solution. It is another important piece of infrastructure that will interconnect the digital and physical worlds. The blockchain has big potential and we believe that Cardano will push the adoption one level up."

6 reasons why Polygon (Matic) is massively undervalued at current levels,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plliz7/6_reasons_why_polygon_matic_is_massively/,Set1Less,1,2021-09-10 21:55:27,161,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plliz7/6_reasons_why_polygon_matic_is_massively/,EDUCATIONAL," At current price of around $1.40 and market cap of around $9 Bn, polygon is highly undervalued compared to its peers in the crypto market.

1. According to DeFi Llama Dashboard ([https://defillama.com/chains](https://defillama.com/chains)), Solana has a TVL of $9.3bn and Polygon has a TVL of $6.3bn. TVL denotes the total value of assets locked in the network, across various defi protocols. In other words, its the value of assets deployed on the network. Solana, thanks to the recent rise in price, has a market cap of $53 Bn, while Polygon has a market cap of just $9 Bn, based on TVL, Polygon has more room to grow. Worth noting that both Polygon and Solana have done 100x this year, and the TVL in Solana basically doubled in the last week alone as Solana went from $80 to $200 now. For many weeks before, Polygon had consistently more TVL than Solana. On the DeFi Llama dashboard, if you sort by Mcap/TVL, you can see that Polygon is amongst the lowest. A lower Mcap/TVL figure indicates the project is undervalued compared to its peers. This metric can be compared to the PE metric used in evaluating stocks/companies. 
2. **Coinbase is set to integrate native deposits and withdrawals on Polygon** PoS scaling solution. This will be huge, as it would allow Coinbase users to deposit and withdraw Ethereum assets directly on Polygon, without the need to withdraw first to Ethereum L1, and then use the bridge. This can really open up TVL on Polygon to retail users. (More on retail below). Coinbase Ventures is also an investor in Polygon. 
3. The Polygon Hermez merger has not at all been captured in Polygon’s current price. While Hermez may be a microcap project based on its price, it shares true Ethereum ethos and is founded by reknowned contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem. Hermez will bring true decentralised L2 scaling to the Polygon ecosystem via its zk-rollups. Developers/users will be able to easily switch between more centralised Polygon PoS chain for cheap transactions for games/NFTs, while using Hermez for trading, swaps, investing etc. When Hermez network is fully integrated on Polygon, it will be a game changer as **it is considerably cheaper to use Hermez over other L2 options like Optimistic Ethereum, Arbitrum etc**. As per [https://l2fees.info](https://l2fees.info/), it costs $4.5 to transfer ETH on Optimism, $3 to transfer ETH on Arbitrum and just $0.40 to transfer ETH on Polygon Hermez. On Polygon PoS, it is much lower, at 0.007c!
4. While the present Polygon PoS chain does have more centralisation aspects due to its use of multisig, it has turned into a highly efficient network. The metrics from Polygon are mind blowing. The Polygon network has already crossed 700 million transactions, in little over 2 years. Bitcoin for instance only has 668 million transactions (though Bitcoin does not support smart contracts). Ethereum has around 1.2 Bn transactions. Polygon consistently operates at 70-100 TPS, and does 7 million transactions on an average day. (Metrics: [https://polygonscan.com/charts](https://polygonscan.com/charts))
5. Polygon is just winding up its DeFi summer, with amazing results and almost all of the top Ethereum projects have already deployed on Polygon, with great success. Curve, 0x, Aave, Balancer, OpenSea, mStable, Pickle, StakeDAO, UMA Protocol.. tons of NFT projects like Aavegotchi, Zed Run, many more are constantly moving to Polygon for scaling requirements. Big names like Dolce &amp; Gabbana are launching NFTs on Polygon. Even [Google BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/public-data-finance/crypto-polygon-dataset) has integrated Polygon data for blockchain insights. 
6. Polygon has emerged as an indisputable favourite network for retail users to transact on. Network level transactions show that 45% of all transactions on Polygon PoS are transacting less than $1.45. 65% of all transactions on Polygon PoS are transacting less than $100. 85% of all transactions on Polygon are transacting less than $1k. Most of these users are critical of the fees they would spend on other networks. Daily Active Addresses on Polygon is around 175k, while it is around 450k on Ethereum. Polygon PoS is multiple times cheaper than Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche and BSC, while even Hermez would be cheaper than these other competitor EVM compatible chains. 

Catering to retail users is one of the main use cases of DeFi, and spending $5 for a DEX swap or just for claiming your LP rewards just doesn't make any sense. While there are multiple networks coming into the picture today, my personal thesis is that the network that retail prefers will continue to remain relevant over time - especially if there are cheap and easy access rails provided by fiat exchanges like Coinbase."
Any news/hints as to when we might be able to earn yield on our CRV on Celsius?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/plv3sd/any_newshints_as_to_when_we_might_be_able_to_earn/,Geek4Product,1,2021-09-11 06:25:01,2,/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/plv3sd/any_newshints_as_to_when_we_might_be_able_to_earn/,NaN,"I’ve been using Celsius Network for a few months now. I absolutely love it and I’m super impressed with the team, their continuous drive for innovation and ability to deliver their vision.

I have noticed in the app there are a few assets in the ‘coming soon section’, including Curve Finance (which I am a long term holder). Has there been any announcements/hints as to when we might see CRV rewards offered on the platform? I have been digging, but can’t seem to find anything beyond its listing in the ‘coming soon’ space. Thanks in advance 🤜💥🤛"

It’s over for COVER,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AsdraOfficial/comments/pnc852/its_over_for_cover/,AsdraOfficial,1,2021-09-13 17:44:16,0,/r/u_AsdraOfficial/comments/pnc852/its_over_for_cover/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[Asdra Inc. www.asdra.com](https://preview.redd.it/xfh3l9bkr8n71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9713fa686343dae18110e87e344554dd62d3424)

In the wake of its founder’s troubles, popular **insurance protocol DeFi** is shutting down. Since the launch of the protocol more than a year ago, the protocol’s coin price has also dropped substantially. As a result of **Ted’s announcement**, the **Cover** token has dropped from **$269** to **$211**. This news forced traders to sell, resulting in a **$19** million trading volume, up from **$3.5** million.

# Overview &amp; History

Founded by **Alan**, one of the co-founders of **SAFE**. The **Cover Protocol** is a **DeFi Insurance Protocol** that provides peer-to-peer coverage. The protocol allows users to be protected against risks associated with smart contracts along with allowing the market to determine coverage prices rather than a bonding curve.

The protocol was launched about a year ago, Cover has created a decentralized marketplace for DeFi investors, requiring tokens to be locked on Cover as collateral. Users are given tokens that will cover them in the event that the DeFi protocol they invest in is hacked, rug-pulled, or exploited. The value of these tokens depends on the smart contract risk.

# What really happened with Cover

**A hack in December 2020** led to a Cover collapse, leaving its customers uncovered and COVER token investors stranded As part of the refund, the hacker added the message, “Next time, take care of your own shit.” Cover returned the money to its customers, but the token’s value fell 96% as a result. A significant amount of Cover’s influence also shrank after it cut ties with Yearn Finance founder Andre Cronje in March, while the protocols collaborated in November 2020.

# What would they do to customers’ holdings?

**“Compensation will be as of block number 13162680, this will be used as the snapshot to distribute funds to holders from the treasury. Founders, including myself, will not take part in this.” — DeFi Ted**

According to **DeFi Ted**, customers should pull their holdings from the project as soon as possible, since it’s effectively been closed. Token holders will get an equal distribution of the remaining treasury funds. Cover’s Token and its contracts will both be terminated. It was clarified that the project development team wouldn’t be receiving anything.

** Coinbase v SEC**

There has been another wave of regulation buzz this week as Coinbase took the offensive and called out the SEC.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?s=20) to identify a pattern of “sketchy” behavior he’s experienced directed toward Coinbase.  Here’s the story, according to Brian: the company was planning to roll out a feature called Lend, which would allow users to lend their cryptocurrency for a return.  This is a common feature in the crypto world, with most major wallets and exchanges offering it natively.  When Coinbase made the SEC aware that they will be releasing the feature, the SEC responded by declaring that crypto lending is considered a security.

Coinbase executives requested further explanation and in response, the SEC subpoenaed documents from Coinbase, demanded testimony from their employees, and informed the company they will be sued if Coinbase proceeds to launch their Lend feature.  Armstrong went on to explain that the new head of the SEC had previously dodged an attempt to introduce himself to regulators on a May trip to DC, being told “we’re not meeting with any crypto companies.”  In Coinbase’s [official posted statement](https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009), they reveal that the SEC requested the name and contact information for everyone on their Lend waitlist, which the company refused to give.

Mark Cuban [posted](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1435454959441620995) his take in response to Armstrong’s tweets, calling this “Regulation via Litigation”, stating that the SEC is struggling to set reasonable regulation and is instead planning to leave it to the lawyers.

**TLDR:** The SEC has officially stated it plans to sue Coinbase if they release their lending feature, a feature many other exchanges already offer.



**Mastercard Acquires Crypto Forensics Firm CipherTrace**

Credit card company Mastercard will acquire crypto forensics giant CipherTrace. CipherTrace provides transparency in crypto investments, identifying possible theft, fraud, and money laundering. The company's clients are governments and other companies that need to track crypto projects, and CipherTrace helps protect crypto companies and financial institutions from security and compliance risks. Currently, CipherTrace tracks and reports on over 7,000 crypto assets.

CipherTrace can help clients detect crime in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which is experiencing massive growth and attracting criminals. In mid-August, there was over $80 billion of value locked on DeFi platforms. DeFi crime this year has totaled almost $700 million.

The two main types of DeFi crimes are hacks and ""rug pulls."" According to CipherTrace, roughly [three-quarters of DeFi crime](https://www.reuters.com/technology/defi-crime-hits-record-high-first-7-months-2021-ciphertrace-2021-08-10/) this year has been protocol hacks, where hackers exploit the underlying code running an exchange and steal the money. About one-quarter of DeFi crime has been rug pulls, where the people running the project quit and take the money.

This is the latest move by Mastercard into the crypto space, following their [announcement](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/) of crypto payment cards early this year, and the start of a [crypto project launch pad](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727005244/en/Mastercard-Launches-New-Start-Path-Cryptocurrency-and-Blockchain-Program-for-Startups) this summer.



**Bored Ape Yacht Club Auction Sells for $24 Million**

The growing NFT art trend had yet another impressive showing this week when a collection of 101 [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) NFTs sold for $24 Million, at an average price of $241,500 per NFT.  The average price per Bored Ape on secondary markets is roughly $160,000.  The Bored Ape project is one of the early generative art lines (projects where the NFT gets a number of random traits for the image at the time of minting) to gain major traction.  [The auction](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/ape-in/101-bored-ape-yacht-club) was conducted by Sotheby’s, one of the world’s largest fine art brokers, which started auctioning NFTs earlier this year.

The sale crushed Sotheby’s target price range of $12M-$18M and included a total of 107 NFTs.  Bored Ape Yacht Club recently released an add-on NFT called mutant serums which “mutate” the original NFTs and yield a second Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT.  This is one of several rewards granted to holders of the original NFT, alongside a free NFT from the Bored Ape Kennel Club line.  Kennel Club also recently had an auction of 101 NFTs, which sold for a total of $1.8M.

The project has been garnering attention from big name celebrities and athletes such as [Stephen Curry](https://decrypt.co/79676/nba-star-stephen-curry-buys-ethereum-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-for-180k), Dez Bryant, The Chainsmokers, and many more. This week also had the largest individual sale of a Bored Ape at $2.9M.



**Should You Hold a Wrapped Token?**

Wrapped tokens are cryptos pegged to the value of another asset. A wrapped token is like a stablecoin, except its value is pegged to an asset such as Bitcoin. Wrapped tokens are usually used for compatibility in cross-chain transactions, but they can also be held by investors.

Wrapped tokens work like stablecoins: a custodian holds the balance of the asset, keeping the same amount that is wrapped. The custodian can be a merchant, a DAO, or a smart contract.

Wrapped tokens are used to make cross-chain transactions, such as trading [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://bitcoin.org/en/) on the Ethereum network. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't compatible, the exchange could instead use [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://wbtc.network/), an Ethereum-compatible wrapped token pegged to Bitcoin. Wrapped tokens operate on-chain, so they incur gas fees. Investors have to pay gas fees to wrap and unwrap their assets.

Wrapped tokens are a good option for cross-chain transactions, but are they too risky to hold? Since the wrapped token software is operated by a custodian, there is additional risk compared to holding the native asset. The custodian could be hacked or rug pull the project.

Some assets, such as BTC and ETH, are easy to acquire and hold, so holding WBTC or WETH is likely an unnecessary risk. Other assets, such as [Nexus Mutual (NXM)](https://nexusmutual.io/) are more difficult to acquire due to KYC requirements, but there is a wrapped version available with no KYC requirements: [Wrapped NXM (WNXM)](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/wrapped-nxm). Although there is considerably more risk to holding WNXM, investors may consider this acceptable due to the ease of swapping WNXM compared to the native NXM.

**TLDR:** A wrapped token gives you the option to more easily access assets (for example, avoiding Know Your Customer (KYC), though it adds more risk than directly holding an asset.



**Project Spotlight: BitClout**

[BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) (CLOUT) is a blockchain-based social media project that “mixes speculation and social media.”  People make short posts that show up in a cultivated timeline, much like Twitter.  Each account on the platform has a Creator Coin, a coin that you can buy or sell that works on a yield curve to determine its value.  Creators can set a percentage of their coin to keep from all transactions.  The goal of BitClout is to create an asset class which is tied to the reputation of an individual directly. Some of the features released, or planned for release, revolve around exclusive access to holders of coins; the company has considered Stakeholder Meetings, Premium Messages, Sponsored Posts, and Premium Content.  

One of the most exciting parts of BitClout is the community that has sprung up around it.  The home page has a list of major projects, all of which trade directly on BitClout and are available to invest in from the moment they launch.  The top project is [BitClout Pulse](http://bitcloutpulse.com/), a BitClout analytics company describing themselves as “Bloomberg for BitClout.”

BitClout launched in March 2021 with much of the staff being entirely anonymous – the CEO is simply known as “Diamond Hands.”  The project has raised funding from many of the top tech investors, like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, and Winklevoss Capital, as well as from well known individuals such as Chamath Palihapitiya (a confirmed user on the site)."

Other assets, such as [Nexus Mutual (NXM)](https://nexusmutual.io/) are more difficult to acquire due to KYC requirements, but there is a wrapped version available with no KYC requirements: [Wrapped NXM (WNXM)](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/wrapped-nxm). Although there is considerably more risk to holding WNXM, investors may consider this acceptable due to the ease of swapping WNXM compared to the native NXM.

**TLDR:** A wrapped token gives you the option to more easily access assets (for example, avoiding Know Your Customer (KYC), though it adds more risk than directly holding an asset.

**Project Spotlight: BitClout**

[BitClout](https://bitclout.com/) (CLOUT) is a blockchain-based social media project that “mixes speculation and social media.”  People make short posts that show up in a cultivated timeline, much like Twitter.  Each account on the platform has a Creator Coin, a coin that you can buy or sell that works on a yield curve to determine its value.  Creators can set a percentage of their coin to keep from all transactions.  The goal of BitClout is to create an asset class which is tied to the reputation of an individual directly. Some of the features released, or planned for release, revolve around exclusive access to holders of coins; the company has considered Stakeholder Meetings, Premium Messages, Sponsored Posts, and Premium Content.  

One of the most exciting parts of BitClout is the community that has sprung up around it.  The home page has a list of major projects, all of which trade directly on BitClout and are available to invest in from the moment they launch.  The top project is [BitClout Pulse](http://bitcloutpulse.com/), a BitClout analytics company describing themselves as “Bloomberg for BitClout.”

BitClout launched in March 2021 with much of the staff being entirely anonymous – the CEO is simply known as “Diamond Hands.”  The project has raised funding from many of the top tech investors, like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, and Winklevoss Capital, as well as from well known individuals such as Chamath Palihapitiya (a confirmed user on the site)."
Flatten the Curve. Post 118. Stephen King. Some of his books get very strange when you look around at our present day situation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pnsce7/flatten_the_curve_post_118_stephen_king_some_of/,biggreekgeek,1,2021-09-14 08:49:34,68,/r/conspiracy/comments/pnsce7/flatten_the_curve_post_118_stephen_king_some_of/,NaN,"[Source Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pmmpp7/flatten_the_curve_post_117_a_deep_dive_into/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)   

Ok. Buckle up. Hard. I've got a deep rabbit hole here, and it will seriously mess up your mind worse than any episode of **DARK MIRROR**.  

#Black Mirror. 6th season. Live now, everywhere   
[Source Here](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/this-terrifying-black-mirror-netflix-poster-is-still-utter-genius)     

**If you're feeling like the plot of 2020 is straight out of a dystopian drama, you're not alone. One Madrid-based advertising agency has turned the concept into a reality with a speculative poster campaign that places us all quite literally inside Netflix's next series of Black Mirror.**   

So, **what if?** What if we are being steered off course from our natural biological evolution and onto a mapped out transhuman evolution? And what if some people have tried to warn us? Or what if some of those people are tapping into a collective consciousness and it displays through bursts of creativity? Because when you start observing and actually paying attention, you'll begin to notice some oddities that you can't ignore.    

#The Stand      

Oh an obvious one, right? Of course I would show you the Stand, the magnum opus of Stephen King. It's about a pandemic and were in a pandemic, duh. I just can't point go a work of fiction and insist it's a work of creativity which has tapped into some mystical new age collective consciousness. That's nonsense. Ok. And maybe it is. Maybe King is just extremely observant, and those observations allow him to come up with stories. I can accept that. Absolutely. But. There are stranger things going on in his novels, much stranger things than the TV show **STRANGER THINGS**. 

#IT      

And it really seemed to start around here, 2016. The year of the psychotic evil clown scare. Do you remember?   

#‘Creepy Clown’ sightings: Why the epidemic is spreading across Canada and the U.S.
[Source Here](https://globalnews.ca/news/2990008/creepy-clown-sightings-why-the-epidemic-is-spreading-across-canada-and-the-u-s/)    

I had forgotten about the clown scare. Back in 2016 I remembered thinking, man, how strange is that? That was it. Nothing more and nothing less. And then I forgot all about it, until the pandemic hit years later. 

#The Cell      

This book came out in January 2006. 

&gt;""The Pulse"", a signal sent out over the global cell phone network, suddenly turns every cell phone user into a mindless zombie-like killer. Clay is standing in **Boston Common** when the Pulse hits, causing chaos to erupt around him. Civilization crumbles as the ""phoners"" attack each other and anyone in view.       

Ok. The book starts out in Boston, which is also where Facebook started. And yet, thinking back, Facebook was just starting to achieve prominence. And the Cell was published in January 2006, at which point Facebook was only a phenomenon on college and university campuses. It would only open up to the public in September of 2006. Yes some media outlets began talking about it, but it was hardly far from becoming a widely known website. The majority of adults had no clue what Facebook was. And now here we are. 

&gt;It is clear the phoners have become a **hive mind** and are developing psychic abilities.      

A hive mind? What nonsense, right? That was just King writing fiction. Nothing more, nothing less.   

#Monkey ‘brain net’ raises prospect of human brain-to-brain connection   
[Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/09/monkey-brain-net-raises-prospect-of-human-brain-to-brain-connection)

**In two separate experiments, scientists have formed a network from the brains of monkeys and rats, allowing them to co-operate and learn as a “superbrain”**    

So maybe a pulse which destroys our minds and turns us into zombies is a stretch, at least I hope it is. But he was clearly tapping into something here. And whether or not that is some kind of psychic precognitive flash or just an intuitive deduction of where society is headed, does it matter? Besides, couldn't those flashes of intuition actually be us rationalizing a precognitive ability? 


That night, all of the survivors share the same horrific dream: each dreamer sees himself in a stadium, surrounded by phoners, as a **disheveled man wearing a Harvard University hooded sweatshirt** approaches, bringing their death. Waking, the heroes share their frightening dream experiences and dub him ""the Raggedy Man"". A new flock surrounds their residence, and the **""normies""** face the flock's metaphorical spokesman: the man in the **Harvard hoodie.**   

Ahem. **NORMIES**. Seriously. Do you like the **NEW NORMAL**? Do you feel normal, or does feeling normal leave you feeling like a **NORMIE** while everyone else is a part of the **NEW NORMAL**. When did you first notice the phrase? Becsuse I didn't until this year. And maybe this was just calling everyone left behind a normie was only for dramatic effect, it still doesn't lessen the strangeness of our present day fixation on using the term, **THE NEW NORMAL**.    

And while the normie term may have only been for dramatic effect, how do you explain the main villan wearing a **A HARVARD HOODIE?** Seriously?    

#That hoodie: Is Facebook some kind of cult?
[Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jun/07/facebook-zuckerberg-hoodie) 

**It was probably just the heat of the stage lights - but it was much more fun for the media to say it was the heat of those questions on privacy. But when Mark Zuckerberg finally took off his hoodie on stage at the D8 conference last week, he revealed an intriguing strategy-cum-Illuminati logo printed inside.**   

This guy constantly wore Harvard hoodies. And yes, that's normal. He went to Harvard. But what isn't normal is a direct allusion in a horror novel with the main villan wearing a Harvard hoodie. Back in 2006. Before Facebook was huge. 

#19    

Have you read any books by King? I have. Not all of them, maybe around sixty or seventy percent. After reading that amount you start to pick up on a number that constantly pops up in his writing, the number nineteen.   

He's been asked numerous times why the number keeps occurring, and his answer is always the same, he doesn't know. Fair enough. Maybe it's just his subconscious mind putting out the details for some **unknown reason**.    

**ONE = A. NINE = I**    

#19 EQUALS AI   


And the Cell was about a hive mind. And Mark Zuckerberg has stated his goal is to connect all of humanity. And they are working on brain computer interfaces to link our brains together.   

Why we should worry about Big Tech’s investment in a new brain technology   
[Source Here](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-12/big-tech-dangerous-interest-brain-technology-help)

&gt;**For example, Facebook partly funded the research that made Pancho’s BCI and has its own in-house BCI development program. The company reported working on BCIs that decode neural signals collected by a noninvasive wearable device that could allow people to type with their minds by imagining talking. While Facebook’s recent statements indicate they are steering away from those specific plans, they continue to actively research other BCI concepts.**   

Are you starting to find this strange? Is it creeping you out? Good. Welcome to the club. O appreciate the company.     


#Covid-19    

Yes he wrote the Stand, which was about a superflu escaping from a lab and killing almost all of humanity until God intervenes. But we only have a **CORONA**virus.   

Corona = a part of the body resembling or likened to a crown.

Stephen • In Biblical Names the meaning of the name Stephen is: **Crown; crowned** • King    

Whelp. Ok. Sure. Whatever. Hopefully the elites aren't building doomsday bunker.

[Source Here](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/doomsday-luxury-bunkers/index.html)    

Ok. **KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON**. Nothing to see hear folks. Nope. Nothing at all. But then I saw something else. Airplanes in King's books. 

&gt;Eddie Dean flys in **Delta** flight 910 to New York. 9 + 10 add up to 19.

&gt;The **Delta** flight his daughter takes home is number 559 (5+5+9=19)

And what do we have know? A **DELTA** COVID-19 mutation that's spreading. And what next mutation are they worried about? The **MU** variant. Let's take a look at another book. 

#11/22/63    

&gt;The for rent sign in New Orleans says to call **MU**3-4192 and that adds to 19.   

OK. Come on! Look, I know he's written a ton of books and left a lot of words on his pages, but these are just downright bizzare. And this doesn't even touch on the fact that AI = 19, and he kept featuring 19 in all of his books, and now we have a pandemic which features the number 19  called COVID-19. And also, while rarely talked about, his **DARK TOWER** books centered upon a world being destroyed by computers and technology. And there was a villan called the **CRIMSON KING**. And of the pandemic exercises was called:   

#Crimson Contagion
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Contagion) 

&gt;**Crimson Contagion** was a joint exercise conducted from January to August 2019, in which numerous national, state and local, private and public organizations in the US participated, in order to test the capacity of the federal government and twelve states to respond to a **severe pandemic of influenza originating in China.**   

&gt;According to the results of the coordinating draft report, dated October 2019, the Crimson Contagion simulation registers 110 million infected Americans, 7.7 million hospitalizations, and **586,000 fatalities**.    

Definitely not the **STAND** level of infection, but oddly close to the situation we find ourselves in today.   

#The Institute  

This was the first book which made me realize something strange was happening. It came out just before the pandemic started, and I only picked it up when I was bored during lockdown.    

It's plot deals with a secret organization which kidnaps psychic children. Were first introduced to Luke, a kid and the main hero, at a place called, **ROCKET PIZZA** before he's kidnapped by the secret organization.   

Rocket Pizza? A conspiracy involving a place called, **COMET PING PONG** that's a pizza place? While I do think this is just creative licence, especially considering the novel came out after all the conspiracy, does Mr. King have an account here on r/conspiracy?   

Moving on.    

I the book they also subject the children to something called, **SHOTS FOR DOTS**. Which is, injections meant to bring out psychic abilities. And they keep having to take the shots. Somewhat reminiscent of boosters, wouldn't you say?   

I'm not suggesting the vaccines are trying to makes us manifest psychic abilities. I'm just writing down a similarity. That's it. Nothing more. 

In the end, the Institute’s management reveals that the organization truly believes its **ill treatment of telepathic and telekinetic children is for the greater good of the world**: taking out possible terrorists and neutralizing those who have the potential to start wars with their precognitive flashes. “**Thousands of children have died in this process**, but billions of children have been saved,” claims Mr. Smith, the Institute’s boss.       

The benefits outweigh the risks. Enough said.   

I realize some of these connections are tenuous, especially the last two. But the next part of the book is what alerted me that King was tapping into something, or even trying to warn us about something.   

&gt;Tim Jamieson is a disgraced cop en route to New York on the promise of work as a security guard. Running mainly on intuition – “great events turn on small hinges” – Tim surrenders his seat on the plane to a government official and begins hitching his way north instead, ending up in a nowhere town that exists mainly to serve its associated rail depot. Here he gets a job making night patrols and begins to gain the trust of the local sheriff.

&gt;**What they will not be expecting is for Jamieson to vanish. There are almost 300 pages to wait before he is seen again, when DuPray – the town’s name is no accident – becomes the backdrop for the denouement of another story entirely.** [Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/04/the-institute-stephen-king-review)

When I read the Institute, this shocked me. I couldn't believe a writer like King could make such a novice error in his books. You don't start a book with a main character and then simply forget about him. That's beyond bad writing. That's horrible. He had to mean something by it, didn't he? But for the life of me I just couldn't figure out what. Until a couple of months passed by. It wasn't an error at all. He wanted us to forget about the character. He wanted that to shock us into realizing, our recall ability, our memories, are being damaged by the information age. As soon as King stopped writing about Tim, I forgot about him after a few pages. I was shocked and awed at the moment, and I think that was what he was hoping for.   

&gt;Luke posits that there are **too many factors that come into play**, making it nearly impossible for these precognitive flashes (years and even decades before the events actually happen) to be that accurate. Readers are left to wonder: Are these flashes to the future enough to warrant killing possible threats in cold blood, years before they commit a crime?    


And here I'm about to get into complete speculative territory. Batcrap crazy territory. I've written about our governments and military running simulations on us. They have the (supposedly) capability now to run **SIMULATIONS** on upwards of Two billion people at once. And I've also speculated that we are the random access memories that AI needs to achieve true intelligence. So what if, just **WHAT IF** the kidnapped kids in the book are symbolic of kids being kidnapped and hooked up to AI to run simulations? What if this is why AI is actually becoming smart. It's not technology, it's us powering that tech.    

Because by the end of the book something stood out to me. While Luke talks to a shadowy man from the organization, he brings up Bayesian statistics. And that was an odd moment for me, because I realized that Bayesian statistics are involved in AI.     

And they are used to:   

&gt;Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring, based on a previous outcome occurring. **Bayes' theorem provides a way to revise existing predictions** or theories (update probabilities) given new or additional evidence. In finance, Bayes' theorem can be used to rate the risk of lending money to potential borrowers.

&gt;Bayes' theorem is also called Bayes' Rule or Bayes' Law and is the foundation of the field of Bayesian statistics.
[Source Here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bayes-theorem.asp)    

They make predictions. The Institute’s main plot is about psychic phenomenon being used to take out so called **BAD GUYS** because computer simulations tell them that **BAD GUY** will be a problem in the future. So they launch a preemptive strike before that can happen. But that's just fiction, right?   


&gt;Qasem Soleimani (Persian: قاسم سلیمانی‎, pronounced [ɢɒːˌsem solejˈmɒːniː]; 11 March 1957 – 3 January 2020) was an Iranian military officer who served in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). From 1998 until his assassination in 2020, he was the commander of the Quds Force, an IRGC division primarily responsible for extraterritorial and clandestine military operations.   

Maybe?    

#Final Thoughts   

I've been sitting on this for a while now. Well over a year, in fact. Why? Because it tripped me out, that's why. Could this all be nonsense? Yes. Of course it could. This whole post may just be my overactive imagination conjuring up connections where none exist. After all, give an infinite number of monkeys an infinite amount of typewriters and one of them will eventually write **12 MONKEYS**.   

But go back and read the last post and Project Cassandra. Look at the other novels which somehow seem to predict, or come just close enough, to be called foreshadowing future events. Something strange is happening here. And it's especially strange when you consider Project Cassandra had success predicting future crises based on previously written literature. And then it was discontinued. Yeah. Ok. More like taken top secret and made a special access project.    

So is this why some of us feel like something is off in this **NEW NORMAL?** Is it because our natural evolution is being hijacked and controlled by Artificial Intelligence? Are we taking order from a machine instead of using a machine as a tool? Is this why so many of our studies are garbage (on top of being funded by bad actors)? Because where do you input numbers from your study? Into a computer hooked up to the internet. Remember that and then look up the Replication Crisis.   

&gt;**The replication crisis** (also called the replicability crisis and the reproducibility crisis) is an ongoing methodological crisis in which it has been found that many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce. The replication crisis most severely affects the social sciences and medicine, while survey data strongly indicates that all of the natural sciences are probably implicated as well.  
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)   

I'll have more on this in an upcoming post. For now, as always,

I have written 101 articles about PINETWORK, which have been read about 3 million times. This is the first time to publish an article on the English encrypted information platform. I hope I can contribute some energy to PINETWORK.

The source of this article is a discussion between a pioneer and ONEPI. He expressed his views and expectations for PINETWORK in the future. The combination of the pioneer's expression and ONEP's personal views resulted in this article.

&amp;#x200B;

**PINETWORK evolutionary path**

Flashback to January 3, 2009, “The chancellor of the exchequer was on the verge of implementing a second bank bailout. ” This is the first messages who Satoshi Nakamoto left in the Bitcoin network, and the first block reward is 50 Bitcoins.

Ten years later, on March 14, 2019, the first version of PINETWORK's mobile mining APP——PI APP——was released, and three students from Stanford University quietly released a short white paper.

On May 22, 2019, PI users reached 10,000;

On July 10, 2019, PI users reached 100,000;

On October 31, 2019, PI users reached 1 million;

On December 08, 2020, PI users reached 10 million.

The tenfold fission process from 0 to 10,000, to 100,000, to 1 million, and to 10 million took 70, 48, 113, and 404 days respectively.

In this process, PI is still a number integral in TestNet, and many people ridicule PI APP as a number counter.

They were both right and wrong.

Since the whole tenfold fission process is conducted in a testnet with blockchain properties, this process means that PI is not simply an integral, but a hash integral with progressively enhanced hash properties. When does it become positive?

The moment the mainnet go online, then hash points are converted into cryptocurrency.

So, you might have the same question as ONEPI, how long does it take to go from 10 million to 100 million users? Now takes about 270 days (as of September 07), it is said that in accordance with the above 10 times the fission rate.It has no size, would not.Because it wil get faster and faster.And the more the closer the target back end (such as the mainnet or exchange platform) the greater the attraction, like power curve index, over time the growth will be faster.

From this perspective, PINETWORK's product, PICOIN, is just a cryptocurrency (currently hash points).

PI = COIN

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60y2t8zzvdn71.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b65d334f513f03b335716aba175620c07c4d90f

**PINETWORK is a public blockchain network**

PINETWORK will creat an ecosystem gradually, and the foundation is PINETWORK block network and PI apps. The builders of the ecosystem come from officials and developers. Hackathon accelerates the construction of the ecosystem, because the ""ecology"" what everyone talked about before the hackathon feels very empty, but the hackathon will have a clearer outline. With the application demonstrated, the rudiments of ecology will have been formed.

Therefore, another important significance of hackathon is to tell us that PI is not only a coin, but also a Blockchain Network. Why?

Because the PI chain is a public chain that can exploit the ecology.

In addition, PINETWORK is, to use the buzzword right now, a SocialFi project with more than 20 million active users -- social decentralized finance -- and SocialFi is just one of PINETWORK's attributes or features.Maybe it's probably the world's largest SocialFi.

**PI = COIN + NETWORK.**

&amp;#x200B;

**PINETWORK is a global payment system**

However, the above two paragraphs are not what ONEPI wants to express. The real point is this one. PINETWORK is a huge, complex and pure system, and I will use three examples to express it.

①History: First Emperor of Qin\`s imperial system locked China for more than 2,000 years

First emperor in the history of China is only the emperor of Qin, because the monarchy he created directly locked up the system of all subsequent dynasties,from the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period to the Tang、Song、Yuan、Ming dynasty without exception.Imperial system is the ancient emperor a set of management system of the country, the biggest succession system of the emperor.Under the heaven all the king's land, the king's subjects.

This is the power of continuity in the imperial system.

② Finance: SWIFT settlement system dominates global finance

SWIFT, founded in 1973, its purpose is to realize international financial transactions, it has become the global standard of financial settlement, and has been controlled by the United States, and the U.S. dollar and gold, hard goods purchase link.It controls the world's finance through a single clearing system, and if there is a financial crisis in the United States, the world takes over.

This is why the financial settlement system is highly controlled.

③Encryption: Bitcoin network locks all cryptocurrencies

Whether it is blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has established the bottom layer of blockchain and cryptocurrency, with characteristics such as decentralization, smart contract, distributed storage, anonymity and so on. All subsequent cryptocurrencies or blockchain projects physically jump out of its rules.

These are the underlying rules of the block network system.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what system is PINETWORK?**

(1) It may be the largest SocialFi network in the world. Pioneers have a two-layer social relationship, inviting relationship and security circle relationship.

(2) It may be the world's largest native cryptocurrency payment system.All pioneers hold PICOIN, unlike PAYPAL users who need users to buy cryptocurrency. PINETWORK may have multiple cryptographic versions of Amazon, that is, PICOIN can be directly used for online and offline purchases of goods.

(3) It may become a legal currency payment option in some countries, just as El Salvador has defined Bitcoin as its legal currency, and PINETWORK has too many shortcomings in terms of total volume, price, miner fees and user penetration.

(4) It may be a global legal currency exchange and settlement system, where users can directly exchange various legal currencies among various legal currency suppliers. Of course, the exchange rate calculation of each country's legal currencies may be required in the middle, but all exchange rate calculation problems will be solved within the APP.

When the outbreak of the world to ease, the gate began to open and global integration will accelerate.The average user will once again enter the global user flow. The world needs a currency with such high penetration that it can settle payments instantly without having to go to a bank to change them.

PICOIN is the only medium for the global cryptocurrency settlement and exchange system, so do you really think more than 20 million users is a lot? Not much at all! 100 million users? There is not much!

At the current rate, it will reach 50 million users by the end of the year. The average output of the users' basic computing power (personal computing power + security circle computing power) is less than 1000 coins, and the total available circulation is only 50 billion. There are 10 cryptographic circles worth more than 100 billion RMB, but which one can achieve global coverage and global payment?

If the number of users exceeds 100 million or 500 million, and the average amount of available currency for each user is only 500 or 100, then the price of a currency of 100 RMB, 500 RMB and 1000 RMB is very likely.

And fiat currency is inflating all over the world, and if the DOLLAR crashes, then inflation will be even faster, which will make the legal price of cryptocurrency even higher!

PI = COIN + NETWORK + SYSTEM (cryptocurrency + block network + value system)

There is another kernel value that is very, very important, and that is time!

https://preview.redd.it/gf62zbe2wdn71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c951c950018bbe592cb16e745a9d55f14fbea5a5

**PI: Only time is the ultimate currency**

Hayek said that money is the greatest invention of mankind, only it is open to the poor, power is not.

But, in ONEPI's view, Hayek should have added the word ""legal"" to the front of the currency.

While encryption is authority with a unified currency, and the rights and interests has become a kind of power. Although it is small, the collective vote of countless users through consensus becomes a kind of power, and the holding of coins is power. Although PINETWORK is officially promoted by centralization at present, it will develop into a self-organizing DAO in a gradually decentralized state in the future, and the power and rights in this DAO are PICOIN.

POWER equals wealth, so **PI=MONEY+POWER.**

On September 3, 2021, Elon Musk tweeted ""Time is the ultimate currency."" 

Why is PICOIN valuable? Because all PICOIN is acquired by users through time, and this time cost is value. Because it represents everyone's life and time, and BTC is the same too. Some people say that other currencies can also be used, but other currencies have investment costs (crowdfunding, mining, secondary market, etc.) and they can be acquired with capital in a very short period of time, directly or indirectly. It is fair that anyone can buy it. It is unfair that only people with money can buy it.

PICOIN costs nothing, but you have to sign up and click on lightning, and you have to invite people to sign up, and you have to add security circles, so it's free and expensive, so it's long and steady.

There is a line in Nikola Tesla's autobiography that ""only time can prove greatness"".

Time is the most expensive, because time represents life. Time cannot be obtained, and no one can obtain extra, while money can be obtained by means or inheritance.

PINETWORK is going to do this experiment of life space currency exchange, an experiment of cryptocurrency universalization, and it's a mission. How many cryptocurrencies in the blockchain currently have such a high mission? Less than five on the count of your fingers!

If Satoshi Nakamoto's idea is to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system, then BTC's mission is to create blockchain and cryptocurrency economies.

If Nicolas\` idea is to make cryptocurrencies universal on top of Bitcoin, then PICOIN's mission is to make cryptocurrencies global.

So **PI = TIME.**

https://preview.redd.it/8hdqnbi4wdn71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43b505a37161bf299d5c8d274ebf5f1f1b3fdecd

So let me ask, is the time expensive? Is life expensive?

So PI is not just a cryptocurrency, it's not just a blockchain project, it's not just a payment system. Its truth is a time-cost social experiment. Are you willing to pay for the PICOIN what you get for your life and your time? Are you willing to pay for life and time for PICOIN to form a consensus value?

So, this consensus and the value of life time, it is only worth 100 RMB, do you think enough?

If you spent 2 years earning 2000 life time coins, which you could call life money, how much would you be willing to price your time at? The pioneers collectively decided!

Say quietly, ONEPI is willing to own life currency, marked 1000+, as for the unit behind is what, aha! It is a secret!

Of course, the time value of all life currencies takes time to accumulate, from 0 to 1, from 1 to 100, from 100 to 10,000, like the PINETWORK's population fission, which takes time to settle.

If you remember the words in the profile of Nicolas, then you know that Nicolas and Cfan regard PI as their children, hoping that their children will become successful. PiBaby is growing up...... It is difficult to put a value on the things or people for which people give their time and life. This should tell you that PI is time, PI is life, and PI is the future.

“I want everything to come true, not just now! I wish time is long, value into a river! I wish world peace and freedom for all!”

&amp;#x200B;

**PIKING introduced**

Keep PI, Keep Hope! I am ONEPi, and I put forward the global slogan ""ONE PI ONE WORLD"" in August 2019.

Piking community, a Pinetwork integrated community, is committed to sharing Pinetwork and blockchain knowledge, Piking\`s three core: Preach Pinetwork+ share blockchain knowledge + discover quality projects.

**On September 7, in a historic event, the small Central American nation of El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender.**

The true significance of this day to the way people around the world exchange value and the meaning they attach to the concept of money will take some time to be fully reified and understood.

But also by the joy and optimism of millions of people around the world who see this great experiment with hope, ""Bitcoin Day"" marked the first case of a sovereign state that makes a decentralized digital asset its national currency. Was it a success, after all?**

## Politics behind the scenes

El Salvador, a nation of fewer than 7 million people, has long given up on claiming its monetary sovereignty**. In 2001, it ditched the colón, its national currency in use for more than a century, in favor of the US dollar.** The measure made a lot of sense from a practical point of view since the share of remittances (a good part of them coming from Salvadorans living in the United States) in the country's gross domestic product exceeded 16% at peak times.

At that time, then-President **Francisco Flores Pérez's move** sparked protests and was condemned by detractors who claimed it was undemocratic and supposedly benefited the bankers and the wealthy.

**Two decades later, President Nayib Bukele (a 40-year-old man who came to power at the head of a party called New Ideas) added another chapter to El Salvador's monetary novel, this time, complementing a foreign currency circulating in the country. with one without borders.**

Like 20 years ago, **there have been negative reactions in relation to the Bitcoin Law.** However, **the same surveys showing a lack of support for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a new means of payment suggest that a large portion of Salvadorans have a limited understanding of what it is and how it will affect their lives.**

Furthermore, in many cases, resentment towards Bitcoin may be related to resentment towards Bukele, who, despite his strong approval ratings, remains a divisive figure whose alleged autocratic tendencies concern some international observers.

In summary, there are good reasons to believe that there is no powerful ideological opposition to the concept of decentralized finance in El Salvador, and any resistance that currently exists will likely dissipate further down the adoption curve (if the implementation turns out to be a resounding success).

## The uproar in the country

**Meanwhile, the somewhat hasty launch of the payments infrastructure was, unsurprisingly, far from perfect. The government-run Chivo wallet was down for several hours, and some retail workers didn't know how to process BTC payments.** Shortly after launch, the president himself took on the customer support role, tweeting updates on the status of the wallet's service.

Overall, however, based on feedback from those who were there to witness El Salvador's first steps as a ""Bitcoin nation"", things started to calm down soon after a turbulent start. **Bart Mol, founder, and host of the ""** ***Satoshi Radio*** **"" podcast tweeted his experience from Chivo's ATMs not working to successful Lightning transactions to pay for pizza and coffee at different points of sale.**

The general feeling, Mol concluded, was to **""witness history.""**

## International response

The institutions of the global financial system seem less enthusiastic. **The International Monetary Fund has been passive-aggressive regarding El Salvador's Bitcoin Law since it was passed earlier this summer. Perhaps, if this experiment yields favorable results, the IMF and other global financial organizations will jump on the bandwagon?**

Some legal professionals are skeptical of this prospect. **During an ""Ask Me Anything"" (AMA) session on Discord with Cointelegraph Markets Pro subscribers last week, Cointelegraph General Counsel Zachary Kelman opined that global financial institutions are unlikely to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon as National currency:**

""The cited reasons (environment and transparency) for opposing the adoption of BTC by El Salvador are not the real reasons, which is the threat that the [development of cryptocurrency ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)poses to the established global political order and the banking system. Therefore I don't think these international bodies are widely supporting Bitcoin. ""

However, other nation-states are watching closely. It is true that El Salvador's position as the leader in remittances in the region, combined with its previous experience in outsourcing the national monetary function to a foreign currency, constitutes a rare combination. Most other countries have to rise to a higher bar, even if they could muster the political momentum to make a decentralized token recognized as legal tender.

Still, the possible favorable effects of El Salvador's move could prompt other countries to consider Bitcoin more seriously as a means of payment. **Amanda Wick,** head of legal affairs at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, **told Cointelegraph that** [**cryptocurrency development**](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) **is an ideal technology for remittances and is therefore well-positioned to serve economies that handle many remittances:**

""Many citizens \[in El Salvador\] do not have access to traditional financial services, and this could drive financial inclusion. These drivers can give us an idea of ​​which countries can follow suit. In our research, we have found that these use cases are already popular in countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia in particular. ""

**The acceleration of the digital currency research programs of the central banks of other countries, the push to define the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine,** and the discussions to make cryptocurrencies **a legal alternative payment method in Panama** can be seen as carryover effects of El Salvador's daring initiative.

"El Salvador's ""Bitcoin Day"": The First of Many or the Only One of Its Kind?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/pnvvac/el_salvadors_bitcoin_day_the_first_of_many_or_the/,yokesh351,1,2021-09-14 12:32:15,3,/r/Crypto_General/comments/pnvvac/el_salvadors_bitcoin_day_the_first_of_many_or_the/,NaN,"Thanks to El Salvador's daring move, digital money is high on the radars of policymakers around the world.

**On September 7, in a historic event, the small Central American nation of El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender.**

The true significance of this day to the way people around the world exchange value and the meaning they attach to the concept of money will take some time to be fully reified and understood. However, what is already clear is that September 2021 will be next to January 2009 in the history books of the digitization of finance.

**Surrounded by controversy, protests, a complicated deployment of infrastructures, what else? But also by the joy and optimism of millions of people around the world who see this great experiment with hope, ""Bitcoin Day"" marked the first case of a sovereign state that makes a decentralized digital asset its national currency. Was it a success, after all?**

## Politics behind the scenes

El Salvador, a nation of less than 7 million people, has long given up on claiming its monetary sovereignty **. In 2001, it ditched the colón, its national currency in use for more than a century, in favor of the US dollar.** The measure made a lot of sense from a practical point of view, since the share of remittances (a good part of them coming from Salvadorans living in the United States) in the country's gross domestic product exceeded 16% at peak times.

At that time, then-President **Francisco Flores Pérez's move** sparked protests and was condemned by detractors who claimed it was undemocratic and supposedly benefited the bankers and the wealthy.

**Two decades later, President Nayib Bukele (a 40-year-old man who came to power at the head of a party called New Ideas) added another chapter to El Salvador's monetary novel, this time, complementing a foreign currency circulating in the country. with one without borders.**

Like 20 years ago, **there have been negative reactions in relation to the Bitcoin Law.** However, **the same surveys showing a lack of support for Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a new means of payment suggest that a large portion of Salvadorans have a limited understanding of what it is and how it will affect their lives.**

Furthermore, in many cases, resentment towards Bitcoin may be related to resentment towards Bukele, who, despite his strong approval ratings, remains a divisive figure whose alleged autocratic tendencies concern some international observers.

In summary, there are good reasons to believe that there is no powerful ideological opposition to the concept of decentralized finance in El Salvador, and any resistance that currently exists will likely dissipate further down the adoption curve (if the implementation turns out to be a resounding success).

## The uproar in the country

**Meanwhile, the somewhat hasty launch of the payments infrastructure was, unsurprisingly, far from perfect. The government-run Chivo wallet was down for several hours, and some retail workers didn't know how to process BTC payments.** Shortly after launch, the president himself took on the customer support role, tweeting updates on the status of the wallet's service.

Overall, however, based on feedback from those who were there to witness El Salvador's first steps as a ""Bitcoin nation"", things started to calm down soon after a turbulent start. **Bart Mol, founder, and host of the ""** ***Satoshi Radio*** **"" podcast tweeted his experience from Chivo's ATMs not working to successful Lightning transactions to pay for pizza and coffee at different points of sale.**

The general feeling, Mol concluded, was to **""witness history.""**

## International response

The institutions of the global financial system seem less enthusiastic. **The International Monetary Fund has been passive-aggressive regarding El Salvador's Bitcoin Law since it was passed earlier this summer. Perhaps, if this experiment yields favorable results, the IMF and other global financial organizations will jump on the bandwagon?**

Some legal professionals are skeptical of this prospect. **During an ""Ask Me Anything"" (AMA) session on Discord with Cointelegraph Markets Pro subscribers last week, Cointelegraph General Counsel Zachary Kelman opined that global financial institutions are unlikely to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon as National currency:**

""The cited reasons (environment and transparency) for opposing the adoption of BTC by El Salvador are not the real reasons, which is the threat that the [development of cryptocurrency ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development)poses to the established global political order and the banking system. Therefore I don't think these international bodies are widely supporting Bitcoin. ""

However, other nation-states are watching closely. It is true that El Salvador's position as the leader in remittances in the region, combined with its previous experience in outsourcing the national monetary function to a foreign currency, constitutes a rare combination. Most other countries have to rise to a higher bar, even if they could muster the political momentum to make a decentralized token recognized as legal tender.

Still, the possible favorable effects of El Salvador's move could prompt other countries to consider Bitcoin more seriously as a means of payment. **Amanda Wick,** head of legal affairs at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, **told Cointelegraph that** [**cryptocurrency development**](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) **is an ideal technology for remittances and is therefore well-positioned to serve economies that handle many remittances:**

""Many citizens \[in El Salvador\] do not have access to traditional financial services, and this could drive financial inclusion. These drivers can give us an idea of ​​which countries can follow suit. In our research, we have found that these use cases are already popular in countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia in particular. ""

**The acceleration of the digital currency research programs of the central banks of other countries, the push to define the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine,** and the discussions to make cryptocurrencies **a legal alternative payment method in Panama** can be seen as carryover effects of El Salvador's daring initiative.

**Obviously, not all states are in a position to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency.** But on September 7, virtually everyone was driven to rethink their position on the world's digital money map.

**Regardless of the outcome of El Salvador's experiment, the pioneering example of the Central American nation has already brought cryptocurrency to the mainstream political agenda more than it could achieve without the recognition of a sovereign state.**"

How to Generate Passive Income With Decentralized Finance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/po3679/how_to_generate_passive_income_with_decentralized/,Icy-EndCrypt,1,2021-09-14 21:50:22,2,/r/economy/comments/po3679/how_to_generate_passive_income_with_decentralized/,NaN,"Today, modern decentralized protocols and smart contract applications offer the DeFi user things like yield farming, staking, and lending, allowing them to accrue steady growth on their initial outlay. So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It’s a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use “staking” as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

If you, like me, are delighted with passive earnings with DeFi, please share your experience and thoughts. What platforms have you already used?"

HOLD DEEP OTM CALL OPTIONS AT NO COST,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/po9wst/hold_deep_otm_call_options_at_no_cost/,Successful-Way-3000,1,2021-09-15 03:37:20,40,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/po9wst/hold_deep_otm_call_options_at_no_cost/,Discussion,"For those that want a higher profit curve when AMC moons.. NFA

We all do it... Deep OTM calls that almost never pan out but when they do it means faster lambos..

Hedge fucks get us that way and use that as a steady source of income to cover the cost of their shorts. So I say flip that shit on them and use their strategies against them.

Here is how it goes:

Recycle time : 1 week

If you are a XXX holder or more sell a near the money call option for a credit using 100 shares as collateral. Then go to the last strike price and buy as many OTM call options as the credit gives you.

Senario 1: stock price falls, otm option worth less, but covered by the credit received.

Senario 2: stock price stays the same, otm option worth less, but covered by the credit received

Senario 3: stock price goes up slightly but under the near the money strike price, still profit from your shares, otm option worthless, but covered by the credit received

Senario 4: stock price blows past your near the money strike but not enough to reach the OTM call option, keep the credit received, cover the exercised near the money call option with your shares at a profit (strike - avg) and quickly buy your position back to maintain your shares. OTM option worthless, covered by credit received.

Senario 5: stock price moons.... Nuff said

What this does is essentially forces the market makers and hedge fucks to finance your gamble at no cost to you. And since the amount of otm long calls are much higher than what you are selling near the money, you force the hedge fucks and market makers to hedge their options positions by buying more stock.

Example: AMC Price 47.80 Hold 100 shares of AMC stock at 47.80 Sell 1 53 call option for 0.87 Buy 22 145 call options for 0.04

I do this every week on Monday and have maintained an options and raw stock position since February without adding more money to my account.

"Humaninties first contact gone Oh, So Right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/pqfhp3/humaninties_first_contact_gone_oh_so_right/,Akmedrah,1,2021-09-18 12:09:34,33,/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/pqfhp3/humaninties_first_contact_gone_oh_so_right/,long,"SEXUAL SHIT INBOUND: Mods, if this is not okay, please let me know, but as far as I could tell from the rules and the wiki, I think (?) I'm good to go.

So before we dive into this, I want to say three things:

1: I do not know if this will be ongoing, depending on how it's received and how much time I have, it might be. But as per the usual with my stories, I make no promises. 

2: I personally do not like the idea of ""Trigger Warnings"" for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I can't anticipate what every individual will find 'triggering.' So I don't use them. Please do not take this personally or as a slight against a particular group, I simply believe that my job as a writer is to allow all those who read what I write to interpret it however they want, free from any influence of what I may or may not find to be inappropriate. 

3: I will be using a couple of the races and slang terms (altered slightly) that I have come up with for my other one-off stories. This is not an extension of those stories, I just like the races and have some, shall we say, alternative ideas for them.

Now that being said, I hope you all enjoy this and join me in horny jail, soon enough.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allan lay on top of his favorite spot, a hill just outside of the town he had been born and raised in, and stared up at the stars. ""I wish I could travel the galaxy,"" he said to himself, he had always felt sad that he was born in what he called the age of stagnation. All the spots of the map were filled in, there was no more 'here be dragons,' no more grand quests to save the kingdom. And it was too soon for him to ever hope to be a space pirate, or make the first contact with an alien species. His life would be stagnant, working a nine-to-five until he was seventy years old, and then he would die. Maybe have children, and maybe, if they were lucky, their great-grandchildren would get to live out Allan's dream.

This melancholy was nothing new to Allan, he had struggled in high school, when everyone had been talking with gusto about what they wanted to be. After getting a degree in personal finance, Allan had sought out adventure through work, working as a crab fisherman in Alaska, A safari guide in Africa, and most recently he had worked and lived as a sherpa for rich billionaires who wanted to climb Everest. All that before his 27th birthday, ""Say what you will about me universe."" He proclaimed to sky, ""But I do work hard when I want to. I still wish for adventure though."" Today was his birthday, and all of his friends, those who were still local, had been busy, so Allan had come out to his spot with a fifth of vodka.

""Is that all you truly want?"" A strangely melodic voice said from behind him. Allan sat up and looked behind him. What he saw shocked him for a moment. A woman standing slightly shorter than him, naked, well naked except for scales that he assumed were body art, the scales were small and looked almost soft, covering the woman everywhere except for her face, breasts, a line of skin from her breasts down to an inch or two below her navel, and her sex. 

""Wow,"" Allan said, taking a breath as he felt himself harden. ""Awesome cosplay. Did Eddy put you  up to this?"" He walked slowly around the woman, who was still looking at him, turning her head to follow his movement as he clearly inspected every inch of her from afar. This would be something Eddy would do, he had told Eddy that no one could hang, and Allan would not put it past the marine to call up every connection he had and hire some woman to make sure that Allan was not alone on his birthday.

""I am sorry but I do not know an Eddy."" The woman said as Allan tore his gaze away from her marvelous assets and looked at her face. That was when he saw the three lines of what could only be gills, sitting under her jawline. ""But answer me fleshing of the deathworld, as I can not remain here long, is adventure all you wish for in your life?"" She said, and Allan saw the gills fluttering in sequence. 

""I mean, I think, I guess?"" Eddy said stuttering as he looked closer at the woman, he stepped up as his brain fought to make sense of what he was seeing, the gills appeared to function, her face had a nose, but there were no nostrils. And with how firmly the woman mouth seemed to be closed when she was not talking he didn't think there was any way that she was breathing through her mouth. The only conclusion that his partially drunken brain could come to, was that the gills were real. He took a step back. ""What..."" He fumbled for words, ""What are you? Who are you? Why are you here?"" 

""I suppose that is an appropriate line of questioning."" The woman said, taking a seat cross-legged which only served to increase the strange mix of emotions inside Allan's head, as it put her gloriously on display him after she leaned back to rest her ams on the ground behind her. ""My name is Alyniqual Jushintorg."" 

Allan thought for a moment before shaking his head. ""That is a lot, may I call you Aly?"" he asked, trying and failing to stop himself from looking down at the spot where the woman's legs met. He hadn't caught most of her name and judging from how she had pronounced it, he doubted he would ever be able to say it right.

The woman laughed, a sound that if he had heard it anywhere else, he would have assumed that someone was playing around with sound effects. It was beautiful, if anyone had ever wondered what an angle's laugh sounded like, he now knew. ""you may call me Aly, yes. As to what I am, I believe that the word you would use is an alien. I am a member of the Quillinar race. Why am I here? That one is more difficult to answer, especially given the time constraints. But suffice it to say that I came looking for someone, anyone who I might be able to convince to come along with me."" 

She seemed saddened. ""To make a very long story short, I am alone and have been for the last 14 of what you call years.  The crew of my ship died, and everyone believes me to be cursed, so no other sentient I asked would fly with me, so I decided to find one who would, I have spent the last fourteen of your years scouring one deathworld after another."" She stopped, and her gills seemed to be working overtime, and her arms had begun to shake. ""The gravity of this world is extreme, even with nanites to facilitate my body's function, I can not remain long. So I ask again, is adventure all that you desire?"" 

Allan thought for a moment. ""Yes, I mean it's most of what I desire."" 

""If that is true, and you have nothing to hold you here, come with me."" She attempted to rise, and was pushed to the ground. Allan stepped over and reached down to scoop her up, she was incredibly light and incredibly cold. ""I am sorry, the gravity is far stronger than I anticipated."" She said as Allan placed her on her feet. ""And you are very warm."" She sighed, almost erotically as she stepped up to him pressing her body into his. She seemed to come to her senses after only a moment, "" I am sorry, I got carried away."" She stepped back, and her scales seemed to ruffle along her body. ""Come with me fleshing of the deathworld, and I can promise you adventure."" 

Allan looked at the gloriously naked woman standing in front of him, his soul ached for what she was offering. A part of him wanted to stay and look after his mother and father. But this was what he wanted. What he had wanted since the first time he had read the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He took a deep breath. ""A beautiful woman, shows up naked, asking me to go on an adventure with her? How could I say No? I do need to say goodby to my mother though. If that won't be a problem, I will go with you."" 

The look in her eyes could have outshone the sun. ""Thank you,"" she said, quietly almost so quietly that he could not hear her as she looked down at her feet, mercurial tears streamed down her face. She wiped them quickly and reach into a pouch that Allan had not noticed hanging on a string from her waist. She handed him a matte black disc. ""Do what you must. I will be waiting. When you are ready, simply speak my name into the comm disk and I will bring you aboard my ship."" She turned, speaking quietly to herself once again. ""Please hurry."" She disappeared a moment later.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Allan walked back to the home he had grown up in he thought about what had just happened. And every time his mind tried to tell him that he was losing it, he would look into his hand and see the disk, it was clearly not from Earth, he didn't know what it was that made him think that but it just wasn't. Before he got home he made a call to Eddy, without saying much he manged to extract a promise that if Allan's mother called Eddy would do everything he could to help.

""Yo, Allan, you have been talking cryptic this whole time. But whatever it is that is going on you sound excited."" Eddy said towards the end of their conversation. 

""I am, more than I ever have been. I don't know if I'm coming back from this one Eddy. Can you please..."" Allan choked up.

""Hey man, we are brothers, your mom is my mom and all that. I know you worry with your dad and all that..."" Eddy faded off, eluding to the fact that Allan's father was a notorious drunk. ""But hey man, just know that if anything ever happens, me and my boys will take care of it."" A chorus of exceptionally motivated marines chimed in then with chants of 'Oorah', and 'kill kill kill.'

""Thanks, man, if I come back I'll tell you all about it."" Allan said smiling at the thought of twenty or so pissed-off Marines showing up only to be coddled by my loving mother. 

""Sure thing boss."" Eddy said. ""And hey Allan, whatever it is, give 'em hell."" 

""Copy that."" Allan hung up the phone. With that taken care of he walked through the front door of his home. His father was out at the bar, as was his norm. And his mother was home, like always, working on some craft project or another. ""Hey mom, I'm home."" he said.

""Surprise!"" A single voice said, jumping out from behind the curtain to his mothers crafts room. His mother was holding a cake with 27 candles on it. ""Happy Birthday Allen!"" she said, before blowing into one of those party horns. 

Allan was truly surprised, he and his mom had gone to lunch for his birthday. He had not expected her to awake let alone planning anything. ""Hey, mom."" Allan said, taking the cake and blowing out the candles, as he set it to the side, and hugged the woman to him tightly.

""Allan, what's wrong?"" She asked when he finally let her go. She could always tell when something was off. 

""Mom, sit down."" he said, guiding her to the couch. ""I just got offered an opportunity that I can't say no to."" He looked at her, tears streaming down his face. ""I..."" He could not find the words. 

""Allen James Mac'Millen, look at me."" She said, her tone happy and supportive. Allan looked up. ""I know exactly what is going on. I knew this day would come, I have known since you were a little boy."" Allen was stunned by her words. ""I knew that one day someone would off you the adventure that you seemed always to be seeking, and that when it happened, you would leave. Never before, even when you moved to Nepal, have you come to me like this."" She hugged him, again. ""So the only thing that I can say, is go. Have your adventure, live your life."" 

""Thanks mom."" Allan said, relief streaming through him. ""I don't know if I'll come back from where I'm going, though."" 

""I didn't say you had to come back."" She said playfully. The next hour was a hustle and bustle of activity, as he talked with his mother, and she tried to give him money, and other things, but Allan refused most of it. Allen also made sure that Eddy's number was still in his mothers phone. ""Allan, take this,"" she handed the large green ammo canister that dad kept his old glock 17 in. ""I don't care if you throw it in the river, if your not going to be around, I don't want to worry about you."" 

Allan relented and packed his backpack with the gun, and all 1500 rounds that his father kept in the house, as well as food, water, and survival tools, and a hammock. ""Well I guess this is it."" Allan said, hugging his mother at the front door. ""Love you mom, and seriously, don't hesitate to call Eddy, if needs be, I'm sure he'll show up with a full squad of marines to deal with anything that happens."" 

""I won't."" She said tears, streaming down her face. ""Stay safe, wherever it is that you are going."" Allen nodded and picked up his pack, walking out the door. After he had left his neighborhood he took the black disk from his pocket, ""Aly, I'm ready."" a moment later, a faint humming filled his ears.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next thing that Allan knew he was *somewhere.* The room was small, and dimly lit, when he walked out the door, almost bowled over Aly, who looked as if she had been sprinting. She seemed far more at ease here than she had on the hill. Allan guessed that it had something to with the Florida like humidity and the fact that he felt incredibly light, despite the 70 pounds of equipment and goods in his pack. 

""You came,"" Aly said, sounding genuinely surprised. ""You actually came."" 

""I said I would."" Allan said, and a thought hit him. ""By the way, my name is Allan."" 

""Allan,"" she looked up at his face. ""Allan, very well, let me show you to the sleeping quarter. And then we will get underway to a Jumpgate."" She turned and lead him to a single large room, in it was a bowl-shaped depression, filled with what he thought was sand. she walked in and told him to leave his things. He stepped into the sand, and sunk almost six inches. 

""Woah,"" he said, reaching down to the sand, and realizing that it had to be some kind of synthetic material. It was soft, and somewhat warm. ""Ohhh, this is the bed isn't it."" 

""Yes."" Aly said, with hesitation. ""Do you not have propper sleeping pits for your clans?"" 

""Nope, we use beds, I guess a better description would be an elevated sleeping platform, but no."" Allan said as he set his things to the side of the pit. He followed Aly to the bridge of the ship, he guessed this is where she had run from, as it seemed to be the farthest from the room he had arrived in. ""COOL!"" He shouted, running past Aly to look out the window, far below him, Earth, his homeworld, spun in the inky black of space like a top.

""Allan, before we get underway we need to ensure that you are properly inoculated against things you may encounter. Please come through here."" She gestured at a door that had a strange curving symbol on it. Inside the room Allan could *feel* the sterility of every surface.

""Medical bay?"" he asked, as Aly began tapping buttons. 

""Yes, please, stand still."" She said, and Allan did as requested. A moment later a beam of light that seemed to oscillate from yellow to purple appeared at his feet, and slowly moved up his body. Once it had reached the top of his head it vanished, and Aly began to read something intently. ""Amazing, apparently your species immune system is far more advanced than anything the computer can find in the database. As far as it knows any disease that you encounter will effect you only minimally, with fluid excretions from your mucus membranes. And..."" She trailed off, her scales ruffling, and a bright pink flush crossing her cheeks.

""And what?"" Allan asked looking Aly up and down, marveling once again at her beauty, and how cute it was when her scales got ruffled. 

Her blushing intensified, ""And apparently, your genetics are some of the most compatible the computer has ever encountered. Should you choose a life-mate, you should quite easily be able to procreate and have offspring. ""

""Wait you mean I can fuck?"" He asked playfully. She looked up at him, not understanding his tone. 

""I believe so?"" She said, looking at him with a strange mix of fear and something else in her face. ""Should you require it, as is stated in the Quillinar charter of directives, my body is available to you for use should your race have only specific time constraints on when you can reproduce."" She bowed what Allan judged to be a very practiced bow.

""Wait what?"" the shock and surprise in his voice threw Aly off. ""What the hell does that mean?"" Allan was genuinely shocked. ""Don't get me wrong, I love sex, and given the appropriate opportunity, I'm fairly sure that I'll fuck my way out of a situation. But you don't have to make yourself available to me."" 

""But I do."" Aly said, confusion running through her voice. ""The Quillinar are a race of beings that prioritize the reproductive rights of all races. If we are capable, and a crewmate has no other option, we are bound by our lows to make best efforts at ensuring that reproduction limited races have every opportunity to plant their seed, and bring more life to the galaxy."" 

""Okay,"" Allan's mind was spinning from that one, ""well first of all, I'm not reproduction limited, and secondly, that's just not how I do things. So that will not be required. However, if you desire it, or even if you need to blow off some steam, and just want a quick dick in the woods. I would be more than happy to accommodate you. Deal?"" 

His tone made it clear that this was a hill he would die on. ""Yes Allan, I understand. Since you do not need any medical treatment, let us get underway, and then we can sleep, as I am sure this has been a taxing day for you."" 

Allan nodded. She quickly explained that this portion of the galaxy was under a no warp restriction so it would take several days to reach a Jumpgate. She set the autopilot and then walked with him back to the room where his things were. ""Welp, nighty night then,"" Allan said, as he walked in, expecting her to continue to her own room. She instead followed him in. She lay on the sand, and looked up at him, as if waiting. ""I'm sorry did I miss something?"" Allan asked, once again very confused.

""No, it is time to sleep, this is the clan sleeping pit, so let us sleep."" Aly said, her own confusion flashing across her face. Then an understanding look. ""Your people do not sleep together to conserve body heat."" 

""Nnnooo."" Allan said, slowly, then he looked in her eyes, and saw the loneliness of years in her eyes, and the crushed hopes of having what she called a clan again. Allan sighed, taking his shirt off, ""But you know what they say, when in Rome."" This got more confusion from Aly, as he took off his boots, socks pants and hesitated with his underwear.

""Full nudity guarantees the best exchange of heat."" Aly said, not picking up on the embarrassment that Allan was try ing throttle down. Her tone of voice was amusing to Allan though, it was not a trick, she was simply following what she knew. 

""When in rome."" he said again to himself and then dropped his underwear to the pile of clothes. stepping into the sandpit, he lay down, trying to give them a little space but the sand seemed to push them together. His breath came in sharply as Aly lay, facing him, and snuggled up close. Her breasts pressing into his chest, and the top of her head nestled under his chin, she intertwined her legs with his, and he thought that there would be no way he would get to sleep. He was wrong, moments later they were both asleep, entangled in each other.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next day Allan awoke to a pleasant sensation. It looked as if in the night, Aly had wrapped her arms and legs around him and pulled him close, the result being that his face was pressed in between her breasts, and his morning wood was pressed under her exquisite ass, the base of his cock against the lower folds of her sex, and the head resting against the curve of her ass. He was fairly certain she was asleep still, and he was too embraced to move, so for the moment, he simply enjoyed his luck. A moment later, she moaned a little, the moan of someone who was having a great dream.

Her hips bucked back a little, rubbing herself onto his manhood even more. Her grip with her arms and legs tightened further. Allen had never been one to cockblock anyone, especially a woman who was using him as her very own hump pillow, so he closed his eyes and fell back asleep, listening to her sweet little moans, and enjoying the feeling of her breasts on his face.

When Allan awoke again, Aly was sitting up next to him. ""Allan, I'm...I'm so sorry... I..."" She could hardly get the words out, and the embased pink flush from yesterday was back as an agry red color that went all the way from her sex, to her face. When Allan looked down, and saw that he had most certainly been used as a pillow, he laughed. ""I will take you back... you did not... I just..."" Aly burst into tears.

""What? Why? I don't want to go back."" Allan said, running a finger through the juices she had left behind to coat his cock, and then placing it in his mouth and moaning, ""and holy shit do you taste amazing."" She turned and even more violent shade of red at this.

""I sexually assaulted you."" She said, quivering as she clearly was still orgasming. ""I am a terrible person."" 

""What?"" Allan said, surprised by what she said. ""Aly I woke up when you started your little dream, I could have easily just left you to have that dream on your own, you did not assault me."" 

""Yes I did."" She started crying, ignoring what he had said. ""I didn't want to. I was asleep, my body just *did that.* It's been so long that..."" what she was saying was cut off, as she stared in shock at Allan. ""Wait, you said that you woke when it started, you knew this was happening."" 

""Yes Ma'am."" Allan said, smiling mischievously. ""You know if it's been that long, and you're that hard up, I would be happy to, shall we say pop that quark. As I said yesterday."" 

""You mean..."" She didn't finish what she was saying as a wave of excitement washed ever her at Allan's nod. She looked at Allan's rock-hard manhood standing at attention, and a moan escaped her lips. She crawled as if she made to take him inter mouth, and while he was not opposed to the idea of watching her ass wiggle as she sucked him, the thing that intrigued him most in that moment was the sight of her still dripping pussy as she moved to grab him. Without warning, he leaned up and grabbed her legs, and in the low gravity, easily lifted her above him as he lay back down. ""Allan what....eep!"" she started to ask something but it was cut off as he set her down right on his face and his tongue went to work learning every delicious fold of her sex. 

""Ohh, Allan."" She moaned, that angelic voice of her making him even harder than he thought possible. ""Don't stop, please, for the love of Elunitra please don't stop."" she moaned as she involuntarily moved her hips, grinding her throbbing pussy into his tongue. ""Ohh, goddess."" was all she said, before a torrent of liquid streamed down Allan's face. He felt her thighs squeeze his head which only made him more excited. She collapsed next to him a literal quivering mess. 

""Ready for more?"" Allan asked, watching her carefully touching her engorged nipples and clit. She looked at him, and unable to speak simply nodded. Allan smiled and picked her up again, laying her on her back. He leaned forward his face still dripping from her previous orgasm, and kissed her, not a gentle lover's kiss, this kiss informed Aly that she was about to be ravished. And she eagerly awaited every second of it. As their tongues worked in each other's mouths, Allan reached down and gently guided the tip of his cock inside her. He slid forward only about two inches. The whole time he felt the walls and lips of her pussy squeeze. ""Holy fuck you are tight."" 

""My race,"" She was panting this out in between kisses. ""Regrows...its hymen... if ... there is... no penetration... for a time.""

""Really?"" Allan said, stopping and looking down at her. ""That's cool, so you could say that at this moment, I'm going to be your first."" He teased her slightly by pushing ever so slightly deeper into her. 

""Mmmm, yes."" She said with a moan that told him she was angry he wasn't moving inside her already. Claws slid out of the ends of her fingernails, and she dug them into his back, causing him to moan. ""Yes,"" she panted, ""Right now I am about to let myself be fucked senseless by a deathworlder, as tight as the day I left my spawn-father's home. Now shut up and fuck me."" she demanded and in a surprise motion, thrust her hips up until Allan felt his their pelvises touch. 

Allan didn't respond, only placed a hand on her throat, and began thrusting into every glorious inch of the tight wonderland that was Aly's sex. No words were spoken, as she threw her arms and legs around him, which only seemed to make her grow tighter. Her claws raked down his back making him arch into her even deeper. A moment later Aly pulled him down on top of her locking her legs so that he could not move, and her arms around his back held him still. The throbbing and pulsating around his cock told him that had reached climax. ""Please, hold still for one second."" She begged. 

Allan held still for a moment. ""You okay?"" Allan asked in a whisper, nibbling on the slightly pointed lobes of her ears. 

""Yes."" She gasped out, a quiver from her sex, and a sudden rush of liquid around Allan's cock telling him that she had come once again. ""More?"" she asked in a voice that said she wanted it but was unsure if she could take it. 

""If you want. I am fine stopping here."" Allan said, internally he was a little upset he hadn't finished yet, but this was for her.

""What about you?"" She asked moving her hips in such a way that she could still feel every inch of him filling her. She moaned, ""You have not achieved orgasm yet, and I don't want you to feel used."" 

""I think that if I fuck you anymore it will either drive you insane, or make it so you can't walk, so how about you do what you wanted earlier."" Allan said, and she smiled, her eyes lighting up. Allan pulled out from her, as she undid her death grip around him. 

He stood up and made as if to flop lay back down, and she shook her head. ""You may not know, but I should not be able to speak your language, the only reason that I can,"" she moved to kneel in front of him, ""is that your people had a rudimentary data net established, with a shocking amount of porn, I think its called, in learning your language I watched a little of it, and I can assure you one thing."" as she knelt in front of him she reached up in an incredibly sexy manor, and brushed away her hair, gesturing to the gills. ""I don't need to 'come up for air' as I heard it put."" She smiled at him in an evil manner, ""My race also has no gag-reflex. So think of my throat as if it were your, what's the term,"" she arched her back, sticking out her magnificent breasts, and placed her finger on her chin in a position that Allan could have sworn she took from a sexy librarian video. ""Ah, yes, think of my throat as your own personal fuck hole."" 

She leaned forward and kissed the tip of his cock, and then ran her tongue from the base all the way to the tip. Allan moaned, and then Aly opened her mouth, and forced his whole cock down her throat. Allan was shocked, he was not the largest in the dick department, but no woman he had been with ever tried to deepthroat him. He waited for the inevitable moment that she would pull off, and then what she had said sunk in. ""You're sure?"" Allan said placing a hand on her head, and without pulling off she looked up at him with the greatest 'fuck me' eyes he had ever seen, and nodded slightly, all while sliding her incredibly long tongue out to tickle his balls. ""Fuck, okay, if you need to stop tap my leg."" she rolled her eyes and surprised him once more by reaching behind him, and grabbing his has with both her hands and pulling him even deeper down her throat. 

""Game on."" Allan moaned, and tangled both his hands in her hair, thrusting into Aly's wet mouth, over and over, even though he hadn't finished earlier, he had been close. ""Fuck, baby, I'm close, where do you want it."" Allan asked, looking down without stopping his relentless assault on her throat. She looked at him with a look that said ""*where do you think?""*  ""Yes Ma'am."" Allan grunted out thrusting harder and deeper, Aly's hands helping pull his deeper as they clasped his ass. ""Ohh baby."" He groaned and she pulled him deep and held him there, surprising him again as her tongue swirled out, revealing that it was longer than he had imagined, opening her jaw wider than he had imagined possible, and using only her tongue, swept his balls into her mouth as well. 

The torrent of cum that spilled down her throat as she hummed in pleasure force him to buck his hips trying to get deeper. when he finally finished, his orgasm was extended by Aly using her tongue to stroke him inside her mouth. he pulled out. Allan then collapsed next to Aly, who snuggled up to him. 

""Day one of my adventure and I have already done more than could have imagined,"" Allan said stoking the scales on Aly's back. ""I wonder what will happen next."" 

Aly looked up at him from where her head lay on his chest. ""I can assure you that there will be more of this."" Aly said, kissing his chest, and then sliding up to snuggle so that they could be face to face. ""If you want it that is.""

""Of course."" He said, she kissed him. ""You said we have three days before we get to warp-permissible space and then to a jump gate, this is day one of three right."" 

""Yes."" Aly said, wondering where he was going with this.

""Then I guess that means I have three days to make up for the years you went without a clan or a lover."" He said. Internally Allan was unsure of where this would end or if it ever would, but he knew one thing. The adventure that he'd always wanted was here, and if it included some hot alien ass, well that was a bonus. The two of them snuggled up and fell into a deep sleep of exhaustion.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes.

 

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater."

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave.

Many of the tokens in the top 200 are  Erc-20 tokens that don’t have official wallets and Metamask is predominately used as the utility wallet application. I didn’t list all of those. 

___
 

Many coins and tokens have wallet applications that have been specifically designed to allow you to better utilize your crypto and/or help support the native blockchain or the project you’re invested in. 

In some cases, multi asset wallets may be the best or only option. Many in the top 200 are supported by multi asset wallets and that’s easily searchable.


This is not a complete list of every wallet. This is a list of the most recommended wallets, most popular, and official or crypto specific wallets where applicable and excludes stable and wrapped coins and most well known multi asset wallets like Exodus, Atomic, Coinomi, Guarda, etc. as these together support almost every crypto in the top 200 and are not specifically designed for utilization of a single coin or blockchain. 

Please let me know if I made any mistakes or if additions are needed.

$PStake Airdrop - Details Revealed (Now Claimable),https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/prjo6z/pstake_airdrop_details_revealed_now_claimable/,Sybaros,1,2021-09-20 08:11:16,151,/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/prjo6z/pstake_airdrop_details_revealed_now_claimable/,:fire: BOOOOM :fire:,"\[$PStake Medium Post\]([https://medium.com/pstakefinance/pstake-airdrop-explained-8fd5e8569924](https://medium.com/pstakefinance/pstake-airdrop-explained-8fd5e8569924))

Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with pStakeFinance or Persistence, just an FYI post for all of my fellow $ATOM holders.

On September 10th, \[pStakeFinance announced they would be airdropping tokens to $ATOM holders and stakers\]([https://medium.com/pstakefinance/pstake-airdrop-2c5bc5b74367](https://medium.com/pstakefinance/pstake-airdrop-2c5bc5b74367)) as well as $XPRT holders and stakers and users of  SushiSwap, Curve Finance, and Aave.  A snapshot was taken at September 2nd 12:00UTC to determine who qualifies for this airdrop.  Over the weekend, \[they released the details of the airdrop\]([https://medium.com/pstakefinance/pstake-airdrop-explained-8fd5e8569924](https://medium.com/pstakefinance/pstake-airdrop-explained-8fd5e8569924)), including the formulas for how to calculate the amount of $PStake you will receive.

I just finished claiming my airdrop, you can go to [https://airdrop.pstake.finance/](https://airdrop.pstake.finance/) to claim what you're allotted for owning and staking $ATOM or $XPRT.  In order to claim it, you will be required to make a magic transaction.  This involves sending 0.000001ATOM to a specific address (which they provide) from the address which qualifies you from the airdrop, and also needs you to include an Ethereum address in the memo which will be where the claimed $PStake is sent.  If you qualify for $PStake through other means, I think it will probably be sent to your address automatically at some point."

I'm good to go.

So before we dive into this, I want to say three things:

1: I do not know if this will be ongoing, depending on how it's received and how much time I have, it might be. But as per the usual with my stories, I make no promises.

2: I personally do not like the idea of ""Trigger Warnings"" for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I can't anticipate what every individual will find 'triggering.' So I don't use them. Please do not take this personally or as a slight against a particular group, I simply believe that my job as a writer is to allow all those who read what I write to interpret it however they want, free from any influence of what I may or may not find to be inappropriate.

3: I will be using a couple of the races and slang terms (altered slightly) that I have come up with for my other one-off stories. This is not an extension of those stories, I just like the races and have some, shall we say, alternative ideas for them.

This my first post on r/HFY and I am reposting here from r/humansarespaceorcs at the suggesting of several people. This part and part 2 will be reposts, and from here on, I intend to post to r/HFY and cross share to r/humansarespaceorcs . Enjoy.

Allan lay on top of his favorite spot, a hill just outside of the town he had been born and raised in, and stared up at the stars. ""I wish I could travel the galaxy,"" he said to himself, he had always felt sad that he was born in what he called the age of stagnation. All the spots of the map were filled in, there was no more 'here be dragons,' no more grand quests to save the kingdom. And it was too soon for him to ever hope to be a space pirate, or make the first contact with an alien species. His life would be stagnant, working a nine-to-five until he was seventy years old, and then he would die. Maybe have children, and maybe, if they were lucky, their great-grandchildren would get to live out Allan's dream.

This melancholy was nothing new to Allan, he had struggled in high school, when everyone had been talking with gusto about what they wanted to be. After getting a degree in personal finance, Allan had sought out adventure through work, working as a crab fisherman in Alaska, A safari guide in Africa, and most recently he had worked and lived as a sherpa for rich billionaires who wanted to climb Everest. All that before his 27th birthday, ""Say what you will about me universe."" He proclaimed to sky, ""But I do work hard when I want to. I still wish for adventure though."" Today was his birthday, and all of his friends, those who were still local, had been busy, so Allan had come out to his spot with a fifth of vodka.

""Is that all you truly want?"" A strangely melodic voice said from behind him. Allan sat up and looked behind him. What he saw shocked him for a moment. A woman standing slightly shorter than him, naked, well naked except for scales that he assumed were body art, the scales were small and looked almost soft, covering the woman everywhere except for her face, breasts, a line of skin from her breasts down to an inch or two below her navel, and her sex.

""Wow,"" Allan said, taking a breath as he felt himself harden. ""Awesome cosplay. Did Eddy put you  up to this?"" He walked slowly around the woman, who was still looking at him, turning her head to follow his movement as he clearly inspected every inch of her from afar. This would be something Eddy would do, he had told Eddy that no one could hang, and Allan would not put it past the marine to call up every connection he had and hire some woman to make sure that Allan was not alone on his birthday.

""I am sorry but I do not know an Eddy."" The woman said as Allan tore his gaze away from her marvelous assets and looked at her face. That was when he saw the three lines of what could only be gills, sitting under her jawline. ""But answer me fleshing of the deathworld, as I can not remain here long, is adventure all you wish for in your life?"" She said, and Allan saw the gills fluttering in sequence.

""I mean, I think, I guess?"" Allan said stuttering as he looked closer at the woman, he stepped up as his brain fought to make sense of what he was seeing, the gills appeared to function, her face had a nose, but there were no nostrils. And with how firmly the woman's mouth seemed to be closed when she was not talking he didn't think there was any way that she was breathing through her mouth. The only conclusion that his partially drunken brain could come to, was that the gills were real. He took a step back. ""What..."" He fumbled for words, ""What are you? Who are you? Why are you here?""

""I suppose that is an appropriate line of questioning."" The woman said, taking a seat cross-legged which only served to increase the strange mix of emotions inside Allan's head, as it put her gloriously on display him after she leaned back to rest her arms on the ground behind her. ""My name is Alyniqual Jushintorg.""

Allan thought for a moment before shaking his head. ""That is a lot, may I call you Aly?"" he asked, trying and failing to stop himself from looking down at the spot where the woman's legs met. He hadn't caught most of her name and judging from how she had pronounced it, he doubted he would ever be able to say it right.

The woman laughed, a sound that if he had heard it anywhere else, he would have assumed that someone was playing around with sound effects. It was beautiful, if anyone had ever wondered what an angle's laugh sounded like, he now knew. ""you may call me Aly, yes. As to what I am, I believe that the word you would use is an alien. I am a member of the Quillinar race. Why am I here? That one is more difficult to answer, especially given the time constraints. But suffice it to say that I came looking for someone, anyone who I might be able to convince to come along with me.""

She seemed saddened. ""To make a very long story short, I am alone and have been for the last 14 of what you call years.  The crew of my ship died, and everyone believes me to be cursed, so no other sentient I asked would fly with me, so I decided to find one who would, I have spent the last fourteen of your years scouring one deathworld after another."" She stopped, and her gills seemed to be working overtime, and her arms had begun to shake. ""The gravity of this world is extreme, even with nanites to facilitate my body's function, I can not remain long. So I ask again, is adventure all that you desire?""

Allan thought for a moment. ""Yes, I mean it's most of what I desire.""

""If that is true, and you have nothing to hold you here, come with me."" She attempted to rise and was pushed to the ground. Allan stepped over and reached down to scoop her up, she was incredibly light and incredibly cold. ""I am sorry, the gravity is far stronger than I anticipated."" She said as Allan placed her on her feet. ""And you are very warm."" She sighed, almost erotically as she stepped up to him pressing her body into his. She seemed to come to her senses after only a moment, "" I am sorry, I got carried away."" She stepped back, and her scales seemed to ruffle along her body. ""Come with me fleshing of the deathworld, and I can promise you adventure.""

Allan looked at the gloriously naked woman standing in front of him, his soul ached for what she was offering. A part of him wanted to stay and look after his mother and father. But this was what he wanted. What he had wanted since the first time he had read the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He took a deep breath. ""A beautiful woman, shows up naked, asking me to go on an adventure with her? How could I say No? I do need to say goodby to my mother though. If that won't be a problem, I will go with you.""

The look in her eyes could have outshone the sun. ""Thank you,"" she said, quietly almost so quietly that he could not hear her as she looked down at her feet, mercurial tears streamed down her face. She wiped them quickly and reach into a pouch that Allan had not noticed hanging on a string from her waist. She handed him a matte black disc. ""Do what you must. I will be waiting. When you are ready, simply speak my name into the comm disk and I will bring you aboard my ship."" She turned, speaking quietly to herself once again. ""Please hurry."" She disappeared a moment later.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Allan walked back to the home he had grown up in, he thought about what had just happened. And every time his mind tried to tell him that he was losing it, he would look into his hand and see the disk, it was clearly not from Earth, he didn't know what it was that made him think that but it just wasn't. Before he got home he made a call to Eddy, without saying much he manged to extract a promise that if Allan's mother called Eddy would do everything he could to help.

""Yo, Allan, you have been talking cryptically this whole time. But whatever it is that is going on you sound excited."" Eddy said towards the end of their conversation.

""I am, more than I ever have been. I don't know if I'm coming back from this one Eddy. Can you please..."" Allan choked up.

""Hey man, we are brothers, your mom is my mom and all that. I know you worry with your dad and all that..."" Eddy faded off, eluding to the fact that Allan's father was a notorious drunk. ""But hey man, just know that if anything ever happens, me and my boys will take care of it."" A chorus of exceptionally motivated marines chimed in then with chants of 'Oorah', and 'kill kill kill.'

""Thanks, man, if I come back I'll tell you all about it."" Allan said smiling at the thought of twenty or so pissed-off Marines showing up only to be coddled by my loving mother.

""Sure thing boss."" Eddy said. ""And hey Allan, whatever it is, give 'em hell.""

""Copy that."" Allan hung up the phone. With that taken care of he walked through the front door of his home. His father was out at the bar, as was his norm. And his mother was home, like always, working on some craft project or another. ""Hey mom, I'm home."" he said.

""Surprise!"" A single voice said, jumping out from behind the curtain to his mothers crafts room. His mother was holding a cake with 27 candles on it. ""Happy Birthday Allen!"" she said, before blowing into one of those party horns.

Allan was truly surprised, he and his mom had gone to lunch for his birthday. He had not expected her to awake let alone planning anything. ""Hey, mom."" Allan said, taking the cake and blowing out the candles, as he set it to the side, and hugged the woman to him tightly.

""Allan, what's wrong?"" She asked when he finally let her go. She could always tell when something was off.

""Mom, sit down."" he said, guiding her to the couch. ""I just got offered an opportunity that I can't say no to."" He looked at her, tears streaming down his face. ""I..."" He could not find the words.

""Allen James Mac'Millen, look at me."" She said, her tone happy and supportive. Allan looked up. ""I know exactly what is going on. I knew this day would come, I have known since you were a little boy."" Allen was stunned by her words. ""I knew that one day someone would off you the adventure that you seemed always to be seeking, and that when it happened, you would leave. Never before, even when you moved to Nepal, have you come to me like this."" She hugged him, again. ""So the only thing that I can say, is go. Have your adventure, live your life.""

""Thanks mom."" Allan said, relief streaming through him. ""I don't know if I'll come back from where I'm going, though.""

""I didn't say you had to come back."" She said playfully. The next hour was a hustle and bustle of activity, as he talked with his mother, and she tried to give him money, and other things, but Allan refused most of it. Allen also made sure that Eddy's number was still in his mothers phone. ""Allan, take this,"" she handed the large green ammo canister that dad kept his old glock 17 in. ""I don't care if you throw it in the river, if your not going to be around, I don't want to worry about you.""

Allan relented and packed his backpack with the gun, and all 1500 rounds that his father kept in the house, as well as food, water, and survival tools, and a hammock. ""Well I guess this is it."" Allan said, hugging his mother at the front door. ""Love you mom, and seriously, don't hesitate to call Eddy, if needs be, I'm sure he'll show up with a full squad of marines to deal with anything that happens.""

""I won't."" She said tears, streaming down her face. ""Stay safe, wherever it is that you are going."" Allen nodded and picked up his pack, walking out the door. After he had left his neighborhood he took the black disk from his pocket, ""Aly, I'm ready."" a moment later, a faint humming filled his ears.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next thing that Allan knew he was *somewhere.* The room was small, and dimly lit, when he walked out the door, almost bowled over Aly, who looked as if she had been sprinting. She seemed far more at ease here than she had on the hill. Allan guessed that it had something to with the Florida like humidity and the fact that he felt incredibly light, despite the 70 pounds of equipment and goods in his pack.

""You came,"" Aly said, sounding genuinely surprised. ""You actually came.""

""I said I would."" Allan said, and a thought hit him. ""By the way, my name is Allan.""

""Allan,"" she looked up at his face. ""Allan, very well, let me show you to the sleeping quarter. And then we will get underway to a Jumpgate."" She turned and lead him to a single large room, in it was a bowl-shaped depression, filled with what he thought was sand. she walked in and told him to leave his things. He stepped into the sand, and sunk almost six inches.

""Woah,"" he said, reaching down to the sand, and realizing that it had to be some kind of synthetic material. It was soft, and somewhat warm. ""Ohhh, this is the bed isn't it.""

""Yes."" Aly said, with hesitation. ""Do you not have propper sleeping pits for your clans?""

""Nope, we use beds, I guess a better description would be an elevated sleeping platform, but no."" Allan said as he set his things to the side of the pit. He followed Aly to the bridge of the ship, he guessed this is where she had run from, as it seemed to be the farthest from the room he had arrived in. ""COOL!"" He shouted, running past Aly to look out the window, far below him, Earth, his homeworld, spun in the inky black of space like a top.

""Allan, before we get underway we need to ensure that you are properly inoculated against things you may encounter. Please come through here."" She gestured at a door that had a strange curving symbol on it. Inside the room Allan could *feel* the sterility of every surface.

""Medical bay?"" he asked, as Aly began tapping buttons.

""Yes, please, stand still."" She said, and Allan did as requested. A moment later a beam of light that seemed to oscillate from yellow to purple appeared at his feet, and slowly moved up his body. Once it had reached the top of his head it vanished, and Aly began to read something intently. ""Amazing, apparently your species immune system is far more advanced than anything the computer can find in the database. As far as it knows any disease that you encounter will effect you only minimally, with fluid excretions from your mucus membranes. And..."" She trailed off, her scales ruffling, and a bright pink flush crossing her cheeks.

""And what?"" Allan asked looking Aly up and down, marveling once again at her beauty, and how cute it was when her scales got ruffled.

Her blushing intensified, ""And apparently, your genetics are some of the most compatible the computer has ever encountered. Should you choose a life-mate, you should quite easily be able to procreate and have offspring. ""

""Wait you mean I can fuck?"" He asked playfully. She looked up at him, not understanding his tone.

""I believe so?"" She said, looking at him with a strange mix of fear and something else in her face. ""Should you require it, as is stated in the Quillinar charter of directives, my body is available to you for use should your race have only specific time constraints on when you can reproduce."" She bowed what Allan judged to be a very practiced bow.

""Wait what?"" the shock and surprise in his voice threw Aly off. ""What the hell does that mean?"" Allan was genuinely shocked. ""Don't get me wrong, I love sex, and given the appropriate opportunity, I'm fairly sure that I'll fuck my way out of a situation. But you don't have to make yourself available to me.""

""But I do."" Aly said, confusion running through her voice. ""The Quillinar are a race of beings that prioritize the reproductive rights of all races. If we are capable, and a crewmate has no other option, we are bound by our lows to make best efforts at ensuring that reproduction limited races have every opportunity to plant their seed, and bring more life to the galaxy.""

""Okay,"" Allan's mind was spinning from that one, ""well first of all, I'm not reproduction limited, and secondly, that's just not how I do things. So that will not be required. However, if you desire it, or even if you need to blow off some steam, and just want a quick dick in the woods. I would be more than happy to accommodate you. Deal?""

His tone made it clear that this was a hill he would die on. ""Yes Allan, I understand. Since you do not need any medical treatment, let us get underway, and then we can sleep, as I am sure this has been a taxing day for you.""

Allan nodded. She quickly explained that this portion of the galaxy was under a no warp restriction so it would take several days to reach a Jumpgate. She set the autopilot and then walked with him back to the room where his things were. ""Welp, nighty night then,"" Allan said, as he walked in, expecting her to continue to her own room. She instead followed him in. She lay on the sand, and looked up at him, as if waiting. ""I'm sorry did I miss something?"" Allan asked, once again very confused.

""No, it is time to sleep, this is the clan sleeping pit, so let us sleep."" Aly said, her own confusion flashing across her face. Then an understanding look. ""Your people do not sleep together to conserve body heat.""

""Nnnooo."" Allan said, slowly, then he looked in her eyes, and saw the loneliness of years in her eyes, and the crushed hopes of having what she called a clan again. Allan sighed, taking his shirt off, ""But you know what they say, when in Rome."" This got more confusion from Aly, as he took off his boots, socks pants and hesitated with his underwear.

""Full nudity guarantees the best exchange of heat."" Aly said, not picking up on the embarrassment that Allan was try ing throttle down. Her tone of voice was amusing to Allan though, it was not a trick, she was simply following what she knew.

""When in rome."" he said again to himself and then dropped his underwear to the pile of clothes. stepping into the sandpit, he lay down, trying to give them a little space but the sand seemed to push them together. His breath came in sharply as Aly lay, facing him, and snuggled up close. Her breasts pressing into his chest, and the top of her head nestled under his chin, she intertwined her legs with his, and he thought that there would be no way he would get to sleep. He was wrong, moments later they were both asleep, entangled in each other.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next day Allan awoke to a pleasant sensation. It looked as if in the night, Aly had wrapped her arms and legs around him and pulled him close, the result being that his face was pressed in between her breasts, and his morning wood was pressed under her exquisite ass, the base of his cock against the lower folds of her sex, and the head resting against the curve of her ass. He was fairly certain she was asleep still, and he was too embraced to move, so for the moment, he simply enjoyed his luck. A moment later, she moaned a little, the moan of someone who was having a great dream.

Her hips bucked back a little, rubbing herself onto his manhood even more. Her grip with her arms and legs tightened further. Allen had never been one to cockblock anyone, especially a woman who was using him as her very own hump pillow, so he closed his eyes and fell back asleep, listening to her sweet little moans, and enjoying the feeling of her breasts on his face.

When Allan awoke again, Aly was sitting up next to him. ""Allan, I'm...I'm so sorry... I..."" She could hardly get the words out, and the embased pink flush from yesterday was back as an agry red color that went all the way from her sex, to her face. When Allan looked down, and saw that he had most certainly been used as a pillow, he laughed. ""I will take you back... you did not... I just..."" Aly burst into tears.

""What? Why? I don't want to go back."" Allan said, running a finger through the juices she had left behind to coat his cock, and then placing it in his mouth and moaning, ""and holy shit do you taste amazing."" She turned and even more violent shade of red at this.

""I sexually assaulted you."" She said, quivering as she clearly was still orgasming. ""I am a terrible person.""

""What?"" Allan said, surprised by what she said. ""Aly I woke up when you started your little dream, I could have easily just left you to have that dream on your own, you did not assault me.""

""Yes I did."" She started crying, ignoring what he had said. ""I didn't want to. I was asleep, my body just *did that.* It's been so long that..."" what she was saying was cut off, as she stared in shock at Allan. ""Wait, you said that you woke when it started, you knew this was happening.""

""Yes Ma'am."" Allan said, smiling mischievously. ""You know if it's been that long, and you're that hard up, I would be happy to, shall we say pop that quark. As I said yesterday.""

""You mean..."" She didn't finish what she was saying as a wave of excitement washed ever her at Allan's nod. She looked at Allan's rock-hard manhood standing at attention, and a moan escaped her lips. She crawled as if she made to take him inter mouth, and while he was not opposed to the idea of watching her ass wiggle as she sucked him, the thing that intrigued him most in that moment was the sight of her still dripping pussy as she moved to grab him. Without warning, he leaned up and grabbed her legs, and in the low gravity, easily lifted her above him as he lay back down. ""Allan what....eep!"" she started to ask something but it was cut off as he set her down right on his face and his tongue went to work learning every delicious fold of her sex.

""Ohh, Allan."" She moaned, that angelic voice of her making him even harder than he thought possible. ""Don't stop, please, for the love of Elunitra please don't stop."" she moaned as she involuntarily moved her hips, grinding her throbbing pussy into his tongue. ""Ohh, goddess."" was all she said, before a torrent of liquid streamed down Allan's face. He felt her thighs squeeze his head which only made him more excited. She collapsed next to him a literal quivering mess.

""Ready for more?"" Allan asked, watching her carefully touching her engorged nipples and clit. She looked at him, and unable to speak simply nodded. Allan smiled and picked her up again, laying her on her back. He leaned forward his face still dripping from her previous orgasm, and kissed her, not a gentle lover's kiss, this kiss informed Aly that she was about to be ravished. And she eagerly awaited every second of it. As their tongues worked in each other's mouths, Allan reached down and gently guided the tip of his cock inside her. He slid forward only about two inches. The whole time he felt the walls and lips of her pussy squeeze. ""Holy fuck you are tight.""

""My race,"" She was panting this out in between kisses. ""Regrows...its hymen... if ... there is... no penetration... for a time.""

""Really?"" Allan said, stopping and looking down at her. ""That's cool, so you could say that at this moment, I'm going to be your first."" He teased her slightly by pushing ever so slightly deeper into her.

""Mmmm, yes."" She said with a moan that told him she was angry he wasn't moving inside her already. Claws slid out of the ends of her fingernails, and she dug them into his back, causing him to moan. ""Yes,"" she panted, ""Right now I am about to let myself be fucked senseless by a deathworlder, as tight as the day I left my spawn-father's home. Now shut up and fuck me."" she demanded and in a surprise motion, thrust her hips up until Allan felt his their pelvises touch.

Allan didn't respond, only placed a hand on her throat, and began thrusting into every glorious inch of the tight wonderland that was Aly's sex. No words were spoken, as she threw her arms and legs around him, which only seemed to make her grow tighter. Her claws raked down his back making him arch into her even deeper. A moment later Aly pulled him down on top of her locking her legs so that he could not move, and her arms around his back held him still. The throbbing and pulsating around his cock told him that had reached climax. ""Please, hold still for one second."" She begged.

Allan held still for a moment. ""You okay?"" Allan asked in a whisper, nibbling on the slightly pointed lobes of her ears.

""Yes."" She gasped out, a quiver from her sex, and a sudden rush of liquid around Allan's cock telling him that she had come once again. ""More?"" she asked in a voice that said she wanted it but was unsure if she could take it.

""If you want. I am fine stopping here."" Allan said, internally he was a little upset he hadn't finished yet, but this was for her.

""What about you?"" She asked moving her hips in such a way that she could still feel every inch of him filling her. She moaned, ""You have not achieved orgasm yet, and I don't want you to feel used.""

""I think that if I fuck you anymore it will either drive you insane, or make it so you can't walk, so how about you do what you wanted earlier."" Allan said, and she smiled, her eyes lighting up. Allan pulled out from her, as she undid her death grip around him.

He stood up and made as if to flop lay back down, and she shook her head. ""You may not know, but I should not be able to speak your language, the only reason that I can,"" she moved to kneel in front of him, ""is that your people had a rudimentary data net established, with a shocking amount of porn, I think its called, in learning your language I watched a little of it, and I can assure you one thing."" as she knelt in front of him she reached up in an incredibly sexy manor, and brushed away her hair, gesturing to the gills. ""I don't need to 'come up for air' as I heard it put."" She smiled at him in an evil manner, ""My race also has no gag-reflex. So think of my throat as if it were your, what's the term,"" she arched her back, sticking out her magnificent breasts, and placed her finger on her chin in a position that Allan could have sworn she took from a sexy librarian video. ""Ah, yes, think of my throat as your own personal fuck hole.""

She leaned forward and kissed the tip of his cock, and then ran her tongue from the base all the way to the tip. Allan moaned, and then Aly opened her mouth, and forced his whole cock down her throat. Allan was shocked, he was not the largest in the dick department, but no woman he had been with ever tried to deepthroat him. He waited for the inevitable moment that she would pull off, and then what she had said sunk in. ""You're sure?"" Allan said placing a hand on her head, and without pulling off she looked up at him with the greatest 'fuck me' eyes he had ever seen, and nodded slightly, all while sliding her incredibly long tongue out to tickle his balls. ""Fuck, okay, if you need to stop tap my leg."" she rolled her eyes and surprised him once more by reaching behind him, and grabbing his has with both her hands and pulling him even deeper down her throat.

""Game on."" Allan moaned, and tangled both his hands in her hair, thrusting into Aly's wet mouth, over and over, even though he hadn't finished earlier, he had been close. ""Fuck, baby, I'm close, where do you want it."" Allan asked, looking down without stopping his relentless assault on her throat. She looked at him with a look that said ""*where do you think?""*  ""Yes, Ma'am,"" Allan grunted out thrusting harder and deeper, Aly's hands helping pull his deeper as they clasped his ass. ""Ohh, baby."" He groaned and she pulled him deep and held him there, surprising him again as her tongue swirled out, revealing that it was longer than he had imagined, opening her jaw wider than he had imagined possible, and using only her tongue, swept his balls into her mouth as well.

The torrent of cum that spilled down her throat as she hummed in pleasure force him to buck his hips trying to get deeper. when he finally finished, his orgasm was extended by Aly using her tongue to stroke him inside her mouth. he pulled out. Allan then collapsed next to Aly, who snuggled up to him.

""Day one of my adventure and I have already done more than could have imagined,"" Allan said stoking the scales on Aly's back. ""I wonder what will happen next.""

Aly looked up at him from where her head lay on his chest. ""I can assure you that there will be more of this,"" Aly said, kissing his chest, and then sliding up to snuggle so that they could be face to face. ""If you want it that is.""

""Of course."" He said as she kissed him. ""You said we have three days before we get to warp-permissible space and then to a jump gate, this is day one of three right.""

""Yes,"" Aly said, wondering where he was going with this.

""Then I guess that means I have three days to make up for the years you went without a clan or a lover."" He said. Internally Allan was unsure of where this would end or if it ever would, but he knew one thing. The adventure that he'd always wanted was here, and if it included some hot alien ass, well that was a bonus. The two of them snuggled up and fell into a deep sleep of exhaustion.

You deserve everything you want in life. You're perfect the way you are. Things may be rough now but everything will be okay and if you need someone I'm here! We're all going through a hard time in the current circumstances. So everybody needs a hug! Also hope everyone's loved ones are safe and sound :) 

**Also obligatory alternative (Audio! Since everyone is doing a PowerPoint) for those who don’t wanna read since this is a huge wall of text but if you have earphones on** https://soundcloud.com/user-602845023/track-5 ( Brownie points for effort ? There's some Easter eggs in the post which aren't in the Audio clip though :P ) and of course there's a tl;dr (too long, didn't read?) 

So here we are at the 1.5-year mark of being stuck with WFH. Growing up, I failed to make friends until I was 12. Those friends were not good for me at all, and they only cared about themselves in the end. The few friends I have, live too far away from or are too busy to talk and hang out. My life got to me so much, with all my negative history being reminded to me by old friends, family, people I didn't know, and even areas where I had been stupid. So I moved away, got more work, and tried to make new friends. But, alas, the friend-making has been painfully slow and COVID isn't helping me socialize either. I don't know about you but staying at home is driving me craaaaazy. Luckily I have work to keep me busy all the time. I usually end up sleeping at 4 AM due to supporting clients from the other end of the globe, so basically a night owl! But dang, don't I miss going out. I miss the planning of where to go out the most more than going out and I miss going to work and having the freedom to move around! And with regard to this post, I gotta say I've done this before, a couple of times actually but I guess things didn't work out or people lost interest or might have been my fault as well. And I can understand why that happens and that a friendship can't be forced so I won't hold it against anyone. Making friends is hard! That's why we're here, aren't we? My whole life I've longed for a best friend. Someone that wants to travel the world with me. Someone that feels so comfortable with me could tell me anything and I'd take it to my grave. Someone I could care deeply for. Not a huge group of friends, but just a couple of people, heck even 1 person, that I could share my life with, fun times, and have a special bond that I see with so many other people's friendships. I've tried everything and I'm not gonna give up on trying. So here we go. Here is a little about me:

I'll start with the fact that I have and pretty much am still suffering from depression and anxiety. The depression is not as severe as it was quite some time back but it's a Sine curve so some days are good but boy, the rest are outright horrible. But I still deal with anxiety and I am planning to get back on meds again. I had stopped taking them a while back after deciding that I am not gonna let 3 pills decide my individuality and that I don't want to be a zombie but I've learnt that it was a stupid move and I should've checked with my doctor first. So fair warning, I might disappear at times when I just need some time away from reality and I'm really sorry for that. I am not gonna ghost you though and am just a hi! away. I'd like to say I've got a pretty decent memory so we can pick u right where we left. And I wouldn't forget you as well, I just sort of dig myself into my hole deeper and deeper and it'll take me a while to come out of it. I've also spent quite a bit of my life with my head in the clouds or in a good book. Right now and for quite a while, my life is kind of not where I really want it to be, both personally and professionally. I'm currently trying to figure out how to get my career goals sorted out. I enjoy going out and having a good time, whether it's hiking, just driving around, or spending nights at home. I also write. You can stalk my Reddit profile for some things I've written :) Music is also something I find lacking in my life, but I love most genres except punk metal. If you're like me and worship the ground that Bowie walked on, I will love you forever. I'm mostly into the indie music scene in India, and a big fan of Prateek Kuhad, Ritviz, Aditi Ramesh (a good friend of mine actually ), and a couple of others in the Indian Indie scene and Bon Iver, Arctic Monkeys, Tame Impala, The Smiths, The Killers (Are we human, or are we dancer?), Tom Rosenthal, Lumineers, Hollow Coves, Ben Howard, Of Monsters and Men, The National, Frightened Rabbit, alt-j and a lot of others too :) and I can assure you I have a playlist for every type of day and mood that I'll be more than happy to share :D I really love classical music and jazz as well. Jazz is a recent development so still exploring the genre!  I'm not an audiophile but to those out there, I use a Sony WH 1000XM3 for travel and a Jabra elite 85t for my daily commutes and both do a great job for their price. Oh, and I have a dog and a cat as well! They definitely help with the loneliness when you're staying alone. I also like writing and I've written some things on Reddit primarily on the /r/unsentletters subreddit(Links if you're not gonna stalk my profile - [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hkc1ee/the_vows_to_the_wife_i_never_had_we_were_supposed/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hjsx95/to_the_one_who_gets_to_love_her_next_long/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/fxo0xh/to_the_girl_that_needs_to_let_go/), [Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/kiannb/to_the_best_friend_who_died_before_we_got_to_go/), I think there are a few more but these are the ones that I really hold close to my heart) But other than that I have a collection of love letters that I had written a while back along with other letters mostly addressed to myself for different days when I could use some uplifting or have some sense knocked into me. I currently obsessed with Final Space. I don't know if many have seen that show but it's hilarious and has the right amount of sci-fi. Recently saw Only Murders in the Building S1 as well and it was hilarious! (To all the true crime fans out there! Give this one a watch) Can't wait to see what they got planned for S3. Oh yeah and I do enjoy podcasts! I love to go on suuuuuuper long drives and these True Crime podcasts are mostly my companion on these journeys along with a couple of finance and general talk shows about money, books, movies and music. 

I love fishing (not a fan of eating them though, so it's mostly catch and throw) and had gone to catch a few yesterday! (It rained where I am here! So yay!) but it's pretty boring in the cities as all you can catch are the small ones, None of those awesome battles between fishing rods and the fishes as shown on Nat Geo. And finally Hiking, I just love to go for long hikes and camping, although I never had the chance to go for a really long one and am tempted to go for the IndiaHikes Bali Pass trek in June 22'. ( It's the next thing to do on my bucket list ) And well, coming to books, I am currently reading The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah, and the book I read last was Of Women and Salt by my favorite Author - Gabriel Garcia, and boy it's a great book, and next on my list is Fake Accounts by Lauren Oyler. In search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust is one of my all-time classical favorites and I've got a shit ton of books this year ( Trying to finish that 52 Books challenge - At 33 now. I wanted to be at 40 at least but a heavy workload and well my side hustles aren't helping ), crosswords are awesome too, but I usually end up getting frustrated and leaving it out. I love watching TV Shows and is also a tech enthusiast. I'm trying to study and learn some stuff, so we can be study buddies as well. I used to have a friend who I used to step into a call and study although we're both doing different things it helps knowing there is someone with you. A work buddy would be awesome as well! We can both do our own work but I can holla to you and you can holla back! I happen to have a stamp collection and a boarding pass collection too if it interests you! I recently got into Digital Art(using Procreate!) and is working on sketching some really cool people from my life. A slow progress but I will get there I hope! I am more of a traditional artist though and have been sketching and painting for as long as I can remember but digital is completely new to me and I'm trying to learn the mechanics of it including layers and everything :) I do game a bit as well but on a console! Have a couple of games - RDD 2, GTA V, Apex, COD WZ, RSS and a ton of other single player/adventure games and also whatever else the kids are playing these days. If you game as well and might be looking for someone to play with on co-op missions or anything, do let me know as well! and we can play! (Hopefully your game supports multi platform)

That's enough about me I hope and now here's what you can expect:

THE 13 REASONS WHY(Pun? Sorta Shitty show though) WHY WE SHOULD HANG OUT:

1. A great friend to talk to throughout the day and night wherever you are
2. A support system. Feel free to vent and I will listen and talk. 
3. Someone to hang out with if we happen to be in the same city/country - I travel a lot for work so chances are we might actually have common boundaries.
4. I know how hard it is to struggle through those shitty times and I want to make someone feel a little less alone and desperate.
5. Loooots of stories to discuss and personal life experiences to share. Although I'm relatively young, I've gone through a lot of things and if it'll help someone, I'll be glad to share.
6. Career advice maybe? Depends on what you do or want to do.
7. I promise not to ghost you
8. Unlimited supply of humor, memes, kitten/puppy pictures to lighten your day
9. I can cook pretty well or so I like to hope. Mostly desserts so if we happen to be in the same city, expect a lot of amazing food! And if you need help with cooking or don't know what to cook, ask me!
10. Trying to reach your fitness goals or study more or need motivation for anything? You got me to do that for you. I've been trying to get back in shape to shed the quarantine weight. Even better if you use cure.fit since we can set up a team for the live classes to motivate each other :)
11. Will take your side in an argument and will literally fight for you if it comes to that always. Pinky promise too :P
12. This is for all the night owls out there and to anyone actually. You can call me at 4 AM with a mid-life crisis and I'll be right there for you
13. Unlimited Spotify Playlists for every occasion, Netflix/Hotstar/Prime and what else is there recommendations and if I really think you're a great person heck, I'd share my accounts and we can even sit and watch something together over zoom!  

Anyhow now you know quite a bit about me and also where to find me :P

Hope to hear back from you!

PS - I’m hoping to find something long term here. we can talk every day, share memes, secrets, or whatever you'd like. Also, I'd hope for this to be a regular thing where we can just talk throughout the day and kind of share dumb videos and maybe just watch dumb videos or movies together and have some really deep and intriguing conversations. I just want to find someone to genuinely have fun and get to know, but I know it does take some time to get there and I don't want to force it. Most of the time, I notice I gravitate toward people who overshare a lot and are slightly extroverted, so I really hope you like talking about yourself! I'm kind of shy at first and honestly consistently awkward, but I open up quickly. I like people who are kind and affectionate, too. I'm not going to be at my computer all the time nor do I expect you to be, but I would like for this to be a daily thing where we talk or hang out with some frequency. We can talk about whatever’s bothering you or if your boss was being a bitch today, we can gossip about celebs or friends. We can offer support and motivation to each other and be best buds! And if things work out for the best and we do end up talking for a while, we could be life-long friends and meet each other and keep in contact forever(or what is forever in reality) which would be absolutely amazing. it doesn’t matter to me what your gender/sexuality/race is or what country or timezone you’re from, all that matters is that you be yourself and want to get to know me.

Also just a general disclaimer - Please don't ghost? And I wouldn't want to either. I'll try my best and will do all I can to keep the words flowing! But no matter how good a conversation is going, if you reply with a single word or a smiley of any kind you kill a conversation. There is no good way to respond to ""cool"", ""awesome"" or "":)"" that doesn't force the other person to reestablish the entire conversation. It doesn't matter how cute you think that emoji is, if that's all you're sending someone they have no way to respond to it.

If you want a conversation to continue then you have to keep it on the tracks. Every time you respond to someone you have to keep it moving forward or choose the other track which drives it directly into a brick wall and forces the other person to reverse it and start over again.

If you have nothing to say on a topic or nothing interesting to respond to something with then move it to a new subject. That way they have something to rebound back to you, if you just respond with a single word it signals a lack of interest in talking to them at all. You're asking them to invest their time in you and not one of the thousands of other things they could be doing, if you don't put in the minimal conversation effort they're simply going to go do something more engaging. It doesn't matter how smart you think you are or how amazing you think your rack is, if you're not putting in the effort you're getting ghosted. There are a million other ways someone could be spending their time instead of you, if you can't do the bare minimum to keep a conversation alive then why shouldn't I just go watch a video about my hobby or see what new games were just released I could be playing instead? Also, If you see a post that's well-written and you want to talk to that person, give them some information! ASL should just be the basics. This person has already made a post talking about themselves. They've put that effort in; you should give them more than one or two sentences when you message them! (On the flip side don't go way overboard and write an essay, just in general -- some people love essays - I'm one of them!)

Aaaaand Reddit chat is kinda buggy at times so expect a delay or can talk on any platform you’d like if we hit it off so feel free to let me know as I'm pretty much open to anything :)

So if you’ve made it so far, you’re either interested in talking to me or you’re just I don't know what you’re doing. anyways, sorry for the super boring and long essay but if you’d like to be best buds, send me a dm! I am super excited to meet you and get to know you!

Have a great day Redditors! And Stay home, Stay safe, and most importantly Stay Healthy!

tl;dr: I know it's a little long but, Looking for a new best friend(s) so hit me up :P"

$ESPR - here is why this will be on the rise for days to come - DD,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pt4vjg/espr_here_is_why_this_will_be_on_the_rise_for/,bitternessoflife,1,2021-09-22 18:46:11,9,/r/smallstreetbets/comments/pt4vjg/espr_here_is_why_this_will_be_on_the_rise_for/,Epic DD Analysis,"A brief analysis of why Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR:NASDAQ) will move higher.

First of all, I must admit that that the earnings, EPS are not great at all but I would not be posting this here if it was about ESPR being a value stock - because it probably is not.

According to various sources (Yahoo Finance, Fintel) ESPR is belived to be held mostly by institutions - which is, according to Yahoo, 104.66%. How the hell over 100% of shares can be held by institutions?! According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp) there are two scenarios where this is possible: slow updates when it comes to data or short selling. Obviously I do not have enough proof to deny that data is f up so let me for now just assume that short selling has been taking place for quite some time now to much extent.

First of all, the chart. It tells quite a story about low earnings, bad EPS (down from over +4$ to negative numbers) and oh well... heavy short selling? As I have stated before, 104.66% of shares are being held by institutions and 1.58% are held by insiders (data provided by Refinitiv according to Yahoo Finance).

https://preview.redd.it/6fuvebjd91p71.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87986825a6bb3c9af30881371bd3e84fd842a6a1

Awful MACD for many many months, RSI literally on the floor for now and OBV indicating that there are many sales ongoing (short selling?).

[Yahoo, 21\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/o9v3vvte91p71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6478aa7f946f064e21f501fd7a9c2c12b014257d)

WeBull is reporting even higher numbers.

[WeBull, 21\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/ivsmbj3g91p71.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a9f9da578fb62412a38210ba84b89ee789f1b13)

And oh well, institutions have been buying in the previous month even more of ESPR? That is at least what WeBull is trying to say.

That all cought my attention and decided to go down that rabbit hole and oh boy it is good.

Here are some facts about ESPR:

* insiders has been buying the stock in 2021, [that is what at least Nasdaq is saying](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/espr/insider-activity) and Ortex seem to agree on this one too

[Ortex, 22\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/2kar4cjh91p71.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23944c80732f6b3d8235e8b44b5e45af14b602dd)

* the [price target](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ESPR/price-target/), lowered recently, is still very high relative to the current price. The average is over 40$, with return potential of roughly 250%
* many sources are saying that institutions are expanding their positions on ESPR (WeBull, Fintel, Ortex)
* [last offering by ESPR has been done in 2020](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/11/12/2125368/0/en/Esperion-Announces-Pricing-of-Offering-of-250-0-Million-of-Convertible-Senior-Subordinated-Notes.html) so yeah there is that
* ESPR when it comes to technical has reached in my opinion its bottom; I am not an expert in TA so comments on this one are much welcome
* bullish MACD on 1D chart
* according to [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ESPR/analysis?p=ESPR) and Ortex, EPS and its momentum seem to be rising (monthly, quarterly) which is obviously great news for the stock

[Ortex, EPS, 22\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/7fb0xyxk91p71.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd52a07c73edab3269277ce84a732c1d7394de6)

* according to [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ESPR/financials?p=ESPR) there has been a revenue growth of over 50%
* according to [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/espr/financials/) shares change has been low for some time and linking this fact to the lack of selling by insider I am willing to belive that might also be true (decrease implies stock buybacks)

And for the dessert, some data that might imply of incoming short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ortex SI, 21\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/bk57t9ju91p71.png?width=2365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08303e2b1c0477d2651caa2d896e9d3d4c5d9e0e)

[Ortex SI, 22\/09\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/s1ee6lm0a1p71.png?width=2373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=137ce121793a9025b28c8ca81ec2d8693d09c1fb)

Just to sum up what is shown on the picture:

* price - growing
* utilization - growing
* CTB - growing
* shares on loan - growing
* volume - growing
* short interest - growing
* free float on loan - growing
* estimated short interest - growing
* days to cover - decreasing

Basically, every indicator which might lead to short squeeze is just on the right track.

So yeah, there is that. As for me, I belive that someone, somewhere has shorted the stock to the extend where institutions were buying their shorted shares and thus resulted in 'over 100% of the shares possible to have' scenario. If current SI of 9.23m (which is over 35%) is true then I can only assume that there is a shitstorm to come on ESPR.

My positions so far:

COIN REVIEW - Mercurial Finance (MER),https://www.reddit.com/r/mrc/comments/pt804s/coin_review_mercurial_finance_mer/,beareatsman,1,2021-09-22 21:53:04,2,/r/mrc/comments/pt804s/coin_review_mercurial_finance_mer/,Coin Review,"**TỔNG QUAN VỀ DỰ ÁN MERCURIAL FINANCE VÀ ĐỒNG COIN MER**

**I/ Mercurial Finance là gì?**

* Mercurial là một sàn giao dịch phi tập trung (DEX) kết hợp với quỹ đầu tư tự động phi tập trung (Vault) được xây dựng trên hệ sinh thái Solana.

&amp;#x200B;

**II/ Sự khác biệt của Mercurial Finance so với các nền tảng DEX khác (như Uniswap,...) là gì?**

* ***Giảm thiểu trượt giá khi swap tokens, đặc biệt là các stable tokens:***
   * Nguyên lý:
      * Thay đổi công thức bonding curve: thêm hệ số khuếch đại a nhằm giảm trượt giá (slippage) nhưng đổi lại thì mức giá cho phép sẽ bị giới hạn
      * Cân chỉnh a cho các thể loại cặp token khác nhau: (1) Cặp tokens được neo giá theo tỷ lệ 1:1 (ví dụ: USDT/USDC, hoặc wBTC/renBTC,...); (2) Cặp tokens giao động trong khoảng hẹp (ví dụ: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY,...); (3) Cặp tokens giao động tự do (ví dụ: ETH/USDT, SOL/ETH,...)
   * Điều này khác biệt so với bonding curve truyền thống của Uniswap x\*y = k:
      * Cho phép khoảng giá không giới hạn (nếu token X bị mua quá nhiều thì giá của X niêm yết bởi Y sẽ tiệm cận dương vô cực)
      * Tuy nhiên, bonding curve đơn giản này gặp phải một vấn đề đó là trượt giá mạnh và không tối ưu cho từng thể loại cặp token khác nhau như trên

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Phí giao dịch linh hoạt theo điều kiện thị trường để gia tăng lợi nhuận cho các nhà cung cấp thanh khoản (LP):***
   * Khi thị trường ổn đinh: phí giao dịch thấp để thu hút nhiều khối lượng: lợi nhuận của LP đến chủ yếu từ khối lượng giao dịch
   * Khi thị trường biến động mạnh: phí giao dịch cao để tối ưu lợi nhuận (vì lúc đó nhu cầu giao dịch tăng) - giống như hiện tượng spread gia tăng khi thị trường biến động mạnh trên các sàn giao dịch tập trung
   * Việc đo lường mức độ biến động của thị trường được thực hiện bằng việc theo dõi tỷ lệ giữa trung bình động của khối lượng giao dịch trong ngắn hạn và dài hạn --&gt; không nhất thiết phải sử dụng Oracle mà có thể hoàn toàn dùng dữ liệu on-chain
   * Đây là điểm ưu việt hơn so với cơ chế phí cố định của Uniswap và nhiều sàn AMM hiện tại

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Sử dụng nguồn vốn trong quỹ thanh khoản để đầu tư nhằm tối ưu hoá lợi nhuận và giảm thiểu tác động của Impermanent Loss đối với các nhà cung cấp thanh khoản (LP):***
   * Việc phân bổ vốn vào nền tảng nào để thu lợi nhuận (yield) sẽ được DAO quyết định
   * Một số ý tưởng: flash loans, gửi vào các nền tảng lending, các vaults (quỹ đầu tư) khác,...

&amp;#x200B;

Money makes the world go round. It always has. The term is called the **velocity of money**.   


&gt;The velocity of money (or the velocity of circulation of money) is a measure of the number of times that the average unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. The concept relates the size of economic activity to a given money supply, and the speed of money exchange is one of the variables that determine inflation. The measure of the velocity of money is usually the ratio of the gross national product (GNP) to a country's money supply.    


I'm not going to deep dive into a complicated subject. There's neither need nor time for it. The velocity of money is a generally accepted metric used to comprehend how an economy is performing. The greater the velocity, the more money is changing hands in transactions. The more transactions there are, the healthier the economy. There's a reason they call it a currency. The system is much like the human body's circulatory system, when it flows to all parts, everything's healthy. When it doesn't, parts start to die. This process starts in the extremities and works it's way towards parts vital for keeping the system operating. Like the heart. And when the heart stops it's game over.   

And they know this. They also know we cling to our illusions because they're the magicians who fooled us with their tricks, such as work hard and you can be rich just like us.    

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.   

And now the system is changing rapidly. We have automation rapidly expanding outwards. Jobs which required humans to converse are now going to vanish. Jobs which required drivers are projected to disappear in the near future. And not only cars, but ships and planes as well. **They had a drone which could fly itself without any human intervention back in 1999** (think about this, automated drones don't need passports, do they?), don't you think airline pilots are more show than go now? Of course they are. Which is why this started being a major topic for the last decade or so. The velocity of money is slowing down. And when that slows down enough, the market corrects. And when the market corrects, the economy crashes. This will inevitably happen on our march to the **FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION**. It has to happen. They can't take jobs away and expect the velocity of money to continue flowing. So they made a plan. Or more than likely, an algorithm made a plan.

They know. And they have known. It's why Trudeau went to the WEF and sang the praises of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It's why they keep talking about the **GREAT RESET AND BUILD BACK BETTER**. And wasn't 2020 just such fortuitous timing, because now we have started putting mechanisms into place that look very suspiciously like UBI, as the conversation about UBI rages on, like it wasn't already a forgone conclusion.

Yes siree Bob ladies and gentlemen. We need UBI. When do we need it? **YESTERDAY**. And we do need it. We absolutely do. Nobody should be homeless or starving. Period. But nobody should also earn enough to own so much farmland that they're starting to look a lot like a James Bond villan either, right Grandpa Gates? And they also shouldn't be hanging out with real life James Bond villans like Jeffrey Epstein either, but I guess the **Club of Rome** wasn't built in day, was it?    

How can I seem to be against UBI and advocating for UBI at the same time? Simple, I'm not against UBI, I'm against those who are manipulating us into the position of manufacturing consent for UBI.   

They have a plan. And the plan is written out in all the headlines, we just have to connect the dots. 


#3 reasons U.S. tech firms are hoarding unprecedented piles of cash

#A third of cash is held by 5 U.S. companies
[Source Here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/05/20/third-cash-owned-5-us-companies/84640704/)

&gt;The rising cash holdings of U.S. corporations are increasingly in the hands of a few U.S. companies, with just five tech firms having grabbed a third of it. And nearly three-quarters of cash held by non-financial U.S. companies is stashed overseas, outside the long arm of Uncle Sam.       

&gt;Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are sitting on $504 billion, or 30%, of the $1.7 trillion in cash and cash equivalents held by U.S. non-financial companies in 2015, according to an analysis released Friday by ratings agency Moody's Investors Service.  That's even more cash concentration than in previous years, as these five companies held 27% of cash in 2014 and 25% in 2013. Apple alone is holding more cash and investments than eight of the 10 entire industry sectors.     


Now think. Investors don't like it when corporations sit on cash. Not at all. Investors want their cash reinvested so that it can generate better returns so they can buy a tenth mansion. Or a twelfth. It's hard to keep count.    

Why then are they just sitting on all this cash? 

Because they're still sitting on the cash and not investing it. Almost like they knew something was coming. 

#Companies are hoarding cash as the Delta variant takes over the globe

&gt;Apple, Google and other big companies around the world are continuing to add to their massive piles of cash, a sign that corporations are increasingly nervous about how the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 could damage the global economy.     

&gt;The world's largest nonfinancial companies had a record $6.85 trillion in cash on their balance sheets as of the end of the second quarter, according to data from S&amp;P Global Ratings. (Banks and other financial firms are usually excluded from corporate cash lists because they are required to hold a lot of money in cash due to the nature of their daily business operations.)      

&gt;Tech giants in particular are hoarding cash. Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have a combined $460 billion in cash on their balance sheets. Amazon has nearly $90 billion. Facebook has more than $64 billion, too.
It's not just the tech titans who are stockpiling cash.     

&gt;Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a giant mountain of cash that is growing even bigger as the company struggles to find more investing opportunities. Berkshire Hathaway had $144.1 billion on its balance sheet as of the end of June, up from $138.3 billion in December.

Strange, isn't it? Now we also have to remember those mysterious leaks which popped out called the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. They detailed all the ways the rich were hoarding wealth outside of the ability of Uncle Sam to collect that wealth. Uh. Ok. Sure thing. Not buying it for one second. Why? 

The five eyes have the most comprehensive and powerful surveillance system on the planet. They can apparently hack any device anywhere. Just ask Angela Merkel.

[Source Here](https://www.businessinsider.com/angela-merkel-has-hard-evidence-that-russia-hacked-her-emails-2020-5)     

It was the Russians. Duh. Ok. Whatever.   

But the point still stands. They can hack into wherever they want, and we're supposed to believe they can't find money in a bank? Or trace the transactions?    

Or is it more likely that when everything reaches a crescendo, when the pandemic keeps stalling the economy because of **LOCKDOWNS AS WE LOCKSTEP OUR WAY TO BUILDING BACK BETTER**, that the government's will go after the tax evaders, then they'll demand the tech giants pay more in taxes because, you got it, the masses need **UBI** and the government's along with the technocratic elite will finally end up being the hero's of society.    

Or in other words, the corporations will be made to start paying taxes by using the cash reserves they have saved by evading taxes, by the governments which claim to not be able to make them pay taxes, or close the tax loopholes  (don't our governments write the tax laws?), or find the tax evaders. **PROBLEM. REACTION. SOLUTION.**    

This is why UBI was inserted into our consciousness. This is why the Panama and Paradise Papers were **""LEAKED""**.     

Leaked. Funny word, isn't it? One man's leak is another intelligence agency's plan. No way? Let's use some logic and see if this is all part of  a plan to usher in the **FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION**.    

#John Doe and the Panama Papers    
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers)

&gt;the whistleblower who leaked the documents to German journalist Bastian Obermayer[15][16] from the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), remains anonymous, even to the journalists who worked on the investigation. ""My life is in danger"", the whistleblower told them.     

His life is in danger. Ominous. Scary. And if we take him at his word, doesn't this lend credence to others having claimed their lives were in danger, and who did in fact die afterwards? Of course it does. 

Good people who cared about humanity like **Max Spiers**.

There are more in the dangerous game of uncovering the truth by exposing those behind the lies. But does this mean the John Doe behind the Panama Papers is telling the truth. It's possible, but I doubt it.    

&gt;Doe added that they had never worked for any **government or intelligence agency** and expressed willingness to help prosecutors if granted immunity from prosecution.

Isn't that a strange comment to make? Why would he even feel the need to make it? If he was just a financial whistleblower, isn't working for the firm enough? Unless of course, he was protesting a little bit too much? Because while the Panama Papers have yielded some fruit, it hasn't resulted in the tree being picked bare by any means.    

Is there any other indication the **SOURCE** may have been working an intelligence plan all along? Well this wouldn't stand up in a court of law, but there's an interesting date which popped up with the Paradise Papers.   


&gt;Some of the details were made public on **5 November** 2017 and stories are still being released.
[Source Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Papers)      


The 5th of November. Now where have we seen that before? Right, that's the date Guy Fawkes tried to institute a **Catholic** Monarchy in England.   

You may have seen his famous mask, after all, **Anonymous** wears them (and you may want to consider they were intelligence agents from the beginning, I'll have a post on that in the future. At some point), and we've come to associate those masks with rebellion, haven't we? Sure we have. And those rebellious thoughts were further reinforced when the movie **V FOR VENDETTA** was released a couple of years after Anonymous made it's debut. And what was the plot of V for Vendetta? Oh you know, a rebellion against a totalitarian state which was made possible by a **PANDEMIC**.    

Yep. The dots are all there folks. We're being manipulated on an unimagined scale that defies comprehension. And it gets worse. Remember that Guy Fawkes wanted to put a **Catholic Monarchy** in power. Or rather, A Roman Catholic Monarchy. Roman. Club of Rome. Project Rome.

It's all connected. All of it. We have to think we won. We have to think that our demands were met so we go along with and accept the plan. And the endgame is an AI overlord that will solve all of our problems. Why? Because the whole system is corrupt. **PROBLEM. REACTION. SOLUTION.**   

And just to give you another little hint that it was all an intelligence operation designed to insert the idea of inequality into our heads.   

#Someone on Reddit hinted at the Paradise Papers 16 days before they were released
[Source Here](https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke/)

&gt;Update on Nov. 7: The Reddit account belonging to PanPthrowaway was deleted after this story was published.     

&gt;On Sunday, Nov. 5, journalists at nearly 100 media organizations began publishing stories on a massive document leak revealing financial information about the offshore accounts of the ultra wealthy. At 1.4 terabytes, the trove dubbed the Paradise Papers is second in scale to last year’s Panama Papers (2.6 TB) and includes details on elites from the queen of England to aides of Donald Trump.
But 16 days before the first stories published, there was a prescient post on Reddit with the title “Do not give up. More is coming.”    

&gt;Obvious throwaway.
I cannot give much information, but I would encourage you all to keep your eyes open. These are more, bigger leaks coming that relate to the extremely wealthy and members at the highest levels of government in developed countries around the world, including the United States.
Paradise.

They leaked it on Reddit 16 days before the Paradise Papers were released. Maybe we shouldn't keep discounting leaks on here? Like the one which suggested the Virus would get worse when it hits the bat population of Brazil? The same one which said to get out of certain stocks because when all of this was over, the world would be changed forever? Nothing like a world changing event, right? 

But how bad will it have to get before this happens? Will the rich flee into their **DOOMSDAY BUNKERS AS THE EVENT FINALLY HAPPENS?** Or can this all be avoided?    

Maybe we should ask one of our **SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM OVERLORDS TO GET A CLEARER ANSWER?** 


#Palantir Buys Gold Bars as Hedge Against ‘Black Swan Event’

&gt;Palantir Technologies Inc. said it’s preparing for another “black swan event” by stockpiling gold bars and inviting customers to pay for its data analysis software in gold.

&gt;The company spent $50.7 million this month on gold, part of an unusual investment strategy that also includes startups, blank-check companies and possibly Bitcoin. Palantir had previously said it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment before adding precious metals more recently.    

&gt;A spokeswoman for Palantir said no one has yet paid in either Bitcoin or gold. Accepting nontraditional currencies “reflects more of a worldview,” Shyam Sankar, the chief operating officer, said in an interview. **“You have to be prepared for a future with more black swan events.”**


Yeah. The same companies that are spying on all of us, thinks they have to prepare for more **BLACK SWAN EVENTS**.

*Just wait for me at the end of the walk,* she had said, and Jimmy did. He put the Mustang’s windows all the way down to let in the warm evening breeze and turned up the music so she’d hear it as soon as she came outside. He basked in the heady aroma of leather seats and Armani cologne and ignored the ostentatious homes that lined the quiet street. He had eyes only for the flagstone walk that led to Destiny’s door.

The Quick family had moved to town when Jimmy was a senior in high school. Nobody knew much about them; dad did something with computers, mom pretty much stayed home. They had one daughter in a private school somewhere upstate; the other daughter, Destiny, came to Jimmy’s school to finish her final year.

They had been in the same class, but not in the same *class,* as they say. Jimmy’s mom had chosen their apartment specifically so he could be zoned into the good schools. He’d made good grades and gotten along well enough with the popular kids, but he’d never been one of them. He wasn’t a total loner, but he never got onto a sports team and spent a lot of his Saturday nights falling asleep to YouTube.

Destiny had moved into the popular group like she’d been born to it. In her one year at the school, she was MVP in tennis, basketball and softball, had a 4.4 grade average, got awards in six different clubs, and saved a kid from drowning. Everybody loved her. Which was why it had freaked him out when one day she stopped at his locker and said, “Hey, Jimmy, wanna go see the new Star Wars movie with me tonight?”

It wasn’t like one of those movie scenes, where sunlight from the glass doors suffused Destiny’s auburn hair with golden fire and limned the skin of her bare arms with soft radiance, her piercing green eyes probing the depths of his soul and declaring that he, Jimmy, was The One. No, it wasn’t like that at all, Jimmy told himself later, over and over again. Just a pretty girl who sat near him in one of his classes asking him out of nowhere if he wanted to go to a movie.

Of course, he’d said no.

He hadn’t stuttered or blushed or dropped his books or been unable to look at her. He’d just very calmly said, “Well, I’d love to, but I need to be home tonight to watch my little brothers.” Which had technically been true, although at that moment, he could think of two of his mom’s friends who would have been happy to watch his siblings, and he knew his mom would have been ok with it. Later, he couldn’t even explain to himself why those words had come out of his mouth. 

Destiny just smiled and said, “Aw, that’s sweet, you’re such a good brother. Maybe another time.”

There had never been another time. Graduation came, then that awkward summer before everyone scattered to the winds. Jimmy had stayed there to work at his uncle’s Ford dealership and take community college courses when he could.

He’d mostly forgotten about Destiny, except nights when his insomnia kicked in and his brain trotted out “It’s Your Life—the 50 Stupidest Things You’ve Ever Done Edition!” That moment in the hallway was usually #1. And it always looked like the movie version.

Two years out of high school, Uncle Arturo had died of an aneurysm. Just like that, no warning. He wasn’t married, no kids. His enormous house went to his only sibling, Jimmy’s mom. Jimmy found himself the sudden owner of the biggest car dealership in the state. Taxes, lawyers, and his new slate of business and finance classes, along with running the dealership, took enough of Jimmy’s energy that he should be sleeping like the dead. Some nights, though, he still found himself on the insomnia train, riding the hot black rails straight back to the school hallway and staying for extra innings of “*What* Were You *Thinking*??”

Summer came again, and with it, Jimmy determined to put the cringiness and self-loathing of that memory to an end. He would make one call. Not a social media message or some other half-assed, easily-ignorable beta male move. A call straight to her parents’ phone. He heard her voice. He asked. She said yes. Now, here he was, waiting for her. And here she came, out the front door, walking toward his car, smiling.

She looked exactly the same. Wearing darker jeans and higher heels, maybe, and an off-the-shoulder top that hadn’t been her style in school, but she was a college girl now. Princeton, Jimmy thought, but he didn’t really care. Her hair was longer, the style loose but clearly expensive. She wore more mascara now—a lot more, he saw as she got closer. And she had a small Band-Aid on her left cheek.

“Hey Jimmy,” she said as she swung the door open and settled into the passenger seat. “Nice ride! Is this a 50-year Limited?”

“Hey Destiny,” Jimmy said with the half-smile he’d practiced in the mirror for about four hours that afternoon. “Good eye, yes it is. 8 cylinders, a little more horsepower than factory…”

“Don’t tell me about it, I want to *feel* it, let’s go!” As Jimmy put his hand on the stick and moved it toward first gear, she put her hand on his. He felt his heart racing along with the engine. “I like a man who takes charge of his equipment,” she said quietly, then let out a “Whoop!” as Jimmy hit second a little early and the car leaped forward.

“Nobody’ll care if we’re a little late,” she said as they approached the end of her parents’ development. “Let’s go out on the highway, I want to see this car really open up!” Jimmy looked over at her. There was no way he was ever going to say ‘no’ again; especially not tonight.

“Fasten your seatbelt,” he said, his smile echoing hers.

“I never wear those things. Just go for it.”

Soon, they were on the highway. The radar detector showed clear, and she cranked the music all the way up. Her hand settled back on top of his, and Jimmy punched it. They zipped along at speeds close to 100mph, dodging other cars and laughing, the wind in their hair and the setting sun blazing across the dashboard chrome. As they rounded a curve, Jimmy dialed it back. “Why are we slowing down, it was just getting good!” she shouted over the speakers.

“That truck with the logs,” Jimmy yelled back, pointing at the big truck looming ahead in their lane. He didn’t want to shout at her, so he thumbed the volume down a bit. “Sorry,” he said more calmly, “there’s no space to pass it just yet.”

“Oh, just get on his tail and shove into the other lane. Those people’ll have to let you over, c’mon!”

“Do you know what can happen if you get too close to a logging truck? No way, I’m getting over now.”

“That’s no fun,” she pouted, pulling her hand away. She turned to look out the window and stayed quiet as they inched their way past the truck. She perked up again as Jimmy sped up and wove his way toward the clear road at the head of the pack. The touch of her hand on his arm was like cool electricity. “You know my last name is ‘Quick,’ right?”

Jimmy was having trouble speaking just then, so he nodded. “I like things that go quick.” She gently plucked his hand off of the stick and brought it closer to her. The car was in 5th, no need to keep his hand on it. “Go a little faster,” she breathed, and pulled his hand to her lips. Jimmy went faster.

Jimmy felt her teeth nipping gently at the first knuckle of his finger, then the warmth of her lips and cheek against the back of his hand. He shivered, and his foot pushed the pedal harder. Her hair tangled around his thumb. The rough edge of the Band-Aid tickled his skin and she laughed; a deeper, throatier laugh than before. “I have a secret,” she said. Jimmy looked at her briefly. The sun had dropped below the horizon, and her face glowed a pale blue in the dashboard lights. “Want to hear it?”

Jimmy was still having trouble speaking. “Mm hm,” he managed.

“Destiny’s my sister.” She laughed again, a high, clear sound like silver bells in an empty chapel. “I knew you were calling for her, but I couldn’t resist. I hope you don’t mind,” she said, tilting her head and slowly pressing his hand down along the side of her face, then farther. His fingers brushed along the smooth expanse of her throat, over the soft-hard ridge of her collarbone, and down.

The last thing Jimmy heard her say before he swerved to avoid another car and lost control on a curve—before the crunch and scream of tortured metal and shattering glass and the sight of leaves tumbling in the headlight beams—was, “Destiny’s my twin; I’m Disaster.”

፠

Jimmy woke up in a hospital bed. It was daylight. He was achy and disoriented, but as far as he could tell, he didn’t think anything was broken. Pretty soon after he started moving around, a state trooper came in. The man seemed calm. He asked Jimmy his name and other normal questions.

“Jimmy, you were talking about a girl when the EMTs picked you up, but your car’s sensor records show you were alone in the vehicle at the time of the accident. So, why were you going that fast?”

Jimmy tried to process what the cop was saying. Tried to remember if his passenger had been thrown from the car, or if she had screamed. Of course she must have screamed, but he had no memory of the sound. Her airbag hadn’t deployed. Thinking through the moment, he vaguely remembered the sirens, the floodlights, the sound of the driver’s side door being mangled to get him out. Lying on the scarred earth up the slope from his demolished car. Nobody else had been pulled out. There was no single, discarded high-heeled shoe with a broken strap and blood on the buckle.

“I…” Jimmy swallowed, trying to focus on the moment of the crash. “I thought I had a date with Destiny,” he said slowly. “But instead, I’d been flirting with Disaster.”"
Fantom - a deep dive,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantomFoundation/comments/ptubpz/fantom_a_deep_dive/,Zarkorix,1,2021-09-23 20:40:24,16,/r/FantomFoundation/comments/ptubpz/fantom_a_deep_dive/,NaN,"I previously wrote this for [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and now I'm sharing it here.

# Moving Beyond the Traditional Blockchain

Fantom (FTM) is a blockchain network built on a non-linear directed acyclic graph (DAG). A non-linear DAG is a form of distributed ledger technology that differs from the traditional ""one block after another"" blockchain used by BTC or ETH. For more details on DAGs and their pros/cons, see my explanation here [(Link)](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pbw024/blockchain_vs_dag_an_overview/).

FTM, theoretically, offers speeds of 300k transactions per second (TPS) but in practice, the maximum varies between 5-7.5k/s while 10k/s has been sustained on the test-net without issue [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-general-update-2nd-november-2020/). FTM offers L1 smart contracts (a world's first for DAGs) and transactions cost on average \~$0.01-$0.05 with a 1-2s finality - ranking FTM toward the top for speed, scalability and finality [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/what-is-fantom-opera/#fast-finality). FTM is currently experiencing \~1.2-1.7m transactions per day, placing it close to or **above** ETH in usage [(Source)](https://ftmscan.com/).

**Main Conclusion**: FTM is a fast, scalable ""Blockchain 3.0"" project attempting to solve the blockchain trilemma.

# Lachesis

Fantom uses a bespoke consensus mechanism termed ""Lachesis"" which merges leaderless proof-of-stake (LPoS) with the DAG architecture to achieve *asynchronous* Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) and therefore security and a degree of decentralisation [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/lachesis-consensus-algorithm/). Let's simplify that and compare it to regular delegated-PoS (dPoS).

dPoS typically selects a single validator to propose the next block (i.e. a leader) and subsequently uses other nodes to reach consensus on that proposed block. dPoS therefore requires that a sufficient number of nodes are able to communicate with each other, *simulatenously*, at any given time - or else the network halts as consensus cannot be reached.

**By contrast, in FTM**:

* No single validator is selected or plays a privileged role in securing the network (i.e. it's *leaderless*).
* There is no dPoS-style voting. Validators do not vote on the integrity of the entire network nor share blocks with other nodes, but rather, each node independently produces its **own** order of events (i.e. transactions). In other words, each node is a blockchain itself. To facilitate this, nodes ""gossip"" basic information about each transaction. Collectively this results in significantly reduced latency and rapid finality.
* FTM is therefore also *asynchronous* since nodes can construct their own order of events independently of each other, at different times.
* FTM's ""gossip"" mechanism means the network can tolerate a significant loss of communication and still reach consensus. This, theoretically, prevents the network from halting if a subset of nodes are experiencing network issues.

A limited form of voting does occur in order to finalise blocks, which are sealed into sub-DAGs known as ""epochs"". If all nodes on the network have a different transaction order or there is a 50:50 split, the nodes with the highest staked amount are considered ""correct"".

**Main Conclusion**: FTM is robust and achieves near-instant finality using a bespoke proof-of-stake mechanism coupled to DAG architecture.

# Decentralisation

FTM currently has only \~52 validators online and 6 of those nodes control 930m FTM (\~60%) of all staked FTM - raising serious questions over how decentralised FTM is. 13.8% of the nodes are run by the Fantom Foundation and 41.5% have no known identity [(Source)](https://explorer.fantom.network/staking).

FTM node-running is permissionless (i.e. anybody can technically run a node), but, the entry barrier is incredibly high. It requires: (i) 1,000,000 FTM (currently worth $1.3m) and (ii) AWS-based hardware [(Source)](https://docs.fantom.foundation/staking/how-to-run-a-validator-node). To put that into perspective, ETH 2.0 requires \~$110,000 to run a node while ALGO requires only \~$2. FTM's governance system (see below) recently attempted to lower the bar to 500,000 FTM - but failed to do so. Nevertheless, in the first half of 2021, the entry barrier was 3,000,000 FTM - so progress has been made.

Despite FTM's Lachesis protocol - which attempts to decentralise the network despite a limited number of nodes - FTM's main net halted for 7 hours on 25th Feb 2021 [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-network-incident-analysis/). This happened because two large validators, that controlled over 33% of the stake, slowed down. Governance has since begun to implement changes to limit node size to address this vulnerability.

To further secure the network, FTM discourages malicious behaviour by operating a no-tolerance, **100% slashing policy** \- that is, if a node misbehaves, 100% of all that node's staked FTM is taken as a penalty fee.

**Main Conclusion**: As with all DAG-based networks, FTM is not - yet - sufficiently decentralised.

# Staking Rewards &amp; Governance

FTM offers a two-tiered staking system [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/ftm-staking/):

* Staked FTM has a base rate of **4% APY** (no lockup period).
* If you choose to lock your FTM, the reward rate increases proportionally - up to **13.45% APY** at the time of writing, in exchange for 365 days. If you unlock prior to the pledged date, you will lose a majority of the rewards. Rewards can be claimed periodically (every \~2-3h) to compound interest.

Staking and validator selection is performed within the official wallet, fWallet [(Link)](https://fwallet.fantom.network/) \- as is governance. Governance operates on the basis of 1 FTM = 1 vote, thus allowing all individual holders to vote. As it stands, however, only validators or the Foundation are able to submit proposals - but this will soon be opened up to the Community.

**Main Conclusion**: FTM offers highly competitive staking APYs and is pursuing further decentralisation by handing voting and proposal submission powers to holders.

# DeFi &amp; Liquid Assets

FTM offers a native, in-house DeFi suite accessible from within the official wallet (fWallet). A key selling point of FTM is the liquidity of locked, staked FTM - which cannot be sold nor transferred out of the wallet, but *can* be used in FTM's DeFi **to** **earn additional rewards (on top of the 4-13.45% APY)** [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/defi/). FTM's DeFi suite consists of:

* **fMint**: a gateway to FTM DeFi that allows you to mint fUSD (advertised as a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to USD) using your staked and locked FTM as collateral. fUSD is then used throughout the DeFi suite.
* **fSwap**: FTM's native DEX that allows you to trade FTM or fUSD for 176 synthetic tokens (including fBTC and fETH) with zero slippage. In other words, if you believe ETH will rally in the short-term, you can buy fETH using your minted fUSD - hold - and sell later for a profit, all without leaving the wallet.
* **fUni**: a clone of UniSwap deployed on FTM which, unlike fSwap, allows you to trade for *real* (i.e. non-synthetic) coins and tokens. Relative to UniSwap on ETH, it provides transactions at lower fees and higher speeds.

**Main Conclusion**: FTM excels in and offers a powerful suite of DeFi apps, which remain accessible even to locked and staked FTM.

# Multi-Chain Tokens, Interoperability &amp; Ecosystem

FTM's main net is known as Opera, where the native FTM coin resides. FTM, however, also exists as separate ERC-20 (ETH) and BEP-2 (BSC) tokens - lending FTM a degree of interoperability and flexibility. To avoid confusion and loss, ERC-20 tokens that arrive into FTM's official wallet (fWallet) are **automatically** converted to Opera FTM or they can be converted manually using FTM's MultiChain DApp.

FTM is fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cosmos SDK compatible - allowing developers to directly deploy ETH DApps on Opera to take advantage of FTM's speed and scalability. Critically, each FTM-based DApp runs on its own, sandboxed blockchain network powered by Lachesis. **This permits each DApp to generate custom tokens, tokenomics and governance rules while still instantly interacting with other FTM-based DApps** [(Source)](https://www.fantom.foundation/intro-to-fantom/). FTM is therefore an interoperable ""network of networks"" in its own right and it's this modularity that makes FTM extremely attractive as both a development platform and an L2-solution for ETH. In theory, Lachesis can plug into *any* distributed ledger.

To further boost adoption of FTM as a DApp platform, FTM have developed Fantom Bridge [(Link)](https://bnbridge.exchange/). This allows you to move ERC-20 tokens or ETH to FTM **for free** [(Source)](https://twitter.com/fantomfdn/status/1434834829682610177?lang=en) \- while moving from FTM to ETH incurs a 0.1% bridge fee and costs 30 FTM (\~$40). This is considerably cheaper than competing bridge protocols (e.g. RenBridge).

In addition to FTM's native DeFi suite, \~60 DApps operate on FTM and the ecosystem can be viewed here: [(Link)](https://fantom.foundation/partners/). Notable DApps and integrations include: Ren, SushiSwap, SpookySwap, Chainlink, Band Protocol, The Graph, Ankr, Covalent, Injective Protocol, Orion Protocol and Curve. FTM also offers several NFT marketplaces.

**Main Conclusion**: FTM natively runs ETH DApps, and has a high degree of interoperability while offering flexibility to each DApp to govern itself.

# Tokenomics &amp; Initial Distribution

FTM has a maximum supply of 3,175,000,000 (3.175b) coins across all chains and \~80% of that supply is currently in circulation [(Source)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/). All FTM was minted at launch in Dec 2019. FTM made \~38% of the total supply available for sale to **private** investors during the ICO - at a price range of $0.016-$0.035. Only \~2% of FTM was made available to **retail** investors during the ICO, at a price of $0.04. A further 15% went to advisors/contributors and 15% to FTM project team members/founders [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/research/wp_fantom_v1.6.pdf). Notable advisors include Andre Cronje - the DeFi mastermind behind Yearn Finance Protocol (YFI) [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/about/). The remaining \~30% is reserved for staking rewards and as developer grants to build the FTM ecosystem.

**Main Conclusion**: FTM's initial allocation was skewed toward private investors and the Fantom Foundation - however, this is not unusual for a PoS-based network.

# Real World Use

FTM has seen major real-world adoption and boasts close ties to the pharmaceutical industry and several national governments - including:

* Tajikistan has adopted FTM to build digital and e-government infrastructure on a national and local level [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-to-power-e-government-infrastructure-of-tajikistan/).
* Pakistan has adopted FTM to regulate, audit and control private educational institutions and a subset of prisons [(Source 1)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/the-pakistan-punjab-prisons-department-and-fantom-enter-into-a-blockchain-and-software-pilot-program/) [(Source 2)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/pakistan-private-educational-institutions-regulatory-authority-to-use-fantom-technology/).
* Uzbekistan has, indirectly, adopted FTM to build e-government infrastructure, monitor commerce and deploy a CBDC [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-bringing-blockchain-solutions-to-uzbekistan/).
* Afghanistan\* has (or had) built extremely close-ties to FTM across a multitude of ministries including: health, energy, commerce/finance, railways and national standards (Sources) to build digital infrastructure and deploy anti-corruption/anti-fraud measures, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector where counterfeit drugs are a serious problem [(Source 1)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/afghanistan-ministry-of-health-and-fantom-announce-national-rollout-to-combat-drug-fraud/) [(Source 2)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/acci-fantom-pilot-program/) [(Source 3)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/ansa-fantom-blockchain-issuance-program/) [(Source 4](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-announces-partnership-with-royal-star-nabros-pharma-bliss-gvs-and-the-ministry-of-health-for-the-certification-of-pharmaceuticals-across-afghanistan/)[).](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-announces-partnership-with-royal-star-nabros-pharma-bliss-gvs-and-the-ministry-of-health-for-the-certification-of-pharmaceuticals-across-afghanistan/)

\*Given current events in Afghanistan, it remains unclear if FTM's governmental partnerships remain intact.

FTM has also received significant funding from several institutions including Alameda Research ($35m) [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/alameda-research-invests-35m-into-fantom-foundation/) and HyperChain Capital ($15m) [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/hyperchain-announces-15m-investment-into-fantom/). Moreover, FTM has presented to and worked with the United Nations CBDC and stablecoin teams [(Source)](https://fantom.foundation/blog/fantom-presenting-to-united-nations-cbdc-and-stablecoin-teams/).

**Main Conclusion**: FTM has built an impressive list of real-world uses, despite launching less than 2y ago.

**Final Conclusion**: FTM offers cutting-edge technology, impressive DeFi capabilities and a growing ecosystem but - as with all DAG-based networks - serious questions remain over its decentralisation. Nevertheless and regardless: as the popularity of DeFi grows, so will FTM."

We are a small facility, about 35 employees, that is part of a larger international publicly traded company.

I was recently promoted to senior accountant. I have about 7 years accounting experience in industry. 3 years with my current company. 

We were told the controller put in their two weeks notice today, and that they hired a professional recruiter to fill that position. 

Should I make my case to take over the controller position? It would certainly a lot more responsibility to take over that role. There is a lot of details to keep track of. Would have to learn the reporting process in more depth and take on a broader role in the overall business. I also have not had formal management experience. 

However, I do know the operations of this company very well after three years here. There will be a learning curve with evening an experienced controller stepping in. 

Just hoping to get some advice and perspective on how to approach this situation. I was expecting to have a few more years to prepare to take over this role."

What is Yield farming?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/pub9qq/what_is_yield_farming/,subwaybooligan,1,2021-09-24 11:20:00,1,/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/pub9qq/what_is_yield_farming/,NaN,"***TLDR at the bottom***

**What is yield farming in DeFi and how does it work?**

**What is yield farming?**  


At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards on their holdings. With yield farming, an investor deposits units of a cryptocurrency into a lending protocol to earn interest from trading fees. Some users are also rewarded with additional yields from the protocol’s governance token. 

Yield farming works in a similar way to bank loans. When the bank loans you money, you pay back the loan with interest. Yield farming does the same, but this time, the banks are crypto holders like yourself. Yield farming uses “idle cryptos” that would have otherwise been wasting away in an exchange or hot wallet to provide liquidity in DeFi protocols like Uniswap in exchange for returns.

**Understanding liquidity pools, liquidity providers and automated market maker model**

Yield farming works with a liquidity provider and a liquidity pool (a smart contract filled with cash) that powers a DeFi market. A liquidity provider is an investor who deposits funds into a smart contract. The liquidity pool is a smart contract filled with cash. Yield farming functions based on the automated market maker (AMM) model. 

This model is popular on decentralized exchanges. AMM eliminates the conventional order book, which contains all “buy” and “sell” orders on a cryptocurrency exchange. Instead of stating the price that an asset is set to trade at, an AMM creates liquidity pools using smart contracts. These pools execute trades based on predetermined algorithms.

The AMM model relies heavily on liquidity providers (LPs), who deposit funds into liquidity pools. These pools are the bedrock of most DeFi marketplaces where users borrow, lend and swap tokens. DeFi users pay trading fees to the marketplace; the marketplace shares the fees with LPs based on their share of the pool’s liquidity. 

Take Compound, for instance. The protocol provides liquidity to borrowers who want to borrow funds in cryptocurrencies. The Compound Finance system does this using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. LPs deposit funds into the liquidity pools. These contracts serve as the matching engine for market participants. 

Once an interest rate for the loan has been agreed upon, the borrower gets the funds.

In exchange for their funds, LPs get Compound Finance’s native COMP tokens. They also get a cut of the interest that the borrowers pay.

Some of the most common DeFi-related stablecoins include USDT, DAI, USDC and BUSD. Some protocols can also mint tokens, which represent your deposited coins in the system. For instance, if you deposit ETH into Compound Finance, you get cETH. If you deposit DAI, you get cDAI.

**Yield farming returns**

Estimated yield returns are calculated on an annualized model. This shows the possible earnings for locking up your cryptos for a year.

Some of the most common metrics include annual percentage yield (APY) and annual percentage rate (APR). The primary difference between them is that APR doesn’t consider compound interest, which involves plowing back your profits to increase your returns.

Still, most calculation models are simply estimates. It is difficult to accurately calculate returns on yield farming because it is a dynamic market. A yield farming strategy could deliver high returns for a while, but farmers could always adopt it *en masse*, leading to a drop in profitability. The market is quite volatile and risky for both borrowers and lenders.

**Should you try yield farming?**

**First, understand its risks**

Despite its obvious potential upside, yield farming has its risks. They include: 

* **Smart contract risks** 

Smart contracts are paperless digital codes that contain the agreement between parties on predefined rules that self executes. Smart contracts eliminate go-betweens, are cheaper and safer to conduct transactions. But, they are susceptible to attack vectors and bugs in the code. Users of popular DeFi protocols [Uniswap](https://decrypt.co/43927/ethereum-user-scammed-for-140000-in-uniswap-uni-tokens) and [Akropolis](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-steals-2-million-from-cryptocurrency-service-akropolis/) have all suffered losses to smart contract scams. 

* **Impermanent loss risk** 

Yield farming requires liquidity providers to supply funds into pools to earn yields and trading fees from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This offers LPs market-neutral returns, but it could be risky during sharp market moves. 

This risk is possible because AMMs don’t update token prices in line with movements in the market. For instance, if an asset’s price drops by 60% on a centralized exchange, the change won’t immediately reflect on a DEX.

As a result, a savvy arbitrage trader could use that narrow price gap to sell their token on a yield farming platform at a premium. LPs will eventually have to cover this difference, and incur losses when the price drops. Since their capital is locked in the pool, they can’t benefit when the price rises. One way of addressing this issue is to choose protocols that trade assets with low price slippages, such as the [WBTC and renBTC pairs on Curve.](https://taiyangzhang.medium.com/)

* **Liquidation risks** 

As with the traditional finance space, DeFi platforms use their customers’ deposits to provide liquidity to their markets. However, a problem could arise when the value of the collateral drops below the loan’s price. For instance, if you take out a loan in ETH collateralized by BTC, a price increase in ETH would result in the loan being liquidated as the value of the collateral (BTC) would be less than the value of the ETH loan.

* **Capital intensive and complicated process**

Yield farming is a capital-intensive operation. Most of the cost concern surrounds the issue of gas fees on the Ethereum network. Josh Rager, the founder of cryptocurrency trading service Blockroots.com, took to Twitter to [complain](https://twitter.com/Josh_Rager/status/1293760986520969217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293760986520969217%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F38556%2Fethereum-fees-briefly-equal-a-us-stimulus-check) that he had to pay as much as US$1,200 in fees to purchase tokens on a DeFi project. This is more of an issue for smaller participants than for wealthier users, who have access to more capital. Smaller participants might find out that they can’t withdraw their earnings due to high gas fees.

Getting into yield farming is a risky endeavor if you have no experience in the cryptocurrency world. You could lose all your investment in one fell swoop. Invest at your own risk. The world of yield farming is fast-paced and volatile. If you decide to try your hands on yield farming, you should not invest more than you’re willing to lose.

**What the future holds for yield farming**

Yield farming uses investors’ funds to create liquidity in the market in exchange for returns. It has significant potential for growth, but it’s not without its faults.

Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, even promised not to dip his feet into yield farming until it “stabilizes.” Several other blockchains like Polkadot and Solana have tried wooing DeFi platforms with new features. Tezos completed an upgrade dubbed “Delphi” which it claims would reduce gas fees for developers by 75%. This proposition is expected to attract DeFi developers.

**The Seven Most Popular Yield Farming Protocols**

[**1. Compound**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/) is a money market for lending and borrowing assets, where algorithmically adjusted compound interest as well the governance token COMP can be earned.

[**2. MakerDAO**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/) is a decentralized credit pioneer that lets users lock crypto as collateral assets to borrow DAI, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Interest is paid in the form of a “stability fee.” 

[**3. Aave**](https://aave.com/) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol to create money markets, where users can borrow assets and earn compound interest for lending in the form of the [**AAVE**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) (previously LEND) token. Aave is also known for facilitating flash loans and credit delegation, where loans can be issued to borrowers without collateral. 

[**4. Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) is a hugely popular decentralized exchange (DEX) and [**automated market maker (AMM)**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) that enables users to swap almost any [**ERC20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pair without intermediaries. Liquidity providers must stake both sides of the liquidity pool in a 50/50 ratio, and in return earn a proportion of transaction fees as well as the UNI governance token.

[**5. Balancer**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/) is a liquidity protocol that distinguishes itself through flexible staking. It doesn’t require lenders to add liquidity equally to both pools. Instead, liquidity providers can create customized liquidity pools with varying token ratios. 

[**6. Synthetix**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/) is a derivatives liquidity protocol that allows users to create synthetic crypto assets through the use of [**oracles**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) for almost any traditional finance asset that can deliver reliable pricing data.

[**7. Yearn.finance**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance-protocol/) is an automated decentralized aggregation protocol that allows yield farmers to use various lending protocols like Aave and Compound for the highest yield. Yearn.finance algorithmically seeks the most profitable yield farming services and uses rebasing to maximize their profit. Yearn.finance made waves in 2020 when its governance token [**YFI** ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)climbed to over $40,000 in value at one stage.

Other notable yield farming protocols: [**Curve**](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/), [**Harvest**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/), [**Ren**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/) and [**SushiSwap**](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/16/bullish-activity-for-bitcoin-under-the-hood-of-the-sushiswap-saga-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/).

- Convex currently has about $260mil worth of CRV permanently locked in its contract, and is continuing to see a rate of about $50mil worth of crv permanently locked in its contract per month.
- Bribes to CVX holders are very likely to reach $1-2mil biweekly in the coming weeks (based on total bribes paid between votium app + andre cronje's bribe site)
- Convex is making about $50mil revenue per month right now
- 25% of CVX emissions were originally planned for liquidity incentives, but with the new cvxcrv pool on curve, 60% of the remaining amount of CVX is being returned to treasury and/or used in the CVX/ETH liquidity pool instead. This means somewhere around 10% of the CVX supply is no longer being emitted as rewards.
- Convex currently has about $8bil TVL and controls close to 40% of the voting power of Curve

The following analysis uses current rates to calculate annualized values, which (disclaimer) in practice may or may not necessarily be an accurate extrapolation:

At current rates, convex is very likely to have over 250 million CRV (&gt;$500mil worth) locked permanently in its contract and earning curve fees forever (plus airdrops), by end of year 1 of operation. Also at current rates, CVX holders will potentially earn over $50million in bribes over a 1 year period, and convex would likely make about $600mil in revenue after 1 year of operation. Currently, convex takes about 16% of this revenue for beneficial purposes such as direct profit for CVX holders, and they have the ability to increase this percent, providing for more direct profit to CVX holders.

Currently, convex's market cap is just $250mil with a fully diluted valuation of $950mil, though it would takes years to reach &gt;90% of supply circulating. To reiterate, convex is likely to permanently own &gt;$500mil worth of locked CRV after 1 year, in addition to $600mil revenue, up to $50mil in bribes paid directly to CVX holders, currently controlling almost 40% of Curve's voting power, 8bil TVL, and having diverted up to 10% of emissions back to treasury. With a FDV of just $950mil with stats like this, a logical assumption is that people simply haven't connected the dots of how insane convex's fundamentals are relative to current price. Convex also still has the massive upside potential of not yet being listed on any top 5 centralized exchanges; if this were to occur in the future (which is likely given that it is currently rank #7 TVL in all of DeFi), this price discovery phase could be quite rapid.

Hey everyone, sorry we’re all here. I don’t know if this is the right forum but I’m going to post it here and hope the mods will direct me correctly if it is not.

About a year ago when I was offshore, she started an affair with a married man from her job, I finally found out after I was back home and unemployed, I almost feel like I stayed with her for fear of not having a job. Much of my family are dead or not in contact and over time I have lost all close friends that I have known coming up because my profession requires me to be on the rig for months.

I know I have myself to blame for staying after she cheated on me the first time, because two weeks ago I caught her cheating on me again, as the saying goes, D-day was two weeks ago and I have already served her Divorce papers. To give you guys a full picture, let's go back to about a year ago when she cheated on me the first time.

About a year ago, I fell on hard times, without a job or money. it was back in 2018 during the oil crisis, my profession was in the oil and gas industries and I worked offshore, so when all the jobs dried up, our saving dried up as well, mainly because my wife spends like a drunken sailor, I had some savings but I used it on making the down payment for our house, she had an ok job but I make most of the money, if you are familiar with oil rig jobs you would know that my job is very stressful because it is dangerous and it required me to stay offshore for months on end, few months on and few weeks off. I lost my job and couldn’t find any other jobs because all my experience were on offshore positions, and employers didn’t seem to be hiring, I was used to working since I was 16 years old, never gone a month without a job, so I felt like a broken man, after 5 months of not being able to find a job, I stayed home all day, my wife was the only one working and since she spent most of our money on useless things, all our money was going to paying credit card, then mortgage, utilities and groceries, although I was collecting unemployment it only went so far, the crisis really hit me hard especially because we just made a huge down payment on a brand-new house so all my saving and reserve money went into that, the job market was so bad at that time I couldn’t even find a job as a janitor, should I explain to you what that did to my confidence?

About myself, I am 25 my wife is 26, we have been together since high school we never went to college mainly because we had kids at a young age and had to grow up quick. We have two girls, an 8-year-old and 6-year-old.

While I was unemployed, I tried to make myself useful by cleaning the house every day, babysitting my kids, taking them to school, cooking and doing all the household stuff, all my wife had to do was work, when she comes back from work, I tried to make her life as comfortable as I can, I even give her back massages during a stressful day at work. my self esteem was very low at that time, my self-worth was tied to being the provider of the family and I wasn’t accomplishing that.

So I started suspecting that she was having an affair when she started coming home late, for instance, she will come home on Monday like at 5 pm and Tuesday like at 9 pm or so, her excuses range from, too much traffic, to girls night out, to working late, she is an hourly worker and I get to see her paycheck and I know she doesn’t work much overtime at least her paycheck doesn’t reflect the amount of overtime she claims, you would think she is working 80 hours a week but in reality she is getting paid like 45-50 hours, we have a joint account and her paycheck is directly deposited to the joint account. I used the same account when I was employed as well. so, I felt like she was distant with me and the kids, sometimes I would be talking to her, and she wouldn’t even be paying attention, she was zoning out of her our life’s. She also started texting a lot and seem a bit too excited answering her text messages, she tries to hide it, but I have known her so long and can read through her, she locks her iPhone with fingerprint and password and I don’t know her password, I felt like I was at a dead end. When I complaint to her about it, it always turn in to a big argument, she makes jokes about me not contributing, not doing enough around the house even though I do everything, she always try to deflect and not take any responsibility for coming home late, when I ask her about the incongruity with her paycheck and the overtime she claim to be working, she always act defensive telling me that she is not a work slave that I have no right to question how much she brings home.

Then I thought about following her after work to see where she goes, but then I have to rent a car because we only have one family car, and I don’t have money to rent another car, This went on for a few weeks but one night we got drunk at home, but she got extra drunk and passed out so I used her finger to unlock her iPhone, long story short, I saw all the text messages, it reveals an ongoing affair that she has been having with a coworker, the relationship was physical and emotional, she wasn’t saying she was going to leave me, she was just doing it to get attention from the affair partner, she enjoys the butterfly in your stomach kind of thing, just a coworker that validated her long enough for her to spread her legs, at the time this guy has been flirting with her for over 11 months and they carried on a physical affair for 9 months, it started when I was offshore. The affair partner is married, so she was banging him in my house when I was offshore, at work and in the park. I spent the rest of the night taking pictures of her text messages, I confronted her the next day and she confessed. I should have walked away from the marriage, I should have divorced her, I should have separated but I wasn’t in a position to do so. I really wanted the relationship to work because I just made a huge down payment for our new home, I have been saving that money for years, and now I was on unemployment, and using it to pay off our joined credit card debt that she racked up with her shopaholic habits.

After I caught her cheating, Things never felt the same. We couldnt talk about the affair as she would break down crying and I spent much of the rest of the day or even weeks consoling her as she talks about how she never wanted it to happen. I couldnt speak to anyone else about it, the idea of this even sends her into a breakdown. I couldn’t tell her that she needs to quit her job because we needed the money, she told me that she broke it off with him, I exposed the other man to his spouse, so he quit working there after that. About 6 months after the affair I was lucky to find a lucrative job as a field service technician, it requires few days of travel, but it was better than the offshore gig where I was gone for months.

Ever since I caught her cheating she has been going through depression, after I found a job, she decided to quit hers. she has gotten use to me doing everything, she does no housework, rarely cooks, and then she decided that it’s her mission to get me a threesome with her and another woman as some kind of penance for cheating on me. During that period i didn’t understand her or anything that was happening. I built my entire life around her in every way I could, and now I had this emptiness inside of me that won’t go away.

The times we have been able to talk, and I extract some info out of her it’s always because she felt disconnected from me and liked the attention, the only information I have about the affair are from the information I found from the text messages. She destroyed two families as far as I’m concerned, as the other man confessed to his wife and lost custody of his kids before going to join the military to “hopefully die in the sandbox.” Her excuse was that he pursued her for months, and because I wasn’t around, she was weak and gave in to his attention and flattery, but the text messages shows that she was just as into it as he was. I still remember all the vile things I read in her messaging app when I discovered it and it makes me sick. Now she’s unemployed, spends her days shopping online, watching TV, or playing video games. She regularly breaks down and talks about her suicidal ideation, but she won’t seek help. I felt like I was stuck with her forever, as if I leave, she will potentially either kill herself or definitely end up destitute. I didn’t want to be responsible for hurting someone after I was destroyed myself.

5 months after I started working, my self-confidence returned, and it led to a lot of fights as I dislike many of the ways she treats me and our kids. I told her to get her act together, force her to do housework and cook, separated my finance from hers by closing our joint bank account, borrowed money to pay off our credit card and then closed it all, to curve her spending habit. She fought me every step of the way, she told me that I am being controlling and unfair. And she started giving me the silent treatment.

2 weeks ago, I went on a business trip to service the machine of one of our clients about 120 miles from my house, it was supposed to be a two-day job, so I rented a hotel close to the client location. The service job went faster than I expected, and I was able to complete my task in a day, instead of spending the night at the hotel and traveling the next day I decided to drive back home. I called my wife, but she wasn’t picking up, so I thought she was busy with the kids or something. So, I checked out of the hotel and drove back home. I spent almost 3 hours driving back home, about 5 minute before I got home I realized that my wife hadn’t called me back so I called her again, it rang a couple times before she answered, she sounded like she was out of breath and I knew something was off, she sounded surprised when I told her that am coming home and she immediately hanged up, my spiders sense was up, I had it in the back of my mind that she was cheating on me at a guys house, but not until I got to my driveway and saw a strange car driving away from my driveway did I suspect that she had someone in my house. I rushed into the house, the front door was unlocked, and I immediately knew the strange car must be a guy getting away from my house, I rushed into my bedroom as my wife greeted me at the front door of the bedroom, her hair was messed up and she had a bathroom robe on, she kind of stood in my way as if to distract me from entering the room, asking me why I was home early, I shrugged her aside, upon my entry I examined the bedroom and bathroom. Found used condoms, the bedroom stunk. The bed was unmade, At this point I didn’t need her to confess, she saw the look on my face and immediately said, “I can explain”. I asked her where the kids were, and she told me that she dropped them off at her friend’s house.

At that moment I couldn’t believe that she cheated on me again, she sent my kids away so she could bang a guy in my bed, I have enough self-respect this time to not fall for her crying, she is a tramp and a manipulative one, I told her that I was getting a divorce and that she doesn’t need to explain anything, she kept saying that she was sorry and wouldn’t do it again.

D-day was two weeks ago, and I have already served her divorce papers. I have proof of her infidelity and that she is an unfit mother so she can’t turn that around on me, I plan to use that against her to gain full custody of my kids because she is truly an unfit mother. I still can’t believe that I nurse this woman through cheating on me, I should have been the one that was being nurse but somehow she turned it around on me and because I was insecure as a man I didn’t realize it.

Exiting the COVID-19 Epidemic: Possible Stepping Stones?,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/pvr3bb/exiting_the_covid19_epidemic_possible_stepping/,AdministrativeRub235,1,2021-09-26 18:13:17,71,/r/singapore/comments/pvr3bb/exiting_the_covid19_epidemic_possible_stepping/,Serious Discussion,"At the end of June, the co-chairs of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce laid out a road map for Singapore to ""live normally with \[Covid-19\] in our midst"". \[1\] This road map hinged on 4 key components: vaccination, testing, treatment and social responsibility. 

In it, they set out the goal of having ""at least two-thirds of our population fully vaccinated with two doses around National Day"", a target which has since been met and exceeded. 

Furthermore, they explained that going forward, ""testing will be less of a tool for ring-fencing and quarantining people exposed to infected persons. Instead, it would be to ensure that events, social activities and overseas trips can take place safely; as well as to reduce transmission risks, especially to those who are vulnerable to infections."". This has also been done, via a mass rollout of easily-available and affordable ART tests, which allow Singaporeans to self-test for the coronavirus without needing to approach medical professionals.

However, in the months since then, Singapore has been in a ""one step forward, one step back"" situation, with short-lived steps to reopen society being followed by ""temporary"" tightening of restrictions. The most recent round of tightened restrictions has been justified on the grounds that a '  rapid rise in COVID-19 cases is “of concern” and putting ""serious strain"" on hospital resources', and that ""Singapore has to take action to slow the rise in cases to protect the hospital system"". \[2\] With 82% of our population being vaccinated, and 97.9% of all cases over the past 28 days being mild or asymptomatic \[3\], this apparent inability of our healthcare system to cope with the heightened case load points to deeper-rooted systemic issues, possibly created by deliberate policy choices as well as pre-existing resource constraints, rather than simply being a result of the epidemic.

Nevertheless, the point of this post is not simply to point out the backsliding in the Government's reopening plans or to attribute blame to different actors. Rather, I hope to examine the Government's rationale for its decision, and to discuss some ideas may contribute to creating conditions for Singapore to return to normal life in a less haphazard manner than we are now experiencing.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Main Objectives**

The Government's approach to reopening Singapore appears to be guided by 3 main objectives:

* Minimise deaths from Covid-19 \[4\], which also requires it to
* Protect the healthcare system from being overwhelmed by a rapid surge in hospitalisations and ICU usage, while
* Within the above 2 constraints, pressing on with reopening the economy and society as soon as possible, a commitment which the Finance Minister reiterated on Friday \[5\]

The question is, what is the most efficient way of achieving this? Is the Government's current approach  one which is designed to give us the best chance of success, given what we know about the virus?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Covid-19 Disproportionately Affects Older People**

While Covid-19 is still poorly-understood in many ways, one aspect has been consistent: this is a disease which disproportionately affects those with co-morbidities, particularly the elderly.

**The CDC has estimated that those in the 65-74 age range are at least 3 times, those in the 75-84 age range at least 7 times, and those in the 85+ age range at least 19 times, as likely as those aged 64 and below, to die of Covid-19. \[6\]**

**In Singapore, after the vaccine rollout, those aged 60 and above routinely account for 20-25% of cases, but \~80% of those on oxygen supplementation and of those in intensive care. \[7\] They thus represent a disproportionate fraction of the load on the healthcare system, and bear the brunt of severe illness and death.**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Do We Actually Know What We're Doing?**

Given Covid's concentrated impact on certain vulnerable populations with known characteristics, especially the elderly, do the measures announced recently make sense in light of that?

To be sure, by adopting work-from-home as the default, keeping children out of school and preschool, and further restricting social activities such as dining-in, we would expect to reduce spread in the wider community. This would doubtless reduce the chance of elderly and vulnerable people being exposed to Covid, whether at home (by their family members) or in the course of their daily activities outside the home (including essential activities like grocery shopping), since there are fewer vectors of infection around.

**However, when we inevitably relax these measures, the spread of Covid will resume, infecting the same number of people in the end. If the elderly and other known vulnerable populations do not continue to be the focus of ongoing protection, they will ultimately remain just as exposed to the virus as ever before.** And as more elderly and other vulnerable people get infected over the course of reopening, the number of deaths and hospitalisations will surge yet again, leading to renewed political pressure for a return to lockdowns and restrictions, and, depending on the state of the healthcare system, the prospect of overwhelmed hospitals yet again.

**In addition, even under current restrictions, a large number of elderly and vulnerable people continue to be exposed to the risk of infection. The work-from-home as a default mandate only applies to employees in roles where remote work is possible. \[8\] Often, elderly and vulnerable people work in frontline, people-facing roles which cannot be performed remotely, such as hawkers, market vendors, janitors, security guards, and taxi drivers.**

**Furthermore, some of the recent policies we have adopted, even as we have tightened measures, may have the unforeseen and perverse impact of increasing exposure to infection particularly among the elderly. For example:**

* **Under the new Home Recovery protocol, a person who is known to be infected can be sent home even if they are living with family members who are up to 80 years old. It is not specified if these family members must be vaccinated.** Furthermore, the protection offered by the vaccines against severe illness may wane slightly faster among elderly people than among younger people. \[9\] In addition, vaccine protection against symptomatic infection wanes even more rapidly, and **even if the infection merely produced mild symptoms, the precautionary approach that Singapore is taking in requiring people aged 70 and above to be admitted to healthcare facilities for observation and possible early treatment will still take up more healthcare resources, than if the index case in the household had been separated and quarantined in a community facility to begin with. Is this a case of being penny-wise, pound-foolish?**
* While stopping short of closing kindergartens and preschools, the Government has urged parents to keep their children at home, and has forbidden them from entering those premises with their children should their children continue attending. Might this inadvertently encourage working parents in dual-income households to turn to elderly grandparents as alternative caregivers? If the grandparents are living in separate households, this may end up leading to twice-daily, unmasked interaction that would not previously have occurred between the parents, the children and the grandparents, most likely without prior testing. This is especially risky if the parents are working in people-facing roles. \[10\] That said, the mandatory Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime for workers in such sectors should go some way to mitigating this risk, although there may be some loopholes (eg. vaccinated teachers and school staff).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Is Flatter Always Better?**

**Thus far, we have aimed to ""flatten the curve"" by tightening measures. The intention of this approach is to lower the peak of infections (and hospitalisations) and spread them out over a longer time, ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed and that care quality is not compromised for either Covid or non-Covid conditions.**

Unlike countries like the United Kingdom or Sweden that have opened up much more rapidly than Singapore and still seen falling or stable cases, hospitalisations and deaths, there is extremely very little natural immunity, induced by past infections, in the Singapore population.

While the vaccines produce confer strong protection against severe illness and death, their efficacy in preventing infection altogether wanes rather rapidly \[9\], leading to ""breakthrough infections"". Even though symptoms are often mild in such cases, they have a similar viral load to unvaccinated patients and are still very much capable of transmitting the virus to others. \[11\]

On the other hand, natural immunity from previous infection has been found to be much more robust in preventing re-infection (13 times as effective) and symptoms (27 times as effective), than vaccine-induced is in preventing infection and symptoms. \[12\] It has also been speculated that it may help to protect against future variants more effectively than solely relying on the current vaccines.

When enough people have established robust immunity against the virus and are no longer likely to be infected, or to transmit it onwards to others, we would have reached herd immunity. At that point, the virus is said to be endemic - cases are kept at a low, sustainable equilibrium in the community without resorting to extremely intrusive control measures, and without leading to major outbreaks (since clusters cannot grow where we have enough immune people breaking the chain of transmission). In that end-state,

&gt;**People who are more at risk may participate** **\[in normal social and economic activities\]** **if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity**. \[13\]

**If we resort too readily to measures that suppress transmission in the community to extremely low levels, or try to ""flatten the curve"" over too long a period of time, we also necessarily prolonging the time it takes for herd immunity to be achieved and the epidemic to become endemic. The specific time this takes depends on the percentage of the population that is required to have natural immunity, to be sufficient for ""herd immunity"".**

**That may also leave us more exposed to future variants that are able to evade our existing vaccines more effectively than Delta (although this appears unlikely to arise).**

**At the same time, as long as the transmission in the community remains widespread (a scenario which the Government accepts as likely in the near future, even if we retain many of the existing measures \[5\]), the vulnerable continue to be exposed to a high level of risk that is mitigated, on an individual level, only by being vaccinated and taking extensive personal precautions.** 

**Ultimately, however, the overall level of community spread that is acceptable in Singapore's context and that our healthcare system is capable of coping is, is a matter that only the Singapore Government possesses the expertise to decide.**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A Few Stepping Stones in the Dark**

Regardless of the approach that the Government eventually chooses to take, and whether it continues to pursue a policy of ""flattening the curve"" by resorting to tighter, broad-based restrictions that affect all of society, **I believe that there are some sensible measures it can take that would be helpful in reducing deaths and relieving the burden on the hospital system. These aim to be robust to the overall level of spread in the community (i.e. they would be sustainable, politically-viable, and would contribute to the stated goals regardless of whether the daily number of new infections is high or low.). However, they are no substitute for an overarching strategy that is coherent and well thought-out.**

**Protecting the Vulnerable:**

* In addition to (or possibly instead of) testing extensively across broad business sectors, the Government could require an **enhanced regime of regular ART testing in workplaces where there are elderly workers or those with other high-risk factors employed**, to prevent outbreaks in these settings
* Where it is feasible, the Government should **require work-from-home to continue to be the default for all workers who are at higher risk of death or severe illness** from Covid
* Similarly, **workers with elderly or otherwise vulnerable family members should be permitted to work-from-home if possible. If not, they should undergo an enhanced of regular ART (perhaps twice-weekly) testing** themselves, so that they do not unknowingly carry the infection back to their family members
* A similar testing regime can be adopted for schoolgoing children who live with elderly or high-risk family members, to enable them to continue participating actively in class and CCA activities with minimal risk of transmission to their family members
* **Extremely frequent (twice-weekly) ART testing should also be required among those working in settings that tend to be frequented by elderly people**, such as hawker centres, coffeeshops, supermarkets and wet markets
* **Other measures to minimise transmission in such settings, particularly improved ventilation and stepped-up enforcement of safe distancing measures, should also be studied and implemented**
* The criteria for Home Recovery could be relaxed in some aspects, and tightened in others. **Younger and healthy patients with mild symptoms, even if unvaccinated, should be allowed to recover at home. More bed spaces in centralised facilities should instead be directed to infected people who live in the same home with, for example, family members who are aged between 65 and 80**. In the latter case, Home Recovery should probably not be an option
* **Where elderly people live alone or in separate households, those visiting them should be encouraged to perform an ART self-test before every visit**

**Relieving the Burden on Healthcare:**

* **To prevent shortages of healthcare workers and ancillary staff, quarantine requirements for these individuals should be relaxed**. Instead of quarantining them upon exposure to a Covid case, a test-to-stay protocol should be adopted that allows them to stay on the job as long as they test negative on daily ART tests that they will continue to take for several days after exposure
* To minimise the stress and anxiety faced by healthcare workers who are at higher risk of getting infected and transmitting it to their loved ones, **those with young children, elderly or other high-risk family members at home should be provided with alternative accommodation**. This could include dedicated hotel rooms, or makeshift accommodation with amenities like toilets and air conditioning. **The aim of this is to provide reassurance and allow them to perform their jobs with greater peace of mind.**
* **The current treatment protocols for Covid-19 state that doctors should ""consider"" administering monoclonal antibodies to infected individuals who are in a high-risk category**, but who only have mild symptoms and have been symptomatic for less than 10 days. **The main benefit of these treatments is to prevent deterioration and reduce, to a large extent, the need for hospitalisation** \- they are no longer very effective once a patient requires oxygen therapy. \[14\] **If there are adequate supplies, these treatments should be recommended as part of the protocol for every patient who falls within the stipulated risk categories, rather than simply being ""considered"". If there are inadequate supplies, it should be a priority to secure more of them, while further clarifying the criteria for eligiblity.** Furthermore, the treatment protocol requires that these treatments be administered only as part of a hospital-based monitoring programme. However, in the United States, **this treatment has been rolled out on a large scale in outpatient settings, requiring only a referral from a GP.** \[15\] **We should consider if it is feasible to do the same in Singapore for patients undergoing home recovery, or even simply to allow it to be administered in non-hospital community care facilities.** This is especially convenient since some of these treatments can be administered with a simple injection, without requiring an IV infusion. \[16\]

**Providing Reassurance to the Public:**

Governments all around the world played their part in presenting Covid-19 as an existential threat on a societal level, and as a severe threat to individual health.

&gt;A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by the low death rate in their demographic group...  
&gt;  
&gt;**The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The United Kingdom's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, 22 March 2020 \[17\]

While this effort has been wildly successful in Singapore as worldwide, the unintended consequence of this is that it has now made it difficult for large parts of the public to accept the reality that Covid-19 is here to stay, and reduced the degree to which the Government is able to secure broad buy-in for its goal of endemicity. **Instead, rising case levels are met by irresistible political pressure for a return to a strategy of suppressing, or even attempting to eradicate, the virus.**

**In addition, the fear created by the Government and the media over Covid-19 has also directly impacted the healthcare system. This can be seen in how**

&gt;**some of Singapore's public hospitals are experiencing a surge in the number of patients who have rushed to their accident and emergency departments with mild acute respiratory infection symptoms. \[18\]**

**The Government must always bear in mind that ""Social"" and ""Psychological"" defence are essential pillars of Total Defence, and should be mindful that its messaging, and the public perception it is creating, does not undermine these aims.** 

**In roping in the Singapore Armed Forces to man its hotlines, and by improving its communications protocols for dealing with infected patients, the Government has already gone some way to addressing the effects of public panic.**

**However, in the longer term, more must be done to reassure the public about the stability of the healthcare system, and the credibility of public health leadership and public health strategies.**

The Government should:

* **Aim to provide clear, easily-understandable and well-evidenced information about the disease and other related topics.** For example, a specialised microsite can be created to discuss claims and findings about the reported effects and prevalence of ""long Covid"", or of vaccine-related adverse events, in a transparent, accurate and non-judgmental manner. 
* **Set up a specialised communications ""War Room"" to respond to false, misleading or flawed claims that spread fear and panic.** For example, when studies are reported that present data in an out-of-context manner (eg. the prevalence of vaccine-related blood clots in the brain), these findings should be responded to quickly, with a clear and forthright discussion of the flaws in these studies and what the takeaways from them should be.
* **Communicate honestly about what different interventions can and cannot do. For example, by stressing the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe illness and death, rather than their (somewhat disappointing) role in reducing transmission. Similarly, the Government should make it clear the limits of mask-wearing as an infection control measure, and stress that it is not anywhere as protecting oneself as getting vaccinated.**

# Above all else, the Government cannot expect to secure broad public buy-in for its pandemic exit strategy, if it is seen not to have a strategy at all to begin with. 

**Unfortunately, the Government's recent actions have contributed to the impression that either the Government does not have a strategy, or it has too many strategies and is having trouble deciding between them.**

**This state of affairs must be resolved as soon as possible, to prevent a further erosion in public trust that may well have deleterious implications for Singaporean society's capacity to withstand future public health or other societal crises.**

I was recently promoted to senior accountant. I have about 7 years accounting experience in industry. 3 years with my current company.

We were told the controller put in their two weeks notice today, and that they hired a professional recruiter to fill that position.

Should I make my case to take over the controller position? It would certainly a lot more responsibility to take over that role- there are a lot of details to keep track of. Would have to learn the reporting process in more depth and take on a broader role in the overall business. I also have not had formal management experience.

However, I do know the operations of this company very well after three years here. There will be a learning curve with even an experienced controller stepping in.

Just hoping to get some advice and perspective on how to approach this situation. I was expecting to have a few more years to prepare to take over this role."

According to the Token Terminal tracking tool, this month alone, Solana has reached $74 billion in monthly fully-diluted market cap and received over $3.1 million of total revenue compared to $28.6 billion and $1.2 million of respective results from August 2021.   


From this point, thanks to the Avalanche Rush programme, and onboarding DeFi giants like Aave and Curve Finance, Avalanche’s growth seems even more impressive with over $40 billion in fully-diluted market cap and revenue of $4.2 million in September, especially if comparing this data to $19.9 billion and $2.5 million from August.   


September was going to be the month of Cardano, when the Input Output Hong Kong were actively announcing the launch of the Alonzo hard fork on September 12. Cardano’s graph from September 2021 shows over $113.2 billion in fully-diluted market cap and total revenue surpassing $1.2 million for the first time since its launch. To compare, these numbers were much more humble in August with $92.19 billion and $822.4 thousand, respectively.

My current position: $TYO FEB 18 2022 $8c entered at .8  

&amp;#x200B;

Here is why I am right:  JPOW and the fed are talking about tapering. And as the fed continues to talk about tapering... banks get nervous and start to raise rates ( Already happening) ([https://tulsaworld.com/business/investment/personal-finance/mortgage-rates-move-higher-again-september-27-2021/article\_17e0a1b9-4b1a-5da8-8add-6cdde360da00.html](https://tulsaworld.com/business/investment/personal-finance/mortgage-rates-move-higher-again-september-27-2021/article_17e0a1b9-4b1a-5da8-8add-6cdde360da00.html)). Why? (almost all of you might ask) ... well, they do this because our boy Jpow is saying that he wont be buying up all the MBS (mortgage backed securities) that the banks have been shitting out the past year at low interest rates. Instead Jpow is slowly going to stop buying MBS blindly and will slowly start buying only those that are most attractive. (higher rates). As rates rise, (the cost of the bond is actually what is falling to cause this) Inverse Bonds go UP.

&amp;#x200B;

Counter Argument 1 : The fed has never successfully tapered, its just a theory. 

My answer: Yeah I know but this time its either taper or hyper inflation. (that's why I hedge this bet with things that go up during inflation but not down when interest goes up. AKA banks.) 

Counter Argument 2:  But as rates rise, stocks go down (pshh yea right), and then institutions pull out of stocks and buy into bonds which then causes downward pressure on interest rates. 

My answer: Yeah, this can happen, likely will, but interest rates will still go up... nobody will buy bonds at rates at 0-3% when inflation is 4% aside from that animal Jpow. (institutions will probably buy the 30yr 3%, (leading to an inverted yield curve) or gold, or Kypto or some other shit as stocks go down and 10 yr rates wait to hit 3%).  So that still leaves us with a runway from 0% to 3% or like 1000% gain in other words. 

&amp;#x200B;

final remark: I'd truly like to hear what you all think about this... how its going to play out. Will the fed actual tape this time?"

Today, my guest on Wealth Formula podcast, well, a lot of people probably already know him. He's got one of the biggest podcasts in the personal financial space investment space. MC Laubscher, aka the Cash Flow Ninja himself, who is also a friend and a really good guy. MC, welcome back to Wealth Formula podcast.

**MC:** Thank you so much for having me Buck, right, to connect again.

**Buck:** Yeah, man. So for people who don't know you, I just want to kind of get a little bit of a background. So who's MC Laubscher? That accent that you're not from Texas, right?

**MC:** It's not a Pennsylvania one. So I'm originally from South Africa, and I actually came to the US 20 years ago. It's, wow, time flies when you're having fun. My wife and I just realized that the other day we were chatting and she's like, when did you come again? I said, 2001, and I'm like, wow, that's 20 years, but I grew up in South Africa. Born and raised over there and after University sort of traveling a little bit around the world. I played sports at a pretty high level, had a College scholarship and a full ride in College for rugby. So I traveled quite a bit. And I ended up in the United States, and I ended up playing in a League here and ended up being part of the men's national squad for a couple of years in the United States. And Besides the sports, one of the things that really struck me when I came to the United States and having traveled quite a bit was just, you know, I was just blown away by the upward mobility available to anyone that's willing to work their butt off in the US, right? It just blew me away. And I was pretty excited to see what I can build and what I can produce over here. While I was traveling for sports, a lot of guys who picked up habits, not necessarily good habits. But there's a lot of downtime for guys when you're traveling and flying and so forth. So some guys plugged into video games, other guys plugged into other stuff. I picked up some books and started reading on economics and finance and came across a book that many of your listeners and viewers will be familiar with. So Robert Kiyosaki, and I kind of went down the rabbit hole and took action right away. I bought my first property. This is now 20 years ago, too. And, you know, that opened the doors for me for cash flow investing because I really just had this light bulb moment after I bought my first property. It was a single family condominium at that stage. And after I paid all the bills associated with that. there was money left over, and I'm like, wait a second. Oh, yeah, there is cash. How many times can I do this? How many properties can I buy? So then it really started that cash flow journey for me. And I really just pursued cash flow investing since then, right up to about almost six years ago. I started the Cashflow Ninja Podcast to accelerate my learning curve. I figured if I speak to the best in business and investing once a week, this is going to accelerate my learning. And I'm going to pick up new things, which it definitely has. And, you know, I started that show five, six years ago, and now we've been listening to and downloaded in 180 countries and millions of downloads around the world. And it's turned into an educational platform, which we built out significantly over the past year. And then I'm also invested in a lot of other different businesses and investments and so forth. So, yeah, it's been a fun ride.

**Buck:** A couple of things that you say really stick out to me. One is the idea of upward mobility. And I'm always shocked when you hear from people who've been in the US for a long time about how there's a lack of upward mobility. But when you compare it to other countries, there is no other country like the US. I mean, I'm one generation from a poor family in the Third World, right? Not enough to eat. And here I am doing a personal finance podcast talking about people making millions of dollars and stuff like that. It's just insane. I'm glad you talked about that. The other thing that occurs to me is I think you were on a couple of years ago. It's been a little bit of time, but just hearing about how much you've done, even in that short period of time, it goes back to that idea that people grossly overestimate what they can do in a year and grossly underestimate what they can do in three, four or five years. It's just so good for you on that part. I want to talk to you a little bit about, obviously, your podcast. First, I want to ask you in terms of the podcast, when you started versus now, how long has it been?

**MC:** Almost six years.

**Buck:** Six years. So it's a lot. What have you, in your own sort of philosophy, you and I have talked offline about how mine has changed since taking the purple pill. How has yours morphed during that period of time, as you've talked to a lot of successful investors and sort of changed your own philosophy. How has that morphed?

**MC:** Yeah. It's a great question. And I just want to touch on one thing that you mentioned, too. You know, it's quite incredible. Sometimes when I speak to folks in the United States and I see their response when I talk about upward mobility and I literally, you won a lottery ticket by being born there as opposed to everywhere else, because there's such an abundance of opportunities. And then from the podcast, too. You know, the Podcast is kind of growing significantly because essentially, you know, I love learning, and I'm a student, and I'm doing that too. And I'm still learning. But I'm also starting to teach more and more and more and stepping into that role, which has been a lot of fun, because when you teach something, really, I mean, that's when you actually learn right and you learn even the topic and the subject matter even better and get to understand it, and it increases your understanding. So that's been a lot of fun. And you've heard the cliche or you've heard people say, if you want to understand something teaches and it definitely definitely rings true. But yeah, I went pretty broad with it, and went pretty broad with business. Real estate, commodities, cryptocurrencies and blockchain investing paper assets and so forth. And we've stayed pretty broad and we've talked about different trains and so forth. But, yeah, we have spent a lot of time focusing on specific niches where there's opportunities now, real estate obviously being one of them and so forth. But it's been a lot of fun. I continue to learn. I continue to pick up something every single time I speak with someone. Yeah, it's been an incredible ride. And also, as you said, I couldn't have my wildest imagination of thoughts five, six years into it. It's grown into what it is, and it's just doing something consistently over and over. I still reflect back and I smile at it. Six months into this, you're like it's only my mom and my sister listening.

**Buck:** Oh, yeah. I had to actually quit my podcast after the first few episodes for a year because I was like, Why am I doing it as no one's listening? This is silly. Then I took it back up. Luckily. But during that time, though, like, give me one thing that you used to think. But now you don't think that that's the case and you think totally differently. I'm putting you on the spot because that's a tough one. Right? But what did you used to think that you think differently about now because of this journey?

**MC:**  I used to have a mindset of having to think that I have to figure everything out myself and know that I know everything about a specific topic matter. And what I came to realize is, look, I need to have a certain level of understanding and a certain level of competency. But then I only have to partner with the best person and or have team members to fill in the rest so I can focus on my skill set in my capabilities and bring in the other folks we always earned. And in sports that I played, they were always like, well, you have to focus on your weaknesses. Well, essentially, that was kind of the mindset that I had with the show and just in my business and in the other investments, too. It's like, no, no, no. I need to focus on what I'm good at because that's gonna be a multiplier for me. And then I need to partner with a relationship that has complementary skill setting capabilities. And that'll be another multiplier. So I always talked about, you know, my Lane because people are like, MC, you're involved in so many things. What's your lane, right? You can't possibly have all these lanes. You're human. You're not a robot. And I said, no, my lane is people. People are what I'm focusing on and investing in people. And I've vet people because I know if I can find the cash flow Ninja in the space that is an absolute monster in the state that you or she is in, and I can partner with them, I know that. Then I can capitalize on opportunities in that space. So I don't need to be the person that has every single thing down. But I need to have a certain level of understanding, a certain knowledge base, and then I can find the best folks to do that.

**Buck:** Yeah, I'm with you there. It's all about finding the right people. And this whole business is certainly in the real asset space is really about, you know, operations, and it's about the people. Mcdonald's doesn't make the best burger. I happen to like McDonald's a lot, but it's hard to argue that they are the best burger in the world. But yet they are the best selling burger. And there's a reason for that. It's because it's the best run company in that space. You have a book coming out. Tell us a little bit about the book.

**MC:** So the book is called the 21 Best Cash Flow Niches, and this will be available October 1. But essentially, the question that I get asked more than any other question. Besides, where I'm from, when I hear my voice is MC, you've interviewed over 700 people on your show. You have had folks talking about different businesses and commodities and paper assets and real estate, all these different niches in real estate and blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. And this kept coming up over and over and over. So I figured, you know what? I think I'm going to go ahead and put it all together in a book for folks to share the 21 Best Cash Flow Niches and also throw in some bonus niches in there because it was tough to narrow it down. And I have to overdeliver, of course. But, yeah, it's been a lot of fun. It's been a lot of fun actually reflecting because I work through you go back through your library of all the interviews that you've done and all the interesting folks that you've had on, and you revisit all of that. But it's been a lot of fun doing it. A book is a different thing, you know? I know you've been down that road. It's a different animal. So if you give me a microphone or tell me to speak somewhere, I can do that. But a book is a different animal.

**Buck:** So let's kind of drill down on that. All right. So we're not going to give them all away here. All right. Give me a few that we might not think about and why you think they're good opportunities.

**MC:** You know, there's a couple of ones that play into trains now that's pretty interesting. So yeah, of course, there's going to be certain businesses and there are certain real estate, different types of real estate in there. There's two asset classes that you know very well in their multifamily real estate and also self storage. But there's some interesting niches where if you think about it, that plays into big trends. So I'll give an example, one of the asset classes that I cover in their cell tower investments. That's a very interesting business. And if you think about it, we all know when we're not near a cell tower or we're running out of reception, and then the next thing becomes, we never think about it as a cash flow potential opportunity or a business. But essentially, there's so much growth in that industry. There's a significant amount of development going into cell phone tower infrastructure, and there's a massive business opportunity because of this, we've driven around them. We've seen them. It's real estate that has a cell phone tower on it. There's tenants of that cell phone tower. They're usually carriers with pretty big bank accounts. So it's secured by good, solid carriers. So there's a huge opportunity to either develop a cell phone tower, project yourself, sign the carriers up the leases of your tenants, and then sell it to a group of investors for the cash flow. So there's folks that do that. And then there's a group of investors that can actually buy that cell phone tower and then collect the cash flow from it. I thought it was pretty interesting and especially, I mean, as we're going from 4G into 5G and the Internet of things and so forth, you're just going to see more and more of those opportunities. So I found that that was a very, very interesting one. One thing that's very interesting, too. And it's playing into another trend is agriculture and the niches within agriculture. We all think of farmland, food, livestock. But there's also some great niches within that. So, for example, timber and tie is an investment that I found pretty interesting. It caught my attention. And then I looked into this and then I'm like, Wait, wait a sec. Wow. Like Ted Turner. And it's like, how many acres of teak? The Harvard Endowment. Now these are like mega money management teams. They're invested in this. What am I missing something here? It stabilizes these portfolios pretty well. Again, it's not sexy. It's not a great cocktail party conversation to say that I've got a bunch of land with trees on them.

**Buck:** But it's better than saying you own a bunch of ugly apartments.

**MC:** Yeah. But the last time I checked, even if there's an economy that crashes, if there's a pandemic, trees still grow. So it was very interesting to learn more about that investment and different investments in agriculture. And obviously doing research for the book, you start to see the numbers of the demand that they will be for certain niches, even with agriculture. I think Jim Rogers is pretty famous for talking about that and the opportunity that will have four investors in the next coming year. So that was very, very interesting stuff. Obviously, music royalties is also very interesting. That was a very interesting topic where if you think about it, every time you hear a song plays, somebody's getting paid. And it was interesting to learn more about that business, too. You know, it might be a partial royalty on a song. It might be full royalty. It might be one song out of an album. Michael Jackson, for example, just his estate has been paid, like over a billion dollars just on royalties. So there was a fascinating, fascinating industry to learn about, too. There's a lot of interesting niches. I mean, one thing that I've learned, there's different niches, but you really realize there's so many ways to do this. There are folks, there's just so many different ways to build businesses to create wealth, to invest in different asset classes, right?

**Buck:** Yeah, for sure. And I'm curious along those lines because obviously my philosophy has been always about, or not always, but certainly in recent years, especially after maybe chasing some shiny objects, so to speak, that I'm going to keep it boring. How do you balance sort of having these different types of investments? And I don't know if you've invested in all these things or not. But for me, one of the most time consuming and difficult things is learning about a new area and then probably even harder than that, finding the right people and the teams and all that stuff. How do you balance it? What's your philosophy on that?

**MC:** That's a great question. And I've not invested in all of these. So I'm invested in some of them, and my philosophy is very similar to yours. Like I invest in things that I know and understand, and I immerse myself in them. So I'm invested in a couple of asset classes. Obviously, I'm invested in real estate, I'm invested in energy, I'm invested in commodities. I'm invested in crypto and blockchain, but also not just in the coins, in businesses, too. And maybe that's a good starting point. So one of the asset classes, obviously, I talked a little bit about crypto and blocks and technologies. So we've had conversations in the past, around 2016 or 2017. We were dabbling in it and getting involved with it. So one of the things that I really immersed myself in in the past 18 months, probably twelve months of it. I really, really, really immersed myself into it was the on blockchain, and it wasn't necessarily the coins, but it was more of the industry, the businesses that are being built in the industry. So I did the same thing where I found the top people in the industry. I studied everything that I could that they put out, whether it be books, whether it be bought cars, whether it be videos and so forth. Then I looked at other things that they offered, whether it be, you know, of course, which is an intellectual shortcut these days. One of the programs that I enrolled in, could I have learned everything, probably by myself and did I know some stuff of that already? Yes. But it probably would have taken me. But I could tap into that person's intellectual shortcut. So I joined a mastermind group, which I'm still in to learn. And why I wanted to do that was I wanted to again, sticking with the big piece, which is the nonsexy part is I wanted to implement a strategy similar to the California gold rush strategy during the California gold rush in 1849. And so the folks that really made fortunes wasn't necessarily the folks that panned for gold, but it was the folks selling the shovels and picks, the equipment and the clothes, the Levy Straus, the boots, the housing, the financial services like Wells Fargo and so forth. So I wanted to see, how do I do this in that space? And it was interesting to see that there's a lot of ways to do that already. And there's a certain type of approach as an vase store. There's obviously an approach as a speculator, which huge upside potential. But I wanted to learn more of that. So that's kind of my philosophy in my approach and how I approach these things is I have certain asset classes that I know, and I understand, and then I look for the best folks in them. But I really deep dive and immerse myself in an asset class if I'm going to invest in that asset clause, even though I'm partnering with someone, whether I'm putting up the capital or I'm bringing something else to the table, that's kind of all. I approach that. But yeah, because otherwise, like you mentioned earlier, the shiny object stuff. And the other thing that I would also say strategically, from a strategy point of view, is, what is it? What is the asset cost? What is it supposed to be doing, and why would you own it? I keep asking myself those questions, too. So I know exactly what it is, what it's supposed to do and why I would have it included in my strategy. We talk about apartments in there. It's apartments. It's affordable living for folks, right? It's not going to go away. People are still going to need a place to live. Five, ten, 15, 20 years from now, 100 years from now. The same thing with cell storage. People are going to need a place to park stuff. So a lot of these things I ask, why am I doing this? Why am I investing in this? What is it supposed to do? What does it do for me? And that's why, for example, I have real estate. But I also have some energy stuff because there's some tax advantages in that show. And when it comes to the crypto and the blockchain is like, what is it? Well, it's cryptocurrencies is blockchain technologies. Even the technology will roll into industries. It's very new. It's very volatile. It's very small. What is it supposed to be in my strategy? Well, as an investor, I can position myself where in businesses that eventually will provide a ton of value to cryptocurrency and blockchain investors, tax services, planning or acid protection. That kind of stuff. You're going to need all that stuff in that industry anyway, as it's growing and growing.

**Buck:** Yeah, that's great. So before I let you go, I want to obviously, you're pretty involved with digital currencies and stuff like that. I want to make sure I get your read on where we are in this market. How long is this Bull market going to go? What do you think is going to happen? Obviously, I can't predict the future, but you're probably more ingrained in this than by far, in a way more than I am. Tell us about your forecast for the digital currency market here.

**MC:** Yeah. It's an interesting time when there was the crypto winter. Some of the folks that I were talking to at that stage were just sharing with me the innovation that's coming in there. You think about the industries that the smartest folks are going into right now. They're going into biotech. They're going into crypto and blockchain. I mean, the smartest folks on the planet, because that's where all the innovation is. They're running into those industries. So I think you're going to keep seeing a ton of innovation in a lot of the projects. I think you're going to see a ton of new types of businesses being built. There are ancillary and complementary businesses to what's already developing in that ecosystem, whether it be the coins, whether it be the blockchain projects, whether it be decentralized finance. So that's only one element, for example, in that ecosystem. I think you're going to see a lot of businesses that are going to position themselves to figure out how they can plug in to, for example, the decentralized finance place and provide products and services to that. So I think you're going to see innovation, as I mentioned, with tax companies. There legal companies, trust and estate planning companies, insurance companies. You're going to see all those types of companies coming up. So there's going to be a lot of innovation in there from a price perspective. I think that yeah. I think that we still have a little bit of legs on this one. Of course, you know, buyer beware. It's a bumpy road in your soul. I think there's still a leg up on this one. If you look at, you know, the Bitcoin, which is kind of like the biggest of them. And if you look at what's going on there and how it is essentially coded to provide a certain amount of coins and a lot of folks are entering into it exciting stuff going on. Right. So you've got payment process is incorporating, but going into what they're currently doing, and we've got companies positioning capital reserves. I mean, I know you're smiling. I mean, the two of us were talking, did you ever imagine that happening? I mean, we thought it was gonna happen, right. But it's still like seeing it happening is kind of crazy. And then also you've got essentially a country that now I needed legal tender. El Salvador. Now other countries are interested, too. So from a price action perspective, it's going to be a roller coach to ride up and down sideways and so forth. But the ecosystem will grow. The adoption will grow because more and more folks are realizing and recognizing, especially in a time like today, globally, that Fiat currencies are being devalued in the workplace. So I was just speaking to someone the other day. That's from Bob with a friend of mine, and they have to validate their currencies and blew it up twice. Now I take hyperinflation basically twice. Right. So it's like if you're there, what are your options? Well, if you have access to a smartphone and you can plug into the worldwide web, you can buy some Bitcoin. So I think more and more people in those countries are going to realize it. So it's going to be interesting. There's a lot of exciting things there, but you have to understand your listeners, too. It's always important to understand when you're saving or when you're investing or when you're speculating. So know what you're doing when you're doing it. Don't think you're investing, but you're speculating and then all of a sudden, you know, right? I have a heart attack when you look at the price movement or action on your smartphone.

**Buck:** Yeah, that's the important part. I think you've said it a few times and I think it is a good point. If you're starting to have some sort of visceral reaction to the losses, probably you have too much exposure. So you just got to be careful and focus on that. Your asymmetric portfolio. It could add zeros to your net worth, or it could be gone. And you just have to know that that's what the deal is when you go in the first place, right. Listen, it's been really great talking to you. Tell us a little bit. Obviously, you can find the Cash Flow Ninja podcast everywhere, but tell us how we can tune in and some of your things that you got going and even find your new book.

**MC:** Oh, thank you. Yeah. CashflowNinja.com is where everything's at over 750 episodes now, podcast interviews there. And I've got two shows that's on there and all the tools and resources that we have on there in the book. You can find that at cashflowninja.com/21niches. That's two, one and then the word niches, and that will get you to the Amazon page. And if you buy the book on Amazon and you screenshot us just a copy of your receipt and send it over to us, we'll give you access to the audio book, a digital version of the book. I actually curated a ton of interviews of covering the niches. And then there's some bonus videos just covering the niches in there, too, for folks that are interested. That's cashflowninja.com/21niches.

**Buck:** You are a seriously high tech dude, man. I'm like, sort of the old man's podcast. I just pretty much had the audio and I went video and I thought it was a big deal, but this guy's got audio books. I got to take some lessons. I need a book on that. But hey, listen, MC is absolutely great seeing you again. Catching up. And let's do it again in the next year when you take over the world.

**MC:** Thanks for having me on. This has been a lot of fun, my friend.

**Buck:** We'll be right back."

# GameStop has always been the catalyst...

This is probably going to be a controversial post when I don't intend it to be (and it shouldn't be taken that way). My intentions are not to call anyone out or any specific event out. I write DD about GME and in my opinion, we have too many DD writers writing about things other than GME. I thought it would be a great exercise to look at the daily GME price information in relation to events that have happened in the GME timeline.  
My theory is that information coming from news.gamestop.com has been more impactful than anything else with regards to GameStop's stock price. In this theory, the overall impact on the price trends up with time as GameStop has only released good news. The other part to my theory is that other events we discuss in our sub are much impactful to the price long-term, but may have some small short term impacts.  
I will compare a couple groups of data, specifically the stock price on the day of the event:

* news.gamestop.com articles
* RC Ventures and DFV position events
* RC Tweets
* Negative/Other External Events - i.e. Mod Drama

I have also added a trend event to see what that looked like. The Reverse Repo Program is a great data set we can plot against GameStop

# Before we get into it, a ""how-to"" read the charts you'll see

You'll see various columns of data in the following tables: Stock Price at Close, Stock Price at Open, Day Difference, High and Low. The values are used to make a standard candle chart but Google Sheets draws solid candles as bullish candles and empty fill candles as bearish. I've outlined a brief explanation of the candles used in the charts below:

https://preview.redd.it/abh09kjc96q71.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dfc823e9a9a7cbf369aa9a349e68a93043d59d1

Now on to the data! I will be linking out the datasets to everything in the post that is open-sourced on GitHub.

# [news.gamestop.com Releases](https://github.com/stonksgraph/news.gamestop.com/blob/main/post.md#newsgamestopcom-releases)

I started back with 11/20/2021 for gathering articles from news.gamestop.com. Then I went into Yahoo Finance and grabbed the data for those specific dates (close, open, high, low). I dropped the data in Google Sheets and got a chart:

https://preview.redd.it/60kqs9mo96q71.png?width=1398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c71831f474ae455bc535f0911f95ee45b5bb6d3

It really does seem that the GameStop news has had a positive trend with the price over time. I have personally found the news during this timeframe to be overall very positive and directly in-line with what the company has communicated to investors. As each piece of good news comes out, it convinces a couple more investors that the digital transformation is going to be successful.

# [RC Tweets](https://github.com/stonksgraph/news.gamestop.com/blob/main/post.md#rc-tweets)

Some of RC tweets happened on days the market was closed, so you'll see a ""-"" in those lines for the price and it will create a gap in the chart.

# [Negative/Other Events](https://github.com/stonksgraph/news.gamestop.com/blob/main/post.md#negativeother-events)

I'm sure there could be a lot of data points added to this set, I just tried taking more known events and used them as examples. I defintely am not trying to say any of the DD posts in here are a waste of time or don't matter; that is not my intention. I personally believe these events just have less meaning than the news GameStop is releasing directly on their site.

# Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements Data

Shout out to u/pctracer for tracking this data. His first post on this topic (I think) was 5/17/2021 (can't source due to brigading). Since we have a continuous trend, we can pull the graphs and look at them next to each other:

https://preview.redd.it/zgkhg2laa6q71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c60490e2afdd4dabc5d9829e17db3419e956273a

# Looking at the data sets

**news.gamestop.com** \- We can definitely see a positive trend overtime with the price. You **SHOULD NOT** take this graph as some sort of ""cycle""; it may kinda look like that but there is no way of knowing when new posts will come up on news.gamestop.com and how the market will react to it. I suggest you take a moment to read through some of the titles in the table above and see how the story has progressed.  
**RC Ventures and DFV position events** \- It's hard to say here because there are so few events here. We all know about DFV's double down post which had an obvious movement on the price that day. Other than that, we see little here mainly because they both were early in the saga. I only used DFV's latest posts because he had so many regular posts and those 2 were the most popular.

**RC Tweets** \- There are definitely some really interesting data points here. You can see a downward trend in the start of July with RC's tweets, but overall the trend seems to look like an exponential curve that is plateauing. I mainly put this data set in because I thought people would want to see it, I did. RC tweets definitely have had some short term price movements

**Other Events** \- This chart just screams ""nothing"" to me. The two days with the largest spreads was when the buy button was turned off and the SS migration during the second sneeze. Each other event didn't have a lasting impact on the price and the events all hover around $200.

**Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Trend** \- These charts definitely don't look like they have any relation and us starting to talk about it didn't have any impact either. If this argument convinced others to invest in GameStop, we should see the price have some overall trend up. The mid-June spike does look to have a small jump in RRP which is interesting, but other spikes in RRP happen at the same time GME is trending downwards. I don't see consistency there.  
It really does look like a lot of the prominent events in the GameStop cycle have been distractions to the real digital transformation news GameStop has been putting out there. MSM always cries they haven't heard the story from GameStop, but I feel like GameStop has been telling us a lot for awhile and we've been too busy looking at distractions rather than GameStop itself.

# tl;dr: Reddit talking about GameStop's successful digital transformation is a SHF worst nightmare, they would rather us talk about literally ANYTHING else. We should be talking about GameStop's website, our purchases from GameStop, reviews we write for GameStop purchases, nft.gamestop.com updates, like anything GameStop.

**CALL TO ACTION** \- GameStop DD Authors should try to focus research on GameStop's thriving business. I don't have enough time and there are so many things that don't get covered from their digital story. 10K/Q analysis is always extremely light and I'm guilty of not getting enough time to post what I have sitting on my computer. Imagine what u/Criand 's thorough research could do in finding new details about GameStop; I know I would be super excited to see that!  
I'm not trying to say any of the past DD is a waste of time, but I do think news about GameStop's successful turn around is the most impactful thing any GameStop investor can add. The information from news.gamestop.com definitely has a better correlation with the overall increase in price and a good example data point in there is the nft.gamestop.com release which actually wasn't an official announcement, it was found and spread through Reddit. If more of this was found and called out, it could have a much bigger impact than we think. Instead we get caught up in Evergrande, Kenny flying planes, the market collapse, mod drama, Bill Gates is short GME, Bezos needs to be looked into, fidelity are shills, Computershare are shills, brokers are shills, u/digi-transformation is a shill, GameStop can't succeed until everything has been exposed and people are in jail! (*I laugh so hard when I see these comments*).  
If you don't believe me, just look at the posts from today. You'll find a ton of DD and other posts on Computershare (I stopped counting after 20), but I couldn't find any posts that were *actually* about GameStop. This is one reason I try to focus my time/research on the company itself.  
I call it all a distraction because it's all much simpler, it's just GameStop. We talk about GameStop doing awesome and hold the fantastic news up like a boombox. The media isn't covering GameStop, so we have to. You can't escape my boombox

https://preview.redd.it/9wntfp6ta6q71.jpg?width=1656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58f87f5b3bcbef4b0509868e362999320ce71139

I'm also going to start adding a disclaimer to the end of my DD in the sake of transparency (but remember, I'm just a dump ape).  
*digi-disclaimer: This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. I am an active investor in GameStop and share my research as I find it. I currently hold a large position of GameStop across Computershare, Fidelity and E-Trade; I also make a recurring investment twice a month in GameStop through Computershare and I have no plans on changing this recurring investment. You should perform your own due diligence before making any new (or changes to existing) investments*"

I'm sure there could be a lot of data points added to this set, I just tried taking more known events and used them as examples. I defintely am not trying to say any of the DD posts in here are a waste of time or don't matter; that is not my intention. I personally believe these events just have less meaning than the news GameStop is releasing directly on their site.

# Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements Data

Shout out to [u/pctracer](https://www.reddit.com/u/pctracer/) for tracking this data. His first post on this topic (I think) was 5/17/2021 (can't source due to brigading). Since we have a continuous trend, we can pull the graphs and look at them next to each other:

# Looking at the data sets

**news.gamestop.com** \- We can definitely see a positive trend overtime with the price. You **SHOULD NOT** take this graph as some sort of ""cycle""; it may kinda look like that but there is no way of knowing when new posts will come up on news.gamestop.com and how the market will react to it. I suggest you take a moment to read through some of the titles in the table above and see how the story has progressed.**RC Ventures and DFV position events** \- It's hard to say here because there are so few events here. We all know about DFV's double down post which had an obvious movement on the price that day. Other than that, we see little here mainly because they both were early in the saga. I only used DFV's latest posts because he had so many regular posts and those 2 were the most popular.

**RC Tweets** \- There are definitely some really interesting data points here. You can see a downward trend in the start of July with RC's tweets, but overall the trend seems to look like an exponential curve that is plateauing. I mainly put this data set in because I thought people would want to see it, I did. RC tweets definitely have had some short term price movements

**Other Events** \- This chart just screams ""nothing"" to me. The two days with the largest spreads was when the buy button was turned off and the SS migration during the second sneeze. Each other event didn't have a lasting impact on the price and the events all hover around $200.

**Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Trend** \- These charts definitely don't look like they have any relation and us starting to talk about it didn't have any impact either. If this argument convinced others to invest in GameStop, we should see the price have some overall trend up. The mid-June spike does look to have a small jump in RRP which is interesting, but other spikes in RRP happen at the same time GME is trending downwards. I don't see consistency there.

It really does look like a lot of the prominent events in the GameStop cycle have been distractions to the real digital transformation news GameStop has been putting out there. MSM always cries they haven't heard the story from GameStop, but I feel like GameStop has been telling us a lot for awhile and we've been too busy looking at distractions rather than GameStop itself.

# tl;dr: Reddit talking about GameStop's successful digital transformation is a SHF worst nightmare, they would rather us talk about literally ANYTHING else. We should be talking about GameStop's website, our purchases from GameStop, reviews we write for GameStop purchases, nft.gamestop.com updates, like anything GameStop.

**CALL TO ACTION** \- GameStop DD Authors should try to focus research on GameStop's thriving business. I don't have enough time and there are so many things that don't get covered from their digital story. 10K/Q analysis is always extremely light and I'm guilty of not getting enough time to post what I have sitting on my computer. Imagine what [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/) 's thorough research could do in finding new details about GameStop; I know I would be super excited to see that! Or what if [u/pctracer](https://www.reddit.com/u/pctracer/)'s daily RRP post was about GameStop's e-commerce SKU count?

I'm not trying to say any of the past DD is a waste of time, but I do think news about GameStop's successful turn around is the most impactful thing any GameStop investor can add. The information from news.gamestop.com definitely has a better correlation with the overall increase in price and a good example data point in there is the nft.gamestop.com release which actually wasn't an official announcement, it was found and spread through Reddit. If more of this was found and called out, it could have a much bigger impact than we think. Instead we get caught up in Evergrande, Kenny flying planes, the market collapse, mod drama, Bill Gates is short GME, Bezos needs to be looked into, fidelity are shills, Computershare are shills, brokers are shills, [u/digi-transformation](https://www.reddit.com/u/digi-transformation/) is a shill, GameStop can't succeed until everything has been exposed and people are in jail! (*I laugh so hard when I see these comments*).

If you don't believe me, just look at the posts from today. You'll find a ton of DD and other posts on Computershare (I stopped counting after 20), but I couldn't find any posts that were *actually* about GameStop.

This is one reason I try to focus my time/research on the company itself.I call it all a distraction because it's all much simpler, it's just GameStop. We talk about GameStop doing awesome and hold the fantastic news up like a boombox. The media isn't covering GameStop, so we have to. You can't escape my boombox:

I'm also going to start adding a disclaimer to the end of my DD in the sake of transparency (but remember, I'm just a dump ape).

*digi-disclaimer: This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. I am an active investor in GameStop and share my research as I find it. I currently hold a large position of GameStop across Computershare, Fidelity and E-Trade; I also make a recurring investment twice a month in GameStop through Computershare and I have no plans on changing this recurring investment. You should perform your own due diligence before making any new (or changes to existing) investments*"
