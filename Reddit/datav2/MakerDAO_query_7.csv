CreDA Introduces An Innovative Decentralized Credit System,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreDAOfficial/comments/obfcmq/creda_introduces_an_innovative_decentralized/,KarthikeyanOnline,1,2021-07-01 13:50:36,0,/r/CreDAOfficial/comments/obfcmq/creda_introduces_an_innovative_decentralized/,NaN,"CreDA Introduces An Innovative Decentralized Credit System

Decentralized Finance ecosystem is growing and numerous innovations are trickling in to solve the issues in traditional finance. Lending is an incredible functionality in DeFi that is being exploited by several protocols at the moment. One thing that is common in existing lending protocols is over-collateralization. Without a credit system, the DeFi world and its efficiencies will be limited solely to over-collateralization, which will reduce the level of innovations that will find their way into DeFi. 

The DeFi realm needs innovative solutions that makes it easy for people to transition from using traditional finance features to DeFi functionalities. Importance of a credit system can't be overemphasized in the lending world, meaning that the DeFi realm needs a decentralized credit scoring to promote better lending system.

Most DeFi protocols that offer lending features like MakerDAO, and AAVE, depend on over-collateralization ratios that are between 150% to 300%, in a bid to clamp down on the risk attached to borrowing and lending within the DeFi realm. Using this system allows lending protocols to ensure that crypto lenders are shielded from default and volatility since there is no credit check system in place. 

CreDA understands that over-collateralization will reduce the innovations that come within the ecosystem, and that is why it is creating a credit system to reduce the lending risks attached to crypto holders, while permitting developers to easily create lending protocols that offers unsecured loans in the DeFi world. CreDA will create a decentralized credit ecosystem that will analyze the creditworthiness of different users, while creating a credit insurance system to hedge the risks."

MakerDAO is a DAO based platform that contains $MKR and $DAI. $MKR and $DAI are two types of tokens in the ecosystem, where $MKR is the governance token and $DAI is the currency token. $MKR (and its holders) govern $DAI and its stability.

*$DAI is soft pegged to the USD. 1 $DAI is about 1 $USD. This value is maintained by the collaterals and $MKR token holders.*

A DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation where no central entity owns the ecosystem, nor governs it. It is governed in a decentralised way, both with the machine (automation) and humans (non-automation).

&gt;We had a [Introducing MakerDAO](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/introducing-makerdao-d9c) and [here](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/introducing-makerdao) and [FAQ](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/makerdao-faq)

# MakerDAO beyond Stable Coin Protocol

MakerDao is an alternative source of leverage; it is an alternative way to gain access to leverage for those who do not wish to custody assets with a centralised exchange. Borrowing from Maker could also be cheaper when stability fees are low.

Besides, any losses incurred by $DAI holders are backstopped implicitly by $MKR holders, who will be diluted in case the system as a whole becomes under-collateralised. This is a major advantage that Maker has versus other lending platforms on the market, where any losses are borne by the lender.

However, MakerDao has some disadvantages. The governance process can take some time before changes can happen. The Stability Fee and The DSR occur through voting instead of being algorithmically determined like in Compound. $DAI can trade away from the peg for sustained periods if governance does not react quickly enough.

There are risks in collateral prices falling too quickly for the system to liquidate in time. In these cases, the system can become under-collateralised, leading to losses for $MKR or $DAI holders (depending on whether $MKR holders are willing to assume losses). During periods when the price of collateral is falling rapidly, vault creators tend to rush to buy $DAI to close out their vault positions, leading to high $DAI prices relative to the peg. This also leads to a relatively weak peg, as I mentioned.

# How Maker Works

To understand the mechanism design behind MakerDAO, let’s first understand how the system works.

The smart contract uses crypto assets (e.g. $ETH) through collateralised debt positions (CDP), to create $DAI tokens. These $DAI tokens are thus backed by these on-chain collaterals ($ETH, $BAT). In MakerDAO, the ecosystem is always over-collateralised, so the value of the collateral is always greater than the debt.

&gt;What is a CDP? A digital asset that is added into the MakerDAO ecosystem. It holds collateral assets deposited by the user and permits the user to generate $DAI. Generating $DAI accrues debt. This debt can be paid anytime or when the owner wants to withdraw their collateral (CDP).

MakerDAO, the system, enables anyone to leverage digital assets (e.g. $ETH) to generate $DAI, the output. Then, like any other currencies, $DAI can be freely spent.

Another way to look at it is that new $DAI tokens are minted when a user stakes their digital assets ($ETH, $LINK, $USDC, $YFI) with MakerDAO’s smart contract. By staking digital assets, they can create $DAI.

# Tokens in Maker

MakerDAO uses a 2-token model in its ecosystem. This is because each token has a specific objective and function.

$DAI is the token with a money function, and it acts as a form of currency. It is a form of payment (via DeFi), store of value (1 $DAI = 1 USD) and unit of account (1 $DAI = 1 USD).

$DAI is also known as a “stable coin” because it is soft pegged to 1 USD. The value is backed by collaterals on-chain via CDP. It is completely decentralised; anyone who wants to own $DAI can buy it on the exchange or stake $ETH for $DAI.

$MKR is a token with a utility function, and it acts as a form of governance in the MakerDAO ecosystem. $MKR holders are part of the decentralised governance for $DAI. They are responsible for the decision-making process. They can vote and have a say on issues and proposals in the ecosystem. $MKR tokens are created or destroyed in accordance with price fluctuations of the $DAI coin in order to keep it as close to $1 USD as possible. $MKR has a value, and the value is determined by market forces, e.g. demand and supply of $MKR tokens."

&gt;What is a CDP? A digital asset that is added into the MakerDAO ecosystem. It holds collateral assets deposited by the user and permits the user to generate $DAI. Generating $DAI accrues debt. This debt can be paid anytime or when the owner wants to withdraw their collateral (CDP).

MakerDAO, the system, enables anyone to leverage digital assets (e.g. $ETH) to generate $DAI, the output. Then, like any other currencies, $DAI can be freely spent.

Another way to look at it is that new $DAI tokens are minted when a user stakes their digital assets ($ETH, $LINK, $USDC, $YFI) with MakerDAO’s smart contract. By staking digital assets, they can create $DAI.

# Tokens in Maker

MakerDAO uses a 2-token model in its ecosystem. This is because each token has a specific objective and function.

$DAI is the token with a money function, and it acts as a form of currency. It is a form of payment (via DeFi), store of value (1 $DAI = 1 USD) and unit of account (1 $DAI = 1 USD).

$DAI is also known as a “stable coin” because it is soft pegged to 1 USD. The value is backed by collaterals on-chain via CDP. It is completely decentralised; anyone who wants to own $DAI can buy it on the exchange or stake $ETH for $DAI.

$MKR is a token with a utility function, and it acts as a form of governance in the MakerDAO ecosystem. $MKR holders are part of the decentralised governance for $DAI. They are responsible for the decision-making process. They can vote and have a say on issues and proposals in the ecosystem. $MKR tokens are created or destroyed in accordance with price fluctuations of the $DAI coin in order to keep it as close to $1 USD as possible. $MKR has a value, and the value is determined by market forces, e.g. demand and supply of $MKR tokens."

MakerDAO is a DAO based platform that contains $MKR and $DAI. $MKR and $DAI are two types of tokens in the ecosystem, where $MKR is the governance token and $DAI is the currency token. $MKR (and its holders) govern $DAI and its stability.

*$DAI is soft pegged to the USD. 1 $DAI is about 1 $USD. This value is maintained by the collaterals and $MKR token holders.*

A DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation where no central entity owns the ecosystem, nor governs it. It is governed in a decentralised way, both with the machine (automation) and humans (non-automation).

# MakerDAO beyond Stable Coin Protocol

MakerDao is an alternative source of leverage; it is an alternative way to gain access to leverage for those who do not wish to custody assets with a centralised exchange. Borrowing from Maker could also be cheaper when stability fees are low.

Besides, any losses incurred by $DAI holders are backstopped implicitly by $MKR holders, who will be diluted in case the system as a whole becomes under-collateralised. This is a major advantage that Maker has versus other lending platforms on the market, where any losses are borne by the lender.

However, MakerDao has some disadvantages. The governance process can take some time before changes can happen. The Stability Fee and The DSR occur through voting instead of being algorithmically determined like in Compound. $DAI can trade away from the peg for sustained periods if governance does not react quickly enough.

There are risks in collateral prices falling too quickly for the system to liquidate in time. In these cases, the system can become under-collateralised, leading to losses for $MKR or $DAI holders (depending on whether $MKR holders are willing to assume losses). During periods when the price of collateral is falling rapidly, vault creators tend to rush to buy $DAI to close out their vault positions, leading to high $DAI prices relative to the peg. This also leads to a relatively weak peg, as I mentioned.

This is a summary of an [article](https://1729.com/daos) written by Theodor Marcu on 1729.com

**DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization**

* As of June 2021, over $1 billion has been committed towards DAOs
* Smart contracts and blockchains organize DAOs, allowing collective participation in the funding and production of community goods

**Okay...So what are they?**

* DAOs can be thought of as “internet-native constitutions”
* Traditional corporations have a set of fundamental rules/principles that establish organization and determine governance within
* DAOs have the same thing, except it is encoded in smart contracts and blockchains
   * This is what makes them autonomous → if given an input, the DAO(a smart contract) outputs something
* This automation allows for greater decentralization, as there is no one person with decision-making capabilities
* Decentralization makes them good for funding/managing projects on the internet
   * Some examples → stablecoins, venture capital funds, DEXes, meme-buying cartels
* The ultimate goal of a DAO is to give all participating members a say

**Okay...So how do they work?**

Say, for example, you want to invest in the most interesting memes on the internet

* The average person wouldn’t be able to afford a Doge NFT, but may still get pleasure from owning a piece of it
* In this case, they can pool their funds with other like-minded people in order to buy NFTs

A few coordination problems exist with this model

1. How exactly do you find people to work with? There must be mutual trust between parties
2. How do you decide which memes to buy? Where does the NFT go when bought?
3. Who’s in charge of this meme-buying organization?
4. How does the organization allocate its capital?

Traditionally, a centralized company/institution was the answer to all of these questions

How DAOs solve these coordination conundrums

1. Proof of Seriousness - A DAO can ask each members to buy-in with a minimum amount of DAO tokens to join the organization, with the expectation that the DAO token will increase as the goals of the DAO are met. 
2. DAOs can be designed so that members can submit proposals on which memes to buy, and if a proposal gets a certain number of votes, the DAO automatically buys the meme
3. Governance Provisions - Amendments can be added if a quorum of members agree on them (a member can be defined as someone owning a certain amount of tokens)

**Some interesting DAO projects**

\- **MakerDAO** \- A DeFi project governed by a DAO. It is a stablecoin protocol allowing users to lend and borrow crypto without third parties. Token holders can change the rules or provide the team a mandate for community decisions.

\- **Uniswap/Curve** \- Uses liquidity pools to enable users to trade assets.

\- **MolochDAO** \- Seeks to fund projects that advance the Ethereum ecosystem

\- **PleasrDAO** \- Buys art in the form of NFTs. Recently purchased the Doge meme for $4 million.

**Legal Status of DAOS**

As of writing, only a few places around the world recognize DAOs as legal entities benefiting from protections afforded to something like an LLC. Today (July 1, 2021), Wyoming’s law that allows DAOs to register as LLCs takes effect.

Most DAOs operate without any protection for their members, but there are projects being worked on to add a liability wrapper around DAOs, like [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/).

**What’s Next?**

DAOs are primarily specific to the blockchain industry at the moment, but there is potential for them to spread to more traditional areas. People may be more inclined to join a DAO over a startup because DAOs can provide liquidity faster, while allowing them to directly participate in the governance of the organization.

DAOs could also be a great fit for the real estate industry. It’s not hard to make the jump from owning digital property like and NFT to owning physical property. Physical property could then give DAOs more leverage when regulation time comes. Imagine a pseudo-citizenship in which members of a real estate DAO have access to a network of DAO-owned properties.

This is only the beginning of DAOs, so it’s likely the most interesting use case is yet to be found."

Merlin lab reacted too ""quickly"" to this attack and announced the closure of the project.
16:54, the project party began to investigate the matter ;
17:24, the project party drew a preliminary conclusion that the loopholes of economic rules had been used;
23:27, announced the closure of the project, informed the user to stop deposit and withdraw funds in time;
the project party began to sell tokens at 0:26 on the 30th.
The indignant voices diffused rapidly on Twitter.
""I'm not withdraw a dollar and only 1 day into Merlinlab and already got rug pulled"",
""they have been audited by Certik and included in Security Leaderboard,but any alerts on their dashboar
Cry a moment
The BSC machine gun pool project MerlinLs hacked at 15:24 on June 29. According to an analysis by blockchain security firm Peckshield, the MerlinLab was hacked There is a logic loophole in MerlinStrategyalPacabnb.
The contract mistakenly takes the BNB transferred by the beneficiary as the mining income, so that the contract issues more MERL as a reward. After repeated operations, the attacker gains $300,000 MERL and temporarily halves, from $16.23 to $6.09 .
Merlin Lab reacts quickly to this attack, but faster than most people would have expected. 
 According to the project owner, after repeated hacker attacks, the developers were not optimistic about the prospect of the project and believed that they had no more experience to deal with the potential challenges in the future, so they did nothing but to shut down the project because they could not realize their original vision.
At present, the official website of the project party can still be accessed, and funds can be withdrawn normally. The project party's documents, Twitter account and Chinese WeChat group have been disbanded. 
This incident exposes the following questions of DEFI :
1) Is the team responsible for evil or normal hacker attack? 
2) Are the audited projects safe?
 3) Are anonymous items trustworthy? 
4) The cost of the project party admitting defeat is low, so how to deal with the losses caused to the investors? Hackers are one of us?
 Peckshield said it was possible that the team had acted badly. 
One suspect: Why rush to deploy a contract on your main network when it wasn't ready? 
The single asset machine gun pool related to Alpaca Finance just went online this morning for testing on the Merlin Labs mainnet. The contract with the vulnerability has not been published yet, nor has it provided the user with the inside information needed to carry out this attack. Since the contract is deployed online and the audit is conducted by many people, there are many possible insiders Team evil may be: the core personnel take the initiative to do evil; Some personnel secretly evil; 
After the attack, the project operator shut down the project overnight, emptied the Twitter, emptied the project wiki, dissolved the WeChat group, sold the tokens and other operations. It seems that there is reason to suspect that this is the initiative of the team. 
However, the profit of this attack is about $300,000,Merlin Labs Before the attack of TVL is about 200 million dollars .If it is the core team take the initiative to do evil, they obviously have enough temptation to shut down the project, and give investors no time to extract money.
It seems that external hacker attacks, the coincidence indicated anything.
The audit does not solve all problems
Most DEFI projects will ask audit companies to issue audit reports to endorse the security of the projects. However, the audited projects are not necessarily safe. In May, BSC was targeted by hackers, many of which were audited by blockchain security companies Peckshield tells Babbitt that defending against an attack is not a static process, it's a dynamic process -- in short, it's a pre-event, post-event process Defense mode of three stages, before the new contract online to conduct a comprehensive and professional intelligent security audit contract, this step is mainly to help agreement screening known all kinds of loopholes, the audit does not solve all problems Also, pay attention to the screen in combination with other DeFi products when the business logic of the loophole, avoid logical loopholes compatibility across the contract; It is necessary to design a certain risk control circuit breaker mechanism, and introduce the threat perception intelligence and data situation intelligence service of the third party security company to respond to the security risk in the first time when the DEFI security incident occurs, and check and block the security attack in time, so as to avoid causing more losses.
In addition, a set of perfect asset tracking mechanism should be established to monitor the flow of virtual currencies in real time. After security incidents occur in other protocols, the protocol should be carefully checked and remedied, whether there are similar loopholes and whether there are potential risks We think that in addition to the need to build a safe prediction strategy, to thoroughly understand the agreement and in the prophecy machine this source fluctuation kongfu, do it from the Angle of audit found problems, provide reliable solutions, under the chain of timely check 20, can reduce the price because of how machine distortion data manipulation Anonymous project is worthy of trust?
almost all of the current top 10 DEFI projects are real names.
For example, Michael Egorov, founder of Curve, is a Russian like Vishen. Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of AVE, studied law at the University of Helsinki Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, was laid off from his first job out of school, and the world lost one young electrical engineer to one DEFI pioneer, and others like Compound(founder Robert Leshner), Makerdao (founder Rune) Christensen) Liquity(founder Robert Lauko) is also a real name project. The Venus project is supported by the Swipe team (which has since been reorganized and Swipe has stepped down from project decision-making), a Binance investment company Only the teams of Pancakeswap and Sushiswap are anonymous. 
However, several core developers of Sushiswap are active on Twitter. Although blockchain is about decentralization and trust, the reality is that real-name projects are more likely to win the trust of investors.
Unfortunately,Merlin Labs was an anonymous project
The project was discarded at random and the investors had to pay for it, right? 
The solution adopted by Merlin Labs after the attack did not fix the vulnerability and make a compensation plan for the investors like the previous two times. 
On the contrary, the project side quickly sold off the tokens and announced the dissolution of the project, which directly caused the halved coin price to go to zero . The sharp fall in the price of the coins also led to heavy losses for the LP, which provided liquidity for the project. 
To put it mildly, it is extremely irresponsible of the project party to do this, and completely disregarding the interests of investors Last night bottom-hunting investors cost more in the range of 6-8 dollars, a wake up to return to zero because the project party is anonymous, at the same time the project Twitter cancelled the cable group ban WeChat group dissolved, the loss of investors almost nowhere to ask for a claim that DEFI has no supervision, in Code is law Investors in the blockchain world rely on code security as well as ethical discipline. When those two lines of defense are breached, how we prevent it next time?"

It is a multi-collateral decentralized stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to borrow decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. In addition, BakerDAO is non-custodial and completely decentralized, in which all processes are completed based on smart contracts on BSC. No one is entitled to use collateral assets or issue BAI and BKR arbitrarily. 

BAI is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed and stable currency issued by the BakerDAO system according to the borrow protocol, which is soft-pegged to the US dollar. With very low volatility, BAI can resist hyperinflation, ensure economic freedom and provide opportunities for anyone anywhere. 

BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO. For instance, the holders can modify such parameters as the stable fee rate and liquidation rate of collaterals, and they also have options for what type of new collaterals to support.

Besides, BakerDAO is a decentralized stablecoin as well as a safe and reliable decentralized lending protocol. Currently, the amount of stablecoin DAI of MakerDAO on Ethereum has reached nearly 5 billion US dollars, which are all issued through collateral cryptocurrency, and the marketcap of the governance currency MKR market cap has also reached nearly 5 billion US dollars. MakerDAO is the most complicated and largest decentralized application in the DeFi world so far. BakerDAO will certainly make another splendid achievement with its enormous market potential by relying on the high efficiency and low gas fee of the BSC chain and the innovative economic model.

BakerDAO Economic Model

1 million BakerDAO governance token BKR will be issued, 70% of which will be issued in a fair manner, namely, yield farming. Stimulated by yield farming, more users can obtain BKR, so as to participate in the governance of BakerDAO. The distribution method is as follows:

BakerDAO **Ecosystem** **Plan**

It is well-known that the BAI ecosystem is a key marker for the BakerDAO development, so BakerDAO reserves 10% of BKR to support ecosystem projects. These projects will not be supported directly by BKR to prevent the fluctuation of BKR price. Instead, they will be supported in the following two ways:

l BAI is repurchased using BKR to support the ecosystem projects;

l BKR mining is conducted to support the ecosystem projects’ cryptocurrency.

In turn, the ecosystem projects need to airdrop a certain percentage of tokens to BKR holders to give feedback for this support.

The ecosystem projects planned by BakerDAO include stablecoin trading protocols, lending protocols and decentralized exchanges. The ecosystem will continue to grow as BakerDAO progresses. The ecosystem projects can be existing projects or new ones.

BakerDAO **Roadmap**

To better develop the Baker protocol, we will develop the BAI ecosystem, initiate governance, provide more collaterals and increase capital utilization in addition to optimizing the user’s experience on BakerDAO. The development roadmap is shown below:

l The stablecoin BAI generation protocol will be launched on June 16, 2021

l BKR yield farming will be launched on June 18, 2021

l The ecosystem project, Stablecoin Exchange Protocol, will be supported on July 18, 2021.

l BakerDAO will start governance by BKR on July 28, 2021

l The ecosystem project, Decentralized Lending Protocol, will be supported on August 18, 2021

l BakerDAO liquidation system will be upgraded on September 1, 2021

l The ecosystem project, Decentralized Exchange Protocol, will be supported on October 18, 2021

l NFT assets will be supported to generate BAI on January 1, 2022

l The utilization of collaterals will be increased using the re-collateral model on April 1, 2022

l Physical assets will be supported to generate BAI on July 1, 2022 

l BAI interest system will be adopted to improve the utilization of BakerDAO system revenue on October 1, 2022

BakerDAO Borrow system was officially launched at 18:00 on June 19, 2021. And BakerDAO Yield Farming was launched at 20:00 on June 20, 2021.

What is meant by this, is that blockchains are inherently under the control of no one entity, such as a government, corporation, etc. They are open to everyone, entirely transparent. Immutable, and uncensorable. Blockchains make massive sacrifices in order to maintain this decentralization, this is what makes blockchains valuable.

 In order for blockchains to actually achieve something more than just sending tokens around, we want blockchains to interact with the real world, and we want to be able to have meaningful agreements and contracts on chain, something more than just ‘send tokens from address A to address B’. These are done in something called a ‘smart contract’. A smart contract is a piece of code that lives on-chain, this code automatically executes the instant the necessary parameters for its execution are met. Basically all of Decentralized Finance today is run by smart contracts.

Say you want to set up a smart contract for the purposes of betting on the superb owl. Users send tokens to the contract putting their bet on either team A, or team B. If Team A wins, all the tokens go to the users who bet on team A. This is all very simple to code on networks like ethereum, except for one major problem: how will the contract know who wins the super bowl? 

 To get any information about the real world on chain, you need an ‘Oracle’. A reliable source of definitive truth. The obvious solution is to connect your smart contract to some website like sportsnet, and just use that as your Oracle. This will probably work fine, but remember, the whole point of blockchains is decentralization, if you have all these fancy decentralized networks running your smart contract, but the execution of the smart contract is entirely reliant on a centralized source of data, then what’s the point of all those decentralized networks? A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, it doesn’t matter if you have the most decentralized computing network in the world running your smart contracts, if the source of data, which governs how the contract executes is entirely centralized. 

 This problem, of finding a way to get information on chain, in a way that matches the level of security and decentralization of blockchains, is known as ‘The Oracle Problem’, and this is the problem Chainlink solves. Oracles are the most obvious, and most vulnerable attack vector for most smart contracts.

Chainlink solves this problem by decentralizing oracles. Aggregating the results of multiple ‘nodes’, to come up with one answer. There are multiple levels of security ensuring these nodes provide honest, accurate, data to the network, but i’m not going to get into those too much in this post. Tl;dr is that they’re economically incentivized to be honest, penalized if they’re dishonest, and there is a reputation system and a number of safeguards that work to keep the oracles Chainlink provides reliable and secure. 

 The Chainlink token is used to pay for any of the services on the network, and eventually will be ‘staked’ by chainlink nodes, meaning it is locked in the network, and will be taken from these nodes if they misbehave. Chainlink is inherently modular, and customizable, so customers can pick and choose their nodes, and the specification of their oracle network according to whatever needs they have. You can think of Chainlink as a network of networks, and customers can build oracle networks customized to their needs all within the link ecosystem.

Chainlink is currently the only major player in the oracle space. They have a significant first mover advantage, and the network currently secures basically every major DeFi protocol except for MakerDAO. The total value collectively secures by these protocols is in the tens of billions of dollars, and this value is all dependant on the reliability of the data chainlink puts out, as unreliable data would lead to faulty liquidations, and lost funds from these protocols and their users. 

Chainlink is already cementing itself as the standard oracle solution, and in the long term, unless some other, superior solution is found to the oracle problem, chainlink stands to have a near monopoly on secure oracles. The market for this is massive, the derivatives market is worth literally quadrillions, and chainlink is primed to secure that entire market as it moves on-chain.


If anyone has any questions about oracles/chainlink, please feel free to ask! I'm always glad to have an opportunity to help people learn (and shill my bags)."

What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Cryptocurrency is a relatively newer form of currency that has been floating for a while but has suddenly gotten into the limelight. Unlike fiat currencies which require a medium like a bank to complete transactions, crypto successfully eliminates a medium and hence is a peer-to-peer network. Cryptocurrency is the name given to a system that uses cryptography to allow the secure transfer and exchange of digital tokens in a distributed and decentralized manner. These tokens can be traded at market rates for fiat currencies.

The first cryptocurrency that came into being was Bitcoin which began trading in January 2009. Bitcoin was launched by a person/group of people known by the name of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. Now there are more than hundreds of cryptocurrencies and various other applications of blockchain technology readily available.

Cryptocurrency holds the potential for being cheap, secure, and near-instant transactions allowing millions of people to join the world of internet commerce. This system allows businesses to offer real-time pay-per-use consumption of their products such as cell phone services, video, etc.

The rise of cryptocurrency poses a threat to many existing traditional functions of finance. Investing in stocks, keeping money in banks are some examples of this.

 

**BLOCKCHAIN**

 

A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. This technology enables users to confirm transactions without needing a central clearing authority.

Blockchain holds the potential of going far beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrency. But in this article, we’ll stick to its use in the crypto field.

**CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

A cryptocurrency doesn’t have any intrinsic value and functions only because there is sufficient market acceptance and there is a belief that the currency has value attributed to it. In the case of fiat currencies, money has value because people trust the central bank. For cryptocurrencies additions to the public ledger are confirmed by the crowd of people participating.

**DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

Cryptocurrencies can be grouped into seven classes:

* Transaction mechanism: bitcoin,litecoin
* Distributed computation token: Internet computer where programs, smart contracts are executed when called. For eg- Ethereum, Tezos
* Utility token: Programmable blockchain asset. For eg- Golem,FileCoin
* Security token: Represents stocks, bonds, derivatives, or other financial assets. For eg- Security Token Offerings(STO)
* Fungible Token: Most popular is ERC-20 issued on the ethereum blockchain.
* Non-Fungible Token: Each token is unique and not interchangeable with another. For eg- Cryptokitties, Decentraland(LAND)
* Stablecoins: There are four categories -

1. Collateralized with fiat currency: USDT,USDC
2. Collateralized with real assets: DGX, collateralized by gold
3. Cryptocurrency Collateralized: MakerDAO offers DAI coin pegged to US dollar
4. Uncollateralized: Basis project and their coin Basecoin

**Price action of Bitcoin:**

Bitcoin price since inception has seen the rise of 26140% and has outperformed all traditional assets.

**CLOSING REMARKS**

Cryptocurrency is financial innovation and offers vast research avenues. As with new innovations there lies many confusions in the space.

Our goal was to highlight various types of cryptocurrencies and their price discovery since inception."
Messari Share: How to become a professional crypto analyst?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dramatic_Climate_598/comments/oe43n6/messari_share_how_to_become_a_professional_crypto/,Dramatic_Climate_598,1,2021-07-05 17:53:11,0,/r/u_Dramatic_Climate_598/comments/oe43n6/messari_share_how_to_become_a_professional_crypto/,NaN,"Recently, blockchain data provider Messari hosted a seminar on how to become a crypto analyst on Crowdcast, where senior analysts Ryan Watkins and Mason Nystrom shared their tips for growing from Crypto to a professional analyst. They also tweeted earlier Medium and other communities have shared relevant methodologies and learning experiences, and the author has compiled these suggestions for those who want to become builders in the crypto field and continue to improve on their professional path. 

**Messari's goal is to bring transparency to the crypto economy and help investors According to Maartje Bus**, Managing Director of Messari Hub, regulators and the public understand crypto assets and build data tools to drive informed decision making and investment: 

You can think of us as the crypto version of Bloomberg terminal Messari which provides data analysis tools related to specific crypto assets. You can build your own watch list. We have a very detailed overview of each asset In addition to this, we provide enterprise-class tools to track crypto enterprise/project dynamics and assist exchanges and asset custodians. 

Messari believes that high quality and widely distributed research can help unlock Ryan's story of potential analysts in crypto.

**Ryan Watkins** 

Graduated in 2018 with a degree in Finance + Computer Science. After working in investment banking for a year and a half, Watkins became involved in crypto and joined Messari full time in October 2019. Ethereum stuff had gone up over 2,000%, and he felt like he had to look at this thing again. 

""I started trading with the money I made from my internship and learning as fast as I could to get a handle on this space that seemed to be growing at a million miles per hour In my senior year, I began to obsessed with this, almost 100% of the free time.When I don't go out to play in the study in this field, first begin with COINS I have never questioned what money is and how it works, why does it exist, what is the purpose of it, or what's wrong with it. 

I just always thought that money is useful With COINS, I began to understand and question the basic component of civilization, and I became fascinated by these enough to let Ryan consider leaving lucrative investment banking, until a few months later, when he learned that the etheric lane and is convinced that encryption to some extent, even beyond the currency, he decided to work in this industry Against the backdrop of declining trust in institutions across the Western world, the idea that cryptocurrencies could provide the basis for the development of new types of institutions adapted to the digital age is really exciting!

**Mason** 

Graduated with a degree in business administration and began his career at a small exchange in Hong Kong, where he fell in love with cryptocurrencies when he read Messari founder Ryan Selkis's title *The Apprentice: Crypto*'s article for Volunteer Analysts.

After contacting Messari via email, he became an analyst volunteer of ConsenSys. With the fame of Messari and experience in exchange related work, ConsenSys has been awarded the job Now, he's a full-time research analyst at Messari. Is a technical background necessary to be a crypto analyst? 

Mason tells us from his experience: You don't have to have a technical background. **Cryptography is a very young field, the best way to really become an expert is to use a lot of different protocols**. You don't usually have to have a technical background. I didn't have a traditional financial background, because I didn't have a fanatical interest in finance and accounting or anything like that. I just took a very general approach But as long as you're willing to invest, you can quickly learn about what you're interested in, whether it's DeFi NFT, social tokens, etc., there's always an area where you can provide value and finally, I think if you can leverage the skills that you've developed in these projects, you'll easily find a full-time crypto job. 

Ryan and Mason share some common tips on how to break into the industry and become a professional analyst: In the live stream sharing, one of the most popular questions asked was: as a person with no experience in CYPTO analysis, despite my knowledge in this area, can I participate in it, or do you suggest where I should start? 

Ryan replied: The industry is young and there are not many ways to get into it, but that's a good thing. The way to get into it is to get your hand in the program and learn from it. So in DEFI's lending area, for example, spend a few days learning about Compound, how it works, and then use it and then compare it to AVE MakerDAO, you can see how The loan agreement works and then you can compare them and see what The Compound is going to do next. Research reports are a good source of learning. Messari、 Delphi、 The Block In addition to that, go to project websites, read their blogs, listen to related podcasts, and learn in a variety of ways, which is exactly what we are doing. 

Mason: 

There are all kinds of ways to get involved besides Defi and I've met a lot of different analysts who are very enthusiastic about NFT projects like Chiliz and really get involved (and other aspects of Web 3) and join these communities to explore The members of the crypto community are very inclusive and willing to answer questions and provide information, so really getting involved is one of the easiest ways to level up. 

**Write. Keep writing!** 

Through his writing, Ryan recognized the holes in his thinking and really began to understand that cryptocurrencies might sound perfect in your head, but when it comes to elaborating on paper, it's a different story I learned the theoretical knowledge of finance and computer science in university and had the experience of investment banking, but in the practice of cryptocurrency, I found that it was a new ball game. Mason believed that collaboration could clear the mind and keep up with the latest thing in this industry, Nic Carter Chris Burniske, Derek Hsue, Phil Bonello, Tony Sheng and Kyle Samani made their names in the cryptocurrency space, starting with their blog posts on blockchain topics, mostly related to investing or research. One of the highest skills you can leverage is your writing ability. 

Not only to write good content, but also to have the courage to speak out their own views, which is actually very difficult writing, content can be written? 

Mason recommends some easier forms of writing: Share your thoughts, it might make you feel uncomfortable, get over it! If you really want to take it easy, then from the high complexity of long content. 

The process at the beginning of the work, **you will be surprised on people less time spent on reading**. The content of the planning is very important, is also very valuable. The concept of expert article: to study the specific areas,for example, Stable currency、 liquidity、 NFTs、 intelligent mining、 contracts,、digital art。

You do some exploration of the taxation of the Cosmos ecosystem and write tutorials to show people how to do it! If you don't like to write long posts, then the app takes advantage of the social media community overseas. The smartest people in cryptocurrency use Twitter to build their brands, like POMP, Ryan Sean Adams, Meltem Dimirros, Arianna Simpson， Nic Carter, Ari David Paul, Hasu, Tom Shaughnessy, Also, answering questions on Quora can also help you learn about cryptocurrencies and boost your brand. If you answer enough questions, you can put it together in a written article In the writing process, try to show you have specific areas of knowledge and the unique point of view. Finally note that writing should have good structure, guarantee the reader won't were perplexed by what you wrote a good structure, can reference the outstanding articles as sample, imitating the writing (Chinese community, but in the way of DeFi The public found a large number of outstanding sample). 

After you've written it, read it out loud to see if it makes sense, and if so, ask someone else to read it, comment on it, and see if it made any sense to others. 

In addition to experimenting with the product and writing it,Mason offers the following tips on how to land a job in crypto: 

1. **Move to a cryptocurrency city and attend parties and clubs** 

We're all products of our environment If you want to succeed in tech, you probably should live where innovation is happening. If you're in a place full of blockchain activity, I recommend going to parties or community events, most of which are free The author's note: In China, Hangzhou is exactly the city where such innovation takes place. Various cutting-edge crypto themed activities are being held in China (Hangzhou) Future Blockchain Innovation Center. 

The industry blockchain blockchain technology discussion Defi NFT Metaverse is the earlier hot dance trend of 2021 crypto art(The future and investment opportunities) are still impressive! 

2 **Volunteers or mentors** 

Volunteering can be to gain experience and a good way to establish contact with the encryption monetary world. When you are in the outstanding person, such as excellent teacher, their knowledge and experience will flow from themselves to others. The closer you get to the remarkable people, the more you learn. 

3 **Make full use of your strengths** 

People with a certain amount of work experience should take advantage of it.If you have any skills or qualifications, including: Analyst (Excel oriented), CPA, CFA, Lawyer, Fearless Public Speaker (Voice or Podcast oriented), Author (Keyboard Wizard), Social Expert, Process Design Expert (Attention to detail and operation) ,Designers (Photoshop and graphic design), economics price (encryption currency is based on incentive mechanism and game theory), if you have any of these skills, then you are than the current in the encryption industry have greater advantages For students and young adults, make full use of your time to learn a new skill experience; 

4 Maybe you're not much of a copywriter, but if you're good at creating video, especially live content, then get started **creating tutorial videos**. Presentations are a great way to discuss cryptography Bankless, Chinese community excellent podcasts also have Light Paper Wu Shi One said (both in Chinese and English content) and other cryptographic science analysis Chinese video has block Mr. Chen Mo Bitouq cryptographic vision Ma Lie vision. 

5 **For others to provide help** 

People are always searching for information, help them find the information they need For example, put content, news, information, data, people, educational materials, and so on into perspective. People can't always tell you what they want or need. What do your unique skills and attributes offer? 

6 While ETH has a lot of friends (and perhaps competitors), you should also **find a friend** who shares your passion and works together on any of the topics mentioned above. No one can reach the summit alone and make friends with the rich content machine Hasu, co-creator of the podcast Uncommon Core, is arguably one of the best researchers in the cryptocurrency field, and writes frequently with others 

7 **Best tips: Do cool things To stand out**

You need to target your audience, and employers value people who think and act on their own ideas and make cool things. How do think the company? Here are some suggestions: Create graphical charts or videos that visually express something like the knowledge planet visual thinking, and planet owner Felix has done a great DeFi visual note for DeFi and NFT Concise a cool project (stablecoinindex), do something slightly different (#defi index, DeepDao is ahead of the growing trend like social tokens by creating a website or newsletter that offers something of value, like a list of meeting times for every open source crypto project, and finding ways to save someone's time or effort Research a super niche topic related to blockchain and write/push your findings. It shouldn't be superficial, but it doesn't have to be a completely revolutionary last word. Work hard, stay humble and live a happy life."

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021."

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021."

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

Proto.Gold announced that talented &amp; lucky community members would have the opportunity to win and earn PROTO, LAW and DORE through the year in the community games and competitions.

**DAO - community governance “Law” token.**

Our voice will shape \*\*Proto.Gold’\*\*s future direction! Early supporters who contributed during the DCE 1 and DCE 2 events were registered to receive, on a 1-to-1 basis upon their PROTO holdings, an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the LAW token. Everyone else will have to acquire it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the PROTO total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. PROTO will support the price of LAW and other tokens/coins in some parts, similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

The Proto.Gold community has naturally evolved into what is known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. It is a very efficient way to transparently manage the organization’s affairs on a global basis. An added side benefit is that it also provides both increased security and community participation.

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

**Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you!**

95 days fully locked 🔒 then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day.

PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

Description of PROTO token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each **PROTO** transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

⏫ **Frictionless token yield** ⏫

2.5% of all transactions are shared with PROTO Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of PROTO tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. PROTO is your primary day-to-day token.

**DORE bonus airdrop🏅**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to PROTO holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your DORE airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted Gold Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your DORE airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto.Gold ecosystem. This forward looking statement includes a Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap PROTO for DORE at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the DORE lottery for bigger DORE prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 DORE = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**🪙 Tokenomics Features:**

**Why the necessity of Vortex in the Defi and how it resolves the existing problem?** 

The current DeFi solutions are dispersed. It becomes extremely difficult for a regular Joe to use them all with a slow learning curve considering the DeFi market is moving at a speed of light at the moment. 

With so many protocols and platforms coming every month, It is a dream of yield farmers to be able to access them all from a single web interface. 

Vortex Defi plans to provide you access to all leading platforms and protocols from a single web-based user interface. 

*MVP of Vortex DeFi shall:* 

1. Enable Lending via Yearn Protocol 

2. Enable Lending on Compound

3. Enable Lending on Aave 

*Immediate Version 2 of the MVP (post-seed) will include:* 

1. Enable Borrowing via Compound 

2. Enable Borrowing via Aave 

3. Creation of MakerDao CDP. 

The following will be integrated in the near future. 

4. MakerDAO 

5. bZx 

6. Compound 

7. Aave 

8. Synthetix 

9. Uniswap 

10. Unilend Finance 

11. dYdX 

12. Balancer 

13. Zapper

14. Yearn Finance 

15. Idle Finance"

DeFi, short for decentralized finance, is a global, peer-to-peer system of storing and transferring assets without the structure, restriction and costs of a traditional centralized banking system. Advocates assert that DeFi can do everything a bank – whether brick-and-mortar or online-only – can do, only faster and more transparently through digital smart contracts on public ledger blockchains like Ethereum. Here’s what you need to know about this emerging technology. Consider working with a financial advisor if you’re thinking of moving into either cryptocurrencies or using DeFi.

MakerDAO, which was created in 2014, is often credited with being the first DeFi platform to gain widespread use. It’s an open-source project on the Ethereum blockchain and a decentralized autonomous organization created in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

**How DeFi Works**

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi works off a public decentralized blockchain network, stablecoins and DeFi apps, also known as dapps.

Blockchains continuously collect chunks of data and links them so past transactions are immutably and unbreakably documented. Each transaction is publicly verified by everyday users, and once it goes on the chain, it can not be changed. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it more secure than alternatives that depend on one centralized owner or authority like banks, corporations and governments. Blockchain technology enables the tracking of singular pieces of data like cryptocurrency payments so financial transactions can be verified and traced back to their owners, giving it verifiable value that can be used even more securely than fiat currencies.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to combine the transparency, security and immediacy of cryptocurrencies with the stability of fiat currencies.

Most DeFi apps, or dapps, use the Ethereum blockchain to complete transactions. You can purchase Ether, the Ethereum currency, and other cryptocurrencies to spend, lend and save. Cryptocurrencies are what fuel the creation of the blockchain network. Using dapps like Maker, Compound and Bancor, you can pretty much do anything with crypto that you can with traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, including borrowing and lending. Among other things, you can invest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have been gaining popularity for artists, collectors, celebrities of all kinds and their fans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros and Cons of DeFi**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sma0pzdgvw971.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c2ed5730aba94a1ed06624a9f4e0976aa000c99

There are some major advantages of using DeFi, including cost, speed and security. Anyone with an internet connection has access to blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Users are able to make trades and move their assets whenever they want without having to wait on bank transfers or pay bank fees. DeFi is fast. The blockchain is updated as soon as a transaction is made, and interest rates are updated multiple times in one minute. The open nature of DeFi means that every single transaction can be seen by the public. It would be very hard to steal cryptocurrency because of how the blockchain logs transactions.

You can also invest on securities markets and conduct peer-to-peer activities. For example, [DX.Exchange](https://DX.Exchange) provides a platform for trading and investing in tokenized stocks backed by NASDAQ and MPS Marketplace Services Ltd. You could buy a house using crypto, provided the seller agrees and you find an abstract company that is willing to work with DeFi. Emerging technologies like BitPay can be used to make purchases for physical goods that are typically paid for in dollars by transferring crypto into cash.

The economic impact of Covid-19 and how banks responded revealed another potential benefit of DeFi. In response to the pandemic’s recession, some central banks slashed interest rates to maintain consumer spending and protect the economy. However, that cut the effective net worth of savers. Under a DeFi regime, a central bank would have a much more difficult – if not impossible – task to manipulate the value of its currency. In other words, DeFi enables users to guard the value of their assets from central bank manipulation.

There are also some disadvantages that DeFi faces. DeFi users are not able to guard the value of their assets from market gyrations. Values fluctuate frequently and sometimes extremely. Ethereum transaction rates also fluctuate, so trading could potentially become expensive. Further, dapps are a relatively new technology and weaknesses or liabilities may yet emerge. In addition, there is also an array of potential tax implications that come with purchasing, trading and investing via DeFi.

Finally, the shape of emerging policies and regulatory schemes have yet to be determined. In particular, it remains to be seen regulators will respond to stablecoins coexisting with central bank digital currencies."
"Regarding the ""defisafety.com"" audit score of 3% for SHIBA SWAP",https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBADULTS/comments/ogf19c/regarding_the_defisafetycom_audit_score_of_3_for/,kalbhairavaa,1,2021-07-09 03:55:04,17,/r/SHIBADULTS/comments/ogf19c/regarding_the_defisafetycom_audit_score_of_3_for/,Discussion,"**Defi Safety ShibaSwap Audit**

[**Defi Safety**](https://defisafety.com/) claims to be an independent DeFi app Audit blog/site. I am not sure how reputable they are, but here is my analysis of why the score is 3% for ShibaSwap.

 [**ShibaSwap Audit report**](https://defisafety.com/2021/07/07/shibaswap/)

Here is how they Check for validity - I looked at their [**review of MAKERDAO**](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/draft-0.7-makerdao#scoring-appendix)

According to them , what they do is , they look to see if the following are available from the developer's site.

* ***smart contracts on the blockchain***
* ***documentation that explains what smart contracts do***
* ***tests I ran to verify smart contract***
* ***audit(s) performed on my code by third party experts***
* ***admin controls and strategies***

They conclude that with this data made available, it is reasonable to trust the smart contracts. \[All the tokens/coins and the Dapp/Swap are/has smart contracts\]

**My Observations** \[Please do not consider this as FUD and Please correct me if I am wrong and I will update this with the suggested changes\]

\[What is in **bold** is their ask, and inlined are my comments/observations\]

* ***Here are my smart contracts on the blockchain***
   * They could not find Shiba Swap's deployed contract to see the ""Code Used Appendix"" Analytics
      * We have contracts of Individual coins but not the farm itself 
      *  Pancake swap documents them like [**this**](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-farm) 
   * So far this - [**shibaswap/core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shibaswap/core) code repo (with the same name) from npm is all that is available 
   * So this is ranked as zero
* ***Here is the documentation that explains what my smart contracts do***
   * So far the only documentation about the code in the contracts are comments in the contract
   * I will have to copy the contract on to [**Remix**](https://remix.ethereum.org/) , compile and deploy it to their testnet and then execute it and debug it to understand the code. This will take time and they haven't bothered with it.
* ***Here are the tests I ran to verify my smart contract***
   * The source of the swap itself isn't public AFAIK so no such info exists
   * My best guess about this is that , they might be using  [**Truffle Framework**](http://truffleframework.com/) **,** which would mean that the UI code for the swap would be an npm package available publicly. I couldn't find it, they couldn't either and it isn't documented that this is the official source.
* ***Here are the audit(s) performed on my code by third party experts***
   * For now we have to wait on Certik - so that is bound to change .
* ***Here are the admin controls and strategies***
   * All we know about this is the 6/9 Gnosis Safe and the dignitaries from the Woof paper, but we don't know anything about them
   * The only name common amongst the dignitaries and the devs who attended the AMA is **kaaldhairya**
   * We don't know anything else

They are basically asking for transparency which is a fair ask.

You can be anonymous like Satoshi Nakamoto and build Bitcoin, but his/her/their code is available publicly for everyone to see and audit.

Our encouragement comes from the fact that what Certik said about the project and the fact that the swap exists and it works. 

Since, the Certik audit report hasn't been out yet, we are going to have to wait for that for answers.

There is 1.54 billion USD locked in there so this kind of transparency is a fair ask, IMHO.

For reference, Sushi swap has a dev wiki that lists [all the contracts](https://dev.sushi.com/sushiswap/contracts)   

This has to be build from scratch for Shiba Swap and it is not a trivial task."

After passing the audit of CertiK, a well-known audit institution, the BakerDAO yield farming and borrow protocol, which is a decentralized stablecoin protocol on BSC, was successfully launched at 19:00 on June 19, 2021. Under the adverse situation of the downward market, the TVL is up to US $30 million, and the system has been running healthily and stably. It is reported that the net income of MakerDAO, the Ethereum decentralized stablecoin project, was $9.37 million USD in June, and the stablecoin issued exceeded $5 billion USD. Relying on the efficient, low gas cost and innovative economic model of the BSC chain, BakerDAO has huge market potential. Next, let's take a look at the latest data of BakerDAO's yield farming and borrow.

BKR Yield Farming Data

BKR yield farming has been concerned by all parties since its launch, and has become a new star of DeFi project. Until 12:00 on July 8, various data is as follows:

About BakerDAO: BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."

Welcome to Capmonster Twick

Unique &amp; custom-built, one-of-a-kind labeled &amp; audited contract by several dev teams &amp; 2 respectable auditing firms will carry out the official audits upon the launch.🔏

**📝 Contract Code:** [https://bscscan.com/address/0x069b077efe2d2caf426e4ed076d877f8600a7600#code](https://bscscan.com/address/0x069b077efe2d2caf426e4ed076d877f8600a7600#code)

**Capmonster Twick, part of the Capmonster Twick ecosystem, is now live on PancakeSwap. 💡**

**More than 1000+ BNB was raised in minutes when the DCE 1 event went live, during the crash a couple of weeks back and the soft cap target was smashed, WITH NO MARKETING!!!**

📱 Join the fast-growing community on Telegram: [https://t.me/Proto\_Gold](https://t.me/Proto_Gold)

PROTO is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity.

**LAW** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**DORE** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

*Lightpaper and Whitepaper in 6 languages already ready and live* \-

🌎 English, Mandarin, Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian. More coming!

The Capmonster Twick community has naturally evolved into what is known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. It is a very efficient way to transparently manage the organization’s affairs on a global basis. An added side benefit is that it also provides both increased security and community participation.

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

**Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you!**

95 days fully locked 🔒 then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day.

PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

Description of PROTO token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each **PROTO** transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

 

⏫ **Frictionless token yield** ⏫

2.5% of all transactions are shared with PROTO Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of PROTO tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. PROTO is your primary day-to-day token.

**DORE bonus airdrop🏅**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to PROTO holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your DORE airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted Gold Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your DORE airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto.Gold ecosystem. This forward looking statement includes a Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap PROTO for DORE at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the DORE lottery for bigger DORE prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 DORE = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**🪙 Tokenomics Features:**

1.5% of each **Capmonster Twick** transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool, increasing tradeability forever.

2% of each **Capmonster Twick** transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. PROTO isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground. 🗺

1% of each **Capmonster Twick** transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each **Capmonster Twick** transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig

 

vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each **Capmonster Twick** transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each **Capmonster Twick** transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

***More information below:***

**Community competitions 🎭**

Proto.Gold announced that talented &amp; lucky community members would have the opportunity to win and earn PROTO, LAW and DORE through the year in the community games and competitions.

**DAO - community governance “Law” token.**

Our voice will shape \*\*Capmonster Twick’\*\*s future direction! Early supporters who contributed during the DCE 1 and DCE 2 events were registered to receive, on a 1-to-1 basis upon their PROTO holdings, an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the LAW token. Everyone else will have to acquire it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the PROTO total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. PROTO will support the price of LAW and other tokens/coins in some parts, similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

"Single Token Mining Fee Stepped Rate Plan will be Launched on 11, July（July 10, 2021）",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/ohh9m1/single_token_mining_fee_stepped_rate_plan_will_be/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-07-10 19:48:40,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/ohh9m1/single_token_mining_fee_stepped_rate_plan_will_be/,NaN," 

Since BakerDAO passed CertiK audit and launched lending and yield farming system, TVL has exceeded 30 million USD, BKR price has exceeded 600 USD and has more than 6000 holders. However affected by the environment BKR price is declining spirally. The mining and selling behavior of single token mining users does not conform to the values of the BakerDAO community. We hope that everyone can hold BKR and develop with the community and team for a long time. This is also the purpose of yield farming: allow more people to hold BKR and contribute to the development of BakerDAO. So BakerDAO is launching single token mining fee stepped rate plan, the rate will be adjusted every day according to the price of the previous day, implemented from July 11, 2021. In the near future, BakerDAO will surely become the top DeFi project on the BSC chain like MakerDAO, and everyone's long-term holding of BKR will reflect great value.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 
* Focusing on indexing before derivatives
* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
* Liquidity for the middle class


Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022
•  3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)
•  Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)
•  10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 


• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

🔮 $SPELL abracadabra.money: Provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto assets and borrow magic internet money! $SPELL going to the moon! 🔮,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/ohppmr/spell_abracadabramoney_provide_collateral_in_the/,Doughnut_Master_19,1,2021-07-11 03:59:02,0,/r/CryptoMoon/comments/ohppmr/spell_abracadabramoney_provide_collateral_in_the/,DEFI,"With abracadabra.money, you can provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto assets such as yvUSDT, yvUSD &amp; borrow 'magic internet money' $MIM which is a stable coin that you swap for any other coin. This is the cheapest way to create collateralized debt position in the crypto space

You may know the principle from Unit Protocol (DUCK), but this project demands 2.9% interest, while abracadabra demands only 0.8%-1.5%. They are clearly going for high volume, which is the right thing to do giving that borrowing/lending is pretty much a commodity market (but potentially a very, very big one). Borrowing yvWETH comes with 0% interest at the moment. It's MakerDao but in cheap and targeting high volume.

Abracadabra has strong ties with yearn &amp; potentially even curve. The team is legit, dedicated and very ambitious.

$MIM is already on CRV pools with very high volume, the team is working at light speed and $MIM is available on ETH and Fantom. Stakers of $SPELL receive 10% of liquidation fees, plus rewards from interest.

Now the best part: Leveraged yielding positions &amp; deleverage flash loan repayments. With only one Transaction on the blockchain, you can leverage your yield position in up to 10 „loops“, meaning that you borrow MIM for your interest bearing crypto asset (for which you gain yield), and this borrowed MIM is automatically used for another round of yield.. &amp; again and again, up to 10 times. Not with some shitcoin that decreases in value, but with yvUSDC etc.

It's magic!!

MakerDAO Eyes Adding Gemini and Binance USD as Collateral  
The Maker community voted to prioritize GUSD, BUSD, and eight other tokens for inclusion as collateral, which would allow them to be used to create Dai.  
In brief  
Gemini USD and Binance USD received green lights from the MakerDAO community as potential collateral assets for Dai.  
If the assets are ultimately approved, users can put them on the Maker platform to generate DAI.  
The platform continues to add collateral assets as it moves away from solely allowing Ether.

**Main point:**

– Coins are any cryptocurrency that has a standalone independant blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, …)

– Altcoins are considered as coins that are not Bitcoin.

– Tokens are cryptocurrencies that do not have their own blockchain but live on another blockchain. As they live on another blockchain, they benefit from its technology. (ERC-20 tokens…)

# Coin

Coins refer to any cryptocurrency that has a standalone, independent blockchain — like Bitcoin.

These cryptocurrencies are bootstrapped from scratch, and the broader network is designed explicitly to achieve a certain goal. For example, Bitcoin exists as a censorship-resistant store of value and medium of exchange that has a secure, fixed monetary policy. The native token of Bitcoin, BTC (i.e., bitcoins), is the most liquid cryptocurrency in the market and has both the highest market cap and realized market cap in the cryptocurrency sector.

Coin projects typically draw inspiration from past technologies or other cryptocurrencies and fuse them into an innovative network catering to a specific purpose.

Another example of a coin, Ethereum’s Ether (ETH) is the native coin of a smart contracts platform for creating general-purpose computer programs that run on a decentralized blockchain. Rather than focusing on financial data, Ethereum focuses on arbitrary program data that can cover anything from games to social media. Ether is used for sending/receiving, managing assets, paying gas fees, and interacting with decentralized applications (dapps) on the network.

You might also have heard about Altcoins. Basically, we call Altcoins any coins that are an alternative to Bitcoin.

# Token

Tokens are a unique outlay of broader smart contracts platforms like Ethereum that enable users to create, issue, and manage tokens that are derivatives of the primary blockchain.

For example, the ICO craze of 2017 was fueled by Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, which is basically a protocol for creating tokens (besides ETH) on the Ethereum blockchain that can be exchanged with each other. Projects would announce or build an application on Ethereum using smart contracts, and issue a native token for use in that application, raising funds directly from investors in ETH in the process.

Tokens occupy a unique corner of the cryptocurrency market where they function as “utility” tokens within an application’s ecosystem for incentivizing certain behavior or paying fees. For example, the popular ERC-20 token Dai is part of the MakerDAO dapp on Ethereum. MakerDAO is a way for users to access credit instruments like lending/borrowing using Dai, which is designed to be stable. ERC-20 tokens like Dai can be exchanged for any other ERC-20 token or other Ethereum-based standards (i.e., ERC-721), including the ETH coin.

As a result, tokens exist as application-specific tokens within a coin’s broader cryptocurrency/blockchain network, like Dai existing within Ethereum’s ecosystem.

Other tokens besides Dai include Maker (MKR), 0x, Augur (REP), Komodo (KMD), and Golem (GNT).

Coins need to be exchanged with each other through cryptocurrency exchanges because they are built on different, non-standardized code protocols. Conversely, tokens on Ethereum (e.g., ERC-20) can be exchanged through internal applications amongst each other with minimal friction because they are built on standardized code protocols.

Approaching cryptocurrency markets is a challenging task, but understanding the basic distinction between the various types of cryptocurrencies can help you manage risk and make better decisions in a volatile ecosystem."

Sign of DeFi Explosion: Wrapped Bitcoin Sees Stunning Growth in 2020  
The decentralized finance (DeFi) market has seen explosive growth in 2020. Various metrics, such as the total value locked (TVL), shows the sector's parabolic expansion in recent months. But arguably the most optimistic trend is the increase in the number of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

Wrapped Bitcoin is an ERC20 token that reflects the value of BTC. The token was created by top DeFi protocols in January, which include MakerDAO, Kyber Network and Compound.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle class

Abundance of opportunities for all

Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi 
with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  
•3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) 
Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   
•10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) 
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!

How do they differ from their competitors?


Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.


Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

# 3.3. Future business

According to the roadmap of the team for the second half of the year, there are three areas of business progress worthy of special attention, namely:

# a. AUSD

At present, there is no too detailed information about AUSD, but it should be a stablecoin product issued with Alpaca’s interest-bearing assets (ib token) as collateral. According to the team’s AMA in April, this business was originally scheduled to launch at the end of the second quarter. However, due to the continuous outbreak of security incidents on the BSC from May to June, the team has increased the workload of security audits, resulting in delays in the release of some functions.

The collateral assets of AUSD should be mainstream crypto assets deposited by users into Alpaca, such as stablecoins, BTC, ETH, BNB, etc. The mint method may be similar to Makerdao (just guessing). However, like all stablecoin projects, AUSD also faces the same problems as other new stablecoins: **in a stablecoin market with strong network effect, what new value do you provide for stablecoin users, so that they are willing to use your products?**

Like any new product, a new stablecoin is difficult to be adopted by users if it has no “multiple benefits” compared with old stablecoins. The advantages and characteristics of the current mainstream stablecoints are roughly as follows:

* USDT: first issued with the largest issuance. Its first-mover advantage has built a strong currency network effect, but it is criticized for its centralization and opacity. The market has been worried about its credit risk.
* USDC: it was issued earlier, and its current issuance is second only to USDT. Although it is also a centralized stablecoin, it is under strict supervision and uses US dollars as collateral, which reduces credit risk. USDC is also the most rapidly promoted stablecoin outside of the crypto world.
* BUSD: its issuance ranked the third. Although it is mainly issued by Binance, there are also regulations that pay attention to its collateral and issuance volume, and the credit risk is small. In order to promote BUSD, Binance has provided strong operational support such as transaction fee reduction and exemption, so as to expand its applicable scenarios. It is currently the most widely circulated stablecoin in the BSC ecosystem.
* DAI: a decentralized stablecoin with the largest issuance and the longest history, issued by Makerdao using an over-collateralization mechanism. It has the largest network effect among decentralized stablecoins.

Due to the strong network effects and brand advantages, it is very difficult for new stablecoins to compete with old stablecoins, even if they have no problem in terms of security and decentralization. Because the lack of use scenarios will lead to insufficient demand for stablecoins, and then the coin price will be not pegged to US dollar for a long-term run. This phenomenon exists in Venus’s VAI now.

For the minters and users of AUSD, it may have two new values, making people willing to mint and use it:

* For the users of AUSD: Alpaca may first launch the leveraged yield farming scenario of AUSD within the ecosystem, which can make AUSD have an early usage scenario and income source and avoid the embarrassment of having no place to use. This is the main difference between AUSD and other pure stablecoin project — Alpaca itself can provide the early usage scenario for AUSD without the need of looking outside, which solves the problem of cold start.

Of course, AUSD will eventually need to expand its use cases beyond the Alpaca ecosystem, otherwise its ceiling will come soon. The expansion of the external scenario is ultimately determined by the size and product impact of Alpaca ecology.

# b. Institutional business

Introducing more institutional and professional-level investor funds to the platform may be one of Alpaca’s priorities in the second half of the year. In addition to the clues on the roadmap, this can be confirmed by two other events.

First, in early June, Alpaca has set up a company; second, the team has begun to recruit ToB positions such as head of business director, head of institutional growth, and head of institutional sales, and now there are already some candidates in the negotiation.

The establishment of a company can enable the project to better meet the qualification requirements of other party in the cooperation with institutions, especially traditional financial institutions. In addition, the recruitment of institutional positions indicates that the team will shift its business focus to serving institutions.

Why does the institutional business become the focus of the project? This may be determined by industry trends and Alpaca’s own product positioning. In the view of industry trend, the rapid growth in the crypto world is far from halting, and the space for investment, arbitrage, and trading opportunities is much larger than that of the traditional financial market. As long as the compliant channels for access to DeFi gradually become smooth, institutional funds will inevitably start to earn princely sums. The stablecoin yield products with a fixed return rate of 4% recently launched by Compound and Coinbase have demonstrated this trend. They are very attractive for institutional assets in the global low interest rate environment.

In terms of Alpaca’s products, the leveraged yield farming on the platform and subsequent more complex derivative trading tools have extreme high thresholds of understanding and practice to most ordinary users. Only professional players and institutions with professional data modeling capabilities and mature arbitrage experience are the best service targets for such products. Although the absolute number of such users is far less than retail players, the overall amount of their funds is far higher than that of retail players.

So why are institutional users willing to use Alpaca instead of traditional derivatives tools? In other words, after the token rewards of liquidity farming have faded, is there still any gold worth digging in the DeFi market? This answer may also be yes.

The reason behind this is that the underlying transaction mechanism of DeFi liquidity farming such as AMM, is different from the traditional transaction matching mechanism. The gaining source of liquidity farming is also more complex and non-linear. On the one hand, the gold farming opportunities come from the rapid growth of the crypto market, on the other hand, it comes from the radical change of the rules. This is a “new gold mine” different from the traditional financial market.

For example, in the communication with some senior users in the Alpaca community, they said that professional users choose leveraged yield farming as one of arbitrage tools. On the one hand, they can earn farming gains by using leveraged yield farming. This is the first type of non-loss (interest) derivative, which can make up for the loss of other derivatives combined with it. More importantly, the capital fluctuation curves of leveraged yield farming and options are different, and the intersection of different yield curves can bring low-risk arbitrage opportunities. It is worth mentioning that the game environment of DeFi products is more complicated due to its composability and openness. While amplifying uncertainty and risks, there will also be more arbitrage opportunities that can be flexibly captured.

What’s more is that even for the types of institutional clients that would use simple products like BlockFi, Celsius, Compound, and Coinbase to seek 4% interest, Alpaca can also offer at least this APY as well as doing it with no lockup and in non-custodial, decentralized fashion.

The Alpaca team may have increased its resource investment in institutional services based on the prediction of the above trends.

# c. Improve the composability of protocols

At present, Alpaca’s protocol interaction mainly comes from the direct use of users and calls from the protocol are less frequent, because the function of leveraged yield farming is far more complicated than the DeFi aggregators and the basic lending protocols. Q3 Alpaca will add its SDK to facilitate the use of leveraged yield farming function by external protocols. It is a very important means to enhance the level of business by improving the composability of protocols. Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, said in a recent AMA that currently nearly 80% of Aave’s transaction volume comes from the call of external protocols, which also makes Aave one of the most successful basic protocols on the Ethereum. In addition, innovative products such as cross-asset leveraged yield farming will be launched in the future.

# 4. Alpaca team

As a DeFi project that was born only 4 months ago, the Alpaca team is still mysterious and anonymous. It has not disclosed any information about its core members and has never given any relevant information on the number of team members, job position composition and geographical distribution.

When asked about their anonymity, their Head of Strategy Samsara responded by saying, “Our team is distributed all over the world, and we want to focus on building the best products rather than having to worry about changing macroeconomic climates in various jurisdictions, which often flip-flop on a quarterly basis, potentially hampering innovation and execution. The reality is that this is DeFi and we’re working with 100% open-source smart contracts. That means our code logic is deterministic, verifiable, and trustless. That’s true regardless of what the developers’ names are, just as it was true when blockchain was first invented by an anonymous figure, Satoshi.”

But such an anonymous team is impressive in the following aspects:

# 4.1. Fast product iteration and responsiveness

Obviously the Alpaca team is a believer and practitioner of “agile development”. The so-called agile development refers to a set of methodology which takes the evolution of user needs as the core and adopts an iterative and step-by-step approach to develop new software. Its principles include: advocating simplicity, embracing change, incremental improvement, fast feedback, and moving forward with light burdens, etc.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1uwos0rbjua71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748d2618789a223633b0fbf85af9972e09ae7ff8

Alpaca has a rich document library with six versions: English, Chinese, Thai, French, Portuguese and Russian. If you browse through the documentation of the top DeFi projects, including those that have been around for much longer, you’ll find most of them lack language support beyond English. Alpaca is promoting the project with such a work and product idea, which is reflected in the perceptible external aspects such as community management, product interaction, code efficiency, and document arrangement, etc.

In terms of product iterations, Alpaca has maintained a state with steady introduction of major functions and intensive small improvements. Here the major functions mainly refer to the core functions that can be placed on the product roadmap, such as the leveraged yield farm (LFY) recently launched and dual-asset lending. Small improvements include a quick response to detailed requirements, such as “whether users can add the real-time price on the position opening page to avoid the opening loss due to price changes.”

The agility and rapid response of the team can also be seen in another emergency. After the launch of Alpaca, it quickly attracted nearly 1 billion TVL within a week due to its original open source code, refreshing interactive pages and interesting image of alpaca. However, on March 4, Alpaca’s similar project — Meerkat Finance (MKAT) vanished a day after the launch, raising questions about the safety of the Alpaca project itself. In half a day, the TVL plummeted by nearly 30% (from 1 billion to 700 million). After the incident, Alpaca team quickly responded on Twitter and the community on the same day, giving a transparency statement and reiterating that they were conducting an audit with Peckshield and another company. On March 5, it launched the bug bounty program to encourage bug catching with high bonus. On March 6, the team announced the result of bug bounty and made amendments. As a new project that had launched for only one week, the professionalism and participation of its community users and the team’s response speed are impressive.

The diligence of the project on the product side can also be proved by the update frequency on Github. Alpaca’s code update volume and frequency are almost the highest on BSC now.

# 4.2. Innovation capability

Alpaca is not the pioneer of leveraged yield farming, whose original practitioner was Alpha (later expanded to BSC) deployed on Ethereum. However, Alpaca did not completely fork Alpha’s code, but made a lot of innovations based on its code framework, and this laid the foundation for more innovative functions as well as risk prevention in the future. So far, Alpaca’s innovations compared with Alpha include two-way asset lending (Alpha’s recent V2 version has also begun to support it), leveraged yield farm, AUSD stablecoins, and cross-asset lending. In addition, there are more user-DeFined options when opening positions.

# 4.3. Deep understanding of Meme culture

With the popularity of DeFi trend and the outbreak of Dogecoin and Shiba this year, the word “Meme” has been repeatedly mentioned in the community as well as the communication and operation of DeFi projects.

Meme refers to a popular Internet culture gene copied and spread in derivative way. It is a bit similar to the “gag culture” in Chinese.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jcvd6u7ejua71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a76d9a812cc70c7f105c9f7798c8053c76d4e72

The most successful representative of meme culture in the coin circle is the Dogecoin with dog head as the token symbol. The spiritual core of meme culture in the crypto world is to reduce seriousness, with anti-authority and geek spirit.

Alpaca chose alpaca as the mascot of the project and said formally in the beginning of the official document: Alpaca — what a majestic animal! We can’t think of a better mascot to represent our ethos.

* Alpacas love to live in the mountains at high altitudes… **They will make your farming yields sky-high once you become their friend.**
* Alpacas come in 22 gorgeous colors… **We will offer many farming pools for you to choose from.**
* Alpacas are green animals; they have a very light carbon footprint, and 95% of their wool is usable… **Sending transactions on BSC is incredibly efficient and will cost you much less gas than on other chains, maximizing your yields.**
* Alpacas do not bite, and lack sharp teeth… **Everything about our project is transparent and verifiable; there will be no rug pull!**
* Alpacas are a great investment; they’re inexpensive to raise, require small acreage, and provide a regular supply of wool… **Our protocol’s leveraged positions will allow you to amplify your profit potential, providing higher yields on less capital.**

Within a few days after the launch, the developers changed the image of Alpaca for many times, and the combined IP images include Harry Potter, Laser Eye, etc. Most surprisingly to Chinese users, Alpaca even grayed out the page and created an image of alpaca honoring Yuan Longping on the death day of Yuan Longping, the father of hybrid rice in China.

&amp;#x200B;

 The community inherited the alpaca meme culture from the core team. Community users continuously redeveloped the image of alpaca and created a large number of theme emoticons, which became a unique cultural language in the community, as shown in the below figure: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qomubtrljua71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f9bccd716fb60798a47343f3fff59aacc3d0fc

 4.4. Emphasis and investment on safety

The team attaches great importance to the security of funds and contracts. It arranged security audits by Peckshield and Certik before the official functions were launched. Alpaca is one of the few profitable projects that had not been affected during the period of May to June when BSC security incidents occurred frequently.

Oracle and lightning loan attacks are the most frequent attack methods on BSC. In order to prevent and control this risk, Alpaca has launched a set of exclusive risk control mechanisms, which is called as “Oracle Guard”. To be specific, when the price of an assets in a user’s farming pair from the DEX (PancakeSwap) differ more than 10% from the median of a batch of off-chain oracles verified by Alpaca, the Oracle Guard will enter the protection mode. This consists of disabling liquidations, opening and closing positions, and adding collateral, all of which aim to protect users from trading at bad prices and taking an unjust loss.

In the interviews with community users, many users mentioned the team’s focus on code security and transparency. They said that the team would cooperate with community volunteers with code audit ability to conduct multiple audits before submitting the official audit, while maintaining open source code. This practice of community participation in audits not only improves the community’s trust in the project, but also enhances code security and work efficiency.

In the evaluation of BSC by DeFi Safety on June 12 of this year, Alpaca’s safety score ranked the first. Considering the update speed of Alpaca products and the complexity of its business, this result is really incredible.

# 4.5. Summary

Alpaca team’s hard work in agile development, innovation ability, grasp of meme culture and strong guarantee on security are all impressive and highly recognized by the community. Moreover, Alpaca has not received external venture capital, nor has it issued coins for financing through IDO or IEO. This team has always maintained a high development morale and rapid product iteration, showing the maturity of senior practitioners in the product direction. Where does their motivation come from?

I think this closely related to the economic incentive mechanism of Alpaca which is different from other projects, which will be analyzed in the following section of “Token model analysis”.

# 5. Business analysis

# 5.1. Industry prospect and potential

Alpaca’s business started from leveraged yield farming. This year, it is expected to start the stablecoin, cross-asset leverage and other businesses. It can be seen as a derivatives and currency market providing services for decentralized market makers. Different from centralized exchanges, the liquidity of DEX is almost entirely provided by market makers. In addition, compared with the high threshold of market markers in the centralized exchanges, DEX allows every ordinary user to come and provide liquidity through the AMM model so they can harvest transaction fee yields. Therefore, the total liquidity of DEX in the AMM model can be regarded as the total scale of market-making capital.

 

https://preview.redd.it/7cknu83ojua71.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d12b04661c3b62e0852df5046f46533e8e6c028

According to the data of Debank on July 1, 2021, the top ten DEXs with AMM mechanism have locked US $33.77 billion of market-making liquidity (almost half of the total locked value of DeFi). This can be regarded as the upper limit of the market scale for professional market makers, and this amount is still growing.

As mentioned in the chapter “Basic information”, Alpaca’s leveraged market-making products are relatively complex, more suitable for professional market makers or institutions with arbitrage modeling capabilities (or the ability to use arbitrage models). So, in the current US $33.77 billion DEX market-making world, how much does the professional market-making capital account for?

We don’t know the specific figures for the time being. However, according to The Block research analyst Igor erdiev’s capital calculation for Wintermute, the current largest market maker in the crypto field, its total market-making capital on CEX and DEX are at least US $55 million. Wintermute is an algorithmic market maker specifically designed for cryptocurrencies, providing market-making services on almost all mainstream CEXs. Its weekly trading volume on Bitfinex is approximately US $2 billion, twice that of the second place. It is also one of the largest market makers on DEX platforms such as Synthetix, Tokenlon, and dydx.

Even so, the market-making capital of US $55 million does not account for a large proportion in the whole crypto world, and even in the DEX world. I believe that with the development of DEX and the popularity of compliant channels, more and more market-making institutions will enter the market-making field of DEX and increase the proportion of their market-making capital. Such kind of professional clients are the target users of Alpaca.

Given that decentralized trading platforms are the most important infrastructure in the crypto world, as well as the long-term trend of professional market-making capital to increase the share of DEX liquidity, the potential market size of Alpaca is also large and expected to expand rapidly.

# 5.2. Token model analysis

Alpaca adopts a single token model. Alpaca is not only the governance token of the project, but also realizes deflation through profit repurchase and burn to enhance the intrinsic value of Alpaca tokens.

At present, the sources of Alpaca’s repurchase funds currently mainly come from three parts:

* Loan interest: Alpaca will charge 10% of the loan interest as protocol fee, of which 5% will be used to buy back Alpaca and 5% will be controlled by the team as the operating capital of the project.
* The team’s liquidation robot will receive 5% of the liquidation reward through liquidation works, 100% of which will be used to buy back and burn Alpaca. It should be noted that the liquidation of Alpaca is open to all users, so its liquidation robot may not be able to scramble for the liquidation right, so the income is uncertain.
* Handling fee for leveraged yield farm yield: Alpaca will charge a 19% handling fee for the yield of leveraged yield farm (CAKE farming is currently launched), of which 10% is used to buy back Alpaca and distribute it to its deposit users, and 9% will be used as operating capital of the project and controlled by the team.

In addition to the above three sources of repurchase funds, Alpaca can obtain more sources of repurchase funds with the development of more new businesses. For example, in the recent communication with the Chinese community, Samsara who is the core member of the team, said that in the future a certain proportion of 5% of the third-party robot revenue will be used to repurchase Alpaca, and the overall liquidation revenue in the highly volatile market will also become a value source for Alpaca.

In addition, in the communication with Samsara who is the core member of Alpaca, **he mentioned that in the future Alpaca will increase the proportion of the above protocol revenue that would be used to buy back and burn Alpaca, ensuring that more than 50% of the protocol revenue would go to the holders of Alpaca.**

**New attempt of team motivation**

Readers familiar with the token economy model of DeFi projects may be surprised to see this: shouldn’t Alpaca’s protocol revenue be captured by the project token holders? Why does the team now take away more than 50% of Alpaca protocol revenue?

Alpaca’s core team did share a large percentage of the protocol revenue. In fact, in addition to the above revenue, the team also collects a 3% handling fee from the token reward reinvestment of DEX liquidity farming and 8.7% of the output from the Alpaca token from liquidity farming. This process will last for two years until all tokens are distributed.

I think this is also one of the core reasons why the Alpaca team is so effective. Although it sounds a little unusual for more than 50% of protocol revenue to be attributed to the team rather than to the holders, this may be a more reasonable team incentive model.

If we think that blockchain\\DeFi entrepreneurship is similar to traditional Internet entrepreneurship, we will find that the existing incentive model of blockchain team is a bit weird: The entire DeFi cash flow income belongs to the token holders. The core team (mainly the founding team) does not receive wages, and their incentives either come from the continuous unlocking of free team shares in the early stages of the project, or from a certain percentage of token distribution generated by fair farming. It’s as if the startup team doesn’t get paid, lives on unlocking and realizing cash from the initial offerings and options in the early stage of the startup and pays the company’s daily fixed expenses.

This model may cause two negative effects:

* At the later stage of the project development, as the actual professional manager of the project, the startup team will lose their economic motivation to keep striving.
* Due to the lack of sufficient daily economic income, the team is unable to carry out measures such as team expansion in the important development periods, limiting its development speed.

The above statement is not scaremongering. Stani Kulechov, the founder of the well-known DeFi protocol Aave, said in a recent AMA that the core team may gradually drift away from the development and operation of the project after completing the development of Aave2.5, and it is planning to start a new WEB3 venture project.

The model adopted by Alpaca is more like the business model of traditional startup companies: the protocol obtains operating income through the provision of financial services. Part of the income is used for costs and expenses (the core team uses it to pay for operating costs, including wages and office space, etc.), and the remaining part is retained as net profit for shareholders (token holders).

On the one hand, this profit distribution model ensures that the core team has a stable cash flow income to maintain expenses, on the other hand, the team’s income is also consistent with the growth of the project, because the team’s income will increase with the growth of the overall protocol revenue. This model avoids the problem of team incentives and project decoupling in the later stage of project development.

In this model, the principal-agent problem between professional managers (founding team) and shareholders (token holders) with option incentives (continuous token distribution) seems to be alleviated to a certain extent.

In the end, it will take time to observe and test whether this model is better than the existing model of “governance tokens to capture all protocol revenue”, which is a long-term road to explore.

The author argues that in this process, Alpaca holders need to observe the following:

i. Under the condition of getting more protocol revenue, does the core team have higher work efficiency than other teams and make the pie bigger more efficiently?

ii. Is the team willing to gradually transfer the distribution proportion of protocol revenue and increase the revenue capture ratio of token holders after the protocol revenue pie becomes bigger? Because as the total protocol revenue grows, the proportion of the team’s fixed expenses and labour costs in total revenue should decline.

# 5.3. Competition landscape

# Project moat and source of competitive advantage

As a platform providing financial services to market makers, Alpaca’s moat mainly comes from the following points:

* **Core team with excellent comprehensive quality.** This is reflected in agile development and product iteration capabilities, skilled application of Meme culture, accurate grasp of industry trends, and a good balance between project capital utilization rate and risks.
* **Good community atmosphere.** Due to the complexity and professionalism of the products, the average level of users in the Alpaca community is high, with good trading and financial knowledge as well as code talents. The community has given the team great help in the development of third-party tools, document compilation, production of communication materials, production of opening model tools, code audit, product strategy, community operation management and many other aspects of the project. In addition, the internal community is very united.
* **First-mover advantage of the project in product\\model\\risk management\\TVL.** The design of DeFi leveraged yield farming products is complicated. As an early project in this field, Alpaca has a certain first-mover advantage over the latecomers in terms of product and model experience accumulation.

In the traditional value investment concept, the moat of an enterprise mainly comes from intangible assets (brands, patents, franchise rights), network effect, switching cost (after users use it, the cost to replace the product is very high) and cost advantage (from the scale, geographic location, resources, etc., that are hard to imitate). These competitive advantages that are difficult to shake and hard to imitate prevent new competitors from entering the market to compete with existing players.

So, is the moat theory of traditional value investment still applicable in the blockchain field?

First, let’s look at the patent licensing of intangible assets. In the DeFi field, patents and franchises are rare due to the open source code as well as the transparency and openness of blockchain. However, Uniswap has applied for BUSL1.1(The Business Source License) for their V3 code, prohibiting other projects from forking its codes for commercial purpose without permission. It is said that Alpaca will also begin to apply for code protection for its original function codes (single-asset leverage, cross-asset lending), prohibiting other projects from forking without permission for a period of time.

However, due to the anonymity of a large number of DeFi projects, the protective effect of the license still needs to be observed. There have already been instances of anonymous projects forking Uniswap V3 code before.Still, such projects that make blatantly “illegal forks” are much less likely to receive support from investors, the ecosystem(blockchain and exchanges) or potential partners, both for liability reasons and negative PR.

The brand effect of intangible assets in the DeFi field primarily comes from the safety and longevity of the project, rather than from emotional factors. The longer a DeFi runs without risk, the more users believe in its reliability and tend to use it. For example, many users dare to use Compound and Aave even though they do not have the ability to audit the codes, just because these products have experienced a long time test and multiple rounds of extreme market stress tests.

Network effect has outstanding effects in the fields of public chains and stablecoins, but not in DeFi projects so far.

In terms of cost advantage, since the development cost of DeFi projects comes more from the intellectual capital of team members, i.e., staff salaries, it is almost impossible to build cost barriers and thus the moat of cost advantages is also very rare.

Switching costs exist for some basic DeFi platforms that are widely adopted by external protocols, because other DeFi projects may require adjustments to their overall models and new security audits if they want to replace a piece of their own DeFi Lego. Secondly, institutional users may also have a high switching cost for their arbitrage tools. They need to conduct a complete preliminary investigation on their cooperation platforms, including the understanding of platform security, stress resistance under extreme conditions, team ability, service stability, future product roadmaps and ways to deal with competition. This evaluation process often takes 3–6 months. Due to the high cost of evaluation and decision-making, organizations do not easily change their DeFi partners if there are no safety accidents. On the contrary, individual users easily quit a DAPP to use a newer or better one because their switching costs on specific products are very low.

In general, due to the openness and transparency of blockchain and the autonomy of user account rights, it is more difficult to charge high “monopoly rents” than traditional industries to form a monopoly advantage in the DeFi field. This also means that the core team of DeFi projects must continue to update its knowledge, iterate products, improve its own protocol composability and always prioritize user needs, so that it may not be caught up by later innovators.

**In other words, the core team itself is the most critical “moat” for most DeFi projects.**

# 5.4. Basic risks

# a. Main internal risks

* The team’s product development progress or market expansion is not as good as expected, especially in the institutional market. Risk level: Medium
* Bad debts caused by black swan events such as extreme market conditions and smart contract vulnerabilities. Risk level: low

# b. Main external risks

* Track competition is intensified: more professional and excellent teams will enter the market-maker service track with the support of capital, lowering the overall operating profit of the industry. Risk level: Medium
* Cryptocurrency enters a bear market: the crypto world has a distinct cycle. When a bear market cycle comes, the transaction volume of the entire trading market will decline significantly, and so will the profits of market markers. This will also have a direct impact on Alpaca’s project revenue. Risk level: Medium

# 6. Token circulation and distribution

# 6.1. Total supply and total circulation

The total supply of Alpaca tokens is capped at 188 million. Now the total supply, total circulation and market capitalization of the tokens are as follows (unit: 1,000):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1zsa9t8rjua71.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e093dcc2894534bb09481a222a33bd0fda4a681b

 Alpaca’s farming bonous lasts for 2 years and will end in February 2023. The output declines monthly, as shown in the following figure:

https://preview.redd.it/3uuwxgmtjua71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb9de2990911a9f878264684313333ebadb63dcd

The monthly inflation ratio of project tokens will drop below 5% after July, and the subsequent inflation selling pressure will gradually decrease.

It should be noted that the project launched the Stronk fund pool in March due to the large output of token mining in the early days. Users can put the locked Alpaca tokens into the Stronk fund pool and obtain the lock-up certificate sAlpaca. In return, they will be rewarded with additional sAlpaca tokens (s means Stronk). On July 12, four months later, users can exchange sAlpaca tokens for Alpaca by 1:1. It is estimated that the total amount of principal and interest to be unlocked will reach about 30 million Alpaca, which will directly increase Alpaca’s market circulation by nearly 30%, causing short-term pressure on the token price. However, it should be noted that, in fact sAlpaca is a freely circulating certificate of deposit that can be exchanged with Alpaca in the secondary market, and the current exchange rate is close to 1:1

Therefore, the circulation pressure of 30 million locked Alpaca has conducted disguised transmission to the market through sAlpaca in advance. When 30 million sAlpaca can be exchanged for Alpaca, its impact may be relatively limited.

# 6.2. Token distribution

Among the 131 million tokens supplied by Alpaca, the main wallets distributed are as follows:

# 7. Preliminary valuation

# 7.1. Five core questions

**What business cycle is the project in? Maturity stage or the early and middle stage of development?**

The project is in the early stage of operation, the core functions of its products have been launched, and PMF (Product market fit) has been verified.

**Does the project have a solid competitive advantage? Where does it come from?**

The project has a certain competitive advantage, which mainly comes from the excellent team, the experience accumulation when the project was established early as well as the first-mover advantage in capital.

**Is the medium and long-term investment logic of the project clear? Is it in line with the industry trend?**

The project has a clear investment logic, and the main scenario is precise. It aims to provide financial services for market makers and it will expand to the its market share with the focus on the institutional market. In the future, DEX will still be the foundation of the industry development, and the professionalization and institutionalization trend of market makers will continue. So the development direction of the project is aligned well with the industry trend.

**What are the main variables in the operation of the project? Are these variables easy to quantify and measure?**

The main operation variables of the project are the business development progress and industry competition. They can be intuitively measured by the key function development and implementation speed of the project, TVL, capital utilization rate and other data, as well as the focus on the expansion of institutional customers.

**What is the management and governance of the project? What is the level of DAO?**

At present, directions of product development and protocol are primarily led by the core team. The community gives feedback on product experience and other aspects and promotes the core team to solve them. Alpaca has not yet launched the voting function. In the future, users need to stake their Alpaca tokens to get the voting rights and then attend commubity governance. The DAO is currently in the early preparation stage.

# 7.2. Summary of core investment logic

Alpaca is on a track with clear demands and continuous growth. The overall quality of the project is excellent, which is a high-potential project worthy of attention:

* The market size of market maker is basically the same as the total size of DEX. In the long run, it is in a rising period. In addition, the arrival of subsequent specialized institutions will help the business volume of high-end market-making financial products such as Alpaca continue to grow.
* The project has a very excellent and diligent team, whose innovation, product iteration speed, industry direction judgment, community operation, etc. are all reliable.
* The new developments followed may bring a huge marginal increase to overall revenue and the profits of token holders, including the convenience of more external protocol access after the development of SDK, the improvement of capital efficiency and new interest income brought by the launch of AUSD, and the business expansion.
* Alpaca currently lists on seceral CEXs includes Kucoin, MXC, and Gateio, but they have not launched on top exchanges, especially Binance.

# 7.3. Valuation assessment

Although Alpaca project has a clear cash flow, in theory we can apply the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value it. Given that DeFi is still an early market and the industry is developing rapidly with too many variables, it is likely to get a “accurate but wrong” answer if using the DCF model for valuation.

This research report mainly uses the relative valuation method to compare and Evalate Alpaca. It primarily compares the valuations of Alpaca and similar projects horizontally with the preliminary conclusion that the current market value is slightly undervalued.

# a. Comparison between Alpaca and leading lending projects

Since Alpaca actually is a niche segment of the lending track, how does its valuation compare with that of Aave, Compoud, and Maker? The comparison indicator we use here is PE, i.e., the project market cap\\project earnings attributed to token holders.

 

https://preview.redd.it/2bnctlcfkua71.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3c54481cc5d4a247a441cff98e2f80c7cf39de4

Based on the above data, we found that the PE of Aave and Compound is similar, while that of Makerdao is significantly lower and that of Alpaca is also lower. However, given the inconsistency of the token circulation ratios across projects, projects with low circulation ratios will face greater inflationary pressure in the future. After the author calculated the PE comparison after the circulation ratio adjustment, we found that Makerdao’s PE valuation advantage is more obvious, followed by Alpaca and Aave, while Compoud’s PE valuation is relatively high.

Of course, although the four projects are all lending projects, their business models are quite different, thus PE valuation can only be used as a reference indicator. Given that the Alpaca’s project development is in its early stage with many growth points of follow-up business, its adjusted PE of 69.8 is more attractive than the leading loan projects already in the mature period.

Of course, the reasons why Alpaca has a lower PE valuation may come from various sources, such as the project has not yet been launched in major exchanges, or it only provides services on the BSC now, or the project duration is shorter with higher uncertainty.

In summary, Alpaca’s current valuation is quite attractive.

# b. The current valuation range of the market

At present, the market as a whole is in a correction stage after the bull market (there are also opinions that it has entered a bear market), where the valuation center has been clearly adjusted with obvious market bubbles. In terms of BTC growth, the highest point of this bull market is US $64,510, which is only 222% higher than the last round’s top of US $20,000. In addition, after the correction, the current growth rate is about 65% (US $33,000), significantly lower than the overall growth rate of previous bull markets. From the perspective of time length, the time duration that the current bull market has risen from the bottom is far shorter from the length for the last bull market (see the figure below).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k6su7jygkua71.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c169364c930f2462d76e4d052116d9e8be81ef55

However, the recent policy environment of global liquidity easing has fallen into a delicate situation. Although the Biden administration is eager to launch its 6 trillion fiscal expenditure budget, some federal officials have suggested that reducing the scale of debt purchases should be put on the agenda. The market’s divergence on whether the turning point of liquidity will come early is widening.

Recently, China government has strengthened its supervision on mining and speculation, and many policies are pending, causing greater pressure on the market in the short term. The inflation effect of massive money printing on US stocks is further evident. The CPI of the United States rose by 5% year-on-year in May, the largest increase in 13 years. Rising prices will put pressure on the current loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, which may accelerate the pace of reducing debt purchases. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates in the first half of 2022, bringing a downward pressure on valuations of global risk asset market.

The increasing divergence of market trends will also have a direct impact on the valuation of a single project, which needs to be taken into consideration in asset allocation.

# 7.4. Summary of preliminary valuation

Alpaca serves the market of market makers with clear market demands. It is expected to maintain the current growth rate with the increase of the overall DEX market size and the proportion of institutional capital. Alpaca’s core competitive advantage is its excellent team, and also comes from scientific income distribution mechanism which ensures that the team has sufficient operating budget. In the future development, we need to focus on the expansion speed of Alpaca’s institutional market and its adoption by external protocols. Based on the comparison with the valuations of competitors and leading projects in the lending industry, the author believes that the current project valuation of Alpaca is in a reasonable low position.

\*The above statement is not regarded as investment advice.

# 8. Reference and acknowledgments

Trending as gainer on Coingecko already, with big partnerships (as in Gold Bullion-related) and more for Q3 2021",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ojk4fr/the_proto_gold_ecosystem_a_bigbrain_savings/,akejavel,1,2021-07-14 01:13:19,11,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ojk4fr/the_proto_gold_ecosystem_a_bigbrain_savings/,BSC Token,"Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad, earlier this week, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M. The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 900BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small mcap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out. But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

**Proto** is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity.  
**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.  
**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!**

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield  
2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

\- DORE bonus airdrop  
1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

**1:** 🟨 Discounted Gold Bullion 🟨  
Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

**2**: 🔄 ProtoSwap 🔄  
Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

**3**: 🎰 Lottery 🎰  
Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and Whitepaper in 6 languages already ready and live, with English, Mandarin, Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian live and more languages coming.

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

**DAO - community governance “Law” token.**  
Our voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! Early supporters who attend the presale or the IDO on Dxsale will be registered to receive on a 1 to 1 basis upon their Proto holdings an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the Law token. Everyone else will have to buy it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.

This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Check the previous [newsletter](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/makerdao-case-study-519) if you want more clarity.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced."

In MakerDAO’s ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced."

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.

This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

Amazing update for EVM-compatible chains, and smooth Layer 2 experience

With imToken 2.8.4 version supporting custom node function and EIP3085, imToken has been working hard to explore the smooth experience of Layer2. Meanwhile imToken always put safety as a top priority, this new version made a lot of efforts around “EVM compatible chain asset management” and “security” aspect, with a look :)
This update follows 👇👇👇
More friendly support for Polygon, xDai, Fantom, BSC, HECO, OKEx …
… Support token display for all EVM chains
… Optimized node switching with color
… Add DApp quick entry
Use imKey hardware wallet to transfer and receive Nervos (CKB)
Tron security update
More optimizations and repairs
Amazing update for asset management of your EVM-chains
Using new chains just got way easier.
With this update your tokens on Polygon, xDai, Fantom, BSC, HECO, OKEx and other EVM-compatible chains are automatically detected.
imToken now also shows your token prices on those new chains.
Using BSC or other DApps? Simply click on ‘Ecosystem Apps’ to start with Layer 2, BSC and others.

Left: BSC wallet; Right: BSC Apps
DeFi asset management on your EVM-chains
The ‘DeFi Portfolio Manager’ is our amazing new tool we introduced in last month’s update. To enter it, simply click on ‘DeFi’ to see all your DeFi balances such as dYdX, Uniswap, Aave, MDEX, Curve, Compound, MakerDAO balances and hundreds more. Read more on our blog.
The DeFi Portfolio now supports all kinds of new chains: Ethereum, BNB, xDAI, Polygon, Fantom, Heco … you name it!

For example, switch to ‘Binance Smart Chain’ and click ‘DeFi’ to see your DeFi Portfolio
In this update we also add a color scheme that lets you distinguish different EVM-compatible chains.

ETH = blue and BSC = yellow
TRON’s risk control security system upgrade
We received feedback about some scams — on TRON — that would ask people to enter their passwords on fake websites.
That’s why we fully upgraded our security system in a way that warns users about risky addresses, as reported by users or discovered by the imToken security team.
When you see the following icon on the TRON chain, please be aware of risks!

Risk reminders
Since other common scams involve DApps, we also strengthened the DApp warnings. Visiting a risky DApp on TRON will show you the reminder below.

DApp access risk reminder

DApp transfer risk reminder
imKey hardware wallet supports Nervos (CKB)
imKey is now officially supporting Nervos (CKB). If you hold CKB, you can upgrade to imToken 2.9.4, use imKey to manage CKB wallets and experience transfers.
This currency update does not require hardware replacement and does not involve firmware upgrades. It is suitable for any imKey hardware wallet. You can automatically upgrade through the application to get CKB support.

Adding EVM-compatible chains in imToken also means that you can now use BSC, xDAI, Polygon, HECO and so on with your imKey.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that
• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked
Costly &amp; lengthy property sales
Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
Liquidity for the middle class

Abundance of opportunities for all
Here’s how it works:
• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi 
with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  
•3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) 
Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   
•10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) 
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)
They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.
• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK
• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney
•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks
•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance
•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)
• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!

$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained
$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)
OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval 
OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS

How do they differ from their competitors?
Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :
• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯
• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐
• Legal Entity Created 🏢
• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳
• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦
• On MATIC chain✅
• Great Website
• Real asset oracle🚀
• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎
• Exchange listing later this year 👀
• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH
• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!
Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.
Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.
Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!
OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 
Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 

their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that
• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked
Costly &amp; lengthy property sales
Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
Liquidity for the middle class

Abundance of opportunities for all
Here’s how it works:
• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi 
with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  
•3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) 
Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   
•10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) 
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)
They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.
• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK
• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney
•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks
•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

How do they differ from their competitors?
Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

Farmers on #Polygon, are you ready? DinoSwap Deposits for the Fossil Farms open in less than 24 hours \~ July 15th at 12:00AM UTC. 

On DinoSwap, users will be able to stake the DINO token to earn the tokens of other projects on Polygon.

It is similar to PancakeSwap, but users stake DINO instead to get exposure to [Polygon-based projects](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polygon-vault-makerdao-matic-tokens/) and their native tokens.

The farms where users can earn tokens by staking DINO are called Fossil Farms.

The first Fossil Farms that are launching on DinoSwap are Bella Protocol, Dfyn Network, Benchmark Protocol, Aavegotchi, SportX, and Chain Guardians.

"Launchpads do offer the investors a way to reduce their risk exposures, and a way to add to their returns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/olpvnt/launchpads_do_offer_the_investors_a_way_to_reduce/,ryuk_luvs_apples,1,2021-07-17 04:57:22,1,/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/olpvnt/launchpads_do_offer_the_investors_a_way_to_reduce/,DISCUSSION,"First, to understand what we are going to talk about, we have to simplify the operational process of a crypto launchpad. To understand that, we have to know how projects raise money for their products or services. 

At first, a new project comes up with an idea, or a product that they want to develop. They create a token that will be a huge part of their planned platform. Tokens are sold in early access, at a discount price for investors, in order for projects to raise the funds needed to finance their plans. The platform that allow these sales activities are the launchpads. And then, as the project grows, the value of the token increases, and investors make money, but early investors make much more money. 

This is how launchpads offer investors a chance for a better investment, but how does such platform minimize the risk exposure? The investor is paying less than the original value of the token, so eventually the invested amount, which is the amount at risk, is less than it should be if the investor went for the token after it was released, which means that the loss is minimized already. 

This is why many investors are now looking for launchpads to invest their money in. Some of the most famous launchpads are Binance Launchpad, Kucoin Spotlight, and MakerDAO Pad. Also, an upcoming Launchpad project is gaining a lot of fame and momentum at the moment, it is Gpool.

Launcpads are a huge step forward for crypto trading, and it offers regular investors better chances with a less risky approach, however, no investment is riskless, an investor has to always make sure of his information before putting their money in any project."
👁 Oracle Solutions for Dummies 👁,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olq3tr/oracle_solutions_for_dummies/,yea-my-name,1,2021-07-17 05:09:06,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olq3tr/oracle_solutions_for_dummies/,MOONS 🌕,"Cryptocurrency price valuation fluctuates rapidly, it's why we love it. But in such a new, wild-west-like environment, there are many factors that can effect any given assets price, such as;  leverage, arbitrage, whales, FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), retail/institutional buying and selling. The list goes on. How do you really know what the actual value of an asset is at any given time when there are so many different factors at play? Furthermore, how do you know the exchange you purchase your crypto from is giving you the most accurate, up to date price feed for the asset you want to purchase? 

👁Oracle Solutions 👁

An oracle solution is essentially the ""all seeing eye"" for all partnered assets current price/activity feed. The oracle gives that information to all partnered exchanges/DEX's (decentralized exchanges) so there is little of a discrepancy possible between prices amongst buying platforms. Reducing arbitrage and stabilizing the fungibility of an asset.

Without a strong oracle solution bringing the most up to date, real time prices possible, assets would be disproportionate to one another amongst exchanges, along with being nearly impossible to truly evaluate the current state of an asset.

Examples of 👁Oracle Solutions 👁

\-Chainlink

\-Aurgur

\-Band Protocol

\-MakerDao

\*Extra Info\*

Chainlink is currently working on developing an NFT oracle solution. One of which I am personally very excited about. As far as my knowledge goes, they are the only platform working on developing one specifically for NFTs. It's incredibly hard to actually know a fair price for any given collectible. The true valuation of an NFT is whatever two parties are willing to sell/pay for it. You may be thinking, ""how is that any different from any other asset?"". Simply put, Fungibility. My bitcoin will always be the same price as your bitcoin, but a 1 of 1 NFT? Who makes that price.... Chainlink is working on a way to keep up to date tabs on NFT sales around the blockchain to see what other NFT's are selling for with similar qualities such as; minting, time of release, licensing , etc. To give users as accurate of a valuation as possible to what their NFT is worth!

DAI from MakerDAO is the obvious candidate that comes to my mind, but what others exist? [PegNet](https://pegnet.org/) looks interesting, but I don't have any personal experience with them.

Gitcoin Governance Token (GTC)? Am I delusional or is this actually a solid bet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/om9q6i/gitcoin_governance_token_gtc_am_i_delusional_or/,KiidDBuU,1,2021-07-18 02:23:53,0,/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/om9q6i/gitcoin_governance_token_gtc_am_i_delusional_or/,Discussion 🦍,"I've been looking through the other alt-tokens on Coinbase and stumbled across the GTC token that was released a month and a half ago (they airdropped 100M worth of GTC). I was curious and decided to read up on what it was. Its basically some sort governance alt token on Ethereum, that is used to help fund projects within the Gitcoin ecosystem, as well govern the Gitcoin ecosystem as well. 

 I'm thinking that demand for this will increase sooner or later, when Gitcoin's quadratic funding and platform become more popular. They already helped many big Blockchain projects like Cosmos, Harmony One, Filecoin/IPFS, Lido, and Aave to find developers and get funding. Since a lot of these web3 projects are open source they need to get funding somehow. Many of these project don't really have a solid business model. So they rely on the community to fund them. That's why Gitcoin exists, to help these companies get money, so they can continue to build and innovate. And the DAO essentially is what governs Gitcoin and how these funding mechanics operate. It's also used to help fund internal projects and research within Gitcoin itself. 

Imo I think the potential for this project is uncapped, because it's encompassing the whole Blockchain ecosystem. It's providing value to every open source Blockchain project there is, independent of it's underlying network. And many projects are relying on Gitcoin to get exposure and to market their technology. 

I'm curious to see what you guys think, does GTC have the potential to reach the hundreds, or thousands of dollars, like MakerDAO or Compounds DAO tokens? 

Rn it's $5, and the market cap is still very low. It's still very early to get in, that's why I'm considering doubling down on this. But I wanted to get your guys opinion on the subject matter.

Having collected over $30 million in fees in the last week, a cute NFT pet game called Axie Infinity is currently raking in more protocol revenue than Ethereum and Bitcoin, and more than the next 11 top-ranking dapps – that is, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Aave, Compound, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, MetaMask, Lido Finance, MakerDAO and Synthetix – combined. And in this case, its business model is designed so the people profiting from it are not just a bunch of crypto bros getting richer. It’s people farther down the food chain, those who are usually excluded from these kinds of life-changing moments of wealth creation.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  •3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   •10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) •  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATSHow do they differ from their competitors?
Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥🔥🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATSHow do they differ from their competitors?
Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

"Jax coins provide an alternative to DAI. They are non-collateralized but still stable, transparent, and secure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/on1ozl/jax_coins_provide_an_alternative_to_dai_they_are/,victoroshi99,1,2021-07-19 07:09:05,3,/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/on1ozl/jax_coins_provide_an_alternative_to_dai_they_are/,NaN," 

It will be noted that DAI has digressed from decentralization and marching towards complete centralized finance by adding centralized stablecoins as collateral in abnormally huge amounts. Not only that, the stealing of around $8.3 million in Ether which was tagged black Thursday which make the price of ETH fell down uncontrollably when investors cash out which further triggered panic sales which set a chain of liquidations of the collateral on the MakerDAO lending platform even though they manage to survive it on a long time.

Compared to DAI, [Jax coins](https://jax.network/) are non-collateralized and, therefore, completely decentralized, with no asset pegged to them. The price is market-based, thanks to the unique Jax.Network reward function, so if the demand for transactions rises, more coins are issued, and vice versa. If the price plummets, the number of coins for issuance is reduced. The issuance depends on two main factors, namely the user transaction demand and the cost structure associated with mining. The principle is quite simple. Stability in the purchasing power pegged to electricity costs, and not in value like other pegged or collateralized stablecoins, is one of the reasons why [Jax coins](https://jax.network/) can be massively adopted and outcompete existing fiat currencies."

**OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that**

• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

**Here’s how it works:**

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  •3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   •10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) •  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS**How do they differ from their competitors?**

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

Grayscale Unveils DeFi Fund Linked to New CoinDesk Index,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onihwo/grayscale_unveils_defi_fund_linked_to_new/,BTCrrsr,1,2021-07-20 01:13:26,6,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onihwo/grayscale_unveils_defi_fund_linked_to_new/,FINANCE," 

Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency investment manager, said Monday it has started a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, based on a new DeFi-specific index produced by CoinDesk’s TradeBlock division. 

The companies, both subsidiaries of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), wrote in a joint press release the Grayscale DeFi Fund provides “exposure to a selection of industry-leading DeFi protocols through a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.” The idea is that investors can allocate money toward DeFi without having to buy the tokens directly. 

DeFi, which consists of blockchain-based software protocols designed for the trading and lending of cryptocurrencies, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital-asset industry. The amount of collateral locked into the protocols has increased 19-fold over the past year to [about $50 billion](https://defipulse.com/), and prices for many of the platforms’ associated tokens have soared. 

“Based on the user adoption that we’re seeing around DeFi and DeFi protocols, we do think the future of this area is bright,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Monday on CoinDesk TV’s [First Mover](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/first-mover) program.

The fund is only open to “eligible individual and institutional accredited investors,” according to the press release. Grayscale said it “intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market” but added that “there is no guarantee this will be successful.” 

The CoinDesk DeFi Index is a new product from TradeBlock, one of the first firms to develop an index for professional investors to track [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) when it launched the [XBX Index](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/xbx) in 2014. CoinDesk announced its [purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-acquires-tradeblock-adding-indexes-and-pricing-to-news-events-offerings) of TradeBlock for an undisclosed sum in January.

The new index joins a growing list of offerings designed to help investors track prices for DeFi tokens and invest in them. Last month, the technology firm Amun [launched](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/25/2253105/0/en/Amun-Launches-Two-New-index-Tokens-To-Simplify-Access-To-The-Ethereum-DeFi-Ecosystem.html) two new crypto token products, the DeFi Index Token and DeFi Momentum Index.    

The cryptocurrency data firm Messari has a dedicated screening tool tracking 164 DeFi tokens. The average price of the tokens is up 395% this year, versus 8.3% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, and 160% for No. 2 [ether](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum).  

According to the press release, the CoinDesk DeFi index aims to provide a “broad-based, benchmark representation of DeFi protocols,” with assets [weighted](https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/) by their market capitalization.

As of July 1, 2021, the CoinDesk DeFi Index consisted of the following assets, with their market-capitalization-based weightings:

* [Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/price/uniswap) (UNI), 49.95%
* [Aave](https://www.coindesk.com/price/aave) (AAVE), 10.25%
* Compound (COMP), 8.38%
* Curve (CRV), 7.44%
* [MakerDAO](https://www.coindesk.com/price/maker) (MKR), 6.49%
* SushiSwap (SUSHI), 4.83%
* Synthetix (SNX), 4.43%
* [Yearn Finance](https://www.coindesk.com/price/yearn-finance) (YFI), 3.31%
* UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.93%
* Bancor Network Token (BNT), 2.00%

🔥| Introducing Proto Gold Ecosystem | Unique Codebase - 88% Max Supply Locked With Vesting Up To 5 Years | Whitepaper Released In 6 languages | Savings &amp; Rewards Protocol | Gold Bullion News Q3 2021 |,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/oo13g7/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,coreys9,1,2021-07-20 20:29:55,48,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/oo13g7/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,BSC Token,"# Take your time, it will worth reading. Welcome to $PROTO!

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks. 

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out. 

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion** 

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap** 

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery** 

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and **Whitepaper** in 6 languages already ready and live, with **English**, **Mandarin**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Russian** live and more languages coming.

Locked liquidity 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**DAO** \- community governance “**Law**” token.

Your voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! LAW was used recently in the first 3 community votes, to upgrade the code &amp; become compatable with BSCSCAN &amp; extended lockup periods of ones own wallets volunteralry. 

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**The Ecosystem Explained in more detail.**

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks.

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out.

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Locked liquidity 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**DAO** \- community governance “**Law**” token.

Your voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! LAW was used recently in the first 3 community votes, to upgrade the code &amp; become compatable with BSCSCAN &amp; extended lockup periods of ones own wallets volunteralry.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**The Ecosystem Explained in more detail.**

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

Welcome to $PROTO!

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks.

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out.

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and **Whitepaper** in 6 languages already ready and live, with **English**, **Mandarin**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Russian** live and more languages coming.

Locked liquidity 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**DAO** \- community governance “**Law**” token.

Your voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! LAW was used recently in the first 3 community votes, to upgrade the code &amp; become compatable with BSCSCAN &amp; extended lockup periods of ones own wallets volunteralry.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**The Ecosystem Explained in more detail.**

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

🔥Introducing Proto Gold Ecosystem | Unique Codebase - 88% Max Supply Locked With Vesting Up To 5 Years | Whitepaper Released In 6 languages | Savings &amp; Rewards Protocol | Gold Bullion News Q3 2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiBets/comments/oo30i2/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,MarvellaKlumpp,1,2021-07-20 22:22:34,2,/r/SatoshiBets/comments/oo30i2/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,NaN,"# Take your time, it will worth reading. Welcome to $PROTO!

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks.

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out.

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

You can tokenise your house and sell 49% while still retaining majority ownership! This allows for liquidity from traditional illiquid assets (you could own 10% of a Picasso, Ford Mustang or even a part of the London Shard. 

Who can benefit from Omnia DeFi?

Millennials who are struggling to get on the property ladder 

People in the developing world who are land rich but lack the cash to invest in themselves!

Middle class who own illiquid assets and are cash strapped!

The tokenised land which will be registered on the blockchain will be laying down the foundations of web 3 infrastructure (This is the modern day equivalent of building Airports, highways or railroads!)

So great.... What are their killer features?

**Fundamentals**

Serious project not a MEME coin ⛔️ 

Will start tokenising AFTER regulated (this is so operations don’t get put down by the SEC/FCA)

Aggressive Burn Mechanisms &amp; Unique Tokenomics closely tied to business model, the more art &amp; real estate Omnia DeFi onboard the more $OMNIA they burn!

$500 M worth of Art &amp; Real estate COMMITTED to the project!

Here’s the TLDR for you guys🔌🔋

You can tokenise your house and sell 49% while still retaining majority ownership! This allows for liquidity from traditional illiquid assets (you could own 10% of a Picasso, Ford Mustang or even a part of the London Shard. 

Who can benefit from Omnia DeFi?

Millennials who are struggling to get on the property ladder 

People in the developing world who are land rich but lack the cash to invest in themselves!

Middle class who own illiquid assets and are cash strapped!

The tokenised land which will be registered on the blockchain will be laying down the foundations of web 3 infrastructure (This is the modern day equivalent of building Airports, highways or railroads!)

Take your time, it will worth reading. Welcome to $PROTO!

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks.

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out.

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and **Whitepaper** in 6 languages already ready and live, with **English**, **Mandarin**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Russian** live and more languages coming.

Locked liquidity 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**DAO** \- community governance “**Law**” token.

Your voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! LAW was used recently in the first 3 community votes, to upgrade the code &amp; become compatable with BSCSCAN &amp; extended lockup periods of ones own wallets volunteralry.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**The Ecosystem Explained in more detail.**

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

Getting a picture of the entirety of DeFi is kind of complicated (I definitely don't understand it all), but for the sake of this post, DeFi i'm referring to is the series of applications developed to enable various ""decentralized"" financial functions on the blockchain.  

The 2 most popular functions being Crytpo Lending/Borrowing and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

Crypto holders are incentivized to participate in DeFi as a means of ""Yield Farming"". Basically, parking crypto assets into a liquidity pool so it can earn interest and fees, paid out in the form of an app-specific token.  Sometimes the annual interest returns are huge.

Cypto borrowers get a great deal through these apps too. Put up some coins as collateral, and in return you get instant access to liquidity. No credit checks, no applications... all automated. 

There is a lot of opaqueness in the DeFi market and like I said, I don't fully understand it all. What I understand for sure is:

1. DeFi depends on a consistent stream of incoming liquidity
2. DeFi also depends on the volume of transactions on the network (to collect fees)
3. The price stability of tokens on DeFi apps rely on arbitrage traders (a lot of this in the form of bots)
4. People who get into DeFi projects early see much higher returns. As returns drop, they move their liquidity elsewhere.

All fine in a controlled environment. But here's where I see it going all wrong.   
As the crypto market heated up in 2020, money began flooding into DeFi applications.  Since DeFi allows traders to leverage their assets to make bigger transactions...this in turn helped prop up the entire crypto market with a surge of new liquidity.  After all, all of those tokens previously sitting idle in people's wallets were now being put to work. 

The amount of value just locked into DeFi is now astronomical, currently somewhere over $66 Billion (down from a peak of almost $100 billion).  

But as the DeFi world started to heat up, more and more dApps came into the fold promising increasing interest and rewards. Interest rates in these pools are almost always higher when the coin or token supply is low and demand is high....as more people rush to participate, the yield returns typically drop.  

So we saw Yield Farmers getting increasingly sophisticated. To maximize rewards, many lenders would run their tokens between different pools chasing the highest returns. 

Yield farmers also would then re-invest the tokens received from one liquidity pool, into separate liquidity pools on other dApps for THAT token.  Creating complicated daisy chains of returns. 

To stretch things even thinner...many yield farmers would use their yields as collateral to BORROW more assets, then invest those in liquidity pools, to further increase their returns.

The economics behind this are pretty mind-numbing. Its akin to the mortgage backed securities situation in 2008. Basically....tons of collateralized ""junk"" assets are being traded, all based off a pool of inherently risky &amp; volatile crypto assets.  Remember, the market for these tokens only exists on DeFi.

Honestly its hard to wrap my head around. But I do know all of it depends on new liquidity and volume coming into the systems, and the value of the underlying tokens remains stable or growing.

So the big glaring question is....what the heck happens when the liquidity dries up or the value of the tokens drop off a cliff?

We've already seen multiple times how a dApp can have a meltdown.

* In Mar 2020, we saw the MakerDAO liquidity crisis . Basically, ETH price dropped...people rushed to  stablecoin DAI, and the app also triggered automatic liquidations (which malfunctioned). This caused a huge shortage of DAI on the system, and people to lose out big time.  [https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos)
* Later in Sept. 2020 we saw the SushiSwap rug pull. Long story short...a billion dollars flooded into SushiSwap DEX...then the developer pulls out all of his liquidity suddenly. The underlying token value plummeted...but so did the price of Etherium (by 30%+), and subsequently bitcoin. 
* Then last month we saw the IRON/TITAN ""bank run"".... investors tried to redeem their stablecoins and sell the asset, leading to a massive selloff that tanked the token price to $0 [https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem](https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem)

So we already know potential consequences that can happen.   
 **1) bank runs on DeFi tokens are possible.**   
 **2)  A sharp drop in the value of any of the assets in a liquidity pool can lead to mass liquidations,**  
**3) When the value of DeFi tokens plummet suddenly, it takes the ""mainstream"" crypto market down with it**  
**4) All of this also has the potential to unpeg stablecoins**

As far as I can tell, all it would take is for the underlying crypto asset price of Etherium or Bitcoin to crash low enough to trigger mass liquidations. Suddenly, you're left with a huge flight of liquidity, and tons of ""empty"" token pairs. As traders rush to get their tokens exchanged for ""safer"" assets, the liquidity pools are drained, and gas prices skyrocket. These combined effects could in-turn shut down the entire arbitrage and liquidation markets...all resulting in complete price instability. 

It would cause a catastrophic ripple effect throughout the entire market.  Once all of that leveraged lending goes away, and thousands of coins are unlocked/ sold onto the open market, it will be apocalyptic for crypto prices.  

Whether individual projects are ""good"" and some are ""bad"", doesn't really matter in this case. They've pretty much all been linked together in some way. If the biggest domino falls at the top, the rest come with it. 

Tbh, its kind of horrifying. 

**TL;DR:** The current DeFi ecosystem seems like the 2008 mortgage crisis, Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, and Amway all rolled into one...and its going to collapse when the price of Bitcoin / Etherium drop too low. Only this time, there's not going to be a bailout. Am I reading into this wrong?"

# What Is Alchemix?

Alchemix calls itself a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform. You receive yield from the collateral capital. To understand how Alchemix works, check out our detailed analysis. In this article, we focus on comparing stablecoins that are backed by stablecoins.

# Question: Why Use A Stablecoin To Back A Stablecoin?

Why would anyone deposit a stablecoin ($DAI) to borrow less stablecoin ($alUSD)? We compare some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Alchemix protocol below and compare it with Maker.

### Strengths

* No kind of stability fees (as compared to MakerDAO)
* No kind of liquidation fees
* Yields are generated from collateral automatically
* Simple and easy to use (not as complicated)

### Weaknesses

* Opportunity cost of collateral
* $alUSD, the stablecoin does not have much utility for it to gain traction
* $ALCX tokens currently have no utility other than governance
* Much more centralised compared to other protocols

We note that the main value proposition that Alchemix brings for its users is that a loan will repay itself over time. In general, users pay less fees and do not have to worry about being liquidated from their collateral. Traditionally, users of $DAI deposit their stablecoin in a lending protocol such as Compound or Aave and earn interest. With Alchemix, they can expand their capital base to either leverage on their positions or finance a self-repaying loan.

# Comparison: Alchemix vs Maker

&gt;Which protocol mints a token using the same token of value? Why?

To put things into perspective, we compare Alchemix to a similar form of protocol. This protocol should also accept asset as collateral to mint another asset of the exact same value. Both assets should remain on the same blockchain system. BTC and wBTC do not count because BTC exists on the Bitcoin blockchain network while wBTC exists on the Ethereum blockchain network.With that in mind, we have Maker and Alchemix.

* Maker uses $USDC to mint $DAI
* Alchemix uses $DAI to mint $alUSD

**TLDR**:There is a use case for Alchemix users to borrow stablecoins from their collateral. However, the comparison to MakerDAO in the example might not be a good comparison because they serve a different function for their respective protocols.In MakerDAO, $USDC deposits are used as a backstop to prevent $DAI stablecoin from being unpegged — rather than to actually borrow $DAI. In the case of Alchemix, deposits serve as collateral for users to borrow a loan that is being rewarded with yields. They sell a completely different value proposition. For now, it appears that Alchemix has no close competitors that compete for their market share. However, it would need to greatly increase utility for its stablecoin $alUSD and its governance token $ALCX for the protocol to truly shine."

In general, users pay less fees and do not have to worry about being liquidated from their collateral. Traditionally, users of $DAI deposit their stablecoin in a lending protocol such as Compound or Aave and earn interest. With Alchemix, they can expand their capital base to either leverage on their positions or finance a self-repaying loan.

# Comparison: Alchemix vs Maker

&gt;Which protocol mints a token using the same token of value? Why?

To put things into perspective, we compare Alchemix to a similar form of protocol. This protocol should also accept asset as collateral to mint another asset of the exact same value. Both assets should remain on the same blockchain system. BTC and wBTC do not count because BTC exists on the Bitcoin blockchain network while wBTC exists on the Ethereum blockchain network.With that in mind, we have Maker and Alchemix.

* Maker uses $USDC to mint $DAI
* Alchemix uses $DAI to mint $alUSD

**TLDR**:There is a use case for Alchemix users to borrow stablecoins from their collateral. However, the comparison to MakerDAO in the example might not be a good comparison because they serve a different function for their respective protocols.In MakerDAO, $USDC deposits are used as a backstop to prevent $DAI stablecoin from being unpegged — rather than to actually borrow $DAI. In the case of Alchemix, deposits serve as collateral for users to borrow a loan that is being rewarded with yields. They sell a completely different value proposition. For now, it appears that Alchemix has no close competitors that compete for their market share. However, it would need to greatly increase utility for its stablecoin $alUSD and its governance token $ALCX for the protocol to truly shine."

# What Is Alchemix?

Alchemix calls itself a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform. You receive yield from the collateral capital. To understand how Alchemix works, check out our detailed analysis. In this article, we focus on comparing stablecoins that are backed by stablecoins.

# Question: Why Use A Stablecoin To Back A Stablecoin?

Why would anyone deposit a stablecoin ($DAI) to borrow less stablecoin ($alUSD)? We compare some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Alchemix protocol below and compare it with Maker.

### Strengths

* No kind of stability fees (as compared to MakerDAO)
* No kind of liquidation fees
* Yields are generated from collateral automatically
* Simple and easy to use (not as complicated)

### Weaknesses

* Opportunity cost of collateral
* $alUSD, the stablecoin does not have much utility for it to gain traction
* $ALCX tokens currently have no utility other than governance
* Much more centralised compared to other protocols

After passing the audit of CertiK, a well-known audit institution, the BakerDAO yield farming and borrow protocol, which is a decentralized stablecoin protocol on BSC, was successfully launched at 19:00 on June 19, 2021. Under the adverse situation of the downward market, the TVL is up to US $30 million, and the system has been running healthily and stably. It is reported that the net income of MakerDAO, the Ethereum decentralized stablecoin project, was $9.37 million USD in June, and the stablecoin issued exceeded $5 billion USD. Relying on the efficient, low gas cost and innovative economic model of the BSC chain, BakerDAO has huge market potential. BakerDAO's first yield farming has officially ended at 23:00, July 20, 2021, Beijing time. The price of BKR exceeded $4.6 within 12 hours after the end, an increase of 72%. Next, let's take a look at the final data of BakerDAO's first yield farming and borrow.

# BKR Yield Farming Data

**OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that**

• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

**Here’s how it works:**

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  •3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   •10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) •  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS**How do they differ from their competitors?**

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

**OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that**

• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

**Here’s how it works:**

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  •3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   •10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) •  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS**How do they differ from their competitors?**

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

OMNIA R1 Presale for this low market cap gem ends on the 28th July (gas been extended🥳)💎 

Here’s the TLDR for you guys🔌🔋

You can tokenise your house and sell 49% while still retaining majority ownership! This allows for liquidity from traditional illiquid assets (you could own 10% of a Picasso, Ford Mustang or even a part of the London Shard. 

Who can benefit from Omnia DeFi?

Millennials who are struggling to get on the property ladder 

People in the developing world who are land rich but lack the cash to invest in themselves!

Middle class who own illiquid assets and are cash strapped!

The tokenised land which will be registered on the blockchain will be laying down the foundations of web 3 infrastructure (This is the modern day equivalent of building Airports, highways or railroads!)

So great.... What are their killer features?

**Fundamentals**

Serious project not a MEME coin ⛔️ 

Will start tokenising AFTER regulated (this is so operations don’t get put down by the SEC/FCA)

Aggressive Burn Mechanisms &amp; Unique Tokenomics closely tied to business model, the more art &amp; real estate Omnia DeFi onboard the more $OMNIA they burn!

$500 M worth of Art &amp; Real estate COMMITTED to the project! 

**Team**

Star studded team full of entrepreneurs and seasoned professionals who have had experience in Robotics, Education, Finance, as well as advisors that work in prestigious institutions such as Disney, Tech-Stars, MakerDAO and YFDAI!

GDPR compliance officer! What other projects do you know that have this role filled, this shows Omnia DeFi means business!

**Tokenomics**

Full details on tokenomics can be read here: 
https://omnia-defi.medium.com/tokenomics-core-team-vesting-schedule-funds-usage-liquidity-locking-details-a9471218831e


**Roadmap**
 
22nd August- Quickswap launch- staking and farming available on launch!
October - Regulation
November - Real world asset oracle 


**Marketing**

Mainstream publications soon
1M $OMNIA on the moon as AR tokens (think Pokemon go!)
BIG influencer push coming soon

BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V0.8 (Draft),https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/opyvy8/bakerdao_system_upgrade_scheme_v08_draft/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-07-23 17:31:07,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/opyvy8/bakerdao_system_upgrade_scheme_v08_draft/,NaN,"Based on Ethereum's MakerDAO, BakerDAO has optimized the economic model, hoping to generate another decentralized stablecoin in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and realize billions of U.S. dollars in BAI circulation, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in annual income and billions of U.S. dollars in market value. At the initiation phase, in order to realize the decentralization of BKR, BakerDAO launched liquidity mining since June 19th, 2021, and BAI price fluctuated less than 1 U.S. dollar the next day. After that, all liquidity mining activities related to BAI limited partner (LP) were immediately suspended to prevent speculation for BAI arbitrage. Later, the market was tumbling, which caused three problems in the system, namely, collateral liquidation, instability of BAI, and BKR price decline. These problems during the execution of the project should be tackled by innovative solutions. This project mainly aims to stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar, and more ecologies could support the application of BAI. The problems and solutions are elaborated as follows.

1. Collateral liquidation 

a) Liquidation at low price 

In the BakerDAO system, auction mechanism is adopted for liquidation, with no restriction on the lowest bid. Hence, when there are a small number of people involved in liquidation, some of them can liquidate the holder's treasury assets at a very low price, resulting in the system deficit. Obviously, the system will make up the deficit through profit later. At present, BakerDAO has a debt of 73,453 BAI, which exerts little impact on the stability of the system, but more loopholes may be appear in the future, so this problem should be urgently solved.

b) Arbitrage leads to liquidation and BAI price decline 

The large market fluctuation causes that the price of collaterals in some vaults may be lower than that of BAI obtained. Consequently, holders would better sell BAI to retain their incomes, which will result in BAI price decline, insufficient collateral value and system deficit.

2. BAI instability 

BAI adopts the mechanism of soft anchoring to the U.S. dollars. In the Borrow system, BAI is considered to be 1 U.S. dollar at any time. Holders can lend and return their loaned BAI at 1 U.S. dollar and participate in liquidation, regardless of the price of BAI in the external market. This mechanism is extremely crucial, which can guarantee the stability of BAI to a great extent, but still cannot effectively avoid fluctuations.

When liquidity mining began, the selling climax of BAI led to BAI price decline. We suspended the liquidity mining of BAI LP in time, which eased the situation and gave some compensation.

Later, we performed two governances and raised the stable fee rate, but only obtained non-ideal outcomes under the stimulus of the high yield of liquidity mining. The price of BAI still fluctuates between 0.6 and 0.9, so this problem always exists, which should be urgently solved.

3. BKR price decline 

Since BakerDAO launched online lending and liquidity mining *via* CertiK auditing, the total value locked (TVL) has topped over 30 million U.S. dollars, BKR price has topped over 600 U.S. dollars, and the number of token-holding addresses has exceeded 7,000. However, BKR price declined in a spiral way, from nearly 700 U.S. dollars to less than 4 U.S. dollars under the influence of the broad environment, which exerted a great effect on the belief of BakerDAO community. This is absolutely a common problem in all liquidity mining projects. Later, our team anatomized the causes of the decline, and introduced the Stepped Rate Scheme for Single-Currency Liquidity Mining to limit the mining, withdrawal and selling of single-currency mining users, which was also strongly supported by the community. We hope that everyone can hold BKR for a long time along with the long-run development of the community and team, which is in line with the purpose of the liquidity mining, that is, liquidity mining enables more people to hold BKR and contributes to the development of BakerDAO. The introduction of the scheme made BKR price tend to be stable and avoided a large-scale decline, but it still did not bring much demand and failed to make BKR price rise sharply.

After discovering the above problems, our team began to study and discuss solutions, and some holders in the community also gave very good suggestions. So far, we have worked out solutions to the above three problems, which are divided into the following five parts: liquidation module optimization, liquidation pool, BAI stabilization system, BKR pledge pool and BAI repurchase system.

1. Liquidation module optimization 

At first, we will optimize the liquidation module and improve some parameters and restrictions in liquidation, so as to solve the above problems in the liquidation process and enable the community to share the liquidation income: 

►BUSD mortgage rate adjustment: 101% mortgage rate means that the upper limit of BAI price is expected to be 1.01 U.S. dollars, and it tends to result in surrender of pledge of assets to trigger the short-selling of BAI;

► Adjustment of stable fee rate in time: Raising the stable fee rate will reduce the supply of BAI, which is conducive to the upvaluation of BAI. After the value of BAI stabilizes at 1 U.S. dollar, the stable fee rate will be reduced to increase the supply of BAI and lower the price expectation of BAI; 

► Collateral adjustment for obtaining the upper limit of BAI: control the amount of BAI that collaterals can produce, and control the supply of BAI to regulate its price; Increase restrictions to liquidation price, and do not allow ultra-low price liquidation;

► Increase restrictions to liquidation participants, only allow fixed addresses to participate in liquidation, and withdraw the liquidation right;

► Liquidation income sharing: The liquidation income will be distributed to the liquidation pool (which will be explained in detail later) and the project team at the ratio of 7: 3; 

► Shorten liquidation cycle and improve liquidation efficiency. 

2. BAI liquidation pool 

The BAI liquidation pool system is designed to encourage more holders to mortgage to generate BAI, keep the stability of BAI and reflect the value of BAI, which allows holders to mortgage BAI to obtain liquidation income: 

► Holders deposit BAI into the liquidation pool, share the system liquidation income and participate in liquidity mining; 

► The system withdraws the liquidation right through the above-mentioned fixed addresses, and the liquidation pool shares 70% of the liquidation income according to the different proportion of BAI deposited; 

► The liquidation pool will be rewarded with the governance token BKR. 

3. BAI stabilization system 

The BAI stabilization system, also known as BAI hard anchoring system, is designed for holders to arbitrage to keep BAI anchored to 1 U.S. dollar when it deviates from this price, so as to ensure the stability of BAI. Similar to the stable currency exchange, this system adopts a lower slippage and a smoother curve to enable everyone to trade BAI and other assets. 

► Liquidity providers provide stable assets such as BUSD and BAI as trading pairs; 

► Arbitrators can carry out arbitrage when the price of BAI deviates from 1 U.S. dollar;

► Liquidity providers can be rewarded with handling fees and BKR. 

4.BKR pledge pool 

The BKR pledge pool system is designed to better reflect the value of BKR, make more community holders willing to hold BKR for a long time and stimulate the development of BakerDAO, which allows BKR holders to share the system income: 

► Holders pledge BKR to the pledge pool, and obtain different quantities of locked BKR (LBKR) based on the different locking time; 

► LBKR can be used by holders to vote for governance, but it cannot be used for trading; 

► Holders share the system stability fee, handling fee and other incomes according to the holding quantity of LBKR. 

5.BAI repurchase system 

If the original mechanism of the system and the above-mentioned BAI stabilization system do not play up to expectations, and BAI still seriously deviates from 1 U.S. dollar, the BAI repurchase system will repurchase BAI using BKR by bidding. 

► BAI holders deposit BAI into the repurchase module and choose an appropriate bid; 

► Part of BKR used for ecological rewards is deposited into the repurchase module; 

► The repurchase module will repurchase BAI using BKR according to the bid of holders; 

► The repurchased BAI will be locked for a period of time, and will continue to be used to support ecological projects after the price of BAI is stable.

The above-mentioned solutions are designed for liquidation, BAI instability and BKR instability under the new market environment, which show great achievements in innovation relative to the original system. In the future, the economic model will be updated and the implementation details of each optimization will be released. This draft is not the final version, and we will seek for opinions of the community within three days, and release and implement the final draft next week with consideration of all suggestions. In the processes of design and implementation, we will communicate with the community in time to solve the problems found, and finally we will stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar. The community will definitely witness the prosperity of BAI ecology in the BSC. In years to come, we will head towards the prosperity of BAI ecology on multiple chains through multi-chain deployment."

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  •3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   •10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) •  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium 

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS**How do they differ from their competitors?**

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

Thoughts on stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqzqyx/thoughts_on_stablecoins/,sickvisionz,1,2021-07-25 06:37:23,12,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqzqyx/thoughts_on_stablecoins/,FINANCE,"**TLDR: There are no good stablecoins that fit in with the** ***ethos*** **of crypto. For now, you have to pick your poison.**

Just some thoughts I've had about the current state of stablecoins.

* **Tether** isn't mystery money but it's shockingly little cash (although that's less cash a gov could shutdown via calling a bank) and financial products that definitely aren't going to be liquid during a non-crypto financial crash.
* **USDC**... Tether got a super F.  Like they got a 30 on the test.  They'd still get an F even if you graded on a 25 point curve.  They knew nothing about the material.  USDC is like a 60.  In some schools, Fs are 59 and lower so technically this *could* be a passing grade somewhere.
* **DAI**... a crypto backed stablecoin, operated by a DAO. This is seemingly the best crypto stable asset.  It's so crypto... then you read it's 60% USDC.  If you wanted all the cons of USDC and thought *let's really spice things up by throwing in some smart contract risk*...
* **BUSD**... 96% backed by actual money in a bank.  Nice.  That also means it's easy as hell for a government to shut them down given that it's just money in a regulated bank account. Not to mention that the regulators of Earth have seemingly teamed up and decided *hey you know what... f\*\*\* Binance*.
* **GUSD**... another centralized coin except they've coded the ability to censor addresses into the damn smart contract.  This is like the test case for the *digital yuan* and a company telling regulators and the government *we're the best... we already added all the features and backdoors you'd need to censor coin holders.*  
  
I could go on longer but why bother?  Most of the rest are just *we're backed 75% by USDC and our shitcoin* or amazingly decentralized/censorship resistant and were dollar pegged and trading at $0.86 three days ago.  We're still very early in the crypto game and there is no *crypto ethos* stable coin as far as I can tell that's:

1. Actually stable (lives between $0.99 and $1.01 most of the time)
2. Backed by the peg
3. Decentralized
4. Censorship resistant

&amp;#x200B;

From what I can tell...

1. If you want **stability** then you're in luck because there's a decent amount of them. That's actually not difficult. If that's all you care about and nothing else, you've got plenty of good options.
2. If you want a **collateralized by the peg** token then you're in luck.  You get the bonus of the more it fits this criteria, the more likely it is to also have **stability*****.***  However, the very nature of holding cash (in a regulated, not anonymous bank account) makes getting this feature *and* decentralization or censorship resistance incredibly difficult. They might actually be diametrically opposed ideas unless you want the organization storing cash in some unregulated way.
3. If you want **decentralization**, you're screwed. Those tokens exists but they fail miserably at maintaining their peg which makes them interesting tech ideas but not actually usable as a stablecoin.  Or they're just pulling a MakerDAO: you're decentralized but the primary thing you use to collateralize the coin and the primary asset that keeps it stable is a 100% centralized, 0% censorship resistant token. If regulators squeeze them, you're squeezed by default. 
4. **Censorship resistance** just doesn't exist to me. Not that it can't exist but we just don't have one yet. Stable coins are financial products that directly compete with cash payment systems and yield bearing products. Finance will come around to crypto but the banking industry could literally be destroyed. Literally.  You are not censorship resistant when massive chunks of your collateral and the primary item that keeps your token stable is held by and regulated by titans of said industry you will destroy and you have to go to them to access your funds.

Anyways, that's that. Just my thoughts. Almost a rant but less angry sounding (hopefully). I'd be curious to know what you all think."

One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. 

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great research paper.

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021."

This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021."

One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. 

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great research paper.

Credits to u/Layneeeee 
For putting up the original post

I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&amp;#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web."

**About BakerDAO:** 

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."

Being Able to Take a Loan Using BTC as Collateral Is Incredibly Undervalued And One Reason I'm Even More Bullish. Here's Why,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/os0mb0/being_able_to_take_a_loan_using_btc_as_collateral/,wmredditor,1,2021-07-26 23:07:46,11,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/os0mb0/being_able_to_take_a_loan_using_btc_as_collateral/,TRADING,"Which of your investment assets can you borrow up to 50% of its value without aggressive paperwork and waiting several days? This property of Bitcoin is still incredibly undervalued and in my honest opinion has contributed significantly to the bullish move we have had in the past year or so.

If you own a piece of real estate and need cash, you need to go through a lot of paperwork to secure any loan on top of it. Even though this may be considerably higher than what you get in BTC, the process is very rigorous and not as easy as doing it the BTC way.

If you own stocks, treasury bills, bonds, index funds, etc, getting a loan on them is even more difficult.

But if you own BTC or ETH, there are many platforms, both in **CeFi and DeFi** that would let you take a loan against it, up to 50% of the amount deposited.

Here are some I've come across:

&amp;#x200B;

* Compound
* MakerDAO
* Nexo
* BlockFi, 
* Celsius, etc.

This essentially removes some selling pressure on these assets as individuals can take on low-interest loans that could be covered by a future price appreciation for the value of their crypto. I for one have been less hesitant to sell BTC, and would rather take a small loan against it in extreme cases.

I understand that there are third-party risks and the job of maintaining a healthy Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio by not overborrowing. However, you can't get this stuff this easy with real estate or other investment assets but you can easily do it with Bitcoin. 

I guess the more the broader investment world understands this possibility, the more likely it is that they allocate a portion of idle funds to crypto to unlock some liquidity.

It also gives HODLers an even greater incentive to HODL and never to sell at the wrong price!"

I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkador (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

If you got this far, thanks for reading. Hope you found it useful in some way."

 From how to buy it and how it works to smart contracts and ETH2, a complete beginner's guide to the second-biggest cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

 *Ethereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. It is also a decentralized computing platform that can run a wide variety of applications — including the entire universe of DeFi.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Ethereum, which launched in 2015, is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. But unlike Bitcoin, it wasn’t created to be digital money. Instead, Ethereum’s founders set out to build a new kind of global, decentralized computing platform that takes the security and openness of blockchains and extends those attributes to a vast range of applications.  

Everything from financial tools and games to complex databases are already running on the Ethereum blockchain. And its future potential is only limited by developers’ imaginations. As the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation puts it: “Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.”

* You can check the latest prices on Coinbase's Ethereum asset page.
* Ethereum has become **a popular investment vehicle and store of wealth** (and can be used, like Bitcoin, to send or receive value without an intermediary).
* **The Ethereum blockchain allows developers to build and run a huge variety of applications**: everything from games and advanced databases to complex decentralized financial instruments — meaning that they don’t require a bank or any other institution in the middle. 
* **Ethereum-based apps are built using “smart contracts.”** Smart contracts, like regular paper contracts, establish the terms of an arrangement between parties. But unlike an old-fashioned contract, smart contracts automatically execute when the terms are met without the need for either participating party to know who is on the other side of the deal — and without the need for any kind of intermediary. 
* **Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is an open source project that is not owned or operated by a single individual.** Anyone with an internet connection can run an Ethereum node or interact with the network.
* Much like Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain allows any two strangers, anywhere in the world, to send or receive money without a bank in the middle, **smart contracts running on Ethereum’s decentralized blockchain allow developers to build complex applications that should run exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference**. 

Popular Ethereum-based innovations include **stablecoins** (like DAI, which has its value pegged to the dollar by smart contract), **decentralized finance apps** (collectively known as DeFi), and **other decentralized apps** (or Dapps).

&amp;#x200B;

 **What’s the difference between Ethereum, Ether, and ETH?** 

 *Ethereum is the name of the network. “Ether” is the native cryptocurrency token used by the Ethereum network. That said, in day-to-day usage most people call the token “ETH” (or just “Ethereum”). As a way of sending, receiving, or storing value ETH works much like Bitcoin. But it also has a special role on Ethereum network. Because users pay fees in ETH to execute smart contracts, you can think of it as the fuel that keeps the whole thing running (which is why those fees are called “gas”).*

 *If Bitcoin is “digital gold,” ETH can be seen as “digital oil.”*

&amp;#x200B;

 **Is Ethereum secure?**

 *ETH is currently secured by the Ethereum blockchain in much the same way Bitcoin is secured by its blockchain. A huge amount of computing power — contributed by all the computers on the network — verifies and secures every transaction, making it virtually impossible for any third party to interfere.* 

 *The fundamental ideas behind cryptocurrencies help make them safe: the systems are permissionless and the core software is open-source, meaning countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the networks and their security.* 

*Apps running on the Ethereum blockchain, however, are only guaranteed to be as secure as their developers have made them. For example, code can sometimes contain bugs that could result in loss of funds. While their source code is also visible to all, the user bases of each individual app are much smaller than Ethereum’s as a whole, and so fewer eyes are on them. It’s important to do research on any decentralized app you plan to use.* 

*The Ethereum protocol is currently being updated in ways that are intended to make it faster and even more secure. See the Ethereum 2.0 section below for more.*

 

## How does Ethereum work?

 

*You might have heard that the Bitcoin blockchain is a lot like a bank’s ledger, or even a checkbook. It’s a running tally of every transaction made on the network going back to the very beginning — and all the computers on the network contribute their computing power towards the work of ensuring that the tally is accurate and secure.* 

*The Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, is more like a computer: while it also does the work of documenting and securing transactions, it’s much more flexible than the Bitcoin blockchain. Developers can use the Ethereum blockchain to build a huge variety of tools — everything from logistics management software to games to the entire universe of DeFi applications (which span lending, borrowing, trading, and more).*

* *Ethereum uses a 'virtual machine' to achieve all this, which is like a giant, global computer made up of many individual computers running the Ethereum software. Keeping all of those computers running involves investment in both hardware and electricity by participants. To cover those costs, the network uses its own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency called Ether (or, more commonly, ETH).*
* *ETH keeps the whole thing running. You interact with the Ethereum network by using ETH to pay the network to execute smart contracts. As a result, the fees paid in ETH are called “gas.”*
* *Gas rates vary depending on how busy the network is. A new version of the Ethereum blockchain called Ethereum 2.0, which aims to increase efficiency, began rolling out in December 2020. (The transition to the new blockchain is scheduled to happen over the next two years.)*

 

## What is Ethereum 2.0?

 

Ethereum 2.0 (often referred to as ETH2) is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network. It’s designed to allow the Ethereum network to grow while increasing security, speed, and efficiency. 

As of early 2021, Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum 1.0 exist side by side — but the original blockchain will eventually merge with ETH2 blockchain. (If you’re an ETH holder you won’t have to do anything — your holdings on the ETH 1.0 blockchain will automatically migrate to the ETH2 blockchain.) The transition to ETH2 began in December of 2020, and is scheduled to take two years.

**Why is Ethereum 2.0 necessary?** Moving a popular cryptoasset to a new platform is a complex endeavor, but for Ethereum to scale and evolve, it needs to happen. That’s because the “Proof of Work” method used by the ETH 1.0 blockchain to verify transactions causes bottlenecks, increases fees, and consumes substantial resources (particularly electricity).

**What is Proof of Work?**  How do cryptocurrency networks make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or Paypal in the middle? They use a consensus mechanism. When ETH 1.0 launched, it adopted the consensus mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin: the aptly named Proof of Work. 

* Proof of Work requires a huge amount of processing power, which is contributed by virtual “miners” around the world who compete to be the first to solve a time-consuming math puzzle. 
* The winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions, and is rewarded with a predetermined amount of ETH.  
* This process happens every 30 seconds (compared to Bitcoin’s approximately 10-minute cadence). As traffic on the network has increased, the limitations of Proof of Work have caused bottlenecks during which fees spike unpredictably.

 

## What is staking?

 

Ethereum’s founders were aware of Proof of Work’s limitations. So a very different solution was devised for Ethereum 2.0. — one that will ultimately allow the network to efficiently process thousands of Ethereum transactions a second.

**Ethereum 2.0 uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake**, which is faster, less resource-intensive, and (at least theoretically) more secure. The end result is similar to Proof of Work’s, in that a network participant is chosen to verify the latest transactions, update the blockchain, and earn some ETH. 

* Rather than requiring a network of miners racing to solve a puzzle, **Proof of Stake requires a robust network of participants** who are literally invested in the success of the enterprise.
* These stakeholders are called **validators**. Instead of contributing processing power as miners do, validators contribute ETH to a “staking pool.” 
* The act of contributing ETH to the pool is called **staking**. If you choose to stake some of your ETH, you will earn rewards in proportion to the size of your stake. For most users, staking will function much like an interest-bearing savings account. 
*  The network selects a winner based on the amount of ETH each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there — literally **rewarding the most invested participants**. 
* Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of these attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. 
* All participating validators receive a **reward** in ETH, which is distributed by the network in proportion to each validator’s stake. 

**Staking is open to anyone who is interested** (and coming soon to Coinbase).

 

**Smart contracts 101**

*Smart contracts* *were first* *proposed* *in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo.* ***Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine.*** *Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.*

&amp;#x200B;

 

## A brief history of Ethereum

 

**2013** 

* A 19-year-old computer programmer (and *Bitcoin Magazine* cofounder) named Vitalik Buterin releases a whitepaper proposing a highly flexible blockchain that could support virtually any kind of transaction.

 **2014** 

* The Toronto-based teenager, along with a team of cofounders including Gavin Wood, crowdfunds the development of the Ethereum protocol with the sale of $18 million in pre-launch tokens.

**2015** 

* The first public version of the Ethereum blockchain launches in July. Smart contract functionality begins to roll out on the Ethereum blockchain.

**2016** 

* Hackers steal around $50 million from a smart-contract-powered venture fund called the DAO (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization) by exploiting a software bug. 
* In a divisive vote, Ethereum’s community chooses to revise the protocol in a way that would restore the lost funds. This results in the Ethereum blockchain branching off (via a hard fork) into two separate blockchains, each with its own active community: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

**2017** 

* The ERC-20 standard is created, making it easier for developers to build compatible applications. ERC-20 defines a way to create an asset (or token) on top of the Ethereum blockchain. 
* The first widely popular Ethereum-based app arrives in the form of a game called CryptoKitties, in which users collect and trade digital cats. It becomes a genuine craze; at the peak, rare digital cats sell for upwards of $200,000. 
* The nonprofit Ethereum Enterprise Alliance launches to develop practical applications for smart contract technology. Members include JP Morgan, Samsung, Microsoft, and Mastercard. 
* MakerDAO — the first Decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain — launches. Maker also introduces the first ETH-based stablecoin, DAI.
* ETH breaks $100 USD for the first time.

**2018**

* DeFi, which aims to transform the financial-services industry by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure, gains momentum with the arrival of lending protocol Compound and decentralized exchange Uniswap. 
* The USDC stablecoin is launched. Backed by the CENTRE Consortium, a partnership between Coinbase and Circle, it reaches $1 billion in issued coins in the first year.  
* ETH breaks $1,000 USD for the first time in January, before falling back under $100.

**2020** 

* The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade begins in December. The complete transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 is scheduled to take around two years to complete.
* As part of Ethereum 2.0’s first phase, Proof of Stake is introduced. ETH 1.0 continues to use Proof of Work as its consensus mechanism.

**2021**

* ETH hits new all-time high above $4,200
* See the current price at coinmarketcap.

 

## How do you buy Ethereum?

 

However you acquire your ETH, you’ll need to understand a few basic concepts. Every address on the Ethereum network is issued a public key and a private key, and you’ll need a wallet to manage your crypto holdings.  

* **Public key**: Think of this as the crypto version of an email address. Your Ethereum public key is where people can send you ETH and Ethereum-based tokens like USDC and Dai. You can safely give this out to others.
* **Private key**: Think of this like your password. You should generally avoid giving this out to people. A private key is a long string of letters and numbers. (It can also be in the form of a series of words called a seed phrase.) It’s crucial to keep track of your private keys. If you lose them, you lose your Ether forever. 
* **Wallet**: To store and secure your Ether you’ll need a wallet. If you’re just starting out, the easiest option is to make an account via the Coinbase app or coinbase.com — in which case you’ll interact with a “custodial wallet” that stores and secures your private keys for you. As you progress you might want to investigate other wallet options that are built for interacting with decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols such as Compound (a lending and savings app) or Uniswap (a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies).

 

## How does Ethereum have value?

 

There are a few ways of thinking about the answer to this question. On one level, Ethereum’s value is set by markets like any other asset. People buy it with Bitcoin, dollars, euros, yen, and other currencies 24 hours a day. Depending on demand, the price can fluctuate from day to day. (Ethereum’s value tends to be volatile compared to currencies such as the US dollar or equities like Fortune 500 stocks because it is still an emerging technology.)

But *why* the market prices it the way it does is a much more complicated question. To many investors Ethereum’s value is based on its flexibility as a platform for issuing stablecoins and running DeFi applications — resulting in a growing user base and growing transaction fees. 

## What’s next for Ethereum?

As of early 2021, Ethereum is host to the vast majority of blockchain applications and has a market cap of just under $200 billion, with over $55 billion locked into tokens on the blockchain. Popular stablecoins such as USDC and USDT mostly live on Ethereum today due to its network effects.

But a variety of new smart contract blockchains are beginning to compete in the space. So while Ethereum is the dominant market leader today, there is growing pressure for it to successfully execute the transition to Ethereum 2.0.

That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

**Introduction**

BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V0.8 (Draft)  
 （https://docs.bakerfi.com/bakerdao/blog/blog-8）since we sought for opinions to community, the draft has been widely discussed and recognized. In consideration of the opinions, we have released the official version and started to develop and launch it step by step. BakerDAO is an upgraded version of MakerDAO, which innovatively optimizes the original problems of MakerDAO and will definitely surpass MakerDAO to become a decentralized stablecoin giant.

**Glossary**

**Problems**

Based on Ethereum's MakerDAO, BakerDAO has optimized the economic model, hoping to generate another decentralized stablecoin in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and realize billions of U.S. dollars in BAI circulation, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in annual income and billions of U.S. dollars in market value. At the initiation phase, in order to realize the decentralization of BKR, BakerDAO launched liquidity mining since June 19th, 2021, and BAI price fluctuated less than 1 U.S. dollar the next day. After that, all liquidity mining activities related to BAI limited partner (LP) were immediately suspended to prevent speculation for BAI arbitrage. Later, the market was tumbling, which caused three problems in the system, namely, collateral liquidation, instability of BAI, and BKR price decline. These problems during the execution of the project should be tackled by innovative solutions. This project mainly aims to stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar, and more ecologies could support the application of BAI. The problems and solutions are elaborated as follows.

**1. Collateral liquidation** 

**a) Liquidation at low price** 

In the BakerDAO system, auction mechanism is adopted for liquidation, with no restriction on the lowest bid. Hence, when there are a small number of people involved in liquidation, some of them can liquidate the holder's treasury assets at a very low price, resulting in the system deficit. Obviously, the system will make up the deficit through profit later. At present, BakerDAO has a debt of 73,453 BAI, which exerts little impact on the stability of the system, but more loopholes may be appear in the future, so this problem should be urgently solved.

**b) Arbitrage leads to liquidation and BAI price decline** 

The large market fluctuation causes that the price of collaterals in some vaults may be lower than that of BAI obtained. Consequently, holders would better sell BAI to retain their incomes, which will result in BAI price decline, insufficient collateral value and system deficit.

**2.** **BAI instability** 

BAI adopts the mechanism of soft anchoring to the U.S. dollars. In the Borrow system, BAI is considered to be 1 U.S. dollar at any time. Holders can lend and return their loaned BAI at 1 U.S. dollar and participate in liquidation, regardless of the price of BAI in the external market. This mechanism is extremely crucial, which can guarantee the stability of BAI to a great extent, but still cannot effectively avoid fluctuations.

When liquidity mining began, the selling climax of BAI led to BAI price decline. We suspended the liquidity mining of BAI LP in time, which eased the situation and gave some compensation.

Later, we performed two governances and raised the stable fee rate, but only obtained non-ideal outcomes under the stimulus of the high yield of liquidity mining. The price of BAI still fluctuates between 0.6 and 0.9, so this problem always exists, which should be urgently solved.

**3.** **BKR price decline** 

Since BakerDAO launched online lending and liquidity mining *via* CertiK auditing, the total value locked (TVL) has topped over 30 million U.S. dollars, BKR price has topped over 600 U.S. dollars, and the number of token-holding addresses has exceeded 7,000. However, BKR price declined in a spiral way, from nearly 700 U.S. dollars to less than 4 U.S. dollars under the influence of the broad environment, which exerted a great effect on the belief of BakerDAO community. This is absolutely a common problem in all liquidity mining projects. Later, our team anatomized the causes of the decline, and introduced the Stepped Rate Scheme for Single-Currency Liquidity Mining to limit the mining, withdrawal and selling of single-currency mining users, which was also strongly supported by the community. We hope that everyone can hold BKR for a long time along with the long-run development of the community and team, which is in line with the purpose of the liquidity mining, that is, liquidity mining enables more people to hold BKR and contributes to the development of BakerDAO. The introduction of the scheme made BKR price tend to be stable and avoided a large-scale decline, but it still did not bring much demand and failed to make BKR price rise sharply.

**Solutions**

After discovering the above problems, our team began to study and discuss solutions, and some holders in the community also gave very good suggestions. So far, we have worked out solutions to the above three problems, which are divided into the following five parts: liquidation module optimization, liquidation pool, BAI stabilization system, BKR pledge pool and BAI repurchase system.

**1. Liquidation module optimization** 

At first, we will optimize the liquidation module and improve some parameters and restrictions in liquidation, so as to solve the above problems in the liquidation process and enable the community to share the liquidation income: 

►BUSD mortgage rate adjustment: 101% mortgage rate means that the upper limit of BAI price is expected to be 1.01 U.S. dollars, and it tends to result in surrender of pledge of assets to trigger the short-selling of BAI;

► Adjustment of stable fee rate in time: Raising the stable fee rate will reduce the supply of BAI, which is conducive to the upvaluation of BAI. After the value of BAI stabilizes at 1 U.S. dollar, the stable fee rate will be reduced to increase the supply of BAI and lower the price expectation of BAI; 

► Collateral adjustment for obtaining the upper limit of BAI: control the amount of BAI that collaterals can produce, and control the supply of BAI to regulate its price; Increase restrictions to liquidation price, and do not allow ultra-low price liquidation;

► Increase restrictions to liquidation participants, only allow liquidation pool (which will be explained in detail later) to participate in liquidation, and withdraw the liquidation right;

► Liquidation income sharing: The liquidation income will be distributed to the liquidation pool (which will be explained in detail later) and the project team at the ratio of 7: 3; 

► Shorten liquidation cycle and improve liquidation efficiency. 

**2. BAI liquidation pool**  

The BAI liquidation pool system is designed to encourage more holders to mortgage to generate BAI, keep the stability of BAI and reflect the value of BAI, which allows holders to mortgage BAI to obtain liquidation income: 

► Holders deposit BAI into the liquidation pool, share the system liquidation income and participate in liquidity mining; 

► The system withdraws the liquidation right through the above-mentioned fixed addresses, and the liquidation pool shares 70% of the liquidation income according to the different proportion of BAI deposited; 

►  The liquidation pool will be rewarded with the governance token BKR. 

**3. BAI stabilization system** 

The BAI stabilization system, also known as BAI hard anchoring system, is designed for holders to arbitrage to keep BAI anchored to 1 U.S. dollar when it deviates from this price, so as to ensure the stability of BAI. Similar to the stable currency exchange, this system adopts a lower slippage and a smoother curve to enable everyone to trade BAI and other assets. 

►  Liquidity providers provide stable assets such as BUSD and BAI as trading pairs; 

► Arbitrators can carry out arbitrage when the price of BAI deviates from 1 U.S. dollar;

► Liquidity providers can be rewarded with handling fees and BKR. 

**4.BAI repurchase pool**

If the original mechanism of the system and the above-mentioned BAI stabilization pool do not play up to expectations, and BAI still seriously deviates from 1 U.S. dollar, the BAI repurchase pool will repurchase BAI using BKR by bidding. 

► BAI holders deposit BAI into the repurchase pool and choose an appropriate bid; 

► Part of BKR used for ecological rewards is deposited into the repurchase pool; 

► The repurchase module will repurchase BAI using BKR according to the bid of holders; 

► The repurchased BAI will be locked for a period of time, and will continue to be used to support ecological projects after the price of BAI is stable.

**5. Open vault** 

An open vault refers to a redeemable vault. Any holders can redeem the equivalent collateral in the vault with BAI (the price of BAI is fixed at 1 U.S. dollar) by paying handling fees.

Holders can choose whether the vault is open when creating it;

Collaterals in the open vault will be uniformly distributed to the open vault pool;

The open vault possesses the same characteristics as the original vault, and the owner of the vault can freely mortgage and return BAI;

When holders use BAI to exchange collaterals, they return an equal proportion of BAI to all open vaults and deduct the corresponding collaterals, thus obtaining the share of the handling fee.

**7. Liquidity pool**

A liquidity scheme will be launched to regulate the liquidity of BKR and BAI and allow holders to trade them outside the system.

l Use system incomes and part of BKR to provide liquidity for related transaction pairs in DEX such as Pancakeswap;

l Put BAI and other stablecoins into decentralized stablecoin exchanges to provide liquidity and help stabilize the price of BAI to 1 U.S. dollar.

**8. Repurchase pool**

System incomes will be used to repurchase and destroy BKR, so as to reduce the circulation of BKR and maximize the interests of BKR holders.

**9. Aggregation platform**

Due to the high complexity of the system involving multiple related subsystems, an aggregation platform will be designed to allow holders to achieve one-click operation and maximize the incomes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

The above-mentioned solutions are designed for liquidation, BAI instability and BKR instability under the new market environment, which show great achievements in innovation relative to the original system. In the future, the economic model will be updated and the implementation details of each optimization will be released. This draft is not the final version, and we will seek for opinions of the community within three days, and release and implement the final draft next week with consideration of all suggestions. In the processes of design and implementation, we will communicate with the community in time to solve the problems found, and finally we will stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar. The community will definitely witness the prosperity of BAI ecology in the BSC. In years to come, we will head towards the prosperity of BAI ecology on multiple chains through multi-chain deployment."
