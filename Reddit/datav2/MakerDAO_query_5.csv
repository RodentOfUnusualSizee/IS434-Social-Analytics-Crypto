Cryptocurrency trading and use have been marked by volatility  since launch. Stablecoins aim to reduce this overall volatility by  pegging their value to a basket of goods, such as fiat currencies,  precious metals, or other cryptocurrencies. The basket is meant to act  as a reserve to redeem holders if the cryptocurrency fails or faces  problems. Price fluctuations for stablecoins are not meant to exceed a  narrow range. 

 Social media behemoth Facebook’s Diem is the most famous example of a stablecoin. It is a dollar-backed coin. Other examples of stablecoins are USDC and MakerDAO."

1. Put the ETH to work without selling and missing out on potential price gains.
2. Put the ETH to work and avoid paying capital gains taxes on it, since I'm not actually selling and creating a taxable event.

For these 2 things..I feel like MakerDAO and defi in general are awesome!  However, the variable interest rate scares me and I thought I read somewhere it was a 20% stability fee at one time.

My current test vault is an ETH-C vault, 3.5% interest with a 175% min. ratio.  Aside from all the obvious risks (hacks to the smart contracts, etc) is the biggest risk the fact that the stability fee can blow up? 

If it does, what's the cycle the rate changes on? 1yr, 6mo, etc?  

What scenario do you generally see these hikes happen in?  

Are there any defi platforms out there with fixed rates that function in a similar manner (borrowing against ETH)?  

Are there any projections of what the stability fees may look like in the future?

Why Ethereum will flip Bitcoin eventually.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3v1mm/why_ethereum_will_flip_bitcoin_eventually/,SweetPie123,1,2021-05-03 20:43:25,40,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3v1mm/why_ethereum_will_flip_bitcoin_eventually/,METRICS,"Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart-contracts as you all probably know. In this post I will point out the scale at which Ethereum is already operating, giving you a better idea how revolutionary it already is.

**Tokens.**

On Ethereum you can create your own token, ERC-20. Currently there's already **394,500** Token Contracts. To put that in perspective, the amount of publicly traded companies in the world is estimated at 630,000 companies. Creating a token on Ethereum is extremely simple, so there's likely a lot of 'dead' coins in the list, but the number is still impressive. Tether is the most popular token on Ethereum, with a volume or $105,099,469,661.00 today. One hundred five billion DAILY, to put that in perspective the NASDAQ recorded a volume of 254,089,239,573 [last friday](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DailyMarketSummary). One token on Ethereum doing roughly 40% of the NASDAQ shows the scale at which this coin already operates.

**Smart contracts.**

 ''A *smart contract* is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a *contract*. Smart *contracts* allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.'' - BlockGeeks. 

**Sectors smart contracts are useful:**

* **Supply Chain** **(basically the whole world exists out of supply chains):** Imagine you buy canned tomatoes in the supermarket, all the way up the supply chain someone needs to manufacture a new one to keep the store filled with food. A smart contract makes it easier to give that data to the manufacturer, cutting out intermediaries who often do the paperwork. Automating tasks &amp; payments could bring down the cost of producing significantly lower, less administrative burden. 
* **Healthcare ( $11.9 Trillion**)**:**  Smart contracts also make it possible to encrypt personal health data on the blockchain, so it's always visible whenever needed. The supply chain can also be regulated by smart contracts, as well as testing results and other medical applications. 
* **Automobile industry (70m cars yearly produced):** The whole world is moving to a more digitalized place every day, car manufactures are working on self-driving cars for instance. A smart contract could determine who's at fault in a crash from data the car provides, or insurance can give you a better rate depending on where you live and how safely you drive.
* **Real estate (investment market size $9.6 trillion in 2019**)**:** When buying/renting real estate there's always a lot of intermediaries who take a piece of the pie (Airbnb or instance). When you pay with crypto and set up a smart contract, you cut out the middleman. Every financial sector can profit from this, it's more secure and saves the consumer money.

The total marketcap of Ethereum is at the time of writing sitting at $365B, which is large but looking at the potential growth it can have just with smart contracts in some sectors tells me this is far from over. Of course these numbers represent the whole sector, but even if just 5% of the total value flows to Ethereum we will flip Bitcoin. 

**Decentralized Finance.**

DeFi is a financial system containing a variety of financial products, all fully decentralized. No bank or authority can stop transactions or freeze funds. Loans can be accessed within a few minutes, while legacy financial institutions can take days.

**4 largest DeFi projects by locked USD:**

* **MakerDAO - $11.43B (lending)**
* **AAVE - $11.00B (lending)**
* **Compound - $9.54B (lending)**
* **Uniswap - 8.2B (DEX).**

The global lending market is valued at **$6,751.2 billion.** Uniswap has a daily volume of $1.89B today, compared to the largest CEX Binance with a volume of 34,33B. 

Meanwhile Ethereum is revolutionizing the global markets, Bitcoin is stuck at being a 'store of value'. The total gold marketcap sits at 11.269T, while Bitcoin sits at a marketcap of $1.10T. Roughly a 10x or a  price of Bitcoin around 600K and it'll be larger than the current store of value, gold. Pick your bets, but with ETH 2.0 rollout going on you know where I'll put my money. It's not a question of ''if'' but ''when'' Ethereum will take #1 from Bitcoin. (I left NFT's out due to my lack of knowledge about them, better to just not mentioning it instead of spewing bs)."

I'm asking this question while pondering the long term growth and use of DAI; I can see a future where the dollar is no longer the primary currency for global commerce, but exists in competition with a number of currencies."

The Rocket Pool team is in conversation with the auditors from Consensys and Sigma Prime and is implementing as many of the suggestions as possible (This is regarding the removal of nETH from all the contracts + more gas efficient contracts). While audits are still in progress, it seems that they may be coming to an end soon. Once all improvements are made to the contracts, a new beta will start on the Prater testnet (likely in May). This next testnet will not be incentivized with rewards. Note: The contracts used for the Prater Testnet will likely be the same contracts used on mainnet, with very few variations.

**Beta News.**

The most recent Rocket Pool Beta on the Pyrmont Testnet concluded on April 30th. There will be a new testnet starting in May (the specific day has not yet been determined). For those of you that haven’t been able to test out Rocket Pool, there is no need to worry. There will be another beta on the Prater testnet.

**Tech**

Some of the results from the auditors have been communicated with the RP team. As a result, nETH will be removed from the Rocket Pool contracts. This will eliminate some complexity behind the contracts as well as make it more gas-efficient. 

**Integration With Other Dapps**

A few community members have applied for the use of rETH to be used as collateral in the MakerDAO protocol on April 19th. The results have been determined earlier today (May 3rd), with rETH being greenlit. Meaning it will be accepted as collateral in the future in the MakerDAO Protocol. 

As for integration with other protocols, we are currently drafting applications for RPL to be used in lending/borrowing protocols."

The progress made by decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Aave, Compound (COMP) and MakerDAO (MKR) is highlighted to a greater extent.

At the same time, company analysts noted that the value of outstanding loans in the sector also reached a record level, with Compound, MakerDAO and Aave accounting for the lion's share.

The Ethereum DeFi Pulse blockchain monitor shows that the total blocked value on the platforms is currently around $55 billion, down about 11% from the all-time high of $62 billion recorded on April 15.

While the total dollar value blocked in DeFi has declined, the total amount of ETH blocked in DeFi's Ethereum-based projects is hovering around the all-time high of about 10.74 million ETH.

Among other DeFi-related platforms built on Ethereum, decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap (UNI) holds nearly $6 billion, Curve Finance (CRV) holds $5.32 billion, and SushiSwap (DEX) holds $3.87 billion (DeFi Pulse data).

"Atomic composability sounds complicated, but here's a relatively easy to understand breakdown of what it is and why it's important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n4rf21/atomic_composability_sounds_complicated_but_heres/,rocketrocketleague1,1,2021-05-04 23:40:40,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n4rf21/atomic_composability_sounds_complicated_but_heres/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"***thanks to u/t2000-TT from the cryptotechnology subreddit for helping me understand, his comment is below:***

""For people who don't know what atomic composability is, it is the ability to instantly commit a transaction across multiple shards at the same time in a single step. This is in contrast to non-atomic composability where a transaction goes through on one shard first and then other shards later or cross shard transactions take multiple blocks to process. Non atomic composability is really inefficient and completely breaks a lot of apps, things like flash loans and apps like yearn and MakerDAO stop working properly across shards without atomic composability and even apps like Uniswap can experience problems. By providing atomic composability and Unlimited scalability Radix is the only project that will be able to scale DeFi indefinitely into the future without issues.""

***Just a side note, I kept the portion of the paragraph in relation to Radix as that was the thread being commented on.  If you want to learn more about Radix, his comment continues:***

""Radix makes dapp building much easier too, dapps are built out of FSM components which are more secure than solidity smart contracts, easier to build and easier to learn for traditional web devs crossing over into the world of decentralised apps. App developers who build useful components on Radix will receive lifetime royalties whenever their component is used, encouraging the growth of the Radix ecosystem and rewarding devs for making valuable contributions. Right now the project is sitting at a marketcap of 170M, this is nothing for a project that is solving such huge problems and has this level of technology. If the tech wasn't enough, Radix is about to release their Betanet a week from today and Mainnet in June. It is early now but momentum is building up now and after seeing what recently happened with Solana I don't think it will remain undervalued for much longer.

TLDR - Unlimited scalability, very fast, cheap fees - The only platform where apps don't lose performance with sharding - Easy to build apps on - Lower risk of smart contract exploits - Great developer incentive program (lifetime rewards) - Betanet in 1 week, Mainnet in June - 170M marketcap Radix has real potential to be a top 10 project.""

***Radix is still in the infant stages of development but something to keep an eye on, my intentions weren't to shill Radix with this post but to inform others about atomic composability and the potential solutions being proposed***"

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart-contracts as you all probably know. In this post I will point out the scale at which Ethereum is already operating, giving you a better idea how revolutionary it already is.

**Tokens.**

On Ethereum you can create your own token, ERC-20. Currently there's already **394,500** Token Contracts. To put that in perspective, the amount of publicly traded companies in the world is estimated at 630,000 companies. Creating a token on Ethereum is extremely simple, so there's likely a lot of 'dead' coins in the list, but the number is still impressive. Tether is the most popular token on Ethereum, with a volume or $105,099,469,661.00 today. One hundred five billion DAILY, to put that in perspective the NASDAQ recorded a volume of 254,089,239,573 [last friday](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DailyMarketSummary). One token on Ethereum doing roughly 40% of the NASDAQ shows the scale at which this coin already operates.

**Smart contracts.**

''A *smart contract* is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a *contract*. Smart *contracts* allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.'' - BlockGeeks.

**Sectors smart contracts are useful:**

* **Supply Chain** **(basically the whole world exists out of supply chains):** Imagine you buy canned tomatoes in the supermarket, all the way up the supply chain someone needs to manufacture a new one to keep the store filled with food. A smart contract makes it easier to give that data to the manufacturer, cutting out intermediaries who often do the paperwork. Automating tasks &amp; payments could bring down the cost of producing significantly lower, less administrative burden.
* **Healthcare ( $11.9 Trillion**)**:** Smart contracts also make it possible to encrypt personal health data on the blockchain, so it's always visible whenever needed. The supply chain can also be regulated by smart contracts, as well as testing results and other medical applications.
* **Automobile industry (70m cars yearly produced):** The whole world is moving to a more digitalized place every day, car manufactures are working on self-driving cars for instance. A smart contract could determine who's at fault in a crash from data the car provides, or insurance can give you a better rate depending on where you live and how safely you drive.
* **Real estate (investment market size $9.6 trillion in 2019**)**:** When buying/renting real estate there's always a lot of intermediaries who take a piece of the pie (Airbnb or instance). When you pay with crypto and set up a smart contract, you cut out the middleman. Every financial sector can profit from this, it's more secure and saves the consumer money.

The total marketcap of Ethereum is at the time of writing sitting at $365B, which is large but looking at the potential growth it can have just with smart contracts in some sectors tells me this is far from over. Of course these numbers represent the whole sector, but even if just 5% of the total value flows to Ethereum we will flip Bitcoin.

**Decentralized Finance.**

DeFi is a financial system containing a variety of financial products, all fully decentralized. No bank or authority can stop transactions or freeze funds. Loans can be accessed within a few minutes, while legacy financial institutions can take days.

**4 largest DeFi projects by locked USD:**

* **MakerDAO - $11.43B (lending)**
* **AAVE - $11.00B (lending)**
* **Compound - $9.54B (lending)**
* **Uniswap - 8.2B (DEX).**

The global lending market is valued at **$6,751.2 billion.** Uniswap has a daily volume of $1.89B today, compared to the largest CEX Binance with a volume of 34,33B.

Meanwhile Ethereum is revolutionizing the global markets, Bitcoin is stuck at being a 'store of value'. The total gold marketcap sits at 11.269T, while Bitcoin sits at a marketcap of $1.10T. Roughly a 10x or a price of Bitcoin around 600K and it'll be larger than the current store of value, gold. Pick your bets, but with ETH 2.0 rollout going on you know where I'll put my money. It's not a question of ''if'' but ''when'' Ethereum will take #1 from Bitcoin. (I left NFT's out due to my lack of knowledge about them, better to just not mentioning it instead of spewing bs)."

How does Missile.Farm work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/n6sw8n/how_does_missilefarm_work/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 15:26:22,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/n6sw8n/how_does_missilefarm_work/,NaN,"**We** know that many have lost money in altcoins and have high levels of skepticism about this new opportunity.

So let’s break down what Missile Farm does in language as close as possible to how the current financial world works.

1. You know what interest is:

You have $10,000 in your bank account and you earn a 12.5% annual return on your investment. After 12 months, you receive a deposit of $12,500 as an interest payment. After five years, you have $16,250.

2. You know what compound interest is:

It’s interest on interest. You get interest on the initial amount you put in, and you get interest on the interest already accumulated from the previous years.

So with compound interest, after 5 years you won’t have $16,250, you’ll actually have $18,020.

So far, so good.

***But what if there was a “third way”?***

This is the question we asked ourselves as programmers.

3. Here’s what Missile interest is:

When you take your crypto and lock it up on Missile Farm we find ways to add to the compounding of your asset. If one of the platforms we use gives away a promotional coin on top of any interest, then we take that promo coin and sell it for more of what you staked.

‌���The result is a significantly higher overall annual return.

When Missile Farm combines your 3402% annual compounding interest with the 2480% interest of another site’s promotional coin, you get 5882% APY on Missile Farm.

Missile Farm’s wBNB vault is doing just that. At the time of writing, you get 6132% APY for your BNB.

***After just 1 month, that 10,000$ would already amount to 20684.5$. How about 12 months? An astounding 613,200$! ; even with a more realistic APY, which according to our predictive model would approach to 280% in 6 months, the 5 year ROI will be around 1,721,036.8$; all in the asset you actually staked!***

Advantages of DeFi applications:

🔹- Any user can get one or another financial service, for example, lending, bypassing the bank. 

🔹- Decentralized landing protocols minimize risks and open access to borrowed funds 24/7. 

🔹- The procedure for creating your own digital asset and its introduction to the market has become noticeably easier and has become available to almost everyone. 

🔹- Payment processing does not last several days, but a maximum of a couple of hours

🔹- interest rates and commissions have become much lower. 

🔹- For developers, the ease of creating applications is becoming a clear advantage due to transparency and open source, in addition, DeFi projects can be developed on any platform that interacts with smart contracts.

👉 Most of the existing DeFi are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and the most famous project is MakerDAO, a decentralized lending protocol.

Even if the mechanism is not identified, this possibility may be a factor to deter some users from using DAI. I think this could be alleviated by explaining better the interplay between MR, DAI and the rest of the crypto market ecosystem. In practice, there are many scenarios that could be simulated using multi-agent simulations. The result of the many scenarios could be published and peer reviewed to demonstrate that DAI is resilient to certain scenarios and not resilient to other scenarios. This work could also help MakerDAO foundation to make more informed proposals."

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web."

Liquity: A Better Alternative to MakerDAO for Collateralized Loans,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n94ekx/liquity_a_better_alternative_to_makerdao_for/,showSomeRespect13,1,2021-05-10 21:26:37,0,/r/ethereum/comments/n94ekx/liquity_a_better_alternative_to_makerdao_for/,NaN,[removed]
Liquity Protocol: A Better Alternative to MakerDAO for Collateralized Loans,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/n98yph/liquity_protocol_a_better_alternative_to_makerdao/,showSomeRespect13,1,2021-05-11 00:13:46,0,/r/ethtrader/comments/n98yph/liquity_protocol_a_better_alternative_to_makerdao/,Warning,"*Background:* I’ve been following Ethereum since 2016 and have been a user of Maker since the beginning - including opening one of the first couple hundred CDPs. I had the absolute pleasure of being liquidated in late summer of 2018 so I’ve seen the ins and outs of the protocol.

TL;DR: Liquity lets you take a loan at 0% with as low as 110% collateral.

[Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) is a new entrant to the collateralized loans space on Ethereum, having launched April 5th and reaching 1M ETH locked in only a couple weeks. It allows for borrowers to take loans out indefinitely at 0% interest. You read that correctly - *0%*.

There’s a 0.5% initial fee to borrow as well as a 200 LUSD liquidation reserve to help pay for gas in the event your position is liquidated. When you pay back your loan, the 200 LUSD will be returned to you.

*So, why, with terms that are so incredibly favorable to borrowers hasn’t this project seen more fanfare?*

Well, to be honest with you, I’m not sure. The team is incredibly intelligent and seems to be approaching it from a heads-down academic perspective, with no marketing to speak of. I only stumbled across it randomly myself last week and was surprised I hadn’t heard a word about it in the full year up to the launch, or even as it climbed to #6 on the DeFi Pulse lending index.

*What’s the catch?*

For borrowers, there isn’t really a major downside under normal circumstances compared to MakerDAO *except* that Liquity only accepts ETH as collateral. In the event of a black swan, and ETH crashes immediately and aggressively, you’d be susceptible to liquidations. For very short term loans with large positions, you might be better off using Maker due to the 0.5% fee you’d pay up front to borrow. There are very rare situations where you may be liquidated below 150%. I won’t pretend to be able to explain it better than the docs themselves, so take a look [here](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/recovery-mode)

*So this all sounds great, how can this be?*

MakerDAO uses a variety of incentives to keep DAI pegged to $1, including having the governance feature of MKR tokens raising/lowering borrowing rates to encourage specific borrow/redemption behavior.

Liquity will automatically raise borrowing fees ever so slightly above 0.5% when very large loans are taken out (the amount is nearly negligible, however). LUSD that are minted from your “trove” - the equivalent of a CDP or vault in Maker’s system - can *always* be redeemed for $1 worth of ETH from the system. In the case LUSD falls below $1, you would expect redemptions to occur, reducing LUSD supply. If LUSD were to go above $1, minting new LUSD from your trove for a quick arbitrage brings it back to $1.

The real reason Liquity shines is that capital is always available for liquidated troves. Whereas Maker uses an auction system, which inherently requires a larger collateral in the event of a large price drop in the collateral to protect the system, Liquity only needs an additional 10% to ensure system safety.

Users are incentivized to lock LUSD in the “stability pool” in return for earning a share of new LQTY tokens, as well as the opportunity to capitalize on ETH being sold to them at a discount when liquidations occur. The APR for this will vary depending on the current price of LQTY, but tends to fall around 30-45%.

*Ok so they have two tokens? Why?*

That 0.5% fee I mentioned earlier? If you stake your LQTY tokens, you’ll receive a pro-rata share of that in the form of LUSD. When the protocol launched, APRs were nearly *1,000%*. While that’s unsustainable in the long term, as demand for new loans goes up, you can expect APRs that will likely exceed most other opportunities in DeFi. You can check the trailing 7d APR, as well as a plethora of other cool statistics about the system [here](https://duneanalytics.com/dani/Liquity).

*Is this safe?*

Great question! You might be wondering if the smart contracts themselves have been audited There are possible economic conditions where unexpected losses of funds can occur

Luckily Liquity is well buttoned-up in this regard, and you can find the audits and economic simulations in their [docs](https://docs.liquity.org/documentation/resources). I actually found the economic simulations and math behind them fascinating, and I’d encourage you to take a look. Their deployed contracts are immutable, so there’s no danger of code getting switched up on you.

*Ok but I’ve never heard of these guys before. Why should I trust them with my hard earned ETH*

You might feel more comfortable reading up on the founders and seeing that investors include Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, and well-known personalities such as Meltem Demirors and David Hoffman throughout their seed round and series A. [Take a look here](https://www.liquity.org/team)

*So how do I actually use it?*

This one is interesting. The team has opted to forgo making their own “front-end” in favor of providing the kit to do so and letting various front-ends spring up. In this way, Liquity remains even more decentralized and removes points of failure if one front-end were to go down. This decision also incentives a level of marketing at the front-end level without the team having to spend any resources on it. The “kickback rate” determines how much the end user receives from depositing to the stability pool on a specific front end. A 100% kickback rate means you’ll get all the rewards. You can find a list of front-ends on their website [here](https://www.liquity.org/frontend)

Though most front-ends look relatively similar, the one that has stood out and that I will recommend is definitely Liquity Land frontend.  
Website: [liquityland.com](https://liquityland.com/)

They have the best UI so far, with some fancy added functionalities (Liquidation price, debt in front of me etc).

If a front-end were to go down, you can use any other one. Note that if you want to change your kickback rate when switching to a new front-end, you’ll have to re-stake (unstake all funds from frontend A, and stake on frontend B).

The Liquity team has a wealth of information on their YouTube channel, including a more in-depth [explanation of how it’s different than MakerDAO](https://youtu.be/bXLTE-5BkhA). Their Docs are a good place to start for digging deep and the team is incredibly responsive on their discord. You can find a link to that on [their website](https://www.liquity.org/).

Nonetheless, my mind struggles with some of the working mechanisms of MakerDAO and, especially the governance voting. **The fact that voting power is proportional to the MKR holdings goes against my intuition of decentralization.** I understand that more involved people are probably more knowledgeable about the technology and possess bigger bags. However, this creates a barrier for newcomers to educate themselves about Maker and participate in votings. Moreover, the more people possess MKR the higher their voting power and the higher the centralization. In theory, big banks could buy loads of MKR to have an important influence on decisions? 

In my ideology, decentralization is a way where everyone has the same power to influence governance and where money is out of the question. What are your thoughts?"

We’re looking for a full-time remote (US preferred) operations guru who loves to create playbooks, grow a community, and wear many hats. This person needs to be confident in external facing roles and a great communicator.

## Who we are

Our team has deep crypto-native roots, working at some of the leading consumer teams in web3 like CryptoKitties and the most well-known governance ecosystems like MakerDAO. We’re combining the best of both worlds of web3 with a focus on getting mainstream users down the crypto rabbit hole ? ?️

**Market opportunity** \- cryptonetworks struggle to find the right token holders who want to grow the network instead of speculating, often willing to spend hundreds of dollars per user for millions of dollars without being able to grow the community.

**Product opportunity** \- RabbitHole is making it easy for users to discover new networks, participate, and earn tokens. RabbitHole tracks your activity on-chain to measure your progress and find the right task for you.

## About You

**You have deep experience in crypto.** RabbitHole’s mission is to help the best crypto companies succeed by serving as the best place to discover crypto projects and help them find their early users. This requires a high degree of crypto expertise, knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each network. You’ll get exposed to early stage projects and work with crypto founders directly.

**You get stuff done.** You’ll have (often ambiguous) responsibilities ranging from product to operations. You should be taking it upon yourself to always be learning and find new things to work on.

**You’re entrepreneurial.** This role is autonomous - you’re really excited about proposing and testing ideas based on issues and opportunities you see.

**You’re a proven operator.** You have 2+ years of experience in a technology company, consulting firm, investment bank, or other high-performing company.

**You’re analytical.** You’re fascinated by data and enjoy structuring complex and ambiguous problems. You’re a whiz at Google Sheets and (ideally) have experience using SQL and business intelligence software.

**You deal well with pressure.** RabbitHole’s customers work hard to build their communities, and we partner with them in their most important moments of growth. You thrive under high pressure situations like this and enjoy keeping others calm, on task and on track.

**You’re a great communicator.** This is a highly external facing role. You will be communicating with all different types of stakeholders, from projects, to users, and more. You like to communicate complex ideas very simply.

**You ship.** You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. People know they can count on you to get things done.

## What the job entails

**Make the best teams in crypto successful.** RabbitHole has helped companies like Aave, Matcha, and Gnosis grow their user base by crafting incentive opportunities for users. You’ll work closely with companies like these to support them during campaigns and leverage internal resources to make sure they’re successful.

**Improve internal decision making.** You will analyze large amounts of data and make actionable product recommendations based on it, building dashboards and helping people across the company leverage our data.

**Grow the RabbitHole community.** You will run experiments and create content to support campaigns that educates users and drives new user growth into the RabbitHole ecosystem.

**Scale our operations.** You will design amazing processes, building playbooks to help us systematically run campaigns, and balance that against a steady stream of ad-hoc operations requests and interesting problems that need solving.

**Be a founder.** As an early part of our core team, you will take it upon yourself to identify opportunities for RabbitHole, get buy-in internally, and execute. RabbitHole is an incredibly entrepreneurial environment and we want people who will take advantage of this.

* **Utility Tokens:**

Take for example Filecoin which is used to purchase storage space on a network. The fact that it might be used to purchase services or redeem rewards makes it a utility token.

* **Security Tokens:**

They resemble traditional stocks but instead are in digital forms. Security tokens give back to its owners’ equity, or dividend payout and they are attractive because of their speculation of price appreciation. Just like stocks, these kind of tokens is offered to the public through initial coin offerings (ICO), instead of initial public offerings (IPO).

* **Stablecoins:**

Cryptocurrency trading is characterized by volatility since its launch. Stablecoins, as their name suggests aim to reduce this volatility and be more stable by pegging their value to precious metals, fiats or other cryptocurrencies. Social media behemoth Facebook’s Diem is the [most famous example](https://www.investopedia.com/facebook-fb-hopes-to-launch-digital-currency-in-2021-5090528) of a stablecoin backed by the dollar. Other examples of stablecoins are USDC and MakerDAO.

* **Mining coins:**

Mining-based altcoins are mined into existence which is using a Proof of Work method where the system generates new coins by solving difficult problems to create blocks. Zcash, Monero, and Litecoin are examples of mining coins. There is also the pre-mined alternative just like Ripple XRP, that is produced through an algorithm but are distributed before they are listed in cryptocurrency markets."

Here I will attempt to summarize what stablecoins are, give you a few key stablecoins to consider, and list some helpful resources which will probably give you better information than a rando like myself. 

**What are stablecoins?**

*Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their market value to some external reference.* Coins like USDC, DAI, Paxos Standard, and USDT (Tether) all attempt to peg their value to the US Dollar. The 4 above examples typically do so fairly effectively, so many in the crypto realm consider these coins or tokens to be a less risky investment. Crypto Banks even offer much higher interest on stablecoins because they are less risky and can be used in lieu of dollars. This means that a portfolio invested in stablecoins is less volatile than a portfolio without. Depending on the percentage of that portfolio of course.  

Okay so stablecoins won't go down with the market, but what are the risks and cons? All stablecoins are *minted* on another platform, primarily Ethereum (other examples include XLM, TRX, and BSC). This means that if the platform's network is compromised in someway, your stablecoins are likely to be susceptible if not compromised. However, this risk applies to any token minted on the above platforms (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, BAT). For the gamblers and Yolobois, you might also consider that stablecoins also do not go *up* with the market either. However, we are assuming intentions of investment, not a casino with this post.

**What are some Stablecoins to Consider?**

**USDC:** *USD Coin (USDC) is a digital stablecoin that is pegged to the United States dollar and runs on the Ethereum, Stellar, Algorand, and Solana blockchains. Each USDC is backed by a dollar held in reserve, and USDC reserves are regularly attested by Grant Thornton, LLP.* That's right, each USDC is backed by an actual paper dollar held in a bank.

**DAI**: *Dai (or DAI) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency which aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, MKR, who may vote on changes to certain parameters in its smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.* This means that the value of DAI is given by an actual pool of Ethereum that is shifted in and out of the pool according to Ethereum price and investor demand. 

**Paxos Standard**: *Paxos Standard Token (PAX) is a regulated ERC-20 stablecoin, which maintains 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar. It was issued by the Paxos Trust Company on September 14, 2018, and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).* For those in New York, this is the safest option to consider.

**USDT**: Last but not least, the most popular of them all with its first mover advantage, but the sketchiest and most risky of them all. *Tether is called a stablecoin because it was originally designed to always be worth $1.00, maintaining $1.00 in reserves for each tether issued.[7] Nevertheless, Tether Limited states that owners of tethers have no contractual right, other legal claims, or guarantee that tethers will be redeemed or exchanged for dollars.[4] On 30 April 2019 Tether Limited's lawyer claimed that each tether was backed by only $0.74 in cash and cash equivalents.* Tether was the first stablecoin to enter the market, and with first mover advantage it is paired with many other cryptocurrencies on many exchanges. This makes USDT quite useful if you trust that the value is worth 1 US Dollar. Whenever handling tether however, be aware that it is unlikely the token is *actually* backed by an entire dollar's worth of assets. On one hand, if we all treat USDT like a dollar, its worth a dollar. On the other, government agencies domestic and abroad might be weary of this token. 

There are also stablecoins pegged to other currencies, like the Euro, British Pound, and even the Turkish Lira! I find all of these to be interesting and I'd like to see more options enter the market. However, since the global financial system tends to run on USD, the crypto market follows suit and you will find these easier to move about as things currently stand.

**Stabelecoin Resources**

[Straight from the Ethereum Website](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/).

[Coindesk writeup on Stablecoins](https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-stablecoins).

[As I mentioned earlier, stablecoins tend to yield much higher yields in crpto banks. One might consider this a less risky way to stack some green, or to earn green even during a bear market. This is the best guide I've seen on bank considerations, and I've searched around.](https://prohashing.com/guides/earning-interest-on-cryptocurrencies)

I hope this was helpful to some, regular cryptos like Bitcoin and Litecoin are still fine and awesome! But stablecoins are something to seriously consider for any investor in this crazy world where things can change with a tweet."

XAYA is an open-source project maintained by Autonomous Worlds Ltd. The history of XAYA can be traced back to 2011 when its core team members participated in the Namecoin project who later became the voluntary leader of the project in 2013. Then the team built Huntercoin, the world's first blockchain game. Released in February 2014 as an experimental 1-year project, Huntercoin was met with great enthusiasm and is still running today.

The founder of XAYA launched the Chimaera project (the word *Chimaera* comes from Greek mythology) in October 2016, renamed it ""XAYA"" in early 2018. The XAYA blockchain was launched in the second quarter of 2018 along with its first MVP game, which was *Treat Fighter* by Tricky Fast Studios; in June 2020, it announced it had been included in Ubisoft's start-up program.

XAYA’s vision is to fundamentally change how people perceive video games and how they play games. They see the blockchain as a transformational technology where games transcend the virtual and take on a life of their own in the real world.

https://preview.redd.it/2vv3j465s1z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7fa22ad382252557af352176c68d59563c5d8a6

&amp;#x200B;

**II.** **Project Introduction**

With XAYA, games can be open sourced, and run normally around the clock without a server. Users can mine in games, and innovate with the help of new economy and game types.

Soccer Manager Elite and Taurion, two of XAYA’s games, were among the 28 blockchain games to keep an eye on in 2020.

Soccer Manager Elite (SM Elite) is a remake of the classic battle-proven MMO soccer game, “SM Worlds”, which uses blockchain technology to bring players a sense of reality, ownership and complete control. You can choose a game mode from many options in the game, be it a manager, broker, club owner, stock trader, speculator or any combination of the above, and compete with thousands of players.

SM Elite is purely community driven, with true asset ownership and built to last forever. Soccer Manager coin (SMC), the currency of this game, is priced at CHI. Users can purchase SMC through CHI or earn SMC through games.

Taurion is developed on the Xaya blockchain network. Inspired by the classic science fiction novel *Dune* series, this game brings players a similar feeling. Players can choose from different factions, and each faction has its own advantages and disadvantages and game features. Players can forge their own path on this planet of deserts, and obtain resources through battles, team formation, and adventure.

https://preview.redd.it/g6d5tt6us1z61.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee9d5d559f0f36020154aeb889315a9304029a25

For developers, the ultimate benefits of these players can make the game more attractive. By providing a new and better gaming experience, developers can accelerate business development using the best features provided by XAYA.

A treasure hunt game, similar to a tank treasure hunt, was released in August 2020. More than 20 blockchain projects provided tokens as rewards for winners of the competition. The biggest sponsor was MakerDAO who had provided 2,500 DAI. According to XAYA, 3,000 users signed up, and eventually more than 600 participated in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**V. Latest Progress**

In 2021, XAYA issued Wrapped CHI (WCHI), a token based on Ethereum.

WCHI can be circulated in Ethereum or traded in markets such as Uniswap. The listing of tokens provides Ethereum with more types of tokens. Users can also hold WCHI in the Ethereum wallet through MetaMask, instead of the XAYA wallet. It is reported that Wrapped CHI will be listed successively on XAYA, Ethereum and other platforms.

Some random thoughts about some random alts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ne6z3u/some_random_thoughts_about_some_random_alts/,ethereumflow,1,2021-05-17 12:47:05,50,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ne6z3u/some_random_thoughts_about_some_random_alts/,LEGACY,"I'm an interoperability maximalist that believes in a multi-chain local network future, I don't think it will be a one chain rule them all world. I have always taken a research based approach and have dug into the depths of crypto to find projects I think are cool. This is sort of a brain dump of some different projects that I like and some explanation as to why. 

None of this is meant as shilling, I am simply sharing what I think is cool. Some of these I hold, some I don't. Don't buy my bags, always do your own research. 

**ATOM**: What people don't realize about it is what's to come. Once everything is going with the GravityDEX, Osmosis, liquid staking and Ethermint then ATOM will be a strong competitor. As the centre of the Interchain Finance vision Cosmos Hub will be a key player in the internet of blockchains connecting all of these networks together. I shill this one here plenty so I won't get too into it. 

**SCRT**: This isn't the only privacy mention I will have. I believe in privacy to be a fundamental human right and financial privacy is misunderstood. Secret Network offer a unique solution of programmable privacy. Rather than being a privacy coin SCRT is a platform for privacy applications. Everything on the SCRT main chain is transparent, addresses are public and validators as well. SCRT is not much different than ATOM in the simplest of terms but the applications of Secret Network are what sets it apart. All data in Secret contracts is encrypted. Encrypted inputs, outputs and state. This is how SecretSwap is able to be the first anti-front running DEX in crypto. Transactions are fully private, the explorer only shows that your address interacted with a smart contract. No values, no send or receive details whatsoever. As part of the Cosmos ecosystem SCRT will support IBC eventually but I feel like I should mention that SNIP20 tokens will not be. IBC won't be able to read secret contracts. 

**BEAM**: If I am honest I don't think Monero is scalable enough to be a long term privacy solution, the road to correct that is a long one. SCRT, while I think is fantastic, does not have the same ""money"" characteristics as MimbleWimble chains do, they serve different purposes. While I like the philosophy of GRIN more BEAM is years ahead in terms of development and far more user friendly. If GRIN suddenly had a multi-million dollar dev fund and committed teams able to contribute then it would be a different story. Until then BEAM is one of the most interesting and innovative platforms I have used. MimbleWimble is such a fascinating protocol, one might say magical, and BEAM have done a great job maximizing the tech. It's a centralized approach like ZEC but BEAM is on the road to decentralization and the BEAM company will progress to the BEAM foundation with more open governance. Using BEAM goes to show the value of having funded devs on the project though. 

MimbleWimble is pretty complicated because there are no addresses, no wallets so to speak and with BEAM they have added Dandelion(this ""fluffs"" the transaction to multiple nodes), zero-knowledge proofs and LelantusMW. Another thing with MimbleWimble is that transactions require interactions from both sender and reciever(annoying right?). This means that the receiver needs to be online when the sender sends, to make this easier BEAM have added a Secure Bulletin Board System(SBBS) which allows for the transaction to be signed by the other wallet within 12 hours. Again, this only requires the wallet being online and no other functions so if the wallet is a full node then it will be received immediately. BEAM transactions are fast and private and fun to do. You can even perform offline transactions to make it even more badass. 

**DGB**: DigiByte was an early interest of mine. It's as decentralized as any network could be and has no leading figure or team. There is the DigiByte Foundation which is a non-profit group of volunteers that are passionate about the future of DigiByte. The longest, fastest, most decentralized and most secure UTXO proof of work blockchain, DGB is underrated and undervalued in my opinion. DigiByte supports Digi-assets(essnetially NFTs) and has a working Digi-ID blockchain based login system. Antum ID have adopted it for a small scale project.

 DigiByte is not a privacy coin, though Coingecko class it as one, but they have one cool privacy feature added, Dandelion++. You may remember this one from BEAM, same idea but DigiByte adopted the same concept as GRIN and Monero. Dandelion protocol is kind of direct metaphor to what happens. There is a stem phase of the transaction when it is sent, then it goes into the fluff phase when the transaction is broken up into bits and sent to various nodes(this is slightly slower as a result). Unlike Monero ring signatures this isn't meant to hide the transaction but is rather to obfuscate the sender's IP address. 

The DigiByte community is also great. I have been a member of it for a while and keep up to date with it. I've even contributed to their guides for Ren Bridge as a tester and writer. The cool thing about it is that's how DigiByte happened, people volunteering their time to contribute to the network. I've learned a lot from Josiah as far as community focus growth and decentralization as a core value. 

**REN**: Since I just mentioned renDGB this is a good transition. I don't hold any REN, I like RenVM but didn't plan to run a dark node, which is the only use case for the token. I was an early adopter and tester of Ren Bridge and credit Ren for being the reason I became an interoperability maximalist. Using Ren Bridge taught me the value in cross chain value exchange and liquidity transfers. Largely a learning experience I used Ren Bridge to research the best privacy approach to Ethereum DeFi, renZEC used to be the best privacy solution (until renZEC which is public) for exchanging into and out of Ethereum and then Secret Network came along. I still think renZEC has a cool use case for Ethereum but it would now be better off bridged to Secret Network to stay private. 

Fun fact about Ren, the team behind it helped build wBTC. The knowledge they gained working on wBTC is why we now have renBTC, a decentralized and permissionless version of wBTC. wBTC Cafe uses Ren Bridge and Curve finance through a smart contract to permissionlessly wrap BTC onto Ethereum for wBTC. Ren Bridge transactions were the first really cool smart contracts I got to see and understand and that's what got me so into it. Such a complicated operation was made so simple. The team behind the project are brilliant and also very open to conversation and helpful to users of the platform. Similar to what I mentioned about BEAM, REN have a progressive decentralization plan. They wanted to build  working product and be able to help users along the way in a sort of live testnet. Everything is still considered a sort of live beta right now, not just RenVM, and it will become more decentralized as it grows. There are already over 1300 REN dark nodes. 

**NEAR**: Sharded proof of stake blockchain with Ethereum token and smart contract support, a joke in the community is ""ETH 2.0 is NEAR"". NEAR protocol is a really interesting project, they are also on a progressive decentralization plan and are now in the decentralized phase of it. They launched first as a proof of authority mainnet and have transitioned to their proof of stake mainnet now. The focus for NEAR is on usability for both developers and users of the platform. NEAR wallet has usernames instead of confusing addresses(after a 1-time setup) so that it's easier to send/receive tokens. The platform is fast and simple to use, NEAR is a sleeping giant in my very biased opinion. A lot of their use case seems to be growing in the NFT space as they have Mintbase launching very soon and Paras is live. DeFi will be an obvious addition and Ref Finance is the current community built option for the brave willing to test out a sharded DEX on NEAR. 

What I like most about NEAR is the usability. The story goes that they showed up at an Ethereum hack-a-thon and spent most of the time setting up their tooling. Multiple members of the NEAR team are competition winning developers that worked at places like Google and MemSQL so they figured that the issue was in dev tooling rather than dev skills. They set out to create the dev tools needed and did so with their own more scalable and more usable blockchain. The NEAR devs also led whiteboard sessions on YouTube which featured other devs from various projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and Solana, sharing ideas, thoughts and code. NEAR has taken a collection of ideas from these whiteboard sessions and hacked them together into what is one of the most high performance blockchains out there. 

*NEAR is also certified carbon neutral. This is important to me.*

**ZIL**: The other sharded chain, actually the first one, Zilliqa has taken their own approach to the scaling problem. Zilliqa, like Ethereum, has a custom programming language, Scilla. It is based on oCaml so may be familiar to some but is not popular. They say it is a secure programming language and I believe the, because the devs behind Zilliqa are smart. Dr. Xinshu Dong was a privacy and security programmer securing web browsers prior to and Amrit Kumar was an XMR contributor before knowing what Bitcoin was. Their combined knowledge with many other academics from the University of Singapore tell me that the brain power behind Zilliqa is strong. 

ZIL is fast, low fee and eco-friendly thanks to Zilliqa's hybrid proof of work-Byzantine fault tolerant model. Only require minutes of mining per day ZIL is able to achieve consensus through a staking mechanism. I think Byzantine fault tolerance is fascinating as it's important for Cosmos chains and illiqa are using a different approach from Cosmos there and also have a different sharding technique than NEAR. 

An interesting connection for Zilliqa comes through ZilSwap, which is powered by Switcheo. Switcheo is built with the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint which means ZilSwap will be able to support Cosmos IBC eventually, when they decide it's worth adding. ZilSwap will also be bridged to Ethereum and Binance meaning they are building a role as an cross chain DEX. 

**ANT**: Aragon is a DAO of DAOs and when it comes to decentralization Aragon is as raw to the core as it gets. Aragon is totally open source and management of the project is up to the community. AragonDAO powers plenty of projects like AAVE, 1hive, Decentraland and many more. AragonDAO is even the treasury custodian for Agave, a 1hive project built on xDAI. Agave almost deserves its own mention and you should DYOR on that one because it’s pretty sweet, pun intended. 

I’m big on governance and have learned a lot about concepts and ideas from Aragon. Luis Cuende is an inspiration and the ethos behind the project can motivate anyone to make a change. Aragon is a manifesto driven organization. The community involved are all motivated by the same vision for a better, more decentralized world. 

**ONT**: Ontology is often viewed as a NEO airdrop that went nowhere, that couldn’t be more wrong. Ontology went through a mainnet upgrade in 2020 which changed their staking system and network entirely. It’s a new and improved platform with some cool innovations. Ont-ID is a key feature of theirs along with their decentralized credit score system. Li Jun, co-founder, often talks about Ontology in relation to data. DEX is a DDX to him, a decentralized data exchange. He also refers to Ontology as a decentralized trust network. There are different levels of decentralization and Ontology are targeting more enterprise adoption and have tailored their network accordingly. 

Wing Finance is built on Ontology and is the only DeFi option on the network. Wing utilizes the credit score system built by Ontology for a credit score based lending platform, a pretty exciting innovation in the space. 

ONTO wallet might be the best thing about Ontology. Full support for ETH/ERC20 tokens and access to dapps like Uniswap, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO, Curve, KyberSwap, CREAM and more. Ontology automatically connects the wallet to dapps for use. Ontology solved mobile DeFi with ONTO wallet.


This became longer than I intended. I like talking about alts and have a lot to say about them. Feel free to comment, what do you like about these? What projects do you like that I didn’t mention and why? Feel free to have a discussion."
Can this 'Blockchain' stuff help out with institutional racism?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nel5hl/can_this_blockchain_stuff_help_out_with/,BlackGuyWitCrypto,1,2021-05-18 00:43:24,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nel5hl/can_this_blockchain_stuff_help_out_with/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"**Warning!! Thoughts All Over The Place**

This is my first post, Hello World! 

I'm a newb from America and was DYOR and started thinking...

No matter what race, nationality, sexual orientation, or life choices, we all come together in crypto!

I mean think about it.

Some of the most opposite of people, for example, in my country both citizens, Republicans and Democrats, come together to drive the price (up and down), innovation and adoption of so many projects, I.E. Doge, Bitcoin, 'Shits and Giggles' etc.

Absolute, dyed in the wool, racist will invest their same fiat dollars in projects, that people they claim they despise, also invested their same fiat dollars! 

Hoping for the same outcome!

Anyways

So this DeFi stuff I keep bumping into...

If I got this right, are you telling me that these DApps, these 'Smart Contracts' 'DAOS' are actually 'Institutions Represented As Code (IRAC)'? 

Compound, AAVE, UNISwap, PancakeSwap, MakerDAO, Etc are actually digital representation of the current financial institutions?

Again I'm very new at this and trying to wrap my head around whats going on.

I've been lurking here for a few months and benefited greatly from the community as a whole and look forward to much wow!"

**If however the Dai obtained from the PETH auction is not enough to pay down my CDP, PETH will be sold off from the PETH pool for Dai.**

I assume the PETH that's sold off are other people's collateral? Doesn't this have a lot of downstream negative effects? For example, if someone gets liquidated in the PETH-DAI pool and their PETH is not enough to pay back the debt, then someone else's PETH is sold to pay off the DAI, but that could cause someone else to be liquidated and so on."

Specifically, network growth can be attributed by MATIC’s recent partnerships between SushiSwap, Decentraland, MakerDAO, Zebi, and Hey Coral.

Although ETH has had a bad two weeks, this is clear evidence that loss of MATIC/Polygon value has lead to an oversold token which is ripe for strong gains. The current rise in the MATIC/Polygon transaction rate is inversely correlated with the recent price of ETH. As such, as ETH begins to rise from its current dip, new all time highs can be anticipated based on the expectation of even further network activity.

How DeFi lending can restructure older financial systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm1xhw/how_defi_lending_can_restructure_older_financial/,pepperonimilkjuice5,1,2021-05-27 15:20:48,0,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm1xhw/how_defi_lending_can_restructure_older_financial/,FINANCE,"Cryptocurrencies have opened new doors for finance and lending. Since the inception of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, we have seen innovations of all kinds – from stablecoins to full-blown decentralized finance projects. While stablecoins brought stability to highly volatile cryptos, DeFi introduced new ways to generate income. One such popular method is lending.

&amp;#x200B;

The onset of the pandemic has made people look for an investment option. DeFi lending presented the preposition of making money on crypto holdings without the traditional goalkeepers of loans. Instead of banks or other central entities, people could now choose a decentralized platform to borrow or lend loans. It resulted in the explosion of this new form of lending, with over $29 billion locked in different DeFi lending platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

In this article, we explore some of these lending protocols and find out how they work:

&amp;#x200B;

\##MakerDAO

&amp;#x200B;

Developed by Rune Christensen in 2018, MakerDAO is an organization building technology for lending and a stablecoin on the Ethereum network. It allows users with cryptos to lend themselves capital in a stablecoin called DAI. The platform is the top lending protocol on DeFi pulse, with over $10.11 billion of assets locked.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How It Works\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone can lock up cryptos in a smart contract to create a certain amount of DAI. These DAIs can then later be converted into fiat or exchanged for any other crypto asset. The more locked-up crypto, the more DAI one can take as a loan. To unlock the locked digital assets, users need to pay back their DAI loan along with MakerDAO’s fees.

&amp;#x200B;

As most cryptocurrencies are volatile, when the price of a locked-up asset drops below a specific range, MakerDAO‘s protocol immediately sells off the collateral to pay back the borrowed DAI plus penalties and fees. This threat of liquidation keeps the project stable and ensures no one exploits the system. Whereas, when the price of a locked-up asset increases, users will get extra DAI.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DAI stablecoin, MakerDAO uses MKR tokens to govern its system and support the stability of DAI. DAI is created when someone takes out a loan, and MKR is created or burned depending on how close DAI is to its peg of $1. If DAI is stable, the protocol burns MKR to decrease the total supply. When DAI goes below the $1 peg, more MKR is issued, increasing the supply and maintaining stability of MakerDao’s lending protocol. In terms of utility, MKR holders can vote on the governance decisions of MakerDAO. Also, they get incentives for acting in the best interest of the protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

\##Compound

&amp;#x200B;

Invented by a former economist Robert Lishner, Compound has been leading lending protocol in the DeFi space. It enables borrowers to take out loans by collateralizing their cryptos and allows lenders to provide loans by locking up their digital assets. Compound may look like it works like other lending protocols, although it differentiates itself by tokenizing the assets locked in its system via cTokens.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How It Works\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Similar to MakerDAO, Compound also uses crypto as collateral to lend out money. However, instead of DAI or some other token, Compound issues ERC-20 cTokens (or Compound Tokens) that represent users’ funds locked up in its protocol. In simpler terms, when users deposit any crypto as collateral, they will get an equivalent amount of cTokens. For example, for putting up ETH, users will get cETH.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, users can deposit their cryptos to earn interest. For example, for depositing ETH to generate interest on Compound, users receive cETH. Each asset locked up in the protocol has its value, and the amount of demand and supply of the underlying asset determines the interest rates to be received and paid by lenders and borrowers. Another unique factor of Compound is that all cTokens generated in exchange for cryptos become freely usable, movable, and tradeable in other DeFi applications.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to earning interest on crypto assets, users can also borrow other cryptos on Compound by depositing collateral in return for “Borrowing Power”. The more the “Borrowing Power”, the more cryptos one can borrow. Compound avoids liquidation of locked-up assets by working on the concept of over-collateralization. It means borrowers must supply more value than they wish to borrow.

&amp;#x200B;

\##TruFi

&amp;#x200B;

To bring about the next era of borrowing and lending in DeFi, TrustToken has launched TrueFi – a credit protocol for collateral-free lending. The TrueFi protocol adds something new to on-chain lending: crypto-native credit scores informed by on-chain and off-chain data, as well as the wisdom of the crowd of TRU token holders. It’s unique approach has originated over $105 million in loans, with no defaults, since November 2020. As of writing, the Total Value Locked in TrueFi is close to $100 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How It Works\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike other lending protocols, TruFi doesn’t require approved borrowers to deposit collateral to loan funds. Loans are drawn from lending pools funded by depositors of stablecoins like TUSD, USDC and soon USDT, on which depositors earn a competitive rate of return but also accept some risk in case of default. To borrow, applicants submit data on their business and crypto history, resulting in a credit score that sets the terms on the borrowers’ TrueFi loans – and eventually, may inform loans on other DeFi platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

Borrowers who fail to return the money within the allotted time will face legal actions pursuant to an enforceable loan agreement signed during the onboarding process, and a hit to their credit score.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first version of TrueFi, loans were given based on borrower proposals voted by TRU stakers. However, in the newly launched TrueFi V3, the platform relies on a credit model informed by several factors, including repayment history, company background, operating and trading history, assets under management, and credit metrics. Moreover, with this V3 launch, TrueFi brings multi-asset support in the unsecured lending space, soon to support almost any asset on Ethereum for lending and borrowing.

&amp;#x200B;

\##Final Words

&amp;#x200B;

The growth of DeFi lending in recent years is proof that this trend has the potential to reshape the entire financial system. However, just like any technology, it also comes with unpleasant attributes. What if a third-party smart contract in a lending protocol is faulty? There is also the risk of borrowing APY rising dramatically within a short period.

&amp;#x200B;

While the entire lending process is simple on the above-listed protocols, users should be cautious and ensure they operate on a secure platform.

Pretty excited, the under collateralized loaning looks interesting - can be used in a similar method of MakerDao and the real estate loan"
Are you new? Get a brief intro with a short 1 sentence summary of some coins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nmqiz0/are_you_new_get_a_brief_intro_with_a_short_1/,Thecoinjerk,1,2021-05-28 13:19:47,40,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nmqiz0/are_you_new_get_a_brief_intro_with_a_short_1/,TRADING,"For the newcomers: some of the top Cryptocurrencies, each explained with one sentence.

I tried summing up some of the top coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
