What is Ethereum? A guide for beginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6v5ts/what_is_ethereum_a_guide_for_beginners/,Ooftmoontime,1,2021-12-02 09:30:09,59,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6v5ts/what_is_ethereum_a_guide_for_beginners/,TECHNOLOGY,"I wanted to create this post as we often get told that BTC and ETH are safe investments. However, I believe that if you put your money into something you should understand the underlying technology behind this asset. This is some research on the Ethereum network and it's native ETH token aimed at giving beginners a primer. I'm uploading this to ascertain my own degree of knowledge so if anyone sees any issues or over-simplifications please let me know! I hope to do this with other popular networks. A lot of this information was gathered from reading various articles on the web. Special mention for the section on Layer 2 scaling solutions - most of this information was gained from watching the Finematics Youtube channel. 

**Ethereum Network** 

* Decentralised, open source blockchain with smart contract functionality 
* Can be through of as 3 layers built on top of each other:

1. Ethereum blockchain layer 
2. Smart contracts which use the programming language Solidity 
   1. For example this could include: Mark and Bob send 5 Eth to Jack, if this occurs then automatically send 2 Eth from Jack to Alice 
   2. Smart contracts may also be leveraged to create new tokens 
   3. An issue with smart contracts is that since the code is visible to all, bugs are obvious and are not quickly fixed. This has been exploited once before in the 2016 attack on DAO 
3. dApps, DeFi, etc. which Ethereum users can interact with 

* It currently runs using a PoW blockchain which is slow and has resulted in high transaction fees ‚Äì this is currently being remedied with the Ethereum 2.0 update which will transition to a PoS system
* Each node within the Ethereum network communicates with a small number of nodes within the network known as its peers
   * When a node wants to include a new transaction in the blockchain it sends the transaction to its peers and this is then propagated throughout the network 
   * Certain nodes (miners) maintain a list of all new transactions and use them to create new blocks, which are then sent to the network 
   * As the network is non-hierarchical a node can receive competing blocks, which may form competing chains 
   * The network achieves consensus by following the ‚Äúlongest-chain rule‚Äù ‚Äì stating that the chain with the most blocks at any given time is the canonical chain 
* *Ethereum Virtual Machine* = Runtime environment for transactions executed in Ethereum, enabling network Conesus 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereum 2.0** 

* This is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network set to be released by \~2022 
* The main purpose is to increase transaction throughput for the network from its current \~15 transactions/second to up to \~10,000/second 
* It aims to achieve this via *SHARDING* ‚Äì the process of splitting work into multiple blockchains and then having them all share a common PoS blockchain. This means that any malicious tampering with any singular chain which would require tampering with the common consensus from the main chain (too difficult) 
* It will be launched in 3 phases:

1. Phase 0/Beacon Chain = Launched on 1/12/2020 with creation of the Beacon Chain, a PoS blockchain that will act as the central coordination and consensus hub of Eth 2.0 
2. Phase 1/The merge = Merge of the Beacon chain with the current Eth network, transitioning the consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS 
3. Phase 2/Shard chains = Implementation of shard chains with Eth 1.0 set to become one of the shards of Eth 2.0, with a total of 64 blockchains 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cjv5qz5u51381.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d7546bdafe2e96773a2d2e69304123e49d3645

**Gas** 

* This is a unit of account within the EVM which is used in the calculation of a transaction fee (the amount of ETH that must be sent to pay the miner who includes the transaction on the blockchain) 
* The higher the gas price the more incentive the miner has to include the transaction in their block 
* Gas prices are denominated in Gwei (1 Gwei = 10-9 ETH) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Applications** 

* ERC-20 token Standard 
   * This allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain 
   * It utilises smart contracts and provides functionality such as transferring tokens between nodes
   * Fees to send ERC-20 tokens must be paid with Ether 
* NFTs 
* DeFI
   * Offers traditional financial instruments in a decentralised way, free from any one centralised authority 
   * These can be accessed via web-based extensions such as MetaMask, allowing the user to directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain 
   * Examples include MakerDao, Compound, Uniswap 

&amp;#x200B;

**Layer 1 vs Layer 2 scaling** 

* Layer 1 vs Layer 2 Scaling 
   * Layer 1 represents the base consensus layer of the algorithm, and Layer 2 solutions don‚Äôt require any changes in the consensus layer, but by anchoring to Layer 1 they leverage its security 
   * Layer 1 of Ethereum can process \~15 transactions/second, layer 2 solutions could expand this to 2000-4000 tx/second 
   * The benefits of layer 2 solutions is that they greatly improve transaction speed and transaction throughout whilst reducing gas fees \\

&amp;#x200B;

* Channels 
   * These allow participants to exchange multiple transactions off-chain whilst submitting only two transactions to the base layer 
   * The most popular type = state channels (and their subtype payment channels) 
   * There are 2 problems with channels - 1) they don‚Äôt offer open participation, 2) channels are application-specific and cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts 
   * The main project leveraging state channels on Ethereum is Raiden 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fdmw0ucv61381.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f55feb02ecb51f5cdaaf03745a5e99c3cf9b3792

* Plasma 
   * This is a framework for building scalable applications on Ethereum 
   * It leverages the use of smart contracts and Markle trees to enable the creation of unlimited numbers of child chains (copies of the parent Ethereum blockchain) 
   * This offloading of transactions increases throughput + speed 
   * An issue with this - 1) people have to wait a long time to withdraw their funds from Layer 2, 2\_ cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts 
   * OMG network have their own version of Plasma known as MoreViable Plasma
   * Polygon is another example of a platform using their own version of Plasma 

&amp;#x200B;

* Sidechains 
   * These are Ethereum-compatible, independent blockchains with their own consensus mechanisms and security 
   * Interoperability is possible by using the EVM, meaning that contracts deployed to the Ethereum base layer can be directly deployed to the side chain 
   * An example is xDai 

&amp;#x200B;

* Rollups 
   * These provide scaling by bundling/‚Äúrolling up‚Äù side chain transactions into a single transactions and generating a cryptographic proof 
   * This proof is known as SNARK (Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) 
   * Only the SNARK is submitted to the base layer 
   * Rollups allow all transaction + execution states to be handled in the maintain, whilst the Ethereal maintain stores the transaction data 
   * 2 types - Zk rollups &amp; Optimistic Rollups 
   * Zk rollups are faster and more efficient, but do not provide an easy way for existing smart contracts to migrate to Layer 2. The 2 major Zk rollups = Loopring + Diversifi 
   * Optimistic Rollups run an EVM-compatible virtual machine (OVM) which facilitates the execution of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum base chain. Major one = Optimism"

**Discussion**

With 20+ years‚Äô experience as [integration specialists](http://spo.de/#service) and a number of high-profile clients under their belts\[1\], [Marten Jung](https://de.linkedin.com/in/martenjung)\[2\] and [Stefan Schmidt](https://de.linkedin.com/in/stefschmidt)\[3\] launched Unibright and its accompanying token. The UBT token was released in early 2018 by Unibright IT GmbH as one of the first fully regulated ICO‚Äôs in Germany. The initial idea and [whitepaper](https://unibright.io/download/unibright_whitepaper.pdf)\[4\] revolved around no code templates for common enterprise use cases, such as Multi Party Approval, Batch Tracing, and Asset Lifecycle, through the powerful Unibright Framework and it‚Äôs visual workflow creator and management tools. The template approach was seen as a key way to cut business costs and implementation times - *build once, sell many* \- and has led to Unibright being compared to a ‚Äú[Wordpress for Blockchain](https://twitter.com/Sjaaaakster/status/1247075501723746307?s=20)‚Äù\[5\]. The generic word ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù is not incidental. While the Unibright token is erc20, the project is blockchain agnostic. The ‚Äúno code‚Äù visual approach removes the requirement for expert developers and allows anyone to design custom workflows using the Unibright native templates. Perhaps the most underappreciated aspect of the framework is the ‚ÄúSmart Connectors‚Äù that connect existing off chain data and enterprise software to the blockchain. Obvious candidates are [SAP](https://store.sap.com/en/product/display-0000059272_live_v1/UB%20Framework)\[6\], [MS Dynamics, Salesforce, Email, Excel, even other blockchains](https://docs.provide.services/framework/)\[7\].¬†

The first ‚Äúproduct ready‚Äù version of the framework was released in [early 2019](https://medium.com/unibrightio/the-unibright-framework-is-product-ready-we-are-leaving-beta-status-4064a8dab280)\[8\], along with a [public demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF2Ex-sePV4)\[9\]\[10\] for anyone to trial and see just how easy it is to use. Work has continued since that initial release, and the focus is now on expanding the utility of the UBT token. UBT recently underwent a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù retronym rebrand to ‚Äú[Universal Business Token](https://docs.provide.services/framework/ubt-token)‚Äù\[11\] ‚Äì a reference to it being the only token a business client would ever need. In 2019 Unibright revealed they were working on a security tokenization template, called ‚Äò[Freequity](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-tokenization-a8562f7ac83e)‚Äô\[12\], which includes components for security, token definition, issuance, exchange and liquidity, derivatives, portfolios, big data, custodian services, and integrations with existing software. These components are all available without code, are regulatory compliant, and are implemented with an intuitive, visual approach.¬†

The Unibright team has authored several [blog posts](https://unibrightio.medium.com/)\[13\], including a [demo of AMM liquidity pools for security tokens](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-defi-freequity-trading-component-demo-4dec674b132c)\[14\]\[15\]\[16\], a video [walkthrough of the Freequity platform](https://medium.com/unibrightio/token-issuing-setting-up-liquidity-pools-simulation-and-trading-with-unibright-freequity-5d451b6cb636) \[17\]\[18\] (with everything from compliance to issuance and trading), [Coinbase Custody](https://medium.com/unibrightio/ubt-confirmed-for-coinbase-custody-deepening-partnership-with-provide-to-enable-the-universal-129b8f0bf75e)\[19\], and most recently, integrating their [Freequity components with Hedera Hashgraph‚Äôs ‚ÄúHedera Token Service‚Äù (HTS)](https://hedera.com/blog/unibright-integrates-hedera-token-service-to-scale-asset-tokenization)\[20\]\[21\].

In 2020, Unibright joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, heading the [‚ÄúEMINENT‚Äù Taskforce](https://entethalliance.org/eea-mainnet-working-group-forms-task-force-eminent-ethereum-mainnet-integration-for-enterprises/)\[22\] with Chainlink and Anyblock Analytics. Unibright also joined the [Baseline Protocol as a founding member](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/)\[23\], and member of the [Technical Steering Committee](https://medium.com/unibrightio/baseline-repo-public-unibright-on-the-tsc-baselining-explained-84a3bc4c2e58)\[24\]\[25\], alongside other companies such as AMD, EY, ChainLink, Core Convergence, ConsenSys, Duke University, Envision Blockchain, MakerDAO, Microsoft, Neocova, Splunk, Provide, and W3BCLOUD. Baseline Protocol is an open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to execute secure and private business processes at low cost via a public Mainnet. Through this work on the Baseline Protocol, Unibright has formed close working relationships with a number of other key players. Among the most notable is Provide.services. Marten and Stefan joined the Provide team, and Provide committed to integrating the UBT token as the only payment token for their techstack, effectively merging the two companies. Thereafter, notable client projects commenced, including[ Coke One North America](https://medium.com/unibrightio/baselining-the-north-america-coca-cola-bottling-supply-chain-f87539220269)\[26\], [Fraunhaufer IPK](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-fraunhofer-ipk-collaborate-on-baselining-additive-manufacturing-7469c36143a3)\[27\] and [Between.rs](https://youtu.be/R0OohGiBNGc)\[28\]. The year concluded with Unibright and Provide presenting initial work and use cases for these clients at the [‚ÄúBaseline-as-a-service Demoday‚Äù event](https://provide.services/baseline-as-a-service-demoday)\[29\]\[30\]. During this event,[ CONA expressed praise for the rate of progress](https://youtu.be/C5iFSZh1nfM)\[31\], and that they intended to go live with their solution from Unibright and Provide in early 2021.

The [‚ÄúBaseline-as-a-Service‚Äù product offering is now named ‚ÄúShuttle‚Äù](https://provide.services/news/provide-adds-no-code-workflow-designer-to-shuttle-for-baselining-your-business-processes)\[32\]\[33\], and the first live version is live. Kyle from Provide gave an [update on the CONA project](https://youtu.be/WNK9Nx61-RI) \[34\] and highlight key metrics such as $100m in savings had been made, and $650m of tokenized invoices were predicted for the project over the next 12-18 months. More live demos and clients are set to follow in the coming months, the first which was [ServiceNow](https://youtu.be/nUq8lXVmNOc)\[35\].

One of the most interesting conversations to come out of this work was whether[ Ethereum, or any other existing public mainnet is suitable for enterprise clients](https://youtu.be/s2Quwz7FLd8)\[36\]. In February 2021 the [‚ÄúBaseledger‚Äù whitepaper](https://medium.com/unibrightio/baseledger-the-blockchain-for-baselining-powered-by-ubt-db44d2a02289) was released\[37\]\[38\]\[39\]\[40\] ‚Äì a blockchain built with one purpose: Baselining! Most importantly, for the UBT token holders, was that Baseledger would use UBT as it‚Äôs native token, and also introduce a staking mechanism. Other notable points from the whitepaper included that it will use Tendermint; UBT will remain an ERC20 token, it will have incredibly high TPS, fixed transaction costs, cross-chain utility, with a strong focus on business processes rather than DeFi. For example, CONA could use Baseledger for baselining, but could then release their tokenized invoices on Ethereum, Hedera or Polkadot. Rather uniquely, it will be GDPR compliant. GDPR compliance proved to be one of the more uncomfortable issues for clients interested in baselining, as the compliance officers at large corporations are overcautious of putting data on blockchains.¬†

Baseledger is one of the biggest topics on 2021 for Unibright and Provide, but not their singular focus. The teams are continuing to onboard real, paying, clients ‚Äì which is their number one priority!

**Tokenomics**

Unibright‚Äôs native token, UBT (ERC20), tokenomics can be split into two parts: UBT is required to participate in the Baseledger network, and UBT is required to access both Unibright‚Äôs and Provide‚Äôs services.

Unibright launched as in ‚Äúinput‚Äù utility token ‚Äì UBT can be used to pay for various services provided on the platform, for example discounted blockchain consultancy workshops. Additionally, tokens can be locked for usage within the Unibright framework to cover transaction costs. In 2020, Provide also adopted the UBT token as a payment token, and introduced[ ‚ÄúProvide Payments‚Äù](https://providepayments.com/)\[41\]. Provide Payments introduced ‚Äú[Universal Blockchain Token](https://provide.services/ubt-token-model)‚Äù\[42\] into the crypto vernacular, reflecting a way for UBT to be used as the base currency for all transaction costs an enterprise blockchain solution may incur. For example, Ethereum and Chainlink may be required to run their solution. The client purchases an amount of UBT each month with Fiat through Provide, which is then used to cover their costs in various other tokens. Hence the client only needs to hold/use UBT, and everything else happens behind the scenes.

With the release of Baseledger, the tokenomics loop is now complete, as UBT acts as both an ‚ÄúInput‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutput‚Äù token. Previously the token model required holders to either use their UBT or hold it. Baseledger now allows all token holders to participate in the Baseledger Network ‚Äì either as node operators or proxy stakers. Clients that use Baseledger will pay a flat fee per transaction in fiat, which is then converted into UBT on the open markets, and distributed to node operators and proxy stakers through a proof of stake consensus mechanism, as a reward for securing the network. This staking mechanism does not involve the creation of new tokens or inflation.

It is worth noting that the Unibright team does not hold any tokens, nor do they rely on the selling of tokens to remain in operation. Of the 150M tokens created, the team initially held 9m. These tokens have now all been distributed and it can be considered that the token supply is now completely distributed. At present, there are approximately 20,000 UBT wallets listed on Etherscan; the biggest individual wallet holds 1.13% of the supply for example.

UBT is a utility token, and the team works closely with lawyers and regulators to ensure compliance with everything currently being done, or planned for the future. Their ICO was among the first in Germany, which is highly regulated by BaFin, and Unibright also completed a [REG D](https://sec.report/Document/0001741355-18-000001/)\[43\] form for the SEC regarding the ICO. UBT has been listed on both [IDEX for US users](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-idex-ubt-added-to-us-audience-85c26997052f)\[44\] and Coinbase Custody, which gives a strong indication that UBT is compliant with all relevant Regulations.¬†

**Community and Communication**

Unibright communication and its community are present on Telegram, Twitter, Reddit and Medium - all links can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unibright)\[45\]. Team members of both Provide and Unibright regularly feature on ‚ÄúThe Baseline‚Äù Youtube show, as well as TSC meetings. The team also speaks at events and takes part in interviews and AMA‚Äôs for the community. Good examples of this would be the recent [AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OqiCwd2Vs) \[46\] held with Patrick Lowry, CEO of Cryptology AG, and Rachel Wolfson of Cointelegraph, and then also the two part interview with [Hashoshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IItj47F6cZ4)\[47\] and [Cryptofiend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYqsFn5CVkE)\[48\].

Engagement by the community on twitter is often highlighted as a strength, and all social platforms have seen considerable growth over the last 12-18 months. Community members also have a very active ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù telegram, a community information website, [unitrooper.com](http://www.unitrooper.com/), and also a blog that keeps a record of all the most important things said by the team on telegram.

**Available Audits**

The Unibright token is listed on various exchanges, such as IDEX US, Bittrex Global and Coinbase Custody, all of which have high standards and checking of smart contracts that involve the token. It would therefore be reasonable to assume that these exchanges checked before supporting the UBT token.

**Market and Trading Data**

Unibright‚Äôs price at the time of writing is $1.19. It‚Äôs all-time high was $1.64 (19th Feb 2021), and its all-time low was $0.0079 (25th November, 2019). There are 150,000,000 tokens in circulation, of 150,000,000 maximum supply. The current market capitalization is $178,500,00. The UBT token is available on several major exchanges and a number of leading DEXs. In order of liquidity, the top exchanges that have listed UBT are: Uniswap, Bittrex, Quickswap, IDEX US, Kyberswap, and Hotbit. The 24-hour spot volumes range from $922,391 (Uniswap) to $203,462 (Bittrex) and $90,816 (Quickswap).

MakerDAO weekly forum review (November 25 - Dec 2),https://forum.makerdao.com/t/forum-at-a-glance-november-25-december-2/11967,Artyoma92,1,2021-12-03 03:31:34,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r7f8k8/makerdao_weekly_forum_review_november_25_dec_2/,NaN,
The Ultimate Stablecoin of them all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7val3/the_ultimate_stablecoin_of_them_all/,DaddySkates,1,2021-12-03 17:27:13,27,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7val3/the_ultimate_stablecoin_of_them_all/,ANALYSIS,"# DAI: A Systematically Sustainable Stablecoin

Some who aren't yet familiar with the concept of stablecoins may ask themselves..what exactly that magical coin that is going up even in bear market? I have your attention now right?

Stablecoins are a group of cryptocurrencies where the price is pegged to (usually) a FIAT money such as dollar, yen, euro;  a cryptocurrency, or simply to exchange-traded commodities. These are cryptocurrencies that try to minimize the volatility in crypto market.  Stable coins provides us secure transactions, instant transfers without borders, low fees and quick settlements.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about DAI stablecoin?**

DAI is a stable coin that is issued by MakerDAO. It's an Ethereum-based protocol, which maintains an exact ratio of one-to-one with the USD. DAI as a stable coin is used for lending or borrowing crypto without any need for 3rd party making it a permissionless, transparent system with minimal restrictions.

&amp;#x200B;

**What makes DAI so special when we already have so many stablecoins?**

We have Tether, USDC, PAX, BUSD and others that are already providing all that stablecoins need.

DAI  keeps price in check with advanced smart contract system that is fully automated. If When price of DAI starts going too far from USD, Maker (abbrevated MKR) tokens are burned or created in order to stabilize the price of DAI.

The system manages the price of without the need of 3rd party which could pose as potential fraudulent activity on chain or simply middleman taking its cut. If the system works as intended and DAI keeps the constant value to US dollar, the holders of MAKER coins get benefits because the total supply of MKR is burned and through that the value increases with supply and demand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you just create DAI?**

Not as one would think. DAI isn't printed like FIAT in unlimited quantities but is instead created when a user takes a loan on Maker DAO. When that loan is paid the DAI is burned.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, you convinced me but I need some TLDR PROs because I don't want to read this wall of text!**

Alright. To sum it up why DAI is one of the best stablecoins out there:

* \- The marketing from MakerDAO is starting to really get insane momentum and they are branding the DAI as the worlds first unbiased currency.
* \- DAI doesn't need real US dollar in order to back it. It works on completely different level and unlike Tether it's a much more reliable and secure way to run a stablecoin.
* \- DAI competitors USDT and USDC are controlled by the governing companies, which makes it hard to define such cryptocurrencies as decentralised. DAI is independent.
* \- You can't print DAI like you can print FIAT. Issuing DAI is governed by smart contracts which are immutable. Noone has ability to interfere with DAI.
* \- DAI isn't backed by FIAT but instead it's macked by cryptocurrency.
* \- Interaction between DAI and smartcontracts gives it a good support in DeFi. There are already over 400 DeFi apps that integrated DAI.
* \- Another very important point is that they have a really kickass logo

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And here is a really interesting fact for you... did you know is that DAI actually ""started"" here on Reddit with eDollar? Pretty cool huh?

*Below is a brief summary of ETHLisbon videos where Our Founder* [***@stse***](https://talk.harmony.one/u/stse) *and COO* [***@lij***](https://talk.harmony.one/u/lij) *interview web 3 developers and builders, to include Chief officers and creatives regarding social, geographic or developmental issues. The intention of this post is to increase awareness of other protocols or products which are solving today‚Äôs issues.*

*These are individual clips from the Harmony Protocol Youtube channel during their time at ETHLisbon, please like and subscribe to that channel. Also please share, retweet, upvote and like.*

If you would like to contact the Harmony ONE Community DAO, you can reach us via Harmony Protocol discord server or [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/OneCommunityDAO?s=20) where we host weekly twitter spaces for the Harmony ONE community to speak, ask and learn!

**‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a revolution happening right NOW, if you WANT to live in a world you LOVE then BUILD IT!‚Äù**

**- To start this thread up, an interview with Near Protocol**

[Alex of Near Protocol by Stephen Tse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQNqyEpTY-o)

**Stephen opened up by asking Alex about his start at Near Protocol**

* Near Launched in 2018 - is also a Sharded Chain
* Alex background in database design &amp; architecture - engineering
* Alex mentioned how the database ecosystem is more mature with strong engineers
* Database tech already built and the innovation behind it comes out just once a year, not such a thrilling space to be, people who may like writing papers instead of solving issues may find the space to be suitable
* Alex said AI space was over-hyped, that the blockchain space is healthier and with more ambitious people
* Also stated that the blockchain development sector is heavily unexplored and how bridges in 2019 were awful in stark contrast to today, where they are throughout the blockchain space

**Alex began talking further about DAOs**

* DAO tooling called Sputnik on Near Protocol which if the DAO is focused in or around NFT, music or education it would be easier to onboard and simple to use web wallet
* Integration with payment and invoice systems for the DAOs to pay people
* Alex mentioned he would like the DAOs to be the next wave, although Metaverse seems to be ready to carry the torch as DAOs have so much more to grow
* Problems with today DAOs is lack of self organization and difficult to get participation
* Theres a shortage of tooling for DAOs in order for it to be successful wave such as the summer of Defi, and the recent emergence of NFTs

**Closing comments by Alex - If you are young get involved in cryptography, take on math, ""this is where the money will be""**

**-Next video is Gabriella Chang from Ethic Hub**

[Gabriella interview by Stephen Tse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kykgIye1iaU)

*Gabriella (Chief Success Officer) opened up the conversation going into her background as a developer in Mexico, where she saw first-hand the issues the coffee producers were facing. At that time Gabriella and those with Ethic Hub decided to tackle the issues with the traditional financial system which tends to leave out ¬º of the population which includes small farmers.*

***The solution they came up with was Ethic Hub***

* Although most farmers are organized, due to geographic location there is many that lack financial tools
* Many farmers only have one hectare of land and although most have profitable activity, they still are living within poverty

**Stephen asked ‚Äúwhy is this financial instrument important, and it‚Äôs not just simple as crowdfunding?‚Äù - such as Gofundme**

***Maria responded with the following points***

* Through the platform they provide a transnational decentralized crowd-lending services backed by crowd collateral
* Provides lending to farmers to be able to access resources with the financial instrument having fixed lending rate at 8% APY
* Farmers unite forming an organization through a representative who provides the tools for them to access the resources which Ethic Hub provides
* What the platform plans to do is connect DeFi farmers to traditional farmers
* 50% of total supply locked, the platform is over-collateralized
* 2017 Ethic Hub launched at the exact moment of the bear market, which for everyone in that space especially builders a difficult time, gave the team a strong foundation to build on

*She also mentioned that farmers who live in poverty provide 80% of the total supply of coffee beans*

*Ethnic Hub soon plans to expand throughout other regions within South America and intends to launch a pilot into cacao. It also plans to offer the tools to farmers in Honduras and Brazil.*

***Gabriella finished by saying ‚ÄúBe aware of the technology that is around us which could be utilized to do new things, not the same things faster‚Äù.***

**- The following summary is from Harsh Rajat of Ethereum Push Notificiation Service**

[Harsh Sajat interview by Stephen](https://youtu.be/0hAsyfTHBmQ)

*Building communication between blockchains with on and off chain notifications to drive governance participation*

**User Opt-in protocol for notifications to applications such as Gitcoin, Aave, Polygon**

* Any Dapp or smart contract can provide on or off chain notification in a platform-agnostic way
* Notifications can arrive through multiple crypto supported wallets such as Metamask, Trust Wallet including Solana
* Pilot co-lab, with the following- MakerDAO, Uniswap, TrueFi, Alpha Homora, Gitcoin and Aave

***Harsh Sajat mentioned that he believes Harmony will be joining the co-lab program and that Harmony team knows them well***

**Stephen Tse asked about Harsh Sajat background , when Stephen met him Harsh won a hackathon at ETHGlobal 2020 and now is involved with EPNS**

* began as a Web 2 dev back when it was iOS 3, minimal tools available
* Nightmare to program at that time, no middleware, no API
* At that point in time Apple Launched notifications, notifications were coming through email and it was really slow (constantly checking for updates)
* Harsh had really understood the infrastructure with the difficulties he faced by remaining resilient and he persevered

**Stephen mentioned, he is looking forward to the use case tools for DAOs and asked Harsh to go into detail of what could they provide for DAOs**

* Working with Snapshot, Aragon and Boardroom offering alerts to their users
* Notifications transform to video or call to action, which would be similar to WhatsApp or Twitter alert
* People will see the proposal and have a simple yes or no interaction, no need to go to snapshot site to cast vote

*Harsh closed off by saying he knows EPNS will provide an increase in governance and community engagement with these simple tools, there would be no more hoops or hurdles of jumping through wallets to get to a snapshot. Harsh Rajat believes the tools created at EPNS will be friendly enough to onboard users giving them a text like notification so even the newest user can be involved.*

**Harsh Rajat loves Harmony** **üì∑**

**- Next Manuel Alzuru from DoinGud**

[Interview by Stephen Tse](https://youtu.be/pil5cvwxwDY)

*Manuel started developing as child by porting products from the United States to Venezuela. He went into detail about his time in Venezuela during the civil unrest they had with inflation, and his involvement on the ground led him to trouble, which is what made him move to Spain.*

**The concept of DoinGud is as simple as doing good deeds**

* Creators tokenize assets and stream money to 17 sustainable development goals: climate change or equality while different project tackle those issues
* People can participate in governance and be involved with social causes
* NFT as a social movement, instead of group of people creating value, it just requires ONE person to see the need and value
* ETHBarcelona is upcoming which Manuel feels that the Spanish community will provide a great experience combining tech, art and activism

**Later Stephen mentioned how he would like Harmony to be deeply involved with ETHBarcelona**

*Manuel resides in Spain and Stephen noted how the impact of the Spanish and Latino community is vast throughout the world, Manuel agreed and used Latin music as a reference also the fact that Spanish is the 2nd most spoken language.*

**Stephen asked how we can increase exposure in the Spanish community and how we could help**

*Manuel‚Äôs response was not to force people to adopt technology as in El Salvador to its citizens which could be counter intuitive to growing adoption.*

**Manuel final comment when Stephen said he would be a driving force for the Spanish community ""Lets F\*ing GO!""**

**- Lastly interview with Anthony Beaumont from Encode club**

[Interview by Li Jiang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNHLGMZiA4&amp;t=37s)

***Encode is a Web2 to Web3 education community company***

* Hackathons, coding camps, bootcamp accelerators, Encode supported during ETHLisbon
* 100x subscriber increase in a year
* Everyone is hiring, Anthony says and states its both good and bad, but feels certain innovation will continue to grow

*When Anthony mentioned scaling 100x, Li asked if that could actually happen, Anthony responded saying ‚Äú believes they can, although the only bottleneck with scaling is that the people are interviewed personally‚Äù, roughly just 1/3 are accepted.*

**Li asked Anthony why are people joining now?**

*Anthony mentioned developers have an upside in the market naturally due to Supply and Demand and how having only 6 months experience is about 7% of all experience. Right now there is a fairly low risk opportunity, to the people who are on fence enticed to join he believes crypto has a way to attract people whether by luck or judgement. Anthony stated that the bull market may be the reason for growth of participation, although he personally says anyone joining the space now is unlikely to make short term money.*

**Li asked Anthony how are ideas evolving in the development space between Web2 and Web3 devs**

*Anthony replied that everyone has the same evolution although, the smarter people usually move through the space faster into DeFi and NFT, where the traditional thinker from web 2 would think of bringing an application from Web2 and apply it to crypto such as tracking a supply chain or creating a piggy bank of sort.*

***The Key principal of Encode***

* Makes it easy for Developers to do their job , Encode lays the foundation by making it simple and stress free
* Encode teaches specific blockchain applications
* The best people move fast doing multiple hackathon, hard to keep up with those hackers who excel
* Anthony says for anyone new development to take a leverage bet and get into the space
* Security and gas optimization are the key elements in coding after being taught the basics and that Encode Camp is focused on teaching these things in order to a high quality

**Closing comments by Anthony after being asked what would happen a year from now,**

*He felt skeptical of DAOs since basic infrastructure is lacking and that the current process is inadequate through discord, snapshot and gnosis safe. He states the place of disruption for a hacker would be to build tools in the DAO space. And as for NFT and game developers make the game first then come back to the token.*

***Gabriella finished by saying ‚ÄúBe aware of the technology that is around us which could be utilized to do new things, not the same things faster‚Äù.***

**- The following summary is from Harsh Rajat of Ethereum Push Notificiation Service**

[Harsh Sajat interview by Stephen](https://youtu.be/0hAsyfTHBmQ)

*Building communication between blockchains with on and off chain notifications to drive governance participation*

**User Opt-in protocol for notifications to applications such as Gitcoin, Aave, Polygon**

* Any Dapp or smart contract can provide on or off chain notification in a platform-agnostic way
* Notifications can arrive through multiple crypto supported wallets such as Metamask, Trust Wallet including Solana
* Pilot co-lab, with the following- MakerDAO, Uniswap, TrueFi, Alpha Homora, Gitcoin and Aave

***Harsh Sajat mentioned that he believes Harmony will be joining the co-lab program and that Harmony team knows them well***

**Stephen Tse asked about Harsh Sajat background , when Stephen met him Harsh won a hackathon at ETHGlobal 2020 and now is involved with EPNS**

* began as a Web 2 dev back when it was iOS 3, minimal tools available
* Nightmare to program at that time, no middleware, no API
* At that point in time Apple Launched notifications, notifications were coming through email and it was really slow (constantly checking for updates)
* Harsh had really understood the infrastructure with the difficulties he faced by remaining resilient and he persevered

**Stephen mentioned, he is looking forward to the use case tools for DAOs and asked Harsh to go into detail of what could they provide for DAOs**

* Working with Snapshot, Aragon and Boardroom offering alerts to their users
* Notifications transform to video or call to action, which would be similar to WhatsApp or Twitter alert
* People will see the proposal and have a simple yes or no interaction, no need to go to snapshot site to cast vote

*Harsh closed off by saying he knows EPNS will provide an increase in governance and community engagement with these simple tools, there would be no more hoops or hurdles of jumping through wallets to get to a snapshot. Harsh Rajat believes the tools created at EPNS will be friendly enough to onboard users giving them a text like notification so even the newest user can be involved.*

**- Next Manuel Alzuru from DoinGud**

[Interview by Stephen Tse](https://youtu.be/pil5cvwxwDY)

*Manuel started developing as child by porting products from the United States to Venezuela. He went into detail about his time in Venezuela during the civil unrest they had with inflation, and his involvement on the ground led him to trouble, which is what made him move to Spain.*

**The concept of DoinGud is as simple as doing good deeds**

* Creators tokenize assets and stream money to 17 sustainable development goals: climate change or equality while different project tackle those issues
* People can participate in governance and be involved with social causes
* NFT as a social movement, instead of group of people creating value, it just requires ONE person to see the need and value
* ETHBarcelona is upcoming which Manuel feels that the Spanish community will provide a great experience combining tech, art and activism

**Later Stephen mentioned how he would like Harmony to be deeply involved with ETHBarcelona**

*Manuel resides in Spain and Stephen noted how the impact of the Spanish and Latino community is vast throughout the world, Manuel agreed and used Latin music as a reference also the fact that Spanish is the 2nd most spoken language.*

**Stephen asked how we can increase exposure in the Spanish community and how we could help**

*Manuel‚Äôs response was not to force people to adopt technology as in El Salvador to its citizens which could be counter intuitive to growing adoption.*

**Manuel final comment when Stephen said he would be a driving force for the Spanish community ""Lets F\*ing GO!""**

**- Lastly interview with Anthony Beaumont from Encode club**

[Interview by Li Jiang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNHLGMZiA4&amp;t=37s)

***Encode is a Web2 to Web3 education community company***

* Hackathons, coding camps, bootcamp accelerators, Encode supported during ETHLisbon
* 100x subscriber increase in a year
* Everyone is hiring, Anthony says and states its both good and bad, but feels certain innovation will continue to grow

*When Anthony mentioned scaling 100x, Li asked if that could actually happen, Anthony responded saying ‚Äú believes they can, although the only bottleneck with scaling is that the people are interviewed personally‚Äù, roughly just 1/3 are accepted.*

**Li asked Anthony why are people joining now?**

*Anthony mentioned developers have an upside in the market naturally due to Supply and Demand and how having only 6 months experience is about 7% of all experience. Right now there is a fairly low risk opportunity, to the people who are on fence enticed to join he believes crypto has a way to attract people whether by luck or judgement. Anthony stated that the bull market may be the reason for growth of participation, although he personally says anyone joining the space now is unlikely to make short term money.*

**Li asked Anthony how are ideas evolving in the development space between Web2 and Web3 devs**

*Anthony replied that everyone has the same evolution although, the smarter people usually move through the space faster into DeFi and NFT, where the traditional thinker from web 2 would think of bringing an application from Web2 and apply it to crypto such as tracking a supply chain or creating a piggy bank of sort.*

***The Key principal of Encode***

* Makes it easy for Developers to do their job , Encode lays the foundation by making it simple and stress free
* Encode teaches specific blockchain applications
* The best people move fast doing multiple hackathon, hard to keep up with those hackers who excel
* Anthony says for anyone new development to take a leverage bet and get into the space
* Security and gas optimization are the key elements in coding after being taught the basics and that Encode Camp is focused on teaching these things in order to a high quality

**Closing comments by Anthony after being asked what would happen a year from now,**

*He felt skeptical of DAOs since basic infrastructure is lacking and that the current process is inadequate through discord, snapshot and gnosis safe. He states the place of disruption for a hacker would be to build tools in the DAO space. And as for NFT and game developers make the game first then come back to the token.*

I spent 5 hours researching what a DAO is so you didn‚Äôt have to.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ragxwq/i_spent_5_hours_researching_what_a_dao_is_so_you/,Jxntb733,1,2021-12-07 04:31:53,885,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ragxwq/i_spent_5_hours_researching_what_a_dao_is_so_you/,TECHNOLOGY,"**What is a DAO?**  Standing for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a DAO is an internet-native blockchain-derived investor-directed venture capital fund organization managed by all members. At its core they have an objective to provide a decentralized business model for all future enterprises. Mark Cuban called them ‚Äúthe ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism.‚Äù

One important aspect is that all code is open-source. This is done with the aim to eliminate human error, manipulation, and third parties, by having an automated crowdsourced process of decision-making. Unlike a company, DAOs have democratized organizations allowing all members to vote for any implemented change. The DA organization is represented by transparent computational rules, secured on the digital ledger across the internet, hardened against forgery by timestamping, and disseminated as a distributed database. The DAO is controlled by the members; no managers or basses are needed. 

&gt;Bitcoin in essence is the first fully functional DAO with programmed rules and functional autonomy through consensual protocol; the miners and nodes signal voting through support.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**DAOs need four things really;**   
&gt;  
&gt;A set of rules,  
&gt;  
&gt;A funding token,  
&gt;  
&gt;Voting right provisions,  
&gt;  
&gt;A clear structure &amp; roadmap

  

|**DAOs**|**A traditional corporation**|
|:-|:-|
|Flat hierarchy.|Hierarchical.|
|Voting required for any changes.  |Changes demanded from sole party, voting   may be offered.|
|Voting outcome implemented automatically.|Tallied internally and outcome handled   manually.|
|Services handled automatically in a decentralized manner. |Human handling, centrally controlled automation, prone to error and manipulation. |
|All activity transparent and public.|Activity private.|

**Creation of a DAO:** 

* Step one; create a smart contract that once launched the rules can only be changed by coded governance system.
* Step two; sources of funding must be determined and governance must be engaged, typically funded via token sale that come with voting rights.
* Step three; deploy smart contract on the blockchain from which point onward stallholders will decide future organization. The dev(s) have no more influence than any other stakeholder.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can I join a DAO?:**  Just invest in their token, and boom, you‚Äôve joined. The smart contract token you just bought establishes the DAO‚Äôs rules, most likely you have to stake the token or another in the DAO to get voting rights and influence operations. This is typically done by deciding on and creating governance proposals. The fact that you need to stake to create proposals is to prevent spam proposals, and only (typically) proposals will pass if a majority of stakeholders approve (different percentage majority per DAO; specified in the smart contract).

**What‚Äôs the point? Where is the need?**  Are we all not internet native, or soon will be? DAOs are internet-native organizations with technological advantages compared to traditional companies. They have and establish a higher level of trust then say, the classical corporate hierarchy. Only the open source code needs to be trusted which is transparent thus auditable and verifiable at any time. This solves the economic principle-agent-dilemma where there may be a conflict of priorities between a group and those making the decisions for the group. The answer is community governance where incentives are aligned. There are charity DAOs, ones for NFT investments, for funding projects by Black women and non-binary artists, for funding women and non-binary crypto founders, some are exclusive social clubs, and others are for-profit business applications. I‚Äôve even seen freelance DAO networks of contractor.

&gt;**Examples of DAOs:**  Aragon, MakerDAO (MKR), DAOstack, DASH, JennyDAO, Jelurida, SharkDAO, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, Proof Of Humanity, Opolis, BanklessDAO, MolochDAO, 

**Downsides of DAOs:** No organization is perfect, decentralized or autonomous or not. This is extremely new technology that continues to attract criticisms over legality, security, and structural issues. As a DAO can be distributed across multiple jurisdictions, there is no legal framework. One may have heard about ‚ÄòThe DAO‚Äô crashing, as back in 2016. ‚ÄòThe DAO‚Äô was launched on Ethereum and raised $150 million in ETH (largest crowdfunding effort at the time) but a few days later developers expressed concern about a bug that would allow malicious actors to drain funds, and while a proposal was set forth to fix it an attacker took $60 million worth of ETH. At the time, 14% of all circulating ETH was invested in ‚ÄòThe DAO‚Äô. Chaos ensued and a hardfork was implemented on ETH. Those who disagreed moved to support an earlier version of the ETH network, which became known as Ethereum Classic, or ETC. Point being if any gaps in the contract framework aren‚Äôt closed before launch, it can lead to potential theft and money loss. *There is no such thing as a fully D &amp; A organization.*  Depending on governance, there are only various levels of decentralization. While the network may have independent but equal network actors, the smart contract rules themselves will always be a centralized loss of direct autonomy; architecturally and geographically decentralized yes but logically centralized on the protocol. Upgrading of code is often delegated to experts who understand techno-legal intricacies of code and are therefore a point of centralization.

**Future of DAOs:**  Despite the potential for DAOs to revolutionize the industry, and be a disruptive force to corporate structuring as a whole, they face security and legality issues.  As we all know the SEC claims some blockchain based companies might have made illegal offers of unregistered securities. There is also a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies from new investors, not to mention the technical competence one needs to understand the computational infrastructure and consensus mechanisms within the smart contract to feel good about investing in it. It‚Äôs not all bad though, Wyoming just became the first state to recognize DAOs as legal entities. DeepDAO says there are about 181 DAOs, with an ecosystem‚Äôs total assets under management (AUM) of $13.4 billion. 

Somewhere, in some business boardroom, people are trying to figure out how to integrate self-driving cars into DAOs of autonomous taxi drivers. You order an Uber and it comes, no company, just code."

A few years back a failed experiment called ""The DAO"" launched, it basically costed many people a lot of money because of the security breach.

Everything went quiet for a bit, then the new DAOs started popping up with:
. security protocols that are tied to ETH, making them pretty unhackable
. impeccable voting system that can truly make a difference
. unlimited liquidity

As a person living in the shittiest, most corrupt country you can ever imagine, participating in a DAO was literally a life changing experience for me. My vote was on the chain, permanent, without any politician being able to dismiss it or alter it in any way possible.

So what do you do when your government is a piece of shit? Form a DAO, can't form a DAO? participate in the current ones.

MakerDAO, BitDAO, and New Order DAO are some of the best that come to mind. What makes them stand out to me is their willingness to go out and improve what's around them, not just waste time and money to just focus on internal things within the DAO.

Get yourself some juicy governance tokens, participate in a DAO, make some profit for yourself by ensuring you vote on what you see is a great investment for the DAO, while actually improving the world around you.

# Announcing the Launch of Alpaca‚Äôs Auto-Farming Stablecoin ‚Äî AUSD!

[Huacayachief](https://huacayachief.medium.com/?source=post_page-----7dfff37ea695-----------------------------------)

&amp;#x200B;

  


[Dear alpacas,](https://preview.redd.it/3twfu3svrc481.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc5cd496eff2ca6958f3acdf73944edf241a061b)

Many of you have been waiting for this, and we now have a launch date for AUSD. We‚Äôre proud and excited to announce that AUSD will go live on the **14th of December at approximately 10 AM UTC!**

AUSD will unlock even higher profit potential for capital within Alpaca Finance and greatly increase the flexibility and use cases for your funds. There is currently no lending platform or stablecoin that has this level of composability and capital efficiency, which will firmly position Alpaca Finance as a DeFi 2.0 pioneer.

In this article, we‚Äôll go into the details of AUSD‚Äôs features, the launch plan, and the various ways you‚Äôll be able to earn more yields with this new stablecoin product.

# üéÅThe Benefits of AUSD

AUSD (Alpaca USD) is an **auto-farming stablecoin** that earns passive yields for you in the background. While most platforms that allow you to mint stablecoins force you to borrow while paying interest (MakerDAO, Liquity) or at best borrow while foregoing earning lending APR on your collateral (Venus), Alpaca will allow you to **borrow AUSD while earning yields on your collateral!**

What‚Äôs more is AUSD‚Äôs mechanics are robust, secure, and transparent. AUSD is **overcollateralized**, **decentralized**, and reinforced with **multi-layered pegging mechanisms** so that it does the one thing stablecoins are supposed to do ‚Äî remain stable at $1.

AUSD is a fork of the battle-tested MakerDAO, with many improvements. Some of the key features are:

**Farmable Collateral Module:**  
When borrowing stablecoins on other platforms, users typically have to choose between staking their assets to earn yields or staking their assets as collateral to borrow against. With AUSD, you will no longer have to make this tradeoff! Because you will be using [ibTokens](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/tokenomics/ibtokens) as your collateral, you will continue earning lending APR in at Alpaca(10‚Äì15% in the case of BUSD, BNB, USDT), as well as Staking APR, which at the moment earns extra ALPACA rewards but can also compose with other protocols. This means that in the future, your collateral will potentially be able to earn additional yields for you on external platforms.

Because the Lending APR alone is much higher than the stability fee for AUSD(2% for most collateral types), the loans are effectively better than interest-free, they are yield-bearing auto-farming loans.

**Efficient Pegging:**  
Being overcollateralized is not enough to maintain a stablecoin peg. In the case of MakerDAO, they can also adjust borrowing interest on DAI up and down for the collateral assets. In a situation where DAI‚Äôs price goes above $1, Maker can lower borrowing interest, incentivizing users to mint new DAI which creates selling pressure to bring DAI‚Äôs price back down to the $1 peg. In the case where DAI goes below $1, Maker can increase borrowing interest, incentivizing users to buy back DAI to close their borrowing positions because they have become more expensive, which creates buying pressure to bring the price back up to $1. AUSD also has this mechanism.

Moreover, AUSD will have an internal Stable Swap Module, similar to Maker‚Äôs Price Stability Module (PSM), which will allow users to buy and sell AUSD for BUSD at a rate of 1:1 with low fees. This will facilitate arbitrageurs in maintaining the peg at $1.

**Robust and Gentle Liquidation:**   
AUSD will use gentle liquidation, meaning if an AUSD borrowing position would face liquidation, only a small portion of the position would be liquidated until it was brought back to health. The max liquidation size will be limited to the Close Factor parameter, currently set to 25% of a position‚Äôs Debt Value. This gentle liquidation model results in **lower associated costs and liquidation risk** for AUSD borrowers, while still preventing the risk of bad debt.

AUSD will also use a robust atomic liquidation model. This has advantages over Maker DAO‚Äôs Dutch auction model, because AUSD‚Äôs model is simpler and better optimized for preventing bad debt.

**Insurance Plan:**  
While we‚Äôve made sure to set up the protocol structure and parameters to be very conservative, we will also have a backstop in place to handle the unlikely event of bad debt. When we launch our governance vault within the next 1‚Äì2 months, we will also launch an Insurance Plan. In this plan, in the case of a loss event such as bad debt, 50% of the Protocol APR going to the governance vault will be set aside as remuneration for this event, until the loss is covered. This way, the risk of bad debt will not only be minimized but also have coverage.

[AUSD‚Äôs code is completely open sourced and can be reviewed in our Github repository here: https:\/\/github.com\/alpaca-finance\/alpaca-stablecoin](https://preview.redd.it/51l2chjyrc481.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1e533a577e8512040afeec4d8bf05f1870eeff0)

# ‚è∞Launch Sequence

AUSD will be fully backed by top digital assets such as BNB, BUSD, BTCB, USDT, and TUSD, with robust risk management parameters. Still, to make sure that the launch is as safe as possible for our users, we will first start with only **one collateral pool (ibBUSD)** and **limit the maximum amount of AUSD that can be initially borrowed to 30Mn.** For absolute safety, we will closely monitor the activity, as we add more collateral pools &amp; increase the debt ceiling over the next few weeks.

## Phase I (December 14th)

* AUSD Module
* Farmable Collateral with ALPACA Staking Pools
* ibBUSD Collateral Pool
* Stability Fee Module
* Flash Liquidation
* Staking Pool for AUSD-BUSD LP (ALPACA rewards)

## Phase II (Week of December 27th)

* Stable Swap Module
* Flash Mint Module
* Additional collateral pools

## Phase III (Week of Jan 3rd)

* Additional collateral pools

&gt;*Note: Timeline provided for Phase II &amp; III is tentative and may be subject to change as the rollout progresses*

# üôãHow You Can participate

There are multiple ways you can participate and benefit from AUSD.

[Liquidity Provider:](https://preview.redd.it/0co0uvj0sc481.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc8b15b54c49fc1866c66bc74e2bd2209f0bb64)

We will incentivize AUSD holders as liquidity providers for the AUSD-BUSD pool with ALPACA rewards, targetting a **double-digit APY.** So you‚Äôll be able to easily earn extra yields by providing liquidity in this stablecoin-stablecoin pool on the [Stake page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake).

## AUSD Position Owner:

You‚Äôll be able to easily deposit your ibTokens (or underlying tokens such as BUSD) and borrow AUSD to further your profits by levering up your lending positions.

For example, you could execute the following steps:

1. Deposit BUSD into [Alpaca Finance Lending](https://app.alpacafinance.org/lend) and receive ibBUSD tokens.
2. On the AUSD page, borrow AUSD using your ibBUSD as collateral. A standard LTV with relative safety would be around 85%, meaning you could borrow 85 AUSD for every 100 BUSD collateral (max LTV aka debt ratio is 90% for BUSD)
3. Sell AUSD into BUSD
4. Deposit BUSD back into [Alpaca Finance Lending](https://app.alpacafinance.org/lend) and receive ibBUSD tokens
5. Repeat step 2

You can get up to **\~6x leverage on single-asset BUSD** by cycling through the steps above, earning up to **60% APR** on your BUSD in aggregate, based on the current rate(10%).

## Arbitrageur:

If the price of AUSD temporarily moved below/above $1, you could participate in arbitrage to profit from the price movements. We have modules in place to support and facilitate this arbitrage. More details in our [Docs](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/ausd/ausd-price-stability-module).

# üìÉBenefits to ALPACA Holders and Key Parameters

AUSD will introduce multiple new revenue streams for ALPACA holders. These include:

* **Stability Fee: 2% APR** (for most collateral assets) will be the Stability Fee on each AUSD debt position. 50% of these fees will go towards buyback &amp; burn of ALPACA (and Protocol APR for ALPACA depositors once the governance vault is deployed) while the remainder will go towards the development fund.
* **Liquidation Bounty: 5%** (4% (out of 5%) of the liquidation value will go to additional weekly buyback &amp; burn of ALPACA. 1% will go to the liquidator as a reward for closing positions when their Safety Buffers reach 0.)
* **Auto-Farming Performance Fee: 9%** of the rewards earned from farming AUSD positions‚Äô collateralized assets in Alpaca Staking (and external protocol deployment in the future). 5% will go towards the weekly buyback &amp; burn of ALPACA (and Protocol APR for ALPACA depositors once the governance vault is deployed) while the remaining 4% will go towards the development fund.
* **Close Factor:** **25%** (Max percent of the Debt Value of an AUSD position that could be liquidated in a single transaction when the position is subject to liquidation. This reduces the associated costs and liquidation risk for AUSD borrowers, while still preventing the risk of bad debt.)
* **Debt Floor: 500 AUSD** (This is the minimum amount of AUSD that can be borrowed when opening a position.)

## ibBUSD collateral Pool

* Collateral Factor: 90% (max LTV)
* Stability Fee: 2.0%

&gt;*These parameters might be changed from time to time in the future to maintain the health of AUSD‚Äôs ecosystem. Please refer to our Docs for the latest values.*

## AUSD-BUSD LP pool rewards

We will initially allocate **0.35 ALPACA/block** (\~70,500 ALPACA /week) as rewards to PCS AUSD-BUSD liquidity providers. You‚Äôll be able to stake your LP tokens on the [Stake Page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake) as usual. We will periodically review and adjust the rewards allocation as appropriate.

# üîêThe Safest Transportation Vehicle: An Alpaca

As always, security of all funds within Alpaca Finance is our highest priority. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve made sure all the AUSD smart contracts have **passed three audits** from professional security firms. As a result, you can rest assured, your assets will be safe in AUSD.

PeckShield Audit Report: [here](https://github.com/alpaca-finance/alpaca-stablecoin/blob/main/audits/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Alpaca-USD-v1.0.pdf)

Inspex Audit Report: [here](https://app.inspex.co/library/alpaca-finance#?scope=alpaca-finance-alpacastablecoin)

SlowMist Audit Report: [here](https://github.com/alpaca-finance/alpaca-stablecoin/blob/main/audits/SlowMist_Audit_Report_-_AlpacaStablecoin.pdf)

We know you‚Äôre all excited about this new product that can allow you to safely increase your profits. Yet, don‚Äôt forget that the initial hard cap on AUSD will be limited to 30Mn, which will be first come first served. So don‚Äôt blink and don‚Äôt go into a food coma from too eating too much grass, young alpacas.

Just remember this winning game plan:

1. Stay furry
2. Stay conscious
3. Stay profitable

$SPELL Token - the hottest Defi project on Coinbase (SPELL TO $1),https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/rc2anx/spell_token_the_hottest_defi_project_on_coinbase/,WingZeroX000,52,2021-12-09 06:08:19,79,/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/rc2anx/spell_token_the_hottest_defi_project_on_coinbase/,Meme,"This is a comprehensive thread on what [http://abracadabra.money](http://abracadabra.money) is, the role of its decentralized stable coin $MIM &amp; what is next for this #DeFi 3.0 multi-chain protocol on #ETH, #Fantom, #Avalanche, #Arbitrum, #BSC &amp; soon #Solana

$SPELL in short: Provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto &amp; borrow decentralized stable coin 'magic internet money' $MIM (peg 1$). Collateralize debt &amp; leverage yield positions. #DeFi 3.0 multi-chain protocol. Already $4.9B TVL.

With the protocol of $SPELL you can provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto assets such as cvx3pool, cvxtricrypto2, yvcrvSTETH &amp; more. It's possible to borrow 'magic internet money' $MIM which is a stable coin pegged to 1$ &amp; tradeable, usable like any other coin

$SPELL differentiates itself from other lending projects by offering very low &amp; stable interest rates as well as an 1-click leverage capability. 'Leveraged yielding positions' borrow $MIM, reinvest them automatically, use the invest as collateral &amp; borrow $MIM again.. in loops

$SPELL is always eager to release new supported tokens. Among others, those tokens are supported: $AGLD, $ALCX, $cvx3pool, $cvxrenCRV, $cvxtricrypto2, $FTM, $FTT, $SHIB, $UST, $xSUSHI, $SPELL, $yvcrvIB, $xJOE, $yvcrvSTETH, $yvWETH, $wMEMO (staked $TIME) and $AVAX

Up until now, over 3.7B $MIM were borrowed &amp; are in circulation. Even during recent market dumps, the peg ($1) of $MIM was very strong. On all available chains, liquidity pools with $MIM are set up, often with very high TVLs (e.g. on SpookySwap, Traderjoe, Sushiswap)

Protocol revenues are increasing overall, with $3.5M this week and $2.4M and $5.5M the weeks before. With increasing revenues, rewards for staked $SPELL holders are rising as well.

You can stake $SPELL at [https://abracadabra.money/spell-stake](https://abracadabra.money/spell-stake) on the #Ethereum network (currently approx. 24% APR).

Do not mistake $SPELL for any other ordinary token or #meme. It's a cross chain MakerDao, offers a fully decentralized stablecoin, intertwined with major #DeFi protocols: This is a unique project of an agile team that builds the next key #DeFi 3.0 lego. 1 SPELL is only $0.018"

I think it‚Äôs time to do a quick overview of Alpaca Finance‚Äôs upcoming stablecoin AUSD‚Ä¶. 

First off, what is AUSD? AUSD is an overcollateralized crypto asset-backed stablecoin. Essentially, It is a fork of MakerDAO with many improvements.   


How will AUSD benefit users on Alpaca? In short, Alpaca users will be able to benefit from greater capital efficiency. 

aUSD will allow lenders on Alpaca Finance to collateralize their deposits to mint what are effectively interest-free loans of AUSD. This will earn them additional lending yields and pay off their loans in the background.

For most lending protocols, users have to choose between staking their assets to earn yields or staking their assets as collateral to borrow against. With AUSD, users will no longer have to make these tradeoffs

This has required a huge amount of work by the team and will be a game-changer for Alpaca Finance users

AUSD will be fully backed by top digital assets such as BNB, BUSD, BTCB, USDT, and TUSD. We will first start with only one collateral pool (ibBUSD) and limit the maximum amount of AUSD that can be initially borrowed to 30MnAUSD will be fully backed by top digital assets such as BNB, BUSD, BTCB, USDT, and TUSD. We will first start with only one collateral pool (ibBUSD) and limit the maximum amount of AUSD that can be initially borrowed to 30Mn

Phase 1 is due to begin on December 14th with Phase 2 and Phase 3 tentatively scheduled for the weeks of Dec 27th and Jan 3rd respectively.  Can't wait to see users of

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed.

 

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers."

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed.

 

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance.

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers."

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed.

I wrote a post 7 months ago where I outlined why I loved Cake and thought it was going to keep rising.  
**Post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/pancakeswap/comments/nbgzrm/why\_i\_bought\_more\_cake\_and\_im\_still\_bullish/

2 months ago, I sold my Cake at around \~$21. (Bought in at $10 and staked for half a year) 

Look, I'm not here to spread FUD. I'm not bitter. 

I fucking LOVED CAKE and will always be grateful that it introduced me to DeFi.  
I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of people don‚Äôt understand the fundamentals of WHY Cake keeps going down.  
So my goal is to provide my perspective and help some of you become better investors.  I will not be shilling any projects. 

# Why Cake had a Meteoric Rise:

Cake started at $.61 on January 1st and hit an all-time high in April at $42.59. Fucking insane.   
A few things contributed to this:  
Shitcoins such as Safemoon were skyrocketing. And Binance Smart Chain became a go-to platform for them.   
Cake also become the #1 DEX in the world by users. Cake was the alternative for retail investors get into DeFi without the ridiculous ETH fees.   
And PCS had an interesting roadmap. They were going to be an all in one solution for BCS with games, NFT‚Äôs, lending, etc. 

The future looked bright for PancakeSwap. 

# Why Cake‚Äôs Price Has Tanked since April. 

/1 **Binance Smart Chain is no longer hot.** BSC came at a perfect time. People wanted an alternative to the ridiculous ETH gas fees. Finally people could use BSC and Cake to use DeFi.  
But since earlier this year, we‚Äôve seen the rise of different L1 solutions. AVAX, Harmony One, Solana, and FTM have exploded in usage and popularity. Matic and Layer 2 solutions are keeping ETH in the game for retail investors. 

People don‚Äôt like BSC. It has developed a reputation for rug pull central. BSC no longer has a competitive advantage anymore.  

**/2 Cake is Inflationary and Doesn‚Äôt have Any Utility.** 

This is the biggest issue. 

PancakeSwap prints Cake. Yes there are ‚Äúburns‚Äù each week, but it‚Äôs still inflationary.   
They can‚Äôt just stop printing cake. Printing cake is what gives those APY‚Äôs. No APY‚Äôs means no more stakers. 

Because the price of CAKE has been dropping, staking Cake is a risky proposition. You can get 73% APY, but how much is that worth if Cake‚Äôs price keeps dropping?   
So how do we curb inflation?   
You either increase the amount of users to Cake, or you create more use cases for Cake.   
Increasing the amount of users is hard. They‚Äôre already the most used DEX in the world. And now you have all the other chains siphoning users.   
PCS has tried creating more use cases. Lottery and predictions are decent, but it‚Äôs not enough to stop the inflation monster.   
I honestly believed they had a shot with the NFT marketplace. OpenSeas could use a solid competitor and PCS had the distribution and audience to be a worthy alternative.   
**But there are several problems:**  
They‚Äôre not executing fast enough.   
I‚Äôve realized that the PCS team aren‚Äôt the best at execution. How many times have predictions and lottery gone down? How long has it taken them to roll out the NFT marketplace?   
The PanCakeSquad NFT collection pissed off a lot of users when bots sniped everything. 

The nail in the coffin is when the NFT marketplace uses BNB instead of Cake. Paying for NFT‚Äôs with Cake would‚Äôve given Cake actual value and utility. 

I have seen some people argue that it should be in BNB. Just like how OpenSeas prices everything in ETH. And all the BNB fees are used to buyback Cake. 

I disagree. Keep it simple. If you want utility for Cake, then have NFT‚Äôs be priced in Cake.

That‚Äôs when I realized‚Ä¶PanCakeSwap exists to serve CZ and the Binance Smart Chain. 

If PCS was an independent entity, then going multichain would‚Äôve been a no brainer months ago. But they can‚Äôt do that because they exists to serve the Binance Smart Chain. 

**/3 The Rise of OHM Forks.**   
This is something that people have underestimated.  
People liked staking with Cake because it gave some amazing APY‚Äôs. First, the APY have come down drastically. When I first entered, it was around 300% APY which was mind blowing. Now autocake is around 73%.   
Here‚Äôs the problem with 73% APY - it looks like nothing compared to 73,000% APY.   
And 73% APY doesn‚Äôt look appealing when the Cake price is gone from $20 to $11 in the past two months. It‚Äôs risky. 

I‚Äôm not here to debate if these ponzis are a good investment or not. But we can‚Äôt argue that they are gaining in popularity and grabbing users away from PanCakeSwap. 

In defense of PCS, **ALL** DeFi 1.0 projects are tanking. Look at UniSwap, SushiSwap, MakerDao, etc. People are pouring their money into newer, and more innovative projects.

I don‚Äôt see a way for Cake‚Äôs value to increase at this point. They **HAVE** to keep printing more cake, but the token itself doesn‚Äôt have value. 

I hate that I have to write this post. 

One piece of investment advice: don't be married to your bags. If you want to keep investing in Cake, then great. 

But make sure you're able to articulate why it's still a good investment, and you're not holding on to it because of emotions. Zero-based decision-making means if you had to start your portfolio from scratch today, would you still buy Cake?  
Even though I‚Äôm no longer invested in Cake, I hope they prove me wrong. I‚Äôm cheering for you guys."

**TLDR**:

The centralised way of decision making and governance is inefficient. DAO is a new way of organisation and making decisions, instead of relying on the central authority. Everyone gets to be part of the decision making process. #equality

# General Conclusion

As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

# 1. Solution to Decentralised Governance

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.

So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.

That is DAO ‚Äî decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

# 2. Importance of DAO

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary ‚Äî how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology.

# 3. Economics of DAO

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**.

**TLDR**:

The centralised way of decision making and governance is inefficient. DAO is a new way of organisation and making decisions, instead of relying on the central authority. Everyone gets to be part of the decision making process. #equality

# General Conclusion

As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

# 1. Solution to Decentralised Governance

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.

So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.

That is DAO ‚Äî decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

# 2. Importance of DAO

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary ‚Äî how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide which autonomous organisation will succeed.

* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* *Adam Neumann* *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide which autonomous organisation will succeed.

# 3. Economics of DAO

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* *PieDAO*
* **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* *MolochDAO,* *MakerDAO*
* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* *KyberDAO,* *Dash,* *LAO* *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**.Let me know if you want me to do a deep dive into a DAO or other episodes that you are interested in."

**TLDR**:The centralised way of decision making and governance is inefficient. DAO is a new way of organisation and making decisions, instead of relying on the central authority. Everyone gets to be part of the decision making process. #equality

# General Conclusion

As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

# 1. Solution to Decentralised Governance

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.That is DAO ‚Äî decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

DAI is a decentralized stablecoin issued by MakerDAO. It's backed 1 DAI to 1 USD using crypto as collateral - including other stablecoins like USDC. 

Like with other stablecoins and crypto, you can earn interest on holding DAI on multiple platforms. You'll definitely make more than on any savings account! Also, it's a good way to balance out your crypto portfolio, or to park money in if you take profits on your crypto investments.

I researched 40+ platforms, and was able to find 15 that'll pay interest on USDC. Here's the breakdown of their rates, as of today (December 14, 2021):

Interest rates in APY, with one exception (see notes).

As much as I like DAI, there's clearly less adoption: fewer platforms support it, and the rates are generally lower than the [interest rates for USDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/extracrypto/comments/rfjqjb/highest_usdc_interest_rate_20_platforms_compared/).

Blockchain.com rewards (again) has the highest base rate, which makes it a good choice.

https://preview.redd.it/qnezvrx8e4681.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=017af200f00a2c62f03d2607e5ef4f01941a7877

DeFi has grown into a giant snowball in the past few years rolling down the hill of alternative finance towards the land of traditional finance. With every move it makes, DeFi tends to answer the unanswered questions of CeFi, trying to create a fairer playing field for the average investors.

Common practices like under-collateralized loans, unfair borrowing conditions, institutional investors only (read rich-only) investing slots are becoming a thing of the past as DeFi expands.

Although, there are still problems like liquidity pool hacks, smart contract loopholes, and good ol‚Äô rug pulls in DeFi, having a strong cooperative community across the whole space makes it way easier to overcome these problems and safeguard investors‚Äô funds.

In this article, we‚Äôll have a close look at the state of the art in the DeFi space and where does iBNB Grand fit into this intricately designed world of finance.

**The Beginning Days of DeFi**

Before diving into where DeFi is now, it‚Äôs important to know where it all started. To have a better understanding of the speed of development the space is going through.

It all started with the birth of Ethereum, a modified version of the Bitcoin blockchain to host Dapps on top of it. It was at that moment in the history of web3 that a blockchain became more than a really advanced cashbook.

As Ethereum was introduced, ideas of creating a peer-to-peer lending system started popping out. The platform that actually laid the building blocks of DeFi was Maker or MakerDAO.

**Maker DAO ‚Äî The Concept of DeFi**

The creator of Maker presented a platform where users can come onboard to directly lend and borrow money, eliminating the third party ‚Äî banks.

However, the problem with a peer-to-peer lending/borrowing system was to find the appropriate person on the other side who is prepared to lend to you on your terms and vice versa.

Let‚Äôs say you want to borrow 30 ETH on a 5% interest for 6 months, using the P2P lending model, it‚Äôll be a time-consuming method to match you with someone who agrees on those terms.

As a result, the user-to-contract protocol came into existence replacing the peer-to-peer model of DeFi. In short, liquidity pools came into existence.

A liquidity pool, as you know, is a pool of assets where the money you want to borrow already exists and you can just borrow it against sizeable collateral. Similarly, you can invest in the pool as a liquidity provider (LP), in return for your investment, you‚Äôll earn interests and rewards.

We‚Äôll go into the details of the liquidity pool as the article progresses.

Borrowing from Maker, or any other DeFi platform requires you to over-collateralize the loan to ensure that LPs don‚Äôt lose money and the pool remains healthy. In Maker, the borrower has to collateralize 150% of the borrowed amount. For every 100 ETH put in the pool, the person can borrow 66% of its total value in DAI.

\[DAI is the native token for transactions in the Maker ecosystem. It‚Äôs soft pegged to the USD backed by the Maker liquidity pool. That means, the value of 1 DAI always remains close to $1.\]

Being backed by a pool of multi-collateral assets makes DAI (one of) the most trusted trustless stable coin.

If the value of the collateralized assets dips lower than 150% of the borrowed amount, Maker automatically liquidates the position of the user to cover the losses and imposes a penalty to discourage such incidents from happening.

If at any point, the value of the currency fluctuates heavily, Maker encourages the borrowers to pay the principal loan amount in DAI and the accrued interest in MKR, the governance token of MakerDAO. Once the DAI gets into the pool, it gets burnt to decrease the supply.

Now coming to the DAO part of MakerDAO, Maker has a DAO in place that makes these decisions through consensus. Anyone holding the MKR token has the right to vote on issues.

These are the primary aspects of MakerDAO and DeFi as a whole, with slightly different rules and regulations.

**AAVE ‚Äî Flash Loans and Collateral Swap**

AAVE was launched at the time of the ICO-mania of 2017‚Äì18 and is on the top 3 of DeFi platforms.

AAVE introduced a few brand new features and improved a couple of existing options in the DeFi space. The most revolutionary and groundbreaking was Flash Loans.

The concept of a Flash Loan is slightly complicated as it consists of multiple technical aspects of the Ethereum blockchain.

A Flash Loan lets a user borrow a massive amount without any collateral. But the user has to repay the amount on the same transaction within the standard Ethereum block time of 13 seconds. That‚Äôs where the name Flash Loan comes from.

Basically, you‚Äôre taking out a loan, using the money, and then returning it to the lender within a few seconds. So what exactly is happening here?

Given the special requirement of the loan, it can only be used in a few specific scenarios.

1. Arbitrage

2. Collateral Swap

3. Self Liquidation

Arbitrage is the action of exploiting the price difference of an asset in two different exchanges to make a profit. For instance, if the price of BNB is $550.00 at exchange A and $550.50 at exchange B, buying 1 BNB from A and selling at B will result in a $0.5 profit.

If the same action gets repeated with $10 million worth of margin, the profit will be astronomically high. And that‚Äôs where a Flash Loan comes into action.

Collateral swap is another useful action that can be performed with Flash Loans. As the name says, it is used to swap collaterals inside the liquidity pool.

Say you have 100 ETH as collateral in the liquidity pool but you want to swap it with BAT tokens. In this case, you‚Äôll have to take out a flash loan of DAI and repay your loan, then swap your ETH for BAT, and then take a put the BAT tokens in the liquidity pool to borrow DAI.

The third action that Flash Loans perform is self-liquidation. This issue arises when your collateralized asset (ETH, for example) loses value and comes close to the minimum valuation limit. At this level, you don‚Äôt want to put more of the same asset in the pool, so you take out a DAI flash loan and to repay your borrowed amount and withdraw the ETH. Once you have withdrawn, swap your ETH for DAI to repay the flash loan and keep the rest.

**Compound and cTokens**

Compound is another popular DeFi platform with $5 billion in total value locked. It more or less uses the same system with a few exceptions.

Compound‚Äôs most interesting revelation to the world is cTokens. cTokens are used as a token of certification to liquidity providers. Depending on your lending token, the cTokens are assigned directly at a standard exchange rate. For ETH, it will cETH, for DAI, it‚Äôll cDAI, and the exchange rate of cTokens against the actual token depends on the market price.

The exchange rate of DAI to cDAI at the time of writing is 44.95 cDAI.

So if you lend 1000 DAI to the Compound Protocol, the protocol will transfer 44950 cDAI to your wallet. You can redeem your cTokens by withdrawing your actual tokens, or you can redeem a portion of it.

The longer you hold the cTokens, the more it appreciates in value.

Projects like Uniswap, Curve Finance, Bancor are doing great in the space going on an explosive trajectory.

**How iBNB is Improving the DeFi Space.**

iBNB entered the DeFi space with a different mindset. All the things that I mentioned so far speak for the massive progress DeFi has seen from its inception 5 years ago. Although it has done a great job so far, it is still lacking in a few places. The goal of iBNB is to fix these problems with innovative scalable solutions, and iBNB has been doing a pretty impressive job at it.

**Dynamic Transaction Protocol**

The most significant aspect of iBNB is the Dynamic Transaction Protocol (DTP). As the name suggests, it‚Äôs a tax protocol that automatically adjusts the transaction fees depending on the health of the liquidity pool to keep the fluctuations low. As per the iBNB whitepaper, ‚ÄúThe distribution between liquidity and dividend pool is continuously adjusted in order to maximize rewards while ensuring healthy liquidity.‚Äù

For instance, in general, a 10% transaction fee is sent to the dividend pool to be divided between the investors. But in case of low liquidity, the system implements the rejuvenation state. At this state, to mitigate the diminishing condition of the liquidity pool, a percent of the transaction fees gets redirected to the pool. This cycle continues till the liquidity pool gets back in its healthy state.

Also, in times of excess liquidity (&gt;15% of iBNB market capitalization), the excess gets redirected to the dividend pool as additional rewarding factors to investors.

**Anti-Dump Mechanism**

The whole Crypto space including DeFi suffers from pump-and-dump scams resulting in catastrophic price fluctuations in the market. In an attempt to inspire healthy practice, iBNB has deployed an anti-dump mechanism that discourages token holders to sell a large portion of their funds by charging a higher transaction fee.

Within a 24-hour standpoint, if an investor sells more than 0.01% of the total supply sold within that period, an additional 2% fee gets deducted from the transaction. If the sold token amounts to anywhere between 0.01% ‚Äî 0.029%, the fee goes to 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3fi7d0tie4681.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=182c3c47bd8ae9777a48eda2c0b1c399fb97a9b9

Amount of fees deducted on various degrees of transactions.

**iBNB Bank and Debit Card**

The iBNB Bank is the first DeFi bank that facilitates the management and growth of investors‚Äô finance. It is a central system for receiving, smart distribution, and utility of large volumes of BNBs that is collected from project transaction fees and exchanges.

The bank acts on multiple levels to keep the iBNB ecosystem functioning by allocating funds to different internal projects, clearing dividends to investors, and funding research and development.

The iBNB Debit Card is the resulting subsidiary of the iBNB bank. Like the bank, it‚Äôs going to be the first DeFi Debit card that lets investors collect their rewards and spend them directly on activities like shopping, travelling, etc.

Most importantly, the iBNB Bank has the infrastructure in place to continue evolving to the frontiers of DeFi innovation. It means that with collaboration and insights from experts and the community itself, the latest State of the Art DeFi innovations is implemented by the research and development team of iBNB.

**nBNB Partner Projects**

As of today, there is one project as partner on the nBNB Network.

**BabySafeMoon**

BabySafeMoon is a deflationary token with a core tax protocol in place. With every transaction, the tax rate is adjustable and the amount of tax deducted caters to different purposes.

For example, a 15% tax is deducted on a $100 transaction, the $15 will be divided into multiple areas like reflection, development, nBNB bridge, etc.

The Dynamic Transaction Protocol (DTP V2) is also deployed in this scenario to adjust the tax rate. So if the Liquidity Pool is unstable and needs more supply, the tax will get higher automatically. On the other hand, if the LP remains healthy, the tax deduction will remain the same.

**The near Future**

In a special early freebie shared with you here first, the nBNB Network is scheduled to onboard 6 projects in the upcoming time to come. With transaction fees coming into the iBNB Bank, and the iBNB Bank issuing special collectables for iBNB investors to gamify the investment experience with bonuses, the near future is looking very promising for iBNB.

**Conclusion**

As Defi progresses, the idea of the State of the Art will change too, affecting the finance sector in much larger ways. It has taken DeFi less than 5 years to reach a place where investors consider it as a viable investment option with much larger profit margins. So much so that the total value locked in the space has crossed $200 billion.

iBNB promises a better and more integrated future for DeFi by creating a network of projects and infrastructure that has the potential to revolutionize the field. As the pioneer, iBNB is charting the course and as more projects join the nBNB network, newer and better technologies will be implemented to improve the investors‚Äô experience.

Gold is a tangible and physical asset (unlike the dollars in Circle's bank accounts that could be seized/deleted at any time), which makes it easier to build a decentralized stablecoin system backed by it.

The ethereal nature of the dollar - it's just numbers in a database run by a centralized authority - is the most underrated obstacle to building a stablecoin that stays true to crypto principles. To hold dollars in any meaningful amount it is necessary to partner with old-school backs, who have been ""regulated"" so much they're basically quasi-nationalized.

Since gold is relatively permissionless (worse than BTC or ETH, better than fiat), even small-scale gold holders can issue stablecoins with market caps in the low millions. Moreover, this can be done in absolutely any national jurisdiction, unlike dollar-backed stablecoins that require US or US-friendly financial jurisdictions.

Just like MakerDAO, JewelerDAO/&lt;insert name&gt; will evaluate the reliability of different stablecoin issuers and create an index of the best ones, along with all the other monetary policy functions.

(In theory, this can be done with any commodity, but since gold has the highest economic value per unit volume it is the easiest to do on a small-scale by far, which is good for decentralization. Also, there are so many firms around the world that are competent at being custodians of gold, which can't be said for most other commodities)"

Lets dive into Centrifuge project.

&amp;#x200B;

**Project Introduction:**

Centrifuge works like a bridge that brings real-world assets like invoices, real estate, and royalties to DeFi. Borrowers can finance their real-world assets without banks or other intermediaries, and providing liquidity is open to everyone, investors receive a return plus CFG rewards. By opening these doors to small and medium enterprises, which have historically faced financial issues, Centrifuge are enabling them to access financing securely, transparently and efficiently. DeFi is a growing financial system without any barriers of entry. Centrifuge wants to bring this benefit to all borrowers that until now had no access to DeFi liquidity.¬†

**Key Features And Highlights:**

Centrifuge is built with a two-layer approach: There is the Centrifuge peer-to-peer network for private, secure data exchange. Then there are the contracts deployed on Ethereum that represent business identities, document hashes from our precise proofs, and most importantly the ‚ÄúBusiness NFTs‚Äù to represent documents and make them financeable via MakerDAO, Compound, or others. Centrifuge also launched Tinlake recently, which allows the tokenization and pooling of those NFTs in an easy, standardized way.

**Tinlake:**¬†

Tinlake is an open, smart-contract based marketplace of asset pools bringing together Asset Originators and Investors which seek to utilize the full potential of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Ultimately, Tinlake will become a fully decentralized financing protocol that interoperates with different blockchains and plugs into a variety of funding sources.

**HOW TINLAKE WORKS:**

Imagine you hold assets, like car loans, trade invoices, or music streaming royalties ‚Äî legal documents that entitle you to cash at some point. As an ‚Äúasset originator,‚Äù you can use Tinlake to turn these assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with all of the necessary legal documentation attached, create an asset pool (called ‚Äúsecuritization‚Äù in traditional finance), and then issue two kinds of ERC20 tokens, explains Vogelsang. Centrifuge calls them Tin tokens and Drop tokens.

The process is akin to issuing a ‚Äújunior tranche‚Äù and a ‚Äúsenior tranche‚Äù of securities ‚Äî a common approach in traditional finance. The junior tranche (Tin) is riskier ‚Äî if losses occur, holders of this token are first in line to cover them ‚Äî but can pay a higher return. The senior tranche (Drop) is more stable and less risky.¬†

Asset originators will hold some amount of Tin tokens themselves ‚Äî to have some ‚Äúskin in the game,‚Äù says Vogelsang. Other Tin investors will probably be sophisticated traders who understand the particular real-world asset class well and want to have leveraged exposure, he says.¬†"

 Ardana is a stablecoin ecosystem, consisting of a liquidity pool, a DEX (decentralized exchange), and asset-backed stablecoins, built on the Cardano blockchain. The project looks to develop a DeFi ecosystem that can deliver on the promise to give everyone access to DeFi. Cardano‚Äôs mainnet saw significant growth recently, with several new projects already launched or in the process of being onboarded on its blockchain.

The team behind Ardana is helping Cardano better prepare its ecosystem and infrastructure to handle free-flowing capital and allow it to easily attract cash flow, continuing towards its goal of a robust and open DeFi ecosystem. After years of development, Cardano has become one of the leading blockchain projects and largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Its focus was centered around real-world applications, but it has since widened this area of focus to include DeFi.

Before we can understand why Ardana has chosen Cardano as its blockchain of choice, let us gain a better understanding of both projects.

### An Introduction to Ardana

Ardana is an asset-backed stablecoin protocol and DEX built on the Cardano blockchain. It offers access to on-chain Cardano-native assets coupled with seamless transactions and swaps between them. The Ardana ecosystem consists of two main products: its stablecoins (comparable to MakerDAO) and Danaswap, a DEX that operates similarly to Curve Finance.

Danaswap enables seamless, high-speed swaps between stablecoins and other assets through multi-asset liquidity pools, in addition to reward-based mechanisms to enable DeFi at its fullest.

### What is Cardano?

Cardano is an open-source, decentralized blockchain project that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions. It uses a layered architecture, facilitates smart contracts, and offers better scalability than competitors, like Ethereum. The platform‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, ADA, can be leveraged by users on Cardano to conduct transactions and validate on its Proof of Stake (PoS) network.

The Cardano blockchain is made up of third-generation technology that significantly improves the underlying problems (i.e. scalability, energy consumption) faced by first and second-generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Cardano has all its protocols peer-reviewed, allowing it to easily and quickly tackle any potential issues. On top of this, the project is backed by several organizations, working in tandem with them to develop the platform. The main organizations working on the Cardano blockchain are Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation.

### Why Did Ardana Choose to Build on Cardano?

Since its founding, Cardano has grown in leaps and bounds, becoming one of the leading blockchain projects globally. This rapid growth is easy to see in comparison to its competition, as ADA is currently the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The success of Carcano is easily traced back to its Founder, Ethereum Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson, who identified the need for a scalable blockchain and smart contract solution. Hoskinson teamed up with Jeremy Wood, who shared similar views of the market‚Äôs needs.

From that point forward, Cardano was born.

Development began in 2015, with the project focused on building solutions to improve the blockchain. The first public iteration of the project was released in 2017, starting with the Byron phase, followed by Shelly, which introduced staking and better decentralization. The Goguen era saw Cardano add a smart contract ability, enhancing its blockchains‚Äô overall use cases and functionality for dApps (decentralized applications) and protocols.

#### The Technology Behind Cardano

Cardano‚Äôs protocols are peer-reviewed before they‚Äôre added for use on the platform. The project utilizes two programming languages named Haskell and Plutus. As previously mentioned, rather than using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which consumes a significant amount of electricity to verify transactions, Cardano uses a PoS consensus mechanism. This allows it to utilize significantly less power and fuel a much more sustainable ecosystem.

#### Ouroboros

Cardano‚Äôs PoS consensus mechanism is significantly different from that of Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW consensus mechanism. BTC requires specialized rigs to solve for the next block, but also lacks any features that could prevent potential monopolies over mining operations.

Ouroboros is Cardano‚Äôs PoS mechanism that uses a system of time periods, also known as ‚Äúepochs.‚Äù Each epoch lasts for five days, with each one containing 21,600 smaller units called ‚Äúslots.‚Äù One slot is equal to 20 seconds. Stake pools are assigned randomly to each slot, and slot leaders are selected through a lottery system. To ensure fairness, Cardano selects slot leaders using the following method:

* The user must have a 2% stake in Cardano
* The higher the stake, the better the chances of being selected as a slot leader
* If slot leaders fail to create a block during their slot, they are replaced and must wait until re-election

Ouroboros allows ADA holders to stake their coins in pools that other users operate. Alternatively, token holders can also become stake pool operators themselves. Any rewards generated for adding new blocks to the blockchain are shared between the pool operators and stakers at the end of every epoch.

### Cardano: The Best Fit for Ardana

With Cardano well on the way to creating an ecosystem to address the issues of older blockchains, it‚Äôs now focused on developing cheaper, quicker, and more scalable solutions for blockchain-based transactions. According to Ardana‚Äôs team, this makes Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem perfect for the Ardana protocol.

Cardano is set to become a top ecosystem in the DeFi space, blurring the lines between DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance). The team at Ardana set out to create a DeFi hub on Cardano to enable the protocol to experience the same level of growth seen on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon (Matic). To enhance stability, the team at Ardana also introduced a stablecoin and a stable-asset exchange.

Ardana‚Äôs team reached out to Cardano to build the infrastructure required for their project. Cardano also required a significant liquidity floor, along with a suitable stablecoin suite; this was achieved by offering lending through Ardana vaults, which enabled minting for its various stablecoins. Ardana‚Äôs team also had the vision to bring foreign exchange to the decentralized world, opening this up to more users. They needed to ensure that the price to swap between different currencies was close enough to the actual price for foreign exchange, though. This led to the creation of Danaswap, a stablecoin DEX built on the protocol.

### Closing Thoughts

Ardana‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem has the ability to fully unleash Cardano‚Äôs potential, allowing it to become one of the most prominent players in the DeFi space. The benefits are mutual, as Ardana‚Äôs association with Cardano means it is backed by one of the largest and most trusted blockchain protocols. Ardana‚Äôs ecosystem on Cardano will truly take Cardano‚Äôs functionality to a whole new level.

**TLDR:**

MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.

This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Here are the 4 categories.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO‚Äôs ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced."

Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future.

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.

This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Here are the 4 categories.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO‚Äôs ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced."

[V2 Protocol](https://preview.redd.it/zc52i9nnd2881.jpg?width=2225&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5adeced0f19976e068f935e76e01ec81237b1e20)

Uniswap has 2 versions (v1 and v2). It is obvious that Uniswap v2 is an upgrade over v1, however, being a decentralized exchange, v1 is still active (V1 and v2 are running at the same time!). We take a detailed look at what benefits does v2 bring in, and why the complete weightage will slowly shift towards v2.

In my previous article on Uniswap, I provided a detailed guide on how to use the Decentralized Exchange. Uniswap brings with it many benefits when compared to other Centralized Exchanges. It has triggered the growth of an entire Ethereum De-Fi ecosystem.

Uniswap V1 was a Proof of Concept. The success of v1 led to the development of v2.

v2 encompasses multiple new features which include:

¬∑ ERC20 / ERC20 Pairs ( [Read my reddit on ERC20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gerradfletcher/comments/rpkjqi/what_is_an_erc20_token/) )

¬∑ Flash Swaps

¬∑ Core/Helper Architecture

¬∑ Technical Improvements

¬∑ Path to Sustainability

¬∑ Testnet and Launch Details

The launch of Uniswap V2 introduces new features and a more resilient oracle system, but like in many other DeFi platforms, liquidity remains an issue. The second iteration of the Ethereum decentralized exchange Uniswap V2 exchange was launched on May 18, which follows a March 23 announcement that placed its launch in Q2 2020.

A blog post written by the Uniswap team details the steps taken to transition to the new platform.

Uniswap V1 will continue to exist as it cannot be shutdown like, for example, the old version of MakerDAO. Nevertheless, the team has set up an interface to migrate liquidity from V1 to V2.

The platform relies on users committing capital in liquidity pools, whose size defines the slippage amount during trades. Bigger size pools can thus accommodate larger trading amounts.

The Uniswap interface was updated for V2, and allows users to choose which version of the platform they wish to use. The interface also lets the user know which platform provides better liquidity and price, with V1 still being a better alternative for Ethereum to Dai trades, as Cointelegraph found out. It is expected that the reverse will be true as liquidity providers migrate to the new platform.

The team has also released an updated statistics platform to see liquidity and volume in real time.

Security improvements and flash swaps

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the new platform has three key improvements to usability and security. It now allows direct token-to-token swaps, which are particularly useful in stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades like USD Coin (USDC) to Dai (DAI). While these were possible before, they used Ether (ETH) as the intermediate step, which meant additional fees and slippage.

Uniswap V2 seeks to be a better price oracle for other decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, as the earlier design was abused in instances like the bZx hack.

It has also introduced a feature named flash swaps, which is similar to the flash loan provided by platforms like dYdX. The users can lend unlimited money from a liquidity pool, but they must return it within the same block, or the transaction is rendered invalid.

The flash loan is mostly useful for performing price arbitrage between different DeFi platforms, though Uniswap‚Äôs design can also be used to quickly enter leveraged positions on platforms like Maker or Compound.

The price of decentralization

Unlike some other decentralized exchanges, Uniswap‚Äôs liquidity pool model does not require finding counterparties for a trade, which can allow higher trading volumes compared to order book-based exchanges. Nevertheless, using Uniswap can get expensive.

The current liquidity provider fee amounts to the equivalent of $1.27 for a trade of 1 ETH into 211 DAI ‚Äî approximately 0.6%.

Furthermore, the platform suffers from significant bid/ask spread. As of press time, buying ETH requires an estimated 213.3 DAI, while selling it only nets 211 DAI ‚Äî a higher loss than just the trading fee. Buying and immediately selling 1 ETH would thus net a loss of more than 1%.

These are estimates, as the price can slip even more ‚Äî especially for larger trades. While the majority of these problems are a result of low liquidity at launch, Uniswap V1 and even other exchange platforms like Kyber also suffer from similar spread issues.

The 1inch.exchange platform, which announced the support of Uniswap V2 as it launched, uses smart contracts to split a trade between multiple exchanges. This can help reduce the overall trading losses when entering the DeFi ecosystem."
The rise of the DAOs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpl41b/the_rise_of_the_daos/,aelaos1,1,2021-12-27 19:00:59,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpl41b/the_rise_of_the_daos/,ANALYSIS,"  

There are a lot of hypes in crypto world right now, NFTs and Metaverses and Gaming being the top dogs. I wan to talk about something else here that is overlooked for now but will rise hard I predict in the upcoming year. The DAO.

#### History

The first DAO was called The DAO and ended miserably. It was hacked (probably from an insider) due to a bug and it started the most contentious and divisive spat in crypto. The hard fork of 2016 where ETC was born. You can read more about this incident [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-response-to-the-dao-hack). But the thing is that the idea was exciting and many people rushed. Apparently it was early. Not that hacks are infrequent right now but still there is more knowledge and expertise on the subject. Vitalik found DAOs to be one of the first and most important uses of the blockchain (and I humbly agree). Now what \*is\* a DAO?

#### What is a DAO

I like the Feynman way that said you should describe everything as you were talking to a single child (the famous ELI5 acronym) and I will try to do that.

&gt;A DAO is a group of people that want to do something and instead of court and laws they use software to govern their endeavour. 

Quite simple isn't it? It can be companies running for profit, investment funds that onboard everyone that send money to the smart contract, it can be non-profit NGOs that want transparency and it can be even silly stuff like K-POP fans that want to vote on the next event date. In one word: groups. The DAO and the underlying technology (blockchain) facilitates all.

#### Interesting projects

There are not many plays in this field. That makes me excited because there can be clear winners. I will be talking only about platforms to build DAOs and not specific DAOs you can join because they will be infinite and each idea will come and go but the technology will stay.

[**Aragon** ](https://aragon.org/)is one of the oldest projects on **Ethereum**. It's a platform to build DAOs and the team is from Spain (obviously with this name!). It's the most mature platform right now and it will enable many communities to form and manage everything from where the funds go to voting to governance using it. L1 transactions are expensive as we know so it needs to be in L2. If they don't accomplish a smooth transition it will be hard to be the winner.

[**Metis**](https://www.metis.io/) is building a Layer 2 on top of Ethereum using rollup technology (the latest and coolest of all) to facilitate the use of DAOs and DACs as they call them (c is for company). Interesting project that just launched.

[**DAOstack** ](https://daostack.io/)is an operating system for DAOs. It's open source and openly governed (no central team) and it is more community focused. It's based on xDai(see below). The market cap of this one is really low for now.

[**STAKE (xDai)**](https://www.staketoken.net/)  is an [Ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) sidechain but uses a different consensus algorithm: Proof of Stake ([PoS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) and Proof of Stake DAO (POSDAO).xDAI is a Layer 2 scaling solution and is compatible with Ethereum. It is designed to be more efficient than Ethereum, with higher transaction throughput (70 transactions/second) and has a much lower transaction fee.

#### Why now?

Here in Loft Financial we have correctly predicted both the rise of NFTs and the rise of the Metaverse (proven by our articles and their dates). This is the new theme for the next year. Why? Because we monitor the news and the important people and the trends. NFTs blew up when Silicon Valley entrepreneurs started talking about them. Now they are talking about DAOs on their Twitter. They are usually early. It's their job, they are VCs and visionaries. Also another project blew up that showed the world what a DAO can do (crazy things!). It was called the [Constitution DAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/). Check it out. Although it failed in its objective it was a milestone much like when the first Crypto Punk NFT was sold for a crazy price and woke everyone up.

Job Interview Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/rq0ptw/job_interview_help/,GospodinPrdonjica,1,2021-12-28 07:39:18,0,/r/defi/comments/rq0ptw/job_interview_help/,NaN,"Hello Everybody, 

I've recently applied for a job at a DeFi company and I've been given a set of tasks to complete in order to advance in their recruitment process.

Now I understand the basics behind these concepts, which I believe would be sufficient for the role I'm applying for. 

With that said, some of the tasks (for example number 4) are pretty tough for me to even begin with, as from what I understand Uniswap V3 offers much better capital efficiency than V2 from the get-go, so I'm not sure what type of model would make it so that V2 would allow for a higher capital efficiency.

Anyway, I'm sharing the tasks below, and any help is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Task 1**

Make a comparative analysis of Aave and MakerDAO. Highlight similarities and differences in

the internal economics of each protocol. What are the institutions from traditional finance that

most closely resemble each of them?

**Task 2**

How can one build a liquidity mining campaign for Uniswap v3? Why would anyone need such a

campaign?

\*What is the reason LM appeared in DeFi? What are the mid and long term consequences of

the LM campaign? If you were to do it for your token, how'd you organise it?

**Task 3**

Give a detailed answer as to why liquidity mining campaigns are not free money. Be as detailed

as possible in your explanation and definitions.

**Task 4**

Propose a model to quantify capital efficiency gains for an LP on Uniswap v2 vs Uniswap v3.

Assume ceteris paribus on pool size, volume, fees, order flow, etc.

**Task 5**

What is a 1inch business model? How can it be improved?

**At present, encrypted assets are attacking the real world at the speed of light, aiming to complete the seamless connection between the virtual world and the real world.** **The rapid explosion of DeFi and NFT is undoubtedly empowering the encryption world, so that the traditional fields can more intuitively feel the power of the encryption world.** **At this point in time, whoever can take the lead in the increasingly fierce competition between DeFi and NFT, and gain a firm foothold will be the first to find the right outlet and gain a firm foothold.**

**And Binance, which has always been regarded as the ""head force"" in the exchange industry, naturally will not miss the opportunity, and it has also launched the Binance smart chain BSC, aiming to grab the market share of DeFi and NFT more quickly. .** **So, can the smart chain BSC become the breakthrough place for Binance in the BSC field?** **Today, World Chain Investment Research will do a comprehensive analysis for you on this issue.**

***What is the smart chain BSC?***

To understand ""BSC"", you need to know what ""BC"" is. **BC is the abbreviation of Binance Chain, also known as Binance Chain.** Binance Chain was launched in April 2019 and is the first public chain in the Binance Double Public Chain Project. In addition to the basic functions of token issuance, usage and exchange, Binance Chain also has high throughput, low latency and other features. These core advantages can be comparable to centralized systems, and are even better than Binance Dex (Binance Dex) Provide sufficient guarantee in terms of transaction speed and good experience. You know, Binance Dex inherits the professional financial product modules of Binance's centralized exchange, and **will also try to use the advantages and concepts of decentralized transactions to solve the false currency increase in centralized exchanges. Pain points such as asset opacity** . In this process, Binance Chain also played a vital role.

&amp;#x200B;

After understanding Binance Chain BC, we return to the smart chain BSC. **BSC was launched on September 1, 2020, and can be regarded as a blockchain parallel to Binance Chain.** **For now, BSC mainly serves the Binance DeFi ecosystem, and at the same time, it is also committed to making Binance's dual public chain model more complete.**

In terms of consensus algorithm, BSC has made certain innovations. **It adopts the PoSA (Proof of Stake Authority) consensus algorithm, combines the functions of the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) and proof-of-authority (PoA) mechanism, and is built on 21 verification nodes On the network, blocks are produced in seconds, which will undoubtedly establish a high-speed infrastructure for the DeFi protocol** .

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pyht7eh68g881.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ede995e1e83087aedc82e49790c1a2a25edf98b9)

The core of the smart chain lies in the word ""smart"" (in BSC, S=Smart), which is mainly embodied in the related functions of smart contracts. BSC supports smart contract writing functions and is compatible with the existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and all applications and tools under its ecosystem. Therefore, developers can easily implement the migration and deployment of the Ethereum DApp, saving development effort. As a parallel chain that can interact with BC, BSC natively supports cross-chain communication and transactions. Moreover, on BSC, in addition to the native token BNB, it is also possible to use the token standard of BEP-20 and benchmark against ERC20.

***On the smart chain BSC, what are the ace projects worth paying attention to?***

BSC has assembled multiple track projects including trading, banking, machine gun pool, swap, stablecoin, insurance, and oracle, and has shown good performance on each track. Among them, the daily trading volume of PancakeSwap, the leading project of the trading track, is 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, even more than the Ethereum-based DEX leader uniswap; the machine gun pool track leader Autofarm has a lock-up volume of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, far exceeding the Ethereum-based machine gun pool star YFI; The lock-up volume of the leading bank track venus is almost the same as the AAVE of the Ethereum series.

Next, we will introduce a few star projects on BSC that are quite worthy of attention.

**A typical representative of decentralized exchanges: PancakeSwap.**

**Objectively speaking, PancakeSwap is currently the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on the BSC smart chain, with a lock-up amount of up to 3.3 billion U.S. dollars.**

**In terms of transactions** , PancakeSwap uses the currently popular **AMM transaction mechanism** , similar to Uniswap. **In terms of liquidity mining (Farms)** , users can provide liquidity in PancakeSwap to obtain handling fees and mining income. The handling fee is 0.2%. Mining can earn an annualized rate of return of about 100%, supporting more than 50 Many trading pairs are based on BNB. **In terms of mining (Pools)** , Pools can be understood as pledged mining, that is, mining is carried out by pledge of a single currency, thereby supporting many new coins of Binance, and the annualized rate of return can reach 60%-100%. **In terms of IFO** , PancakeSwap provides a new stock listing model similar to stocks. IFO represents the listing of new coins and can start crowdfunding on PancakeSwap.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6t0jft398g881.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f7ce9c685943a085e137cbd6d47f4b9526061ea)

**The token issued by the PancakeSwap exchange is CAKE. The current circulation is about 120 million, but the total issuance is unlimited, and the circulating market value is close to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.** The price of CAKE has risen astonishingly. It has risen 66 times in 3 months. It is known as the biggest dark horse in the smart chain BSC.

**The leader in the field of lending platforms: Venus.**

**Venus is a lending protocol based on the Binance Smart Chain, and its role is similar to MakerDAO in the Ethereum ecosystem.** Venus aims to introduce a lending system based on decentralized finance into Binance Smart Chain. Venus is not only committed to providing users with a faster and lower-cost trading experience, but also striving to provide users with more opportunities and possibilities to access high-liquid asset classes. In addition, users can also use the collateral provided to the market to mortgage and synthesize excess mortgage positions.

At present, the Venus ecosystem has two types of tokens, namely **XVS and VAI** . XVS is the platform's native BEP-20 governance token, which is mainly used to participate in platform governance, such as voting for product upgrades, adding new collateral types, and adjusting platform parameters. **VAI is a synthetic stable currency asset of the Venus platform, its value is anchored at $1, and the total issuance of XVS is 30 million.** Among them, 79% is used for ecological mining, and the remaining 21% is allocated to Binance Launchpool and Binance Smart Chain ecology. XVS was launched on Binance in early October 2020. The initial price was only less than US$2, but it has been advancing all the way since then, and the highest price once rushed to US$98.

**However, on May 18 this year, Venus' XVS experienced a ""crisis of trust"" for a while.** At 10 o'clock in the evening on May 18, the price of XVS suddenly stretched sharply and doubled in the next two and a half hours, reaching a maximum of $144. When the XVS price was at its highest point, some users pledged 2 million XVS and lent 4,100 Bitcoins and 9,600 Ethereum. After the price of XVS fell, the pledged assets were liquidated. Such a move caused XVS to suffer a sell-off, leading to a sharp drop, and even a chain reaction. After all, the plunging pledge was far less than the value of the lent Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to relevant statistics, this behavior caused a deficit of up to 77 million U.S. dollars to Venus, which is about 490 million yuan. This incident was mocked by the industry as ""air for big pie"", and it also made everyone question Venus's current high price and high pledge rate. Therefore, when you choose Venus to invest, you must also take into account its existing credit risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seed player in the revenue aggregator: Autofarm.**

Autofarm is a DeFi aggregation mining protocol based on Binance Smart Chain, which is similar to Yearn in the Ethereum ecosystem. Autofarm can not only help users automatically switch high-yield mining pools, but also reinvest interest to increase the mining profitability.

**AUTO tokens were officially excavated on December 15, 2020, and mining will end in October 2021, with a total circulation of 80,000.** **Among them, 88% is used for mining and 12% is allocated to the team.** **AUTO tokens have the advantages of no private placement and no pre-mining.** Because of this, once they are launched, they have been widely praised by the community and have a yearn effect. It is worth mentioning that in just one week after the Autofarm platform was launched, the lock-up volume has skyrocketed by 10 times, and the lock-up volume is as high as US$1.4 billion. I believe that under such favorable conditions, the price of AUTO will also rise. Autofarm supports single currency mining and liquidity mining. The USDT stablecoin mining income has been stable for a long time above 40%, and the liquidity mining annualized rate of return is about 100%-500%, and the overall rate of return is good. However, it should be noted that Autofarm charges users a 0.5% management fee, and it is recommended that participating users calculate the rate of return in advance.

Autofarm has a good reputation in the industry, and many people even joked that although Autofarm is not the ""pro son"" of Binance, its excellent product design and outstanding performance are not inferior to the ""pro son"" of Binance. Venus XVS. More importantly, **Autofarm's ambitions are not limited to the Binance Smart Chain. It is currently connected to the Huobi Ecological Chain. It is more likely to be extended to other public chains such as Polkadot in the future** . It has a **promising future** .

***Smart chain BSC builds a top public chain ecology, what other tracks are worth looking forward to?***

Objectively speaking, BSC's current performance is very impressive, and it has been established only a year ago, but it has achieved many impressive results. This is inseparable from the rapid development of the DeFi and NFT markets in the past year. So, from now to the future, which tracks will BSC focus on?

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dql3c8wd8g881.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91c8624d8e7541b891fa36847e3708302661152a)

**First of all, we must continue to give full play to our advantages in the DeFi field.**

The original purpose of BSC was to build a DeFi ecological environment. Therefore, DeFi is the most important and core track for BSC. We have reason to believe that BSC will continue to advance in the future, deploying DeFi from multiple dimensions such as currency listing, investment, and chain ecology.

Judging from the beginning of this year, BSC's performance in DeFi ecology is quite eye-catching. **BSC head applications represented by PancakeSwap, Venus, and Autofarm have attracted more than one billion U.S. dollars in lock-up amount** . Among them, the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap has firmly occupied the leading position of the DEX sector. Even if you look at the entire DeFi rankings, Pancake and Autofarm are fully qualified to be among the first echelon of DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uzy5hj5g8g881.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3b289070c9a2acdbe91f7b17b18331432972764)

In the DeFi track, BSC is undoubtedly the most powerful competitor of Ethereum. BSC has the head in many fields such as DEX, lending, asset management, DeFi infrastructure and development tools, decentralized insurance, and ecological tools. The project must also have the strength to compete with Ethereum.

**Second, we must focus on the NFT field.**

As we all know, 2021 is the first year of NFT development. In this year, the NFT market has experienced a blowout development, with explosive development in the fields of encryption art, NFT games and ""NFT+DeFi"". BSC wants to continue to work hard in 2021 and stay ahead, and it must not miss this important track.

At present, many NFT projects have noticed the advantages of BSC and regard it as an important bridgehead. BSC has also built a unique and self-adaptive ecosystem at the moment, focusing on the development model of ""NFT+DeFi"". **It is reported that in the near future, 6 NFT games, including BunnyPark, Faraland, MOBOX, Crypto Blades, My DeFi Pet, and X World Games, will become star projects on BSC.**

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xm4m6kci8g881.png?width=299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69f15f22b254467edb95e71ea19756654afb48e0)

**The third point is that the smart chain BSC will focus on the GameFi field in the future.**

Speaking of the most interesting and attractive areas on the market, there must be a GameFi. The popularity of GameFi began with Axie Infinity, which is a global chain game. This game is very magical, and it quickly achieved the circle-breaking effect, making a wave of chain travel craze set off on a global scale. BSC smelled this wave of business opportunities early and started the layout in time. Currently, there are not a few popular GameFi games on BSC.

**For example, on BSC, the ""handling"" Crypto Blades in the GameFi field performed well, and even surpassed Axie Infinity once to dominate the GameFi track daily active list.**

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/phi3po3k8g881.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3422306542208e21091a27f8e3fdb4bfca4aaf52)

Such achievements make us look forward to the future performance of BSC in the GameFi field. I believe that with the support of Binance Smart Chain in terms of traffic support and ecological construction, more and more high-quality games will be born.

***Regarding the smart chain BSC, what aspects are worth thinking about?***

At present, the three major exchanges (Huobi's Heco; Okex's OKChain) are all working hard to develop their own public chains. If you make a comprehensive comparison, you will find that Binance **BSC still has the best results** among the three. .

So, the question is, why does the smart chain BSC have an outstanding performance?

The reason is that, **first of all, BSC has received strong support from Binance Exchange because it ‚Äúrelies on a big tree to enjoy the coolness‚Äù** . Ecological development cannot be completed overnight, and a large amount of capital and resource support needs to be invested in it. The development of multiple protocols on BSC is precisely supported by the incubation fund provided by Binance Exchange. Only one year after BSC went live, Binance has provided approximately US$100 million in project support funds to support projects that they believe can bring benefits to the Binance ecology. I believe that in the future, Binance, which sees benefits, will continue to invest in support. fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**Secondly, this also benefits from the foil of peers.** For a long time, Ethereum's fees and network problems have been criticized, which undoubtedly provides opportunities for sidechain platforms such as BSC. As far as the current state of Ethereum is concerned, no matter how the bull market explodes and the users no matter how enthusiastic it is, it will not be able to completely consume and take over these potential benefits. This will naturally give the BSC, which is ready to go early, a chance and taste the sweetness. . BSC is currently fully compatible with Ethereum, and the so-called migration is nothing more than a redeployment of the contract, which has a very low threshold for developers. On the other hand, transaction costs can save a lot. In this way, it is easy for everyone to find their own place on BSC.

**The last point is also complementary to the aforementioned sharp drop in transaction fees. The mining revenue of DeFi projects on BSC is usually very high, which is quite attractive for users.** While the cost is being reduced, the profit is increasing by a large margin. This is undoubtedly a huge temptation that is irresistible.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fjhn63xn8g881.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533f9e4c5f64cb75196e905cb90c09a67a9b6650)

Of course, BSC is not without its shortcomings. BSC was born out of Ethereum and updated on Ethereum, which means that many inherent vulnerabilities, flaws and smart contract limitations in the Ethereum ecosystem cannot be completely circumvented by BSC. Whether such hidden dangers will be attacked by hackers in the future is still unknown. In addition, behind BSC is Binance, which shows that BSC is always a highly centralized project. Whether it can have a decentralized DeFi concept and recognize ""peaceful coexistence"" in the future also needs to wait and see.

Therefore, we still need to remind investors that although the smart chain BSC is quite high-quality and the future ecological development prospects are very bright, we still need to respect the risks and avoid large losses."

OKChain is an open public chain ecology, and its advantages are very obvious. Anyone can run to become an OKChain super node. At the same time, they can also issue their own digital assets on OKChain, create their own digital asset trading pairs, and trade them.

**OKChain is built based on Cosmos' Tendermint mechanism and Cosmos SDK.** The so-called Cosmos is to propose a kind of inter-blockchain communication protocol IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol). It is a network composed of many independent, parallel running blockchains. Each blockchain is connected through nodes. Its emergence is dedicated to the realization of the interconnection and interconnection of the blockchain field. On this basis, combined with the **instant determinism of** the Tendermint consensus algorithm , the value transmission between blockchains is greatly realized. In the near future, it will also support a heterogeneous cross-chain approach to solve the multi-directional circulation of value.

**Tendermint contains two main technical components: a blockchain consensus engine Tendermint Core and a general application program interface ABCI.** Tendermint Core is responsible for data transmission between nodes and Byzantine consensus. The consensus algorithm that combines BFT and DPoS can achieve the final certainty of block generation. ABCI is a blockchain application program interface and a protocol that supports the implementation of transaction processing in any programming language.

The OKChain team is a team with ideas, vision and vision. **They have worked hard for 3 years, and strive to build OKChain into a truly decentralized, borderless trading ecosystem that can be used efficiently by everyone.** At least from the current point of view, they have not forgotten their original intentions and are walking steadily on this road.

***What are the core advantages of OKChain?***

The battle of the public chain is like a war without gunpowder. Although there is no shadow of swords and swords, it is full of cruelty and ruthlessness. If you do not have core advantages and strong strength, it is difficult to gain a foothold in this highly competitive field.

So, what features and advantages does OKChain have?

**First of all, OKChain's architecture selection is quite successful.**

As mentioned earlier, OKChain is built based on Cosmos' Tendermint mechanism and Cosmos SDK. **In this way, it will be very convenient to connect to the Cosmos-based public chain in the future.** At the same time, OKChain also analyzed specific issues and redesigned OKChain governance and election modules according to the unique needs of DEX on OKChain to support diversified business logic.

In addition, OKChain also chose the ""divide and conquer"" cross-chain solution, using the instant determinism of the Dops consensus algorithm to achieve value and data transmission between multiple heterogeneous chains. In this network, relay chains and parachains play a pivotal role. For the virtual user datagram protocol (UDP) or transmission control protocol (TCP) of the blockchain, the relay chain of the OKChain network and each parallel chain can communicate through the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, and the area can be realized by using OKChain. The interoperability between blockchains enables assets on the chain to be transferred from one partition to other partitions safely and quickly.

**You know, cross-chain technology is the key link in the blockchain world to realize asset and data interaction, and it is the technical foundation of DeFi.** To achieve cross-chain, it is necessary to realize asset circulation, information exchange and application collaboration between different blockchain platforms. It is similar to a bridge between different public chains, realizing data transmission between different blockchain networks, and greatly reducing transmission costs. **OKChain simply and effectively realizes the value interconnection, user interconnection and scenario application interconnection of the blockchain through the cross-chain module.** In terms of the cross-chain architecture, OKChain adopts the principle of ""combining overall universality with specific uniqueness"". From this point of view, OKChain is undoubtedly a potential and valuable internet network.

**Secondly, OKChain has low-cost data expansion capabilities.**

In terms of data expansion, OKChain boldly innovated, splitting the data into 3 layers, **namely block data, runtime data and off-chain data** . This operation not only satisfies the advantages of the existing system docking costs, improves the system consensus speed, and expands the data dimension on the chain, but also solves the drawbacks of the traditional public chain solution that ""data on the chain can only be realized in the block"" , So as to solve the problem of data redundancy and low efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

In this way, OKChain successfully layered the huge data on the blockchain, stripped off the redundant part, and only transmitted a small part of the hash. In this way, when a large amount of data needs to reach a consensus, it can effectively reduce the amount of data and retain the advantages of the block chain, which is irreversible and tamper-proof.

**In addition, OKChain puts forward the universal concept of ""Everyone develops DEX"".**

Blockchain application development is more complicated, let alone newcomers and novices, it is not very friendly to many senior developers. OKChain is keenly aware of this problem, and promptly put forward the universal concept of **""everyone develops DEX""** . Through the hierarchical design of the public chain and the sub-module design of the application layer, developers do not need to design the entire public chain, but only need to implement the core. The business function can be. In this way, the concept of ""everyone can develop DEX based on OKChain"" becomes possible.

If we carefully analyze the single-chain architecture in the OKChain ecosystem, we will find that it consists of three parts: the application layer, the consensus layer, and the network layer. Based on Tendermint, OKChain packs the consensus layer and the network layer into a common engine. Common bottom layer, in this way, developers don't have to pay attention to these two common bottom layers. Instead, they can save time and focus on developing the application layer.

Why is OKChain's approach a pioneering work? Because for operators (ie, B-side + C-side), OKChain can help them realize the core value of DEX trading platforms and trading pairs based on the public chain ecology, so as to encourage each individual to participate, exert their strength, and realize digital Greater decentralization of assets.

**Finally, OKChain is unique in that OKChain has a completely independent OKT fuel.**

It is worth mentioning that OKChain currently has launched the OKT token, which is native to the public chain. The OKT token is **completely independent of the OKEx and OKB holders' systems, and the two are not related to each other** .

The reason for this must be a long-term consideration. The rights and interests of platform coins are often highly related to the interests of exchanges. If the exchange tokens are directly used for the issuance of public chain platforms or reward nodes, it will greatly affect the relevant value. The direct issuance of public chain basic tokens can take into account the relationship between the two at the same time, and it is also more conducive to the construction and development of the public chain ecology.

OKChain adopts the concept of on-chain governance, and realizes on-chain governance through proposals. This method can fully reflect the concept of decentralization. OKT holders can participate in OKChain's governance by initiating proposals, collateralizing proposals, and voting on proposals (OKT needs to be delegated).

***What projects on OKChain are worth paying attention to?***

***KSwap***

Speaking of the more important projects in the OKChain DEX field, it is none other than KSwap. KSwap, or KSwap Finance, **is a decentralized trading product established based on OkexChain and based on the concept of automatic market making in a capital pool. It is responsible for supporting liquid mining and transaction mining mechanisms** . KSwap is committed to providing users with token exchange, liquidity, transaction mining and other services in the OKChain ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

**Currently, KSwap has issued KST, with a total issuance of 1 billion.** Among them, 80% is used for mining rewards; 10% is used for team incentives (this part of team incentives will be linearly unlocked in 36 months after the mainnet is launched); 5% is used for marketing, operations, airdrops and other activities (this Part of it will be linearly unlocked in 12 months after the mainnet is launched, and the specific address and usage details will be announced to the community); the saved 5% will be used for early institutional investors. In addition, transaction fees will be used to repurchase KST and distribute dividends to ecosystem contributors. Users can obtain liquidity certificates by providing liquidity and pledge them to the corresponding incentive pool to obtain token rewards provided by KST or other project parties. The amount of reward depends on the number of tokens pledged by the user in the incentive pool. Accounted for.

***Lemond***

**Lemond belongs to the field of lending and is one of OKChain's earlier projects, and it can also be called OKChain's main ecological project.**

If we count the past and present of Lemond, we will find that it is still ""a bit historical."" Lemond was listed on the Gate Exchange earlier, but it didn't want to perform very well, so he came back. The reason is largely because it hurried to the office before it was ready.

After the launch of OKChain, Lemond's overall performance is quite good. If you compare the entire lending field vertically, MakerDao has the highest lock-up amount on Ethereum, with a total lock-up capital of US$690 million. **From the perspective of lock-up funds, Lemond's lock-up amount is only lower than MakerDao** .

Lemond can be regarded as a more controversial project. Some people think that Lemond has a ""dark history"" and believe that it was launched on Gate early, and it may have been laundered by private equity. **But to be fair, as an early project of OKChain, it still has advantages. It can not only help users capture value, but also help them find the right time and follow the project to reap the early dividends of growth.**

***Dematrix***

If there is anything special about Dematrix, it must be that **it is committed to completing the iteration of smart contracts on OKChain** .

In the 1.0 period, Dematrix was a derivative revenue aggregation platform built on OKChain Testnet. Dematrix's branded mining pools provide liquid mining returns for customers with multiple income preferences. On this basis, Dematrix also launched version 2.0. The upgraded version will become a comprehensive platform that supports NFT asset origination, exhibition exchange, auction, mining, lending and games. In addition, Dematrix will also make strategic deployments to build flagship front-ends including blind boxes, mining pools, NFT20, NFTFi and decentralized auction markets, thereby greatly strengthening the connection between digital assets and the real world.

According to official disclosures, Dematrix has now completed a million-dollar institutional round of financing, including Tricer Top Foundation, WeBounty, on-chain capital, Aquaria, BlockLofty Ventures, Coldlab, Bit9 Capital, TokenHODL, R8 Capital, 7 O'clock Capital in Many capital institutions in China have already invested in it. **Dematrix issued the token dmx with a total of 200 million.** It is expected that 25% will be unlocked after going online, and 15% will be unlocked on subsequent monthly lines. The unlocking will be completed in 5 months. Dematrix has now officially landed on Cherryswap on August 10th, Beijing time, and is open to transactions for global users. Interested friends can pay more attention to the business opportunities and bonuses.

***Orange***

In OKChain, there are not only lemons (Lemond) but also oranges (Orange), which can be described as a ""fruit meeting"".

Orange is the main project of OKChain NFT ecology. Orange provides users with a full-chain NFT operation system. Any user can upload and create his own unique NFT work on the Orange platform. **This work is unique and scarce, and naturally protects everyone's work from being infringed** .

In fact, the entire process for users to create their own NFT works on the Orange platform is not complicated. They can log in to the official website, open an account, upload their works (name and fill in the profile), digitally sign to confirm the rights, and choose the bidding method/price/ The time/signature process can be completed, mint Mint, thus owning your own NFT works, and having a proof of ownership on the OKChain public chain. After the ownership is confirmed, the NFT works have tradable value. Users enjoy the rights of placing orders, trading or auctioning their own works on Orange. This means that your work and digital financial assets have similar attributes and values, and your ""work"" will circulate around the world.

It is worth mentioning that the account needs to be opened for the first creation on the Orange platform, and 20 ORGs are submitted as the opening fee, and this fee is no longer required for subsequent operations.

**Orange‚Äôs governance token is ORG, and holding ORG can participate in decentralized governance and obtain staking benefits.** **The total circulation of ORG is 20 million, of which 11 million ORGs are produced through mining** . The ORG mining pool is divided into 5, the first is the OKT single coin pledge pool, with 300,000 ORGs, released in 300 days, and the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the second is the ORG single coin pledge pool, with 1 million ORG, after 300 days of release, the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the third is the ORG liquidity pool, 2.5 million ORGs, after 360 days, the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the fourth is the NFT mining pool, 2.2 million ORGs will be released in 360 days, and the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the fifth is OSwap, with a total of 5 million ORGs. It is reported that the total amount and output method of each mining pool are carefully calculated and planned by actuaries to ensure that the daily ORG output not only meets the needs of the market, but does not cause selling pressure on the market.

***What else do you want to say about OKChain?***

There is no doubt that Ethereum is a well-deserved leader in the industry, no matter in terms of operational value or development conditions. However, as far as the current development is concerned, although Ethereum is not concealed, there are still many shortcomings and problems that need to be corrected and revised. It is precisely because of this that other public chains are given the opportunity to catch up and even break through. Among them, there is no doubt that OKChain also has a huge competitive advantage.

100% open source code and open nodes, this is the biggest highlight of OKChain, and it also means that OKEx will contribute its own strong strength and provide underlying support for many blockchain projects, so as to achieve complete decentralization. **From this perspective, OKChain is likely to become the next Ethereum, and OKT, the high-quality currency on the platform, will also have the opportunity to become a new generation of ETH.**

However, judging from the current development progress of OKChain, not only is it not fast, it is even somewhat ""inefficient"". The current projects on the chain, in terms of popularity alone, can hardly compete with Heco and BSC.

**Even so, we are still full of expectations for OKChain. After all, complete decentralization is the biggest difference between OKChain and other public chains.** **It is hoped that OKChain can truly achieve ‚Äúslow work and meticulous work‚Äù and create a truly efficient, open and shared public trading chain.**"
