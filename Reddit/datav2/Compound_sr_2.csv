Some helpful tips after getting into this,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/l9usky/some_helpful_tips_after_getting_into_this/,Whathaveidoneits421,10,2021-02-01 12:31:03,36,/r/Compound/comments/l9usky/some_helpful_tips_after_getting_into_this/,NaN,"so I really went down this rabbit hole in the last 3 weeks and I see a bunch of nubs asking the same questions I‚Äôve been asking myself for weeks so I thought I‚Äôd help out and weigh with in with some of my experience.

firstly, I see a lot of questions about fees.

yes! the fees to set up are Kind of absurd, but think of it as a start up investment.   


the first fees come in the form of letting comp use your wallet. This is usually a few bucks.

Compound and other liquidity protocols reward borrows and lenders in the form of great rates and token. by removing banks as middlemen this is possible. It‚Äôs literal socialism and libertarianism in harmony. Anyways,

While in theory it would be awesome to collect interest on my $50 deposit of liquidity, in reality it‚Äôs not because the price of gas/eth for transactions right now. what is $50 really going to do to help borrowers? Nothing, so if it does nothing for the system why would it do anything for you?

The price of the smart contracts is a bitter pill to swallow if you‚Äôre fucking with less than I‚Äôd say $500-1000. depending on the coin, as a deposit OR a loan. I‚Äôve seen it as low as 17 and as high as 70 depending on the traffic and gas rates. 

eth Gas station is helpful, but not as much as I hoped. You should still use the site to huge the traffic at least. Works better to see if I should hold off a transaction rather than guide me on the cost I pay at that moment.

at first I couldn‚Äôt really see why I would want to borrow, but it‚Äôs incredible Really. Banks usually lend out your money you deposit into them at absurd interest rates, shave a sliver off the top for you and take shit tons of cash in fees from borrowers. In defi utopia land, I can now borrow against my own liquidity and speculate on other coins on other exchanges, short all kinds of coins, it‚Äôs amazing. Using aave, which is similar to comp, I shorted 0x tokens and it was a glorious feeling. Had it not been for the smart contract fees I‚Äôd have done a lot better than break even. Was super fun to do, and had I just added a zero of two to my original amounts, I‚Äôd have made a pretty penny.

&amp;#x200B;

so the next big thing is what I suppose everyone refers to as liquidity mining, which is my new favorite term and can‚Äôt help but rofl every time I hear it. I‚Äôm a long time crypto user but only just getting back into it heavily after a few years and defi gives me the tingles.

after staring at these interest rates for 10 hours straight I realized I can borrow money off my deposit it back into the system and make out with a net gain despite the interest I pay for the loan. The comp token basically incentivizes this. I basically am being incentivized to deposit, borrow, depsosit, borrow. The net gain of interest and comp token is greater than the sole interest rate of my initial deposit  


Why the fuck would I not do this? The banks loan at money they create out of thin air via fractional reserve banking, why can‚Äôt I? Feels illegal because in the traditional world, these incredible schemes and maneuvers are only accessible to the pink shorts Georgetown fucks. The empowerment defi gives to the little guy is pretty amazing. This shit is revolutionary, folks.  


I can now use my credit card to pay for living expenses while never digging into my savings aka comp deposit. by borrowing off the deposit and earning comp reward I ultimately pay nothing for these comp earning loans and maintain my initial balance while earning interest. My initial deposit is never being interrupted. Totally different than when I‚Äôm poor and have to break into my savings for groceries. I use The comp loan to pay off my Credit card, and keep earning points on my card as well, lol. Credit cards are like 20-30% interest. A comp loan for eth is 2%, and like 8% for DAI. I can trade either to Coinbase and exchange for usd. Keep in mind the fees though. With half my initial comp deposits I can borrow both eth or DAI and use the balance of the two to mitigate my collateral ratio from falling into liquidation threshold

&amp;#x200B;

I know I‚Äôm missing a few other things so if I remember or if anyone asks, I‚Äôll follow up.

&amp;#x200B;

by the way, I know nothing about finance. I‚Äôm a poor Jazz musician and I love to play magic cards. The parallels between magic the gathering and crypto Are Astonishing to say the least. Game theory, mt.gox, immutability, Turing completes, etc.

i use my friend‚Äôs Success at Friday night magic (precovid) to better understand the way I think comp is incentivizing me to use it:

my friend is really good at magic, He almost never loses at tournaments. similar to the way a day trader in crypto or finance can be good at trading and netting mostly gains, my friend just wins at Friday night magic against whomever he plays. His knowledge of the game is thorough, and can confidently navigate his way into in serial wins.

&amp;#x200B;

i think comp allows it‚Äôs users that have made deposits to ‚Äúgo infinite‚Äù in the way my friend has at his local game store.

My friend made the initial investment of buying himself a good deck. Coupled with his confidence in His ability to win, and his statistical history of doing so, he wins more store credit than it costs to enter tournaments. he continues to accrue reward for his ability to make the right plays, and decisions in the form of store credit, and since he almost never loses. He reinvests his store credit into reserve list dual lands (will never be printed again/fixed supply I.e. another bitcoin/gold parallel) and as a result he continues to accrue huge amounts of profits based off good plays and good plays alone.

so basically comp opens up a world of possibility to working people (rich folks always had this opportunity) who may have the talent to make wise crypto trades that now can borrow off their initial investment when they want to pay for something instead of cracking open your savings. It‚Äôs brilliant.   


I know this is what yield farming and liquidity mining is, but I think people are missing the implications of this 80 and how revolutionary this is. This can literally help poor people get out of debt, since no banks are squeezing the system dry, and interest rates are being redistributed in a fair way. I‚Äôm worried the powers that be are not happy that automation will replace bankers before farmers

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: if your friend asked for some $ to pay for their bills and offered you interest, would you offer them $12 or the $500 they really need? Approach compound with this mindset. Gas is pricey, make it worth it."

If my goal is to earn the maximum amount for staking compound, should I consider the highest % for Supply + Distribution? Essentially, is Tether the best crypto to currently stake as it has a combined APY of 16.38%?

Also, for voting it wants to charge me a few $ worth of ETH, is this a 1-time transaction or every time I want to vote?   
And lastly, I see people are encouraging putting in piles of money due to gas fees. Would I still profit in the long run (6+ months) if I start out with around $100 worth?

Fairly new to Comp and its uses. I decided I was going to supply Comp with 100 Dai. I connected my Coinbase wallet and also bought like $20 of eth for gas. I started the transaction on the comp dapp and confirmed the transaction in my wallet completely. Cool, so gas money was taken and the transaction was a success according to etherscan.io. I have yet to receive the 100 Dai I supplied to the comp app. I checked my wallet and there is no recent transaction history for my Dai wallet... but definitely is for my Eth. Did something happen or am I missing something here? Do I need to wait longer? I'm so confused...I feel like I got my gas money stolen...

My first ever post on Reddit here. I was wondering if anyone could explain to me what I should expect from Metamask after I submitted duplicate minting orders to convert $500 USDC into cUSD. The reason I submitted two of the same orders is because I tried to low-ball the network with a low gas price. I then submitted the second one with a higher gas price. 

The one with the lower gas price actually went through first, and now I have the equivalent cUSD I wanted from Compound - all set on this front. I only have $50 USDC leftover in my wallet. What will happen to the pending minting request for $500 USDC when my wallet does not have enough in it? I went on the Etherscan page for the transaction and it says it was dropped from the block/node. Not too sure what this means, and I would appreciate any guidance.

Thank you!"

I'm relatively new to the concept of defi and I've started my research on this subject before going in with investing any funds. At this stage I do know all the other lending platforms and that several few of them have experienced hacks / security breaches which resulted in stolen funds.

Certainly the idea of having a true passive income in a decentralised manner is appealing, but nothing comes free, and I know that we get paid for risking our capital. I'm looking to find and understand if Compound has ever had a security vulnerability/hack/exploit/breach that I can learn more about? Or would the community consider it to be relatively 'safe' compared to other lending and earning interest platforms, such as AAVE for example?

Gas fees unsustainable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/lrdhsm/gas_fees_unsustainable/,Jaycera,14,2021-02-24 21:58:21,41,/r/Compound/comments/lrdhsm/gas_fees_unsustainable/,NaN,"Hi all,

Fairly new to Compound and DeFi, but have been trying to get used to the protocol with some minimal exposure at first. I'm somewhat confused by how prohibitive gas fees seem to be and was curious if I was doing something wrong, if this was the product of the current bull market and congestion, or if this was a product of the small volume I was experimenting with.

For context, I moved about 0.2 ETH into a wallet to begin experimenting with DeFi. I bought some DAI to use as a test run for supplying in Compound and beginning to earn COMP tokens. I was turned off by the gas fees to deposit at first, and waited a few days until I found something that I thought was reasonable (approx $8 USD) and enabled DAI on Compound. Then, to my surprise, I also was met with more gas fees to deposit my DAI into the supply, this time the fees were approximately $73 USD. I rejected that for now and am sitting here feeling half-fulfilled. I've now ""wasted"" fees on withdrawals, deposits, and enabling the token on Compound, but haven't begun actually earning any interest or COMP tokens yet.

Prior to getting into this, I naively thought that my gas fees were going to be nominal (i.e. &lt;$1 USD on a given transaction), but it seems there is a new fee around each corner and that they are quite high. Am I wrong? Is this a product of the current environment? Is this a product of me using relatively small volume and the solution is deal with transactions in higher volume to save on fees? I don't really understand. I love the concept of DeFi and what Compound offers, but I am feeling roadblocked by the associated fees at the present time.

Thanks in advance for any insight."

Spread in stablecoin rates,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/ltjcfz/spread_in_stablecoin_rates/,Something_About_Mory,5,2021-02-27 15:58:37,9,/r/Compound/comments/ltjcfz/spread_in_stablecoin_rates/,NaN,"As of right now,  
USDC is 2.8%  
USDT is 4.8%  
DAI is 7.15%  
That's a difference of 4.3%! How is this the spread so high? Shouldn't yield arbitrage close this gap? Im all in usdc and I kind of regret it"
Tried to withdraw from Compound lending. Want me to pay 0.78 ETH network fee. This differs from the amount I enter. Isn‚Äôt the GAS fee always the same regardless the amount of the transaction?,https://i.redd.it/pc8m7dr4k1k61.jpg,mpluss,15,2021-02-27 23:48:11,14,/r/Compound/comments/ltqt0s/tried_to_withdraw_from_compound_lending_want_me/,NaN,
