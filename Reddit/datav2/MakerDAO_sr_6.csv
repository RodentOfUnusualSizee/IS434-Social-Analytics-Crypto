1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock"

* I confirm the details are correct
* In MetaMask I check the gas is reasonable (~$30) and confirm the transaction
* In Oasis the status is changed to ""Changing Vault"" and provides a link to the transaction in Etherscan

Currently we recommend that you enter your Maker CDP Transactions into CoinTracking as follows:

1. Supply of ETH to the CDP should be a withdrawal from ETH wallet and subsequent deposit into a fictitious exchange account called ""Maker CDP""¬†
2. DAI (or SAI) is then generated should be accounted for as a Trade where X SAI is bought for $0. This is because the SAI is debt and needs to be paid back before the position can be closed. Therefore it shouldn't be marked income.¬†
3. When SAI is returned, you will have to sell it back for $0. If it is transferred, traded, or otherwise used elsewhere, that should be treated as normal transfers/trades.¬†
4. In the event of collateral liquidation, underlying collateral (ETH) is sold for $0, realizing a capital loss.¬†
5. The stability fee payment (akin to interest on a loan) can be made by the user in DAI or MKR token upon closing the position.¬†"

Collateralized loans on Oasis. How to calculate liquidation price and how to understand 'Liquidation ratio'?

Let's say I will put **1 WBTC** as collateral into vault. Oasis says that I can get up to **25'184 DAI** which is in traditional terms **66%** loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. But it also says that the 'Liquidation ratio' (minimal collateral ratio) is **150%** which is the same as **66% LTV** in traditional terms. Does that mean that if I create **25'184 DAI** and the value of my 1 WBTC drops even a slightest I will be in the liquidation territory?  If this is correct, why does such an option even exist? it is super risky. 

My second question is: Can I generate less DAI as I am offered? Instead of **25'184 DAI** (and making this 66% LTV borrowing) can I instead generate **15'140 DAI** which will be close to 40% LTV ratio which is much safer if the liquidation LTV ratio is 66%?

Is it safe to deal with such high amounts on DAO?

PS: calculating liquidation prices formula on MakerDAO website is strange:  
Source: [https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/)

    To calculate a Liquidation Price, simply use the following formula:
    Liquidation Price = (Generated Dai * Liquidation Ratio) / (Amount of Collateral)

If I plug in the numbers for the above case (for 1 WBTC = 37¬†776 USD) I get this:

    (25184 DAI * 1.5) / 37776 USD = 1

How is 1 a ""Liquidation price""? I don't get it

Thank you for any help."

Any plans to lower collateralization ratios,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/o66h0m/any_plans_to_lower_collateralization_ratios/,Rhader,1,2021-06-23 13:35:22,21,/r/MakerDAO/comments/o66h0m/any_plans_to_lower_collateralization_ratios/,NaN,"As the title says, are there any plans to make collateral locked in maker more capital efficient by lowering the collateralization ratios on some types of collateral?


I was thinking since dai is essentially captured by usdc, which is a regulatory captured asset and very far from high quality trust less collateral, why not lower the collateral ratio on dais trust less assets like eth to attract more of that type of collateral? 


Quite frankly the less decentralized dai is the more bearish I am on it, I'm not the only one that sees things like this."

here are the details of the implementaiton:
https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP25

my guess is that the flash dia creation can be used for arbitrage? if thats so how does one use minted dai, use it to buy something else then some how repay the dai in the same transaction. Just so im clear, my understanding of flash loans is that the loan is created and repaid in the same transaction.

im wondering what the use cases for this are and how it helps the makerdao protocol."
