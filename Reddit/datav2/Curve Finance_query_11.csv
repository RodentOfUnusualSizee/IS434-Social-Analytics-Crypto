How to find a mentor when starting?,https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/qjxcz0/how_to_find_a_mentor_when_starting/,Make_That_Money,1,2021-11-01 03:55:56,1,/r/realestateinvesting/comments/qjxcz0/how_to_find_a_mentor_when_starting/,Education,"I'm currently a senior graduating from college in May. I've been interested in real estate for years, but obviously being a college student I couldn't really do much. I'm thinking about purchasing a multifamily once I actually graduate to start. This is something I would definitely like to do long-term and would love to find a mentor to guide me or possibly even work with. 

I do know of someone who is extremely successful in this field, but I'm not sure if I should reach out to them. It's my friend's brother-in-law. Although I will say I'm not that close with this friend because I have only known him for a few years. I met his brother-in-law at an all-day event over a shared hobby, he seems like a cool guy but really busy. I found out that he owns a construction company and over 800 apartments while still in his 30's. He is actually building a multimillion dollar house in my neighborhood a few doors down. He knows who I am and I think the fact he is moving in so close would only help.

Should I try to contact him, I could easily get his phone/email from that friend. I just feel like I have nothing to be able to assist him with since he is already way ahead of the curve. He also seems really busy already. I would kind of like to know how he really got started and if he would mind giving me advice. I would love to be able to actually work with him in some way but I don't think I can bring much value other than my time because of my lack of experience. I am a finance major so I really like analyzing deals and working with numbers. 

Do you think I should reach out to him? If not where would be a good place to look for mentors?"

Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Assets within decentralized finance, namely crypto, are by far the best-performing investment class today. However, you can also lose all of your money if you’re not careful.

It’s not uncommon for a project to generate hype, only to collapse weeks later. That’s why it’s especially important for retail DeFi investors to 1. have a framework to analyze projects, and 2. apply this framework before jumping in. 

DeFi's decentralised nature lets anybody participate. It’s surprising how little technical expertise or cash is needed to bootstrap a project or token. The results can be catastrophic for investors who decide to invest without doing due diligence.

Luckily, the flipside of decentralization is that data is transparent and readily available. The data does not lie, so this is where an intelligent investor should first look.

When investigating a project, you can’t go wrong by starting with 3 metrics and 5 charts. 

* Total locked value

Chart 1: TVL Growth

Chart 2: TVL Distribution

* Market cap

Chart 3: MC/FDV Ratio

Chart 4: MC/TVL Ratio

* Token price &amp; allocation

Chart 5: Token Price Movement

&amp;#x200B;

[Monthly Total Number of DeFi ProtocolsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/mhrokaw1p5x71.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd045aa000d098653340b3f56e2a8423f95a2631)

**Total Value Locked (TVL)**

## Make sure the project has a stable TVL growth

TVL refers to the total value of assets deposited by users and locked into a protocol. More assets in a project locked means users have more confidence providing liquidity and collateral for the protocol’s economic activities. This both signal’s the market’s confidence in the project.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 10 Protocols TVL &amp; Market Cap ComparisonData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/u6bkrn95p5x71.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6091009b3d44e0a0e7a2bcfe6f654b054c14506)

As you can see, the top 10 protocols are of both huge values above $5 billion and stable TVL growth month-by-month. That indicates a project is continuing to maintain its vitality and strength.

On the other hand, when looking at weaker, less reputable projects, the picture is different. Huge TVL changes per day, with an unsustainable upward trend, usually followed by a significant drop the day after the rise.

&amp;#x200B;

[Unstable TVL ProjectsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/booakrc6p5x71.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=605867d5218e4d182116ecd838dc8ca98702492d)

## Pick projects whose TVLs are “middle-of-the-pack”

As is clear from the scatter chart below, projects are proliferating like crazy with an extremely uneven TVL distribution. There are currently over 500 DeFi projects, of which 33%have TVLs below $5 million.

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL Distribution of Protocols \(Excluding Top 10 TVL Protocols\)Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/xfmu7we7p5x71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16415aa054237ca657935a04abcbafb8edf60833)

This is one of the easiest ways to separate projects into 3 categories:

* Already “priced in” or overleveraged/overvalued 
* Completely new, unproven and risky
* Projects with potential

How should you balance risk with reward?

To be on the safe side and to prevent the risk of too small projects running away with their money, individual investors should try to select projects in the middle of the TVL range and above (around $20 million) when deciding who to invest in.

Those in the $1 million to $10 million range are suitable for seed rounds by investment institutions. Individual investors should avoid these because their future positioning and strategic direction is not clear.

While TVL projects in the $10 to 20 million range have found a suitable growth strategy and investors have access to data on this segment, in terms of stability, there is a risk of stunted growth in these projects and a high risk of weak growth or decline if growth is not sufficient.

TVL projects in the $20 million to $50 million range have, to some extent, found a clear fit in terms of product mechanics and growth, with community and technical support gradually becoming more sophisticated, and are a good choice if you want to achieve higher returns than the top protocols.

If your risk tolerance is low and your need for return is not too high, you can choose projects from the top protocols to invest in based on your preferred DeFi project category (e.g. DEX for providing liquidity, lending for lending, etc.)

Market Cap (MC) 

Market cap is the most accurate overall reflection of a project’s market value. 

This metric is calculated similarly to stocks in the traditional equity market, namely by multiplying the price of the token by the number of tokens in circulation and available for trading.

As the number of tokens is affected by circulation and supply and demand, the price of the token can change quickly. On the other hand, market cap tends to increase or decrease within a 20% range, with no sharp increases followed by precipitous crashes.

This stable quality makes market cap a good underlying indicator to evaluate projects and identify potential and worthwhile investments. 

## Avoid low MC/FDV ratios when looking for long-term holds

Fully diluted valuation (FDV) refers to the maximum supply of tokens multiplied by token price. In other words, it is equal to the market cap when all tokens have been released. 

If the MC/FDV ratio of a project's tokens is low, it means that a large number of tokens have not yet been released. This happens when 1) the protocol is newly live; 2) the total supply of the token is extremely large.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top Protocols Token MC\/FDV RatioData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/qs79wa49p5x71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b681d8f3b723826b0caa65d0376104c88c238067)

Investors should consider FDV carefully, focusing on the length of time the project has been online and the token supply schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

[Low Ratio of  MC\/FDV Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/r6j60y8ap5x71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e802665e6a75725f5fa25a19288ec724438c61)

Some examples of projects with low ratios are:

* Fruit : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.002%
* StakedZEN : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.077%
* Hanu Yokia : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.17%

The MC/FDV ratio allows investors to assess whether a token price is overheated.That’s because a low ratio indicates that the supply will eventually be higher than the actual demand once project owners release more tokens.  With the demand increasing rapidly, the price will likely drop as the market adjusts. 

Look at the chart below to see how top-ranked projects looked from a MC/FDV perspective. 

Projects with an MC/FDV ratio higher than 60% are better for long-term holding with price security almost guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price of Top ProtocolsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/9x9qam9bp5x71.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd0ede6627c8bb8f2c124dd9b47feef387d9991)

On the other hand, high MC/FDV ratio projects aren’t without drawbacks. They usually have higher entry prices. Though this isn’t always the case, analyzing the data will allow you to make better investments based on your goals. 

Curve (CRV), for example, has an MC/FDV of 11.86%. Lido, another lending project, has a lower MC/FDV at 5.54% *AND* a higher token price. So, when comparing the two, we can see that those looking for long-term DeFi lending projects to invest in should consider Curve over Lido. 

## Keep an eye out for projects with a low MC/TVL ratio

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 10 Protocols MC\/TVL RatioData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/ei7xdu2dp5x71.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a341fcfe92d3b6cfbc85661a872fc113405b13bb)

The current MC/TVL ratios of the top 10 TVL projects are almost without exception less than 1. This means that these projects are undervalued and worth investing in. Here’s why:

From an economic perspective, the higher the TVL of a project, the higher the MC should be because a high TVL indicates that investors have a high degree of confidence in the project’s economic utility. 

In other words, when investors lock in their tokens it means that they are utilizing the project rather than speculating. More utilization relative to speculation is usually a good sign. 

Therefore, investors should take a gook look at the MC/TVL ratio. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the valuation may be too high and the investability is low, while a ratio less than 1 indicates that the project is undervalued and the returns are primed to increase. 

Remember to always compare projects within the same categories for valid comparisons, and especially compare lesser known projects’ ratios from those of the top protocols.

Stable token price and reasonable token allocation mechanism

## Choose projects whose tokens are stable

Many people do DeFi investing backwards. 

They start by looking at token prices, then do research on the underlying project to justify their (often FOMO-driven) investment. 

Instead, you should have already investigated suitable projects using the metrics and indicators explained above. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 5 Protocols Token Price ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/of17hxeep5x71.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eff6e7c8c6cf4971369a081db972144a7be96b1)

After you’ve created a shortlist of projects you are interested in, screened for solid fundamentals, you can then look at the token prices. 

In crypto, “stable” is a relative term. 

At Footprint, we recommend being wary of price jumps and drops within 20%. Normally, the extreme change of price indicates an unhealthy market reaction to some news that might just be a pump.

If the token price remains relatively stable, the liquidity of the token is relatively stable also. Therefore, the possibility of damage to the project caused by a large number of individual investors selling tokens is reduced.

As with other metrics, this rule is best applied when comparing your different options on a visualization chart, as above. 

The data indicates that InstaDApp and MakerDAO are more resistant to the negative effects of a sell-off than Curve, for example.

## Summary: 5 Steps to Assess The Investability of a DeFi Project 

When looking for the next project to invest in, start with the fundamentals. Use data to compare projects within the DeFi projects you feel spanly about in your thesis. 

The takeaways:

* Stable TVL growth
* Mid-range TVL ranking or above, approximately $20M or higher
* MC/FDV ratio higher than 5%
* MC/TVL ratio less than 1
* Stable token price with monthly fluctuations under +/- 20%

For the above metrics, readers can access them directly in this featured [Footprint dashboard, entitled “How to Discover Valuable Project”](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/97bd7a34-8221-4eab-afe9-23b9a00567ec#name=How%20to%20Discover%20Valuable%20Projects%20). 

Furthermore, the tokenconomics and the team structure of a protocol are also key reasons to consider when investing.  If the percentage of tokens held by the team or foundation is too high, then there is a bigger chance that the project is a money grab.

This can easily lead to a situation where a core group of people can release tokens quickly in an attempt to “cash out”, leading to a serious dilution of the token price and an increased possibility of the tokens being sold off.  

DeFi, as a new investment market, has created more investment possibilities than traditional finance, with many worthwhile projects that are quite slept on.

However, opportunity and risk goes hand-in-hand. 

It’s important to remember that the DeFi market is inherently unpredictable, and that even the above indicators are no guarantees for long-term viability.

From the very beginning in the 1990s, MMT has NEVER argued that ‘printing money’ was necessary. Anyone saying MMT = “print money,” even if they (correctly) incorporate an inflation constraint, is getting MMT dead wrong.

2. The argument from the earliest days–@wbmosler ‘s “Soft Currency Economics,” Wray’s “Understanding Modern Money,” or u/StephanieKelton ‘s “Can Taxes &amp; Bonds Finance Govt Spending?”–the MMT argument is that ALL govt deficits are ‘printing money’ ALREADY (!).

3. These and other foundational, early MMT pieces argue that the choice to issue bonds or not is about monetary policy how to set the CB’s interest rate target, not whether to ‘finance’ a deficit or ‘print money.’

4. The argument across literally dozens of publications is consistent–whether or not govt issues bonds when it runs a deficit, the macroeconomic impact of ‘bonds vs. money’ is nil.

5. What matters for macro impact is the deficit itself, and how it is created (spending/taxing priorities), since the deficit is creating net financial wealth in the pvt sector (note I did NOT say ‘real’ wealth (!)).

6. The choice to issue bonds or not in the face of a deficit is simply about 1 risk-free govt asset (say, Tbills) vs. another risk-free govt asset of perhaps slightly longer maturity (but that’s also a policy choice).

7. This is also partly why we predicted back in the 2001 that Japan’s QE wouldn’t be inflationary, and predicted the same for the US in 2008. QE &amp; ‘monetization’ of govt debt is about an asset swap–it’s the deficit itself that has the ‘quantity’ effect, not the financing.

8. Similarly, in the real world, CB’s are defending their national payments systems every minute of every day. This means they accommodate banks’ demand for CB liabilities always at or near their current interest rate target.

9. From an MMT perspective, it’s really weird that people believe a govt running a deficit via overdraft at the CB is inherently inflationary, but the current system, where govt runs a deficit while CB guarantees mkt liquidity for bond dealers to buy govt bonds, isn’t.

10. So, from the beginning 20+ yrs ago, MMT said the ‘choice’ to issue bonds when running a deficit was about how to set CB’s int rate target. W/ bond sales, CB accommodates banks at its tgt rate. W/o bond sales, CB sets rate at ZIRP or uses IOR=tgt rate to set tgt rate &lt;&gt; 0

11. This is just supply and demand from ECON 101. If you push out the supply curve beyond the entire demand curve, either the price falls to 0 or you have a price floor set at &lt;&gt; 0. Those are the only 2 possibilities when ‘printing money’ to run a deficit.

12. Neoclassicals actually agree w/ this, for different reasons. For them, if ‘monetize’ govt debt &amp; CB rate = 0, ‘monetization’ isn’t inflationary. Or, if CB sets rate &lt;&gt; 0 via IOR=target rate, still not inflationary.

13. In both cases, CB’s reserves are considered effectively equivalent to holding, say, Tbills. So, ‘monetization’ or ‘printing money’ is effectively equivalent to ‘printing’ Tbills. IOW, if you blend neoclassical model w/ actual CB ops, ‘printing money’ isn’t inflationary.

14. Putting this all together . . . MMT has NEVER argued that ‘printing money’ as conventionally interpreted is necessary to carry out MMT policy proposals. All deficits create net financial wealth for pvt sector, regardless of ‘finance’ method.

15. Choice to issue bonds or not when running a deficit is about how to set CB’s target rate, not ‘financing’ a deficit. This means that interest on national debt is a policy variable, or at least can be (for monetary sovereign, of course).

16. So, choice to issue bonds or not is not about ‘quantity’ impact of a deficit, but about ‘how’ CB chooses to achieve its target rate. Hitting interest rate tgt by overdraft to govt &amp; pay IOR=tgt rate=2% has no difference of macro significance from . . .

17. … hitting interest rate target by govt instead issuing tbills while CB ensures mkt liquidity at tgt rate = 2% to banks &amp; bond dealers.

18. Now, there are places where MMT scholars argued for no bond issuance, govt gets CB overdraft, &amp; CB sets tgt rate= 0 (permanent ZIRP). Note, tho, that this is (a) not arguing in favor of ‘printing money’ even in neoclassical view (it’s Krugman’s liquidity trap, actually) …

19. (b) and is therefore, simply a policy proposal for low interest rates on govt debt. It is also NOT arguing for ZIRP in a neoclassical world–Wray did his Ph.D. under Minsky. Minsky was against manipulating short term rates; instead favored credit regs/margins of safety.

20. That is, when MMT proposes ZIRP, it is proposing it for ONLY the govt debt, NOT for the economy overall as in a New Keynesian model. There are dozens of MMT publications on regulating credit, and more on the way. MMT was about macroprudential before that was a thing.

21. Minsky was adamant that manipulating short-term interest rates was actually destabilizing (he blamed the rise of money manager capitalism on Volcker’s high rates). Raise margins of safety to slow credit rather than raising the overnight, risk-free rate.

22. A benefit of margins of safety is that raising interest rates to slow credit leads to higher hurdle rates that can only be met by riskier projects, while raising margins of safety slows credit by favoring the LESS risky loans.

23. Particularly given that the problem of a debt bubble is that credit QUALITY is bad, it’s really weird from an MMT perspective that it’s mostly MMT arguing in favor of macro policy that target credit quality …

24. … while neoclassicals go to lengths to NOT talk about credit quality–use a Taylor rule to manipulate short-term rates, increase liquidity requirements, increase capital, but little to nothing about underwriting. (Shocker–we now have a corp debt bubble.)

25. So, MMT is NOT arguing for ‘printing money’ and ‘ZIRP’ in the conventional, neoclassical world. MMT is arguing for stabilizing demand side of the economy w/ a mix of govt’s budget position (at low rates, however ‘financed’) &amp; credit quality/margins of safety.

The cryptocurrency market is back on the run to the upside as the bulls seem to be buying the discounts every step of the way. But based on observations, the price markets of several crypto sectors are holding back despite their exceptional performance on the fundamental side of things.

One such example is the [**DeFi space**](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/en_US/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-world-of-decentralized-finance)**.** The sector in itself has been doing great ever since it has gained public traction. But shedding light on the price market of the protocols related to the DeFi industry, most native tokens are underperforming relative to their fundamental aspect.

Having that said, the overall direction of the DeFi price market still remains in line with the developments of the projects. Most tokens of [**DeFi protocols**](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/en_US/what-is-standard-protocol-and-how-does-it-work) have been in the buyer's market despite the downturns that came along earlier this year. It is about time that perhaps holding the prices at lower-than-expected levels.

## Total Value Locked Grows by 10x in Ten Months.

**The** [**total value locked (TVL)**](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-is-total-value-locked-2021-09-29) **in DeFi is directly related to the demand for the industry.** Defi is certainly securing its long-term presence in the crypto market based on the patterns revealed by the TVL.

According to the latest numbers revealed by *the* [***Defillama*** **platform**](https://defillama.com/home), the aggregate locked value in DeFi has surpassed the $200 billion mark for the very first time. Despite the pricing market being out of sync, seeing the sector achieve these figures is surprising.

To keep things in context, the total value locked in US Dollars was just $20 billion at the start of this year. And these were the numbers when the entire [**cryptocurrency market**](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/en_US/how-to-choose-crypto-for-beginners) was surging and hitting new highs. However, as the DeFi market increased in popularity towards the second quarter of 2021, the total value locked continued to climb at a much faster rate. The TVL in DeFi now is at [**$200 billion**](https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-surpasses-200-billion-fantom-avalanche-harmony-arbitrum-tvls-swell/) \- ten times its value at the beginning of the year."
Farm Land Investment,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/qlb8ey/farm_land_investment/,whattodo111231,1,2021-11-03 02:50:22,43,/r/fatFIRE/comments/qlb8ey/farm_land_investment/,NaN,"I'm in my early 40s, net worth is around \~$25m. Background in high-finance (private equity), I'm in the highest earning point of my career right now (600k-ish base, bonus usually matches base, percentage ownership in a couple of our portfolio companies adding up to around 5 million that will vest within the next 18 months. 

My portfolio is broken down as follows:

$3m primary residence (Bay Area), will be paid off this year

$1.5m in 2 residential properties rented out (bought in 2009)

$5m with Merrill Lynch, conservatively invested

$5m in equity that will be cashed out in the next 18 months

$1.5m in 401k

$2.5m cash (been hesitant putting more into my portfolio since Covid)

$3.5m Walnut farm (passion project, produces decent cash flow &amp; land value has tripled since I purchased in 2011)

This is a big cash inflow year, switched firms and large deal flow this time around so that comes out to around $3.5m cash incoming this year.

The rest is scattered in various investments/small ventures or set away for the kids' tuition. 

I like farm land. I bought my parents a house on the current farm, they are very hands on in making sure laborers do their job and track expenses. I went in 80/20 with a business partner who had experience in the farming business, helped out with the initial learning curve.

I'm thinking about buying another farm \~20 miles away from my current farm, about 200 acres (around $21k/acre, around what I bought this current farm for), productive almond farm (\~10 year old trees). I'm thinking to go in 60/40 with another long time business partner, parents will be able to care for this farm as well. About a $5m venture.

Margins aren't huge, but they are consistent and land values continue to jump. Also since the land is already productive, it's a lot less work for the first couple of years and I'll be seeing cash flow in from the first year. With of cash incoming this year, I will put more in my investment account but I think diversifying is a good idea.

I have a $1.6m credit line with very competitive rates through Merrill, so with 20% down and a 60% stake, it'll be around $600k out of pocket, and I'll be building equity on it with the cash inflow, not to mention land prices going up. 

Another huge benefit is from taxes- my farm CPA helps me optimize so with how much cash I have coming in, I can expense it and have big deductions from my income tax. 

You see a lot of of residential/commercial development, especially in the crowd I am in, and perhaps returns are a little nicer, but prices are insane for residential/commercial real estate in/near the Bay, while farmland is still relatively reasonable. Also I get to spend a weekend or two out of the city with my parents on a farm, it's a nice feeling. 

Just thought I'd share. Anybody else here invest in farmland, thoughts and experiences?"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Bitcoin and Ether closed October on a strong note, increasing the possibility that the rally will pick up pace in November.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) had their highest monthly close ever in October, indicating strong momentum that favors buyers. The focus now shifts to November, which has been largely bullish for Bitcoin.  
Since 2013, Bitcoin has closed November in the red on only two occasions, in 2018 and 2019. Another positive impetus for Bitcoin could be the tailwinds from the United States stock markets, which also have an enviable record in November.  
The S&amp;P 500 has recorded a median rise of 2% in November, the only month of the year to achieve such impressive median returns.  
Data from Glassnode also shows that Bitcoin reserves on exchanges are at their lowest level in three years. The amount of Bitcoin held on the books of exchanges has dropped from 3.1 million Bitcoin in April 2020 to 2.47 million BTC. According to analysts, this could be bullish for Bitcoin if the demand shoots up because that could create a supply shock.  
Could Ether lead the altcoins higher or will Bitcoin remain in the driver’s seat? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

# 2. JPMorgan Report Says CBDCs Can Save Firms $100B a Year in Cross-Border Costs

&gt;***The report considers a network of multiple central bank digital currencies across the ASEAN region.***  
&gt;  
&gt;A central bank digital currency (CBDC) network could save global corporates over $100 billion a year in transaction costs when it comes to cross-border payments.  
So says a report published Wednesday by consulting firm Oliver Wyman and megabank JPMorgan called “Unlocking $120 Billion Value in Payments.”  
The report estimates that of the nearly $24 trillion in wholesale payments that move across borders each year, banks incur more than $120 billion in total transaction costs; this excludes potential hidden costs in trapped liquidity and delayed settlements.  
“The case for CBDCs to address pain points in cross-border payments is very compelling,” said Oliver Wyman partner Jason Ekberg said in a statement. “The bulk of today’s wholesale cross-border payments process remains sub-optimal due to multiple intermediaries between the sending and receiving banks, often resulting in high transaction costs, long settlement times, and lack of transparency on the status of the payments.”  
Conversations around CBDCs, driven by the march of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, can be about either retail issuance or the type of wholesale transactions this report is focused on.  
There have been several wholesale banking initiatives in recent years led by private firms, commercial banks, and central banks, the report points out, but nothing like a full-scale, multiple central bank digital currency (mCBDC) network.  
The report uses the ASEAN region and its corridors as an example, comprising Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, which operates across a diverse set of 10 currencies and contributes 7% of global cross-border trade.  
JPMorgan and Oliver Wyman suggest a model for the ideal mCBDC that considers the process from minting and redeeming of CBDCs to FX conversion and settlement. The report also cites new opportunities for players in the correspondent banking world who might be disrupted by a full-scale CBDC rollout.  
“The development of CBDCs brings new, tangible opportunities such as subscription-based mCBDC corridor access or smart contract-enabled cash management services,” said JPMorgan Global Head of Coin Systems Naveen Mallela.  
Indeed, Mallela’s Onyx division was involved in one such trial connecting France and Singapore.

# 3. Bitcoin Whale Holdings Reach 2021 High Amid Inflation Fears

&gt;***The renewed buying amid rising inflation expectations across the globe suggests investment is the primary use case for bitcoin.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin whales or large investors with ample capital supply appear to be buying again as fears of inflation lurching out of control strengthen the case for investing in store of value assets.  
Large investors, holding at least 1,000 BTC, snapped up 142,000 coins last week, taking the cumulative tally to nearly 200,000 BTC — the highest in 2021, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis’ market intel report published on Tuesday said.  
The renewed buying amid rising inflation expectations across the globe suggests investment is the primary use case for bitcoin.  
“Its a confirmation of the view that bitcoin is seen as digital gold, or perhaps institutions are just making a longer term trade on the bitcoin price,” Chainalysis said.  
The U.S. 10-year breakeven rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term price pressures, recently rose to a decade high of 2.64%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Bitcoin rallied nearly 40% in October, hitting a record high of $66,975.  
Analysts at JPMorgan have attributed the rally to the perception that bitcoin is an inflation hedge contrary. The perception stems from bitcoin’s mining reward halving. This programmed code reduces the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years, putting the cryptocurrency’s monetary policy at odds with the Federal Reserve’s decades of money printing.  
However, bitcoin needs to expand its footprint into crypto sub-sectors like Web3 and decentralized finance to remain relevant relative to ether in the long run, according to Chainalysis, .  
“Bitcoin usage has not reached the sophistication of Ethereum or other Layer 1 assets,” Chainalysis said. “A decentralized way of wrapping bitcoin is needed to unlock the use of bitcoin as high-quality capital in DeFi.”  
“If bitcoin can be used as capital in Web 3.0 then it will have a future as both a scarce fungible asset and as a useful asset in the more innovative side of crypto,” Chainalysis added.  
The uptick in whale holdings suggests the recent rally is backed by strong hands and is sustainable. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum lost steam in the first quarter as whale holdings started declining. The market crashed in May.  
The cryptocurrency was last seen changing hands near $62,900, representing a 0.5% drop on the day.

# 4. Soaring Crypto Investment Calls for Regulation: India’s Top Finance Newspaper

&gt;***“This is India’s crypto moment,” the newspaper declared.***  
&gt;  
&gt;The Economic Times, one of India’s top finance newspaper, dedicated its entire front page to call on the government to provide regulatory guidance to the crypto industry.  
The Indian government has been sitting on a crypto regulation bill for at least a year. Meanwhile, since the Supreme Court lifted the Reserve Bank of India’s two-year banking ban on crypto exchanges in March 2020, investment in crypto has soared.  
Tens of millions of Indians have invested $80 billion (INR 6 trillion) in crypto, the newspaper wrote. Given these “staggering” numbers and “massive” growth potential, India needs a “transparent and regulated environment,” the newspaper wrote on its front page.  
“The huge amount of Indian investor exposure to cryptocurrencies warrants quick action by the government on the regulatory front,” Prasad Rane, partner at Legaligence Strategic Consulting LLP, told us.  
“The global anti-money laundering agency the Financial Action Task Force \[FATF\] has already identified crypto assets as a source of risk and recently published guidance to regulate the industry like banks. Our government is behind the curve.”  
Rane stressed that most terrorist organisations accept donations and process funding through crypto assets, and it is challenging to keep track of their flow. Hence, regulation is the need of the hour.  
Lacking any regulatory guidance, Indian crypto exchanges have committed to comply by a code of conduct drafted by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), an industry association, the ET wrote.  
The code of conduct includes know-your-customer verification for all customers, checking for fraud and market manipulation, providing an audit trail for transactions, total compliance with tax and law enforcement requirements, investor education, and matrix for addressing user grievances, ET wrote.  
Indian investment in crypto has ballooned to $6.6 billion this year from $923 million last year, intelligence firm Chainalysis found in July.

# 5. Thailand’s Oldest Bank Acquires Majority Stake in Country’s Largest Crypto Exchange

&gt;***SCB paid $536.6 million for a 51% stake in Bitkub.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) has acquired a 51% stake in Thai cryptocurrency exchange Bitkub.  
Thailand’s oldest bank SCB paid 17.85 billion baht ($536.6 million) for the majority stake in the exchange, according to an announcement Tuesday.  
The transaction is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval.  
Bitkub, which is licensed by Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has reported trading volume of over $30 billion from January to September 2021, making it comfortably the country’s largest crypto exchange, with a market share of over 90%.  
However, the exchange fell afoul of the regulator earlier this year over issues on its platform causing severe outages, one of which lasted 16 hours amid increased trading activity. The SEC ordered Bitkub to shut down for five days to iron out the bugs.

OK, I am 2nd in command of the  finance department at my job. Last month was our annual inventory count.  We count for two days, and on the third day, our auditors come to  sample a few items then clear us. During the two days of count and until  the auditors give us the OK, there can be no production and no  shipments.

Due to pandemic, meeting with auditors was done virtually, which made it very cumbersome.

We  always go to our external warehouse first (not owned by us, but they  hold a lot of our inventory), and we cleared them no problem. However, I  wasn't able to get around to clearing the main location's warehouse  until 1:30 in the afternoon. The one shipping manager then proceeded to scream at me and embarrass me in front of the entire  warehouse about how she's unable to get shipments out and how the  freight companies are going to charge us detention fees.

There  was nothing I could have said to placate her and shut her the fuck up.  This was the first time I was taking full control of this project  (normally it was the 1st in command who did this), and for the most  part, we were on pace relative to prior years, even factoring in the  learning curve of adding new technology. I am doing my best.

HR  knows I'm doing my best, the 1st in command of the department knows I'm  doing my best, and she's been around for a few years to know that this  not something that's new; we always have this delay. I'm not  deliberately holding up shipments going out, it's all in the auditor's hands. She just thought that because she's 60 and I'm 29 she can get  away with disrespecting me.

Even  though she apologized to me the next Monday, I sort of half-assed accepted it, because I was so angry that she humiliated me and screamed at me. I was already beyond stressed out with that project I led, and  that's a level of disrespect that still doesn't sit well with me.

Once you disrespect me, I won't forget that. I will never treat you the same again. And that's what I'm doing with this twat.

She tries to be nice to me, but I'm not being nice back. Today she confronted me about it, and so I told her that I'm still mad at her for humiliating me.

Her response? ""What the fuck? I said I was sorry. You need to let it go, seriously.""

My  response? ""Sorry, but I rescind my acceptance of your apology. I worked my ass off and took shit from all sides during that project, from executives jamming it down my throat, auditors hassling me, foremen screaming at me because it takes so long, the last thing I needed was you screaming at me, embarrassing me in front of the whole warehouse,  while the union dicks were laughing at me while you're embarrassing me.

In  NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION am I going to ever think that's OK to do.  I don't tolerate disrespect from anyone, you're no exception. Now get the fuck away from me.""

We should normalize rescinding acceptance of apologies."

**NOV 2021 UPDATE:** I am currently offering discount deals for requests for assistance with completing a student's entire course for the Fall 2021 semester (6 - 20 week courses acceptable), as well as discounts for students seeking help with multiple exams and/or multiple classes for Fall 2021. My availability for the Autumn 2021 / Fall 2021 semester will likely become limited very quickly as I receive more and more academic requests. Therefore it would be very advantageous to reach out to me for academic assistance before my schedule becomes too full.

* I can also be available to complete all the student's homework assignments, exams, or the entire online class on their behalf upon request.
* I find helping students learn and do well in math to be a fulfilling activity that I would jump at the chance to do. I enjoy being a positive influence in students' lives and enjoy using my knowledge to help them do well in their classes and school in general.
* I have received over 20 academic awards and honors during my academic career.
* I have over 10 years of professional tutoring and teaching experience at reputable tutoring centers, including Princeton Review &amp; Kaplan.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* Below is a link to my Google Drive folder, which contains a diverse assortment of the scores I have obtained on exams that I have recently completed for other students. The link also contains a folder containing the numerous awards that I attained throughout my college education.
* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole. 
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services. 
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.

Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Data source: [**Footprint October Monthly Report**](https://footprint.cool/FekA) **(https://footprint.cool/FekA)**

Following a volatile September, the crypto market rebounded to an all-time high in October, with DeFi's TVL exceeding $250 billion and BTC pushing past $66K. 

&amp;#x200B;

[DeFi TVL ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/o4fh9zlm0ix71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ad782377729cdede902dc82523df3cfdd5d723f)

But with all eyes on rising token prices, it was easy to miss some trends and announcements that look likely to impact the market in Q4 significantly. 

* DeFi will be getting more regulated as countries announce sweeping cryptocurrency policies
* Bitcoin ETFs attract global attention, creating positive outlook as institutional investors buy in
* Lending market lacks clear leader as Curve and MakerDAO vie for top spot
* Numerous new public chains see big growth shortly after launching

Read how these developments and others will affect the crypto market in Footprint's October Monthly Report.

**Bitcoin futures ETF triggers new high for BTC**

With Grayscale announcing a series of plans to convert bitcoin funds into spot ETFs and digital asset investment firm Valkyrie listing its bitcoin futures ETF on NASDAQ, the price of BTC climbed from $48,000 to around $60,000. On Oct.20, BTC even reached a record high of $66,000. 

Investors now have very span support for the thesis that institutions will gradually purchase crypto assets. This means we can imagine a world where banks make massive whale purchases of BTC and other tokens. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC and ETH Price ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/hlebkzwp0ix71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=446b7c3e2d2e7503f852ecd91dd4f59f79e7f0c1)

Two aspects bolsters the DeFi TVL's growth in October :

**Lending market sees neck and neck competition among dominant platforms**

[The TVL ranking](https://www.footprint.network/topic/Chain/Blockchain) from Footprint Data shows that Aave and MakerDAO once surpassed [Curve](https://www.footprint.network/topic/Projects/Curve) in the middle of the month to become the projects with the highest DeFi TVL, but quickly fell back behind.

As of Oct. 31, Curve was still ranked number one on the network with $19.2 billion TVL. Curve's TVL grew by 34% for the month of October and its token price reached $4.7, the highest in almost a year. MakerDAO also had a 37.68% TVL growth rate.

The data indicates that the lending market is highly competitive—with picking a favorite for market leader nigh impossible. In other words, now is not the time to put all your eggs in one basket in your DeFi lending play.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Small but numerous chains eat away at Ethereum’s monopoly**

Since its inception, Ethereum held a near monopoly in the public chain space until Binance came onto the scene in February 2021, followed by Terra and Polygon. 

Data from the past month indicate a clear trend towards further fragmentation rather than consolidation. 

Footprint Data shows there are 11 public chains with a TVL growth of more than 100% in the past 30 days. Among them, Tron's growth rate was 1119%, bridging its TVL to $7.6 billion, making it the seventh chain. Other public chains such as Fantom, Arbitrum and Avalanche grew by more than 100%.

The result is that Ethereum’s market share went from 73% in August to 65% in October—and 8% drop in just 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

[Change of Market Share by Public ChainData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/f91tem0v0ix71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfe5c43fbbc8f4288f3556eb959b07dbb5b6fd4e)

# New kids on the crypto block in October

Newly launched chains beat expectations in October.  

The TVL of Secret grew 222% as tightening regulations around public chains make blockchain users refocus on privacy. PriFi—as it’s now called—will soon become the preferred choice for crypto, and Secret, the first Chain with privacy protection, will explode. (At least, so goes the reasoning of the chain’s supporters.) 

Another chain that shouldn’t be ignored is NEAR. While its 86% growth is slow compared to the month’s other breakouts, the chain’s team recently announced a huge $800 million ecosystem development fund to support NEAR-based development projects, institutions and individuals. Aurora, a NEAR-based solution to scale Ethereum dApp projects, also completed a $12 million funding round in October. 

Other public chains such as Sifchain, Harmony, and Celo each had over 200% growth in October and are also noteworthy. Although the new public chains are still nowhere near as popular as the Etherchain, market share continues to divide as they present new use cases and solve problems developers and users face with Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

With the introduction of national policies around crypto in the US, China, Australia and others in September, the market briefly became volatile but a record-breaking October demonstrated we’re still riding the bull for now. 

On a more long-term trajectory, the token price drop and regulations were followed by institutional support and buy-in for blockchain. While controversial amongst blockchain enthusiasts, this has created a perception of reduced market risk among established financial players. Is this the news that banks and investment firms, tired of seeing their returns blown out of the water by crypto traders, were waiting on as their signal to jump in?

3 Minutes to Understand the Next Generation of Defi — the Tokenomics of BEST,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto_newsday/comments/qmzvac/3_minutes_to_understand_the_next_generation_of/,stuffedtoys_me,1,2021-11-05 09:17:11,0,/r/crypto_newsday/comments/qmzvac/3_minutes_to_understand_the_next_generation_of/,defi,"&amp;#x200B;

  
Since Nakamoto pegged PoW to mining, hashrate has become the hard currency in the blockchain world. Users with hashrate have a say and the right to enjoy PoW income, which is the reason why many people flock to it. Bitcoin’s hashrate exceeded 1T for the first time in May 2011 and reached 197 EH/S by May 2021. Ethereum’s hashrate also increased from 150T in early 2020 to 595 TH/S in May 2021.

  
The substantial growth of hashrate confirms the progress made by cryptocurrency which once was favored by a small number of people and now is embraced by the majority. This is also a process in which the mining becomes less popualr. With the continuous expansion of hashrate total volume, the income per unit of hashrate is declining. Miners must form a mining pool to make the income curve smooth. With the continuous increase of mining threshold, it is becoming more difficult for ordinary people to enjoy stable mining income.

  
Behind the expansion of bitcoin’s hashrate is the relentless encirclement and suppression of individual miners.

  


  
One of the important characteristics of cryptocurrency is decentralization. Is there a way to decentralize, so that ordinary users can enjoy the mining income during both the bull and bear market in a simple and stable way?

  
The answer is yes. Even new miners no longer need to choose and purchase mining machines by themselves, neither do they need to bear the high-risk for low-income of cloud hashrate. Through the hashrate token, individual users can avoid all kinds of pitfalls in the participation of mining. Bitcoin and Ethereum Standard Token (“BEST”) is a new generation of hashrate token. It adds Defi to the traditional hashrate token, so that more users can participate in the mining industry.

  
BEST is issued by BESToken Mining. It anchors real Bitcoin mining hashrate and Ethereum mining hashrate. Holding and staking BEST can continuously obtain BTC mining income and ETH mining income. Users can provide liquidity to the market and obtain governance token MUSK through staking BEST. Everyone can easily enjoy the income generated by hashrate + DeFi mining. BEST has not only successfully obtained investments from AU21, Infinity Labs, Hotbit Labs, Oasis Capital, 7 O’Clock Foundation, Crypto Venture Capital, PolkaFund, 4SV, Bondly Finance, KickPad, Red Block Chain and other investors, but also won the favor of the community. For example, the IDO on DuckDAO was snapped up in 30 seconds. The reason that BEST can attract such heated attention and won the favor of capital and the community lies in its unique tokenomics.

  
Economic Efficiency + Governance Strengthening, BEST’s “Dual-Core” Tokenomics.

  
BEST adopts the mode “Dual-Coin”, “Dual-Core” and “Dual-Thread”as its underlying tokenomics, to ensure that the overall operation of the BEST system can achieve both high efficiency and stability, and is more user-friendly. The key to the “Dual-Core”model is the BEST hashrate token and the MUSK governance token. By holding and staking BEST, users can not only obtain BTC and ETH as mining awards, but also obtain the governance token MUSK. It means users can obtain three different tokens through BEST, which is equivalent to three times the return rate of the same asset.

  
BEST integrates the mining right of high-quality cryptocurrency assets and mining capacity into its token “BEST”. Holding BEST is equivalent to holding mining capacity. Users don’t need to consider complex factors such as mine field, platform, cost, operation and maintenance. They only need to stake BEST on the official website DAPP or increase the liquidity of the corresponding trading pairs in the DEXs, then they can continuously obtain the mining incomes.

  
It is the trend of the crypto mining industry to transform hashrate into a more secure and liquid decentralized token through Defi. The mining industry is more technology-intensive and capital-intensive today, therefore the trend mentioned above is more suitable for user participation, because it solved the shortcomings of the traditional cloud hashrate. With the development of BEST ecosystem, holding BEST will get more mining rights of high-quality encrypted assets.

  
Users can obtain multiple benefits through the “BEST +MUSK Dual-Coin” mechanism

  
The total amount of BEST is 5 million, and the initial circulation is 180,000, accounting for only 3.6% of the total amount. The total amount will rise with the increase of the mining machines managed by the team. Each BEST is equal to 0.01t/s hashrate BTC and 0.03m/s hashrate ETH. BEST’s mining hashrate is provided by BESToken Mining. BESToken Mining has mine fields in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Sichuan, and has signed cooperation contracts with local power plants. Users do not need to worry about power sources and compliance issues. BEST also cooperates with F2pool. Its machine has entered F2pool for mining. At present, F2pool is a world-famous bitcoin and Ethereum mining pool with huge hashrate, which can provide users with stable and computable expected revenue curve.

  
BEST will deduct 2.5% BTC and 2% ETH as transaction fee according to F2pool’s standard, and then distribute the remaining income according to the ratio of 7:2:1 at 0:00 (SGT) every day. 70% will be distributed as mining reward to BEST stakers and LP, 20% to repurchase MUSK and burn them, and the remaining 10% as depreciation rate for mining machinery maintenance or renewal.

  
The number of BEST circulating in the market will be counted by day, and the BTC and ETH will be dropped into the mining pool according to hashrate. After deducting the electricity charges and some operation and maintenance costs, the remaining income will be dropped and the smart contract will distribute the income to the beneficiaries, that is, the users who stake BEST on the official website. The whole process is completely open and transparent, and users do not need to conduct cumbersome operation. Staking is mining. Note: users need to bind their own wallet address (BSC) before staking BEST.

  
The total number of MUSK is fixed at 10 million. Its releasing model adopts the deflation tokenomics. The initial output is 30000 / day, which will be reduced by 13% every 30 days until all 10 million MUSKs are produced. The only way to generate MUSK is to continuously provide liquidity for trading pairs as a liquidity provider LP. In the current tokenomics, 75% of the daily output will be allocated to the LP of BEST-BUSD trading pair, and 25% to the LP of MUSK-BUSD trading pair.

  
Users with MUSK have the right to participate in the governance of BEST ecosystem. Besides, the team will also buy back MUSK to support its strong price. 20% of the mining income of BEST will be used to repurchase and burn MUSK. With the continuous growth of the ecosystem, part of the ecosystem income will also be used to repurchase MUSK, to achieve the linear increase of MUSK token value.

  
Users with MUSK can also initiate governance proposals and vote. After the team deploys the smart contract, the token generated will be temporarily stored in the funding pool and gradually distributed to LP through liquidity mining. In addition, the official team will also participate in the LP process and provide MUSK with a value base through repurchase, lending and derivatives. After achieving cooperation with lending platform and other derivative platforms in the future, the team will return the income generated by this way to LP.

  
The “BEST+MUSK Dual-Coin” tokenomics will meet the needs of majority blockchain users. For new users who want to enjoy mining income, BEST can provide them with stable daily income through a simple “holding-staking-benefit” process, without demanding any experience in traditional mining machine. The stable income can be further improved by staking MUSK. Compared with users who purchase cloud hashrate from a third-party website (such as NiceHash), BEST provides a more convenient, secure and decentralized way of cloud hashrate. To sum up, Defi + Hashrate token provide a broader application scenario for BEST.

  
Summary

  
With the strong bull market atmosphere in the cryptocurrency market in 2021, more and more users participate in the market. The more users are attracted, the more the project can expand its own ecology and form a benign cycle. Through the deep cooperation with F2pool, BEST not only realizing the anchoring with real hashrate, but also introduces other hashrate token through the F2pool in the future, which will expand the BEST application scenario and promote price increase. BEST can not only enjoy the price increase brought by the increase of mining income, but also improve the price increase expectation through liquidity mining, etc. The price of hashrate token BTCST has increased over 125 times. Compared with BTCST, BEST adds the anchoring to ETH hashrate, and is accessible on BSC chain. In the future, more assets will be anchored via F2pool.

  
Looking back on the blockchain market in 2014, Matthew Effect still exists.

  
The jaw-dropping increase of Dogecoin, Shibacoin has shocked people both inside and outside the blockchain industry. One of the features of the bull market in the middle and late period is to speculate on worthless tokens. If investors want to win in both the bull and bear market, those who has experienced a complete market cycle will invest BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies with sufficient value recognition. Few people who have experienced the thousands income return of the glorious 2014 and 2017 can survive to 2021. BEST is pegged to BTC and ETH through hashrate. Even in bear market, it can provide motivation for long-term holding and stable income for its holders, let alone the “ Davis Double Play “ of price increase and income increase in bull market. It is hoped that BEST, as a concept project of “Mining + DeFi + NFT”, will push hashrate token to a new height. We believe that the BEST hashrate token will ride the wind and waves in the field of DeFi, and forge ahead!"

“You don’t have to think. You just have to do what I ask for”.. a Sparkies Tale,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/qna4lw/you_dont_have_to_think_you_just_have_to_do_what_i/,OlderSparky,1,2021-11-05 20:33:49,0,/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/qna4lw/you_dont_have_to_think_you_just_have_to_do_what_i/,NaN,"This is tale from the Hospital I did quite a bit of work at, in a rural Australian town I used to live in.

As an electrician who had a few decades of experience in different fields, I came to this town able to pretty much do anything required. Technical skills and a high quality of work, while being cheeky and personable, pretty much let me get away with a lot of shenanigans. I also fixed the General Managers home treadmill early on, so there’s also an element of knowing who to keep happy.

The electrical contractor I came to work with was the largest in the region, did good work for fair prices, and had the big Govt contracts for a lot of infrastructure. I added experience in the more technical and specialist side of the business, so the owner didn’t get too cranky when the times came to slap my wrist.

I relish any opportunities the Universe provides to help people get their Comeuppance Tickets stamped, and am keen as mustard for schadenfreude.    
With that, let me tell you about a bloke who voluntarily brought me much joy.


**”Matt”**    
A standard issue Govt efficiency drive brought Matt to the Hospital in the role of Safety, Security and Compliance Manager. It was a smallish regional Hospital, ~120beds, in a smallish rural Australian town. Until Matt came, these jobs were done by other Managers or Executives as part of other duties. Being a newly created role, it was an absolutely perfect one for someone to come in and be a star.

He came from the Dept of Education in a similar but supervisory role. This was his first Manager gig. Maybe he thought you dealt with Hospitals, Doctors and Nurses the same as you did School Districts and Teachers? It didn’t take long before Matt was politely told that his unsolicited attempts to change clinical (medical) protocols wouldn’t be required. *(Without consulting anyone, he tried to change the way nursing staff handled Scheduled Drugs. I was told that the 13yr veteran Director of Nursing didn’t phrase the message this way. But I can’t write down what she said.)*


**Matt and I**    
From the get-go, I don’t think Matt liked me very much. Every time he tried to make changes that involved anything technical, he was told to check with me to see if it could be done or how much it’d cost. Changes/additions/repurposing to Door access, CCTV, Nurse Call, Security/Duress systems, Matt was directed to me quite a bit. He used to get so annoyed when I told him “No”, or “Yes, but you better check with Finance.” I’m sure he saw me as a stop sign on his road to glory.

He wasn’t a wanker, but he was a proper tool though. One of those people who always has to be right and will talk over you to prove it.

Hand on heart, I tried. In the early days, I tried to get along. Even gave him my direct email and mobile number so he could ask questions, because I knew it was a steep learning curve. I tried, right until he purposefully took some information I gave him out of context, presented it at a planning meeting, and tried throwing me under a bus. 

The little switch inside my head labelled ‘Matt’ flicked from ‘Off’ to ‘Fair Game’.


**Fair Game**    
About 12 weeks later I received an email from the Hospitals Maintenance Manager asking me to see Matt. He wanted access to all the Hospital systems.

Speaking with Matt, he wanted to “Know everything that went on in the property.” It was a nice conversation that I will paraphrase..    
**Matt** - “I need to know everything that goes on here.”    
**Me** - “Well, *everything* is pretty big and a bit vague. Are there..”    
**Matt* - (annoyed) “I want to know, in detail, what goes on across the campus. It’s not hard to understand.”    
**Me** - (not showing that I’m happy Matt is annoyed) “I think maybe going through a list of systems and figuring out which..”    
**Matt** - (smug) “That’s the good thing about this relationship. You don’t have to think. You just have to do what I ask for.”    
**Me** - (outwardly stoic, but inside I was a Happy Little Vegemite) “I guess I’ll get on it then.”

There’s nothing quite like sitting on a veranda at dusk after work, sipping Jacks with Nic Cave softly playing in the background, mindlessly watching the wallabies. Just sitting and most definitely not thinking. About Matt, all the communications gear I had access to, and all the systems and plant in a Hospital campus. And his phone.. that, being a salaried Manager, he couldn’t turn off.

At some point the following day, while brainlessly programming some electronical gear, my “f_ckery filter” kicked in. I went and saw my mate, the regional Govt IT Manager. We had an excellent relationship, so when I asked “hypothetically” just how many emails a Govt staff could receive in a day, they wanted to know what I was up to. After a brief chat, a nod and a wink, I left with some upper limits.

Unrelatedly, Matt’s inbox somehow turned out to be a smidgen larger than other people’s for a while.


**”Sorry to bother you Matt. I’m still unsure what exactly you’re after. If you’d like to know everything that happens, for clarity and transparency in moving forward, we have options to facilitate the merging of communications to effectively bring positive outcomes……”**    
*(What was I thinking! Putting as many buzzword bingo phrases as I could in the pre-amble.)*

It’s very rare that I engage in shenanigans without written CYA. *(Cover Your Ass. A verbal CYA is nice, but a written CYA is golden. A written CYA, worded to give you the protection of a Spartan Phalanx, is to me, a double-dog-dare.)*

The email I sent Matt, asking clarification of “everything”, was 7 pages long. It went into some detail regarding all the different things he could be made aware of, and how. It had bolded categories, italicised sub-headings, bullet points, and very many words. All I asked was for him to choose what he wanted.

For example. He could know when any of the 500+ doors were opened. Or when any of the damper motors in the air conditioning system opened/closed. Or when any of the 150+ CCTV cameras picked up motion. Or constantly know what temperature the boilers were at. Or when any patient pressed a nurse call button. Or the condition status of the medical gas supply. Etc, etc..    
It was a lovely email. Took a whole evening on the veranda just unthinkingly hitting the keyboard.

I don’t think he got past the pre-amble, because his reply was just, “Yes. ASAP.”


**”Can’t stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.”** (Malicious Compliance)    
It was a Tuesday that I was at his office to install his very own 13 character IP Nurse Call Display, with chime speaker. And the CCTV Client PC/monitor, which also had a security/door access client on it. He was very chuffed. He mentioned out loud to himself that no other Manager had these in *their* office. *They* only had the pagers and phones. Like a braindead zombie, I showed him how to use his new toys. *(He did get a bit sad when I wouldn’t give him admin rights. To be honest, looking back, I wouldn’t have given myself full admin rights. Because, shenanigans.)*

An IP Nurse Call System, and a Building Management System, when interfaced with an enterprise level security/door access system has a lot of functionality. If you wanted to, you could single out one Nurse Call display and send it *everything*. Same with mobile phone text messages. And email. The possibilities are joyous.

At 6pm that Tuesday, after sitting on my veranda and double checking the new commands I’d set up, I vacantly looked at my laptop and hit “Apply changes and Save”. 15 minutes later, like a simpleton, I ignored Matt’s first phone call. He ended up leaving 12 voicemails. Each one shorter than the last, and each one increasing in vitriol. He really shouldn’t have sworn so much though. Not in recorded voicemails.

The Maintenance Manager called at about 7pm, saying he’d had an angry Matt call him, demanding cessation. After a friendly chat, he was okay with me looking into the “weird and unexpected” behaviour of the reporting systems in the morning. He was also sick of Matt’s shit.

So, as much as I delighted in his phones’ text messages and email blowing up overnight with *everything*, I left his response pager alone.    
That was ok, because I was excited by what I’d find the next morning at his office.

He wasn’t in his office when I got there, and he’d unplugged the client PC! Shame that. I was looking forward to the rapid beeping announcing camera motion and door activity.    
However, he couldn’t unplug the ceiling mounted nurse call display. Which was going off it’s tits and displaying its heart out.    
*(Boring technical fact, you can set custom tones and durations for the chime speaker for different calls. And if you wanted to, you could make really annoying combinations. If you wanted to.)*

Before I called Matt, I powered up my laptop, had his email reply ready, and then connected to the beepy systems.    
After he arrived with a steadily buzzing phone in hand, and got the whole “What the f_ck did you do” and threats out of his system, I let him clearly see me stopping all the “everything”. His phone stopped buzzing and the display went quiet.

I showed him the email and told him he had double-dog-dared me to do this to him, and things could have been different if he’d only given me direction for what his “everything” meant. Well, this had the opposite effect of mollifying someone. I tried reason and logic, but he wasn’t having a bar of it. He wanted blood. I was half expecting him to throw out a “Respect my authoritah!”

I didn’t want to, but in the end, I agreed that yes, we should bring this to the General Manager. Where I could show my beautifully written attempt to clarify what he meant, and play her the voicemails from last night.

My firm grip on his balls extinguished the fire in his belly and we actually ended up sitting down and going through “everything”. The final list was small and pretty much what I would have logically given him, if he wasn’t a dick about it. He learned a lot about how a Hospital campus functioned that morning.

Because I still had to work with him, before I left, I gave him a very PR sounding “I hope we can work together better in the future” and shook his hand.    
He continued to be a tool for the remainder of his time there, but he was less of a tool to me.

Thank you for reading.

**Everything** - I hear your “Yes, but HOW MANY?” I honestly don’t know. I didn’t check the logs. While testing with my phone/email it was mental. I stupidly started with absolutely everything I could get my sticky fingers to make report. And had to stop it after about a minute. Refining the parameters, I settled on 1 email/text about every 10 seconds. So maybe ~4000 in 12hrs?"
Just regarding some or one of the dog-coins I have found a very humbling group of people and I judged early. Don’t judge.. learning curve and wanted to get of my chest big post,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qna6kb/just_regarding_some_or_one_of_the_dogcoins_i_have/,SpaceFaceMistake,1,2021-11-05 20:36:59,6,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qna6kb/just_regarding_some_or_one_of_the_dogcoins_i_have/,ANECDOTAL,"Sorry if this post gets a little off topic at points I have removed a bunch of text already. It’s all relevant to some extent I’m just also high asf on edibles.

Basically it started back with the first big dog-coin that went up to 0.78 ATH but I was more interacted and I didn’t buy into it at all then. I didn’t judge anyone there. But I noticed many did and or hated on it. I thought thats people. They all have opinions. So then said dog-coin dropped and I was glad I didn’t buy in at $0.60+ as I completed it while the hype was rife. 

So I kind of left the area and space of dog-coin main and I went and continued learning and finding gems from iotex that I had largest blow up in my crypto journey with a small volume jumping 200% in a day yesterday before I moved or exchanged to a more stable growth coin being Axie before i plan to put it back on iotex after its dip is over or towards its end I’m guessing mid December before it picks up in January or February with steady growth. 

Then today and over last 2 weeks or a month I’ve followed Shiba Inu more and more. I decided I had to get in on it to check just for fun if it would slam down or go up. To my expectation it went up. It grew 70%~ in 24 hours. I should have exchange it to a stable at this point yesterday or day before. Anyway it went down to around 10%  gain. I saw the chart and it’s gone down past my buy in now so I made right call. All be it $ not being a huge amount and I mean that coming from a relatively poor lifestyle. So I do understand a dollars value and I know how to be savvy so I simply exchange coins I now have to coins that are going up or about to from coins that are up and about to drop. My balance has doubled over 3 months. The exchanges have all been around 1%-5% of total assets held. 

Sorry dragging on my story…

I have followed shiba and I have seen it’s possibilitys. It’s that the hate is so bad. I was in a large Twitter space where you can have group conversations live. It was a shiba chat but there was a heap of good knowledge on just crypto and the world of tech that honestly was really good to hear others expressing what I wanted to hear or wanted to have confirmed to things I never thought I would have found out.

I judged shiba a few months back. I made claims against it and I was wrong. I take it all back it wasn’t alot but it wasn’t needed.

i didn’t know then that it was actually community project. If there are people who are trying to make scams or take advantage and that’s a reason your hating or angry that happens on every edge on the internet. 

It’s that when people buy in at bad times or the wrong time or a time that they didn’t see happening or the prediction said otherwise then their emotions take over and before they know it they are really upset and saying things they wish they didn’t. 

These meme coins or dog-coins or whatever you want to call them. They aren’t going away. It’s actually going to bring a lot of finance into the third world country’s than really need it. Those that are going to garbage deports to get plastic or cans to feed their family every day. To the people in Africa taking mostly empty carcasses from meat trucks that park and open up their truck for those who have no food to salvage any meat they can.

These are the people I really hope benefit from any cryptocurrency projects. NOT so much the capitalist developers that sure we are ALL capitalists using Reddit. If you own a phone your capitalist.

I’m looking at purchasing a small tractor for snow removal and lawn care in my yard. 

The purchase price is 25 000$ for a new one, they really keep their value 20-year-old tractors sell for 10 000+$

I need (not so much a want, don’t get me wrong I like the tractor) the piece of equipment as I have not been able to find snow blower that would come close to meet my snow removal needs and I need a new lawn tractor. I used to hire out the snow removal, but I can no longer find anyone willing to take the job. And my lawn tractor hasn’t been functional for the past 2 years (I got it running but I’m constantly working on it) 

I can afford buying it cash, but I have a line of credit at 4.5%, I believe I’ll put 7000 down and finance the rest 18 000$.  

I guess what I’m asking is life threw me a curve ball by not being able to find a contractor and winter is coming and I\`m going to have a large unexpected expense that is going to slow down my FI goals. 

What would you guys do in my situation?"

Crypto101: What are Crypto Bonds ?

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

 

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

**TLDR**:Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater. 

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

How we became a leader in the NFT industry. 💥,https://www.reddit.com/r/blockchain_newstoday/comments/qnod4x/how_we_became_a_leader_in_the_nft_industry/,Frank_Up,1,2021-11-06 08:14:24,0,/r/blockchain_newstoday/comments/qnod4x/how_we_became_a_leader_in_the_nft_industry/,blockchain,"&amp;#x200B;

  


  
Despite the numerous benefits of using blockchain technology, the biggest problem with blockchain is the steep learning curve. That’s why we built our easy-to-use developer products to bring blockchain to the masses.

  
With our first tool, digital wallets, we helped leading blockchain gaming projects (like The Sandbox) onboard more than 200k users already.

  
A few months back we launched a leading user-friendly NFT marketplace as if it’s a traditional P2P market, and recently we started helping classic gaming and e-commerce businesses create and sell digital assets with our NFT tools and Market APIs.

  


  
What is Venly

  
Venly was founded in 2018 as Arkane Network and is a blockchain tech provider focussing on 3 main products:

  
Venly Wallets: with our wallet services we help blockchain projects onboard their users by providing blockchain agnostic wallets.Venly Market and APIs: the Venly Market is a peer-to-peer NFT marketplace. With our Market APIs projects are able to build an NFT marketplace backed by our technology.Venly NFT Tools: the right tools to build fast and securely. From minting tools to a complete asset management system for Unity or webshop plugins to scale fast.

  
Partners and clients

  
With Venly we tend to focus on the gaming industry and everything related to it, metaverses, sports, game art, avatars etc. Today we service +100 projects and have partnered with Polygon, Binance, Avalanche and Hedera as preferred tech providers. Our main clients are projects like The Sandbox, Aavegotchi, Battle Racers, IOI Trade Race Manager, Ethermon, Neon District, Cryptopick, AMPnet and many others.

  
\+€2M in funding

  
Beginning of April, Venly closed a €1.55M seed round led by High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF). DM-BB David Majert, Palentine Ventures (Blockrocket), imec.istart Fund and PMV joined the round.Venly recently added Tioga Capital to its list of investors with an additional €500k funding, bringing the total of +2M€ in funding to continue its growth and setup a branch in Berlin.

  
Roadmap

  
As a blockchain agnostic tech provider, we’ll continue adding support for new blockchains to our Wallet and Market products. In the coming months we will focus on our Market APIs and USDC launch. As for our NFT Tools, we’re working on adding new tools and supporting tools built by you. You can apply here. Product updates will also be shared frequently from now on, like this one.

  
On our marketing roadmap we’ll invest more time growing our community of users. We’ll be seeking feedback on our products but also on the projects we support. We will organise NFT missions and exclusive drops with our partners later this year and will set up a dedicated Discord Server to reach you more (more info about this soon).

  


  
Brand NFT

  
To celebrate the rebranding, we created a few NFTs of our old and new logo for fun. You’ll be able to purchase these collector items on our Venly Market very soon. The holders of those NFTs might get rewarded in the future, but for now it’s just for the fun of collecting 🎉.

  
Shop your on [https://venly.market](https://venly.market)

  
Team

  
In the past few months 3 hires have already joined the team. Nico as VP engineering, Jeffrey as Finance Controller and myself, Yan, as CMO of Venly. We’re currently looking for extra Front-End engineers, Analysts as well as a Community Manager and Business Developers. More info on our career page.

  
Thanks for reading, looking forward to reaching the next milestone together!

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.

* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.
* I can also be available to tutor students for Fall 2021 | Spring 2022 | Summer 2022 semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.
* I can also be available to tutor students for Fall 2021 | Spring 2022 | Summer 2022 semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROOF OF MY EXPERTISE IN ACADEMIC WORK:**

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.
* I can also be available to tutor students for Fall 2021 | Spring 2022 | Summer 2022 semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE OF EXPERTISE:**

* I am very knowledgeable and well-versed in a wide range of educational software to tutor students in including but not limited to: Acellus | ALEKS |APEX Learning | Aplia | Blackboard | Brightspace | Canvas | Cengage | CengageNow | Childmsath | Connect | ConnectMath | Connexus | Crowdmark | CPM | D2L | Discord | Edmentum | Eviews | Examity | Excel | Gradescope | Hawkes Learning | Honorlock | Khan Academy | Knewton | LimeSpring | Lumen | Maple | MasteringChemistry | MasteringPhysics | MathXL (XL) | MATLAB | McGraw-Hill | Microsoft Word | Minitab | Moodle | MyAccountingLab | MyEconLab | MyITLab | MyLab | My Lab | MyMathLab | My Math Lab | MyOpenMath | MyPsychLab | MySocLab | MyStatLab | My Stat Lab | NCSS | Open Source Software | Pearson | PERT | PlatoWeb | PowerPoint | Prezi | R | Respondus Lockdown Browser with Webcam | Sapling | SPSS | Stata | StraighterLine | Straighter Line | WebAssign | Web Assign |Webex (Cisco) | WebWork | Wiley | WileyPlus | Wonderlic | Zoom

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**
* Also, you do **NOT** have to answer any questions that you don’t feel comfortable answering. Please feel free to answer only the questions you’re comfortable with.

* I can stretch out the time to a plausible length for timed exams and assignments before submitting them.
* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.
* I can also provide, upon request, complete detailed calculations with explanations for solutions to the problems worked on.

* I can provide more screenshots upon request:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.
* By doing so, it would allow to have more detailed info about the class to help me determine if I can be available to help you as well as a fair price for my services.
* **I promise you that ANY &amp; ALL information provided on the form will be held in the STRICTEST level confidence regardless of whether or not you decide to go with my services.**

* Have reliable software that can change my IP address to match the closest major city near the student.
* I have exceptional multiple-choice exam-taking skills. I have mastered the various techniques to make calculated guesses for the correct option in standardized exams such as the SAT &amp; GRE.

&amp;#x200B;

**I CAN VERIFY MY ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE &amp; SKILLS:**

* I have no problem with requests to solve sample problems upfront to prove my knowledge &amp; proficiency of the course concepts.
* I can provide glowing references &amp; strong examples of work done for past clients to verify my academic skills.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.

* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag\_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_49nV1g-W4TfgsbAV7eLX5Ag_ND8RBfc?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.
* I have received a complete American education from an NJ Elementary School, an NJ middle school, an NJ high school, and 2 NJ universities.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.
* Text messages and email are the fastest and easiest ways to get in touch with me. However, I gladly accept phone calls.
* If I don't respond right away, I am most likely helping a student at the time and not currently available to speak on the phone. But I always make a solid effort to reply to texts, emails, and phone calls within an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ONLINE TUTORING HELP QUESTIONNAIRES:**

* If you are 90-100% positive that you would like to move forward with me helping you with your online class or exam, you can fill out either the ""**Exam Help Request Form""** if you need help with just an exam or the ""**Online Class Help Request Form**"" if you need help with the entire course as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE PAID ACCESS TO OVER 15 STUDY-HELP WEBSITES AND MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE:**

* I have multiple paid subscriptions to a wide range of academic tutoring resources, including Chegg, Quizlet, CourseHero, Brainly, Grammarly, Study.com, Bartleby, Slader, Transtutors, Slideshare, StudocU, Turnitin, Academia, SymboLab, WolframAlpha, and Scribd to help guide to solve exam &amp; homework questions that I may not immediately know.
* However, I am smart enough not to blatantly plagiarize solutions online but instead write them in my own unique words, formatting, &amp; mathematical terminology.
* I have access to a very sophisticated graphing calculator and various mathematical software that provides step-by-step solutions to complex mathematical problems within seconds, allowing me to provide exact solutions to the student in a timely manner.
* I have impeccable handwriting and a high-quality mobile scanner app that allows me to scan written solutions in very legible high-definition JPG, PNG, or PDF formats.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.
* I am half Irish, half Italian, but 100% American.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have an authentic suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* However, be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy.
* These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW TO CONTACT ME:**

* If you are interested in my services and would like to learn more info, please feel free to reach out to me.

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.
* Unlike some alleged “U.S.-based tutors,” I do NOT write using broken English or grammatically incorrect texting shorthand (example: ""wut u need help wit??"").
* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call my phone number and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always try to speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using any obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, C U Next Tuesday, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY AVAILABILITY &amp; RELIABILITY:**

* Depending on my availability, I can accommodate immediate tutoring requests, 1-24 hour, and 1-30-day deadlines.
* I can schedule live real-time online sessions and meet deadlines in an impressively timely fashion.
* I can provide quick notifications and updates of progress made in the student's class via email | text | phone calls.
* I can also be available to tutor students for Fall 2021 | Spring 2022 | Summer 2022 semesters.

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.

If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

Newish still wanted to come by this sub and drop some details on my experience with Reddit and why I will continue to use Reddit and what I used to do and why r/rules are good!,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/qnw96e/newish_still_wanted_to_come_by_this_sub_and_drop/,SpaceFaceMistake,1,2021-11-06 16:45:38,5,/r/NewToReddit/comments/qnw96e/newish_still_wanted_to_come_by_this_sub_and_drop/,I'm Brand New To Reddit! :cake:,"TLTR: Yes this is the TLDR there is a lot of words in this post today! 
I love Reddit. 
What I did before social media and reddit and how I learned digital marketing.
selling on eBay. Now following the cryptocurrency and other financial markets, blockchain  technology and computer science, economics, business management, accounting and much more.
Humbled to be apart of Reddit and wish I had started earlier!  Also the Reddit rules and sub rules along with moderation that makes for what I see to be the next biggest social media platform. 
Onto me, my experiences and how the reddit &amp; Sub r/rules plus r/reddiquette make these subreddit spaces fresh and welcoming. 
Not many users want to or try to break the rules here. 
What subs I hang out the most in being economics, science, technology, cryptocurrency, future, space, life moments, comedy, memes, interesting things, Ask Reddit and many more.


First and foremost hello to anyone reading  and thanks for taking the time to say hi and or read this!

#MyRedditHistory
So a bit on how my Reddit use started and when. Initially I used Reddit over its life time but namely over the last 5-7 years but only commented on extremely rarely occasions and had never made any posts until maybe a year ago and was likely posted in the wrong or not the best suited group. Anyway now I post daily but I don’t post just to post. I only post things links or text or videos that are worth the post and or aren’t posted already on Reddit and or things that are going to contribute to the community in a positive way. That’s the one main thing I ask before I post  is “will this post contribute good or bad things” if it’s not all good or is some negativity that isn’t needed I likely won’t post it.

So using Reddit for answers or clarification on questions I asked search engines to find conclusive evidence and or to back up what answers I found. So that was good but I never became involved in the discussion/s. I used it for answers or Atleast supporting evidence. Now however over the last 4~ odd months but more so the last 2 months, I’ve been familiarising myself with Reddit and the community’s I have become apart of. Namely to familiarise myself with the content in the groups I am interested in and or want to see or be apart of.

 #RedditRules #Reddiquette #SubRules
Now though it’s just been a nice easy learning curve on how and what Reddit is mostly used for and what Reddit rules there are and the individual sub rules when you or I join any sub it will have its own rules. Then it’s reviewing Reddit rules reddiquette and sub rules when I need to or I think I’m wrong but not entirely sure. Also to check if others are violating the rules if I see something bad and I will just tell them so they can change it or remove it and if not then I leave it unless it’s bad stuff I’ll report like anyone should for things like racism or promoting violence or links to heaps of advertising or affiliate links or ad walls or Hating on someone or trying to get mass upvotes or downvotes or karma or other awards etc by manipulating the system from a third party place  organising to have your say Facebook group upvote every post anyone in the group posts with the group at 10k people many times getting 1k+ karma per post and or even comments. This isn’t good but it’s around. It’s not going to be for long or they already have code that will pickup if it’s the same people or accounts voting on the same persons or the same posts all of the time or even flat odd times the algorithms will pick up the people voting on the same things that are being fake up voted or do so as a part of a group outside of Reddit but that all have Reddit accounts. Just one example..  still even then if I found this out or saw it I’d report it yet but I am not a mod nor do I try to be a mod nor try to police Reddit. 

I have found that reading r/rules and the r/Reddiquette section several time now simply to keep on top of the rules and not get banned or have offences against my account. To be a smart thing to do and I recommend it to anyone nee and or old. Especially if you have a Reddit Vault you don’t want to stop being able tp collect Reddit Moons or FortnightBR and any other new to be released coins or tokens on the blockchain that can be earned on Reddit.

IF you haven’t read the r/reddiquette section or you cant remember when you last read, its  advised to go over it again every now and then. Basically reddiquette is a guideline for things outside of the main Reddit rules. Which is also advised to go over the main Reddit r/rules from time to time. I’m saying this as I want others new or not to be informed so those or anyone reading this can share this and or remind others to do so and know yourself what Reddit’s website/forum/social medium is for and what it is not for so you don’t get banned from subs or get penalty points or anything bad against your account.

This is even more true to those who have a vault and collect Reddit moons and or FortnightBR or any new or to be release coins or tokens that will be connected to the Reddit vault in future. This also leads me to the next part of what I came here to talk about and that’s namely why or the reason I have now been using Reddit daily or most days for news to general discussions to insider knowledge and or guides to entertainment like Memes and jokes and videos to awesome and amazing videos or story’s etc. 

The main reason I have started to use Reddit much more as I was well and truly over Facebook and really I like to type. It’s a hobby and a passion at times. So Reddit caters much more for writers and those who want or like to express themselves in writing. Still if it wasn’t for the Cryptocurrency and the Vault system and Reddit Moons I would not be here as active as I am. This is just the truth. Sure I may actually use it for the subjects and subs that have info on cryptocurrency and finacial markets and any sub Reddit groups I’m in now. But really the vault and the knowing I would earn some moons even a small amount, it was an incentive to get involved. That’s more why I began using Reddit and found out how much I actually like it for what it is regardless of Reddit Moon earning’s for participating on Reddit. 

#Cryptocurrency #Moons
Basically I’ve been quite involved now for 2 years in cryptocurrency and mostly I’ve been just studying and learning about it and blockchain technology decentralised finance and exchanges and other business models like dapps and also centralised crypto. I have also learned more on economics than I did in senior school. I learned a hell of a lot more on business management that in senior school same for accounting &amp; finance all of those 3 subjects I chose for my 2 final senior years. Which I learned a lot for the time I learned it with little knowledge but it didn’t serve my until more recently being over 10 years post school. 

I began 5 years ago with eBay and selling bits and bobs for a small profit. It started with items I owned or pre owned goods. Then I saved the money earned and would go buy items from opportunity shops that were vintage and often cost no more than $1-$30 depending on what it was. Mostly I was buying vintage or near antique goods. Mostly small items and not furniture rather jewellery to old records but mostly it was pottery and China or vases and decorative plates or tea sets to Crystal glasses but mostly crystal items or animals or figures of things like a guitar or whatever it was. They always sold quick for not a huge profit but enough. 

Anyway I continued and started to then buy items from wholesalers most came from China but some was made here locally. For things like tempered glass screen protectors that require a small and not as expensive 3D printer they can be made anywhere for a minimal price and also made for new releases before they arrive from company specs on the screen or make them when you can get the screens sizes and dimensions perfect and can sell in a few days or hours of the phones launch which is one of the first things buys of smart phones buy as well as a case if they don’t buy it at the phone shop or it doesn’t come with it. 

So selling on eBay (before corporations were all there like today) really opened my mind to digital marketing and marketing via social media and I found I could market my listings organically and pay nothing but my time and effort and have much greater turnover. Mind you it was a tiny store selling under the max 40 free listings a month. But it was close to maxing that limit some months. This venture or side hustle went on for 16 months but only had good amount of sales in the first 8 months of those 16 before I stopped buying or re stocking. Which were now new items that came from wholesalers and not from opportunity shops or garage sales and that (which is still a great way to make money and anyone can do it) but basically I stopped buying what I was selling the most of. Being lots of Lord of the Ring replica engraved rings that were a nearly a daily sell, also a near daily sale and had many bulk orders for iPhone 6-7 plus Tempered glass 9H good quality screen protectors for the latest iPhones and also stopped getting the phone covers and cases for the latest iPhone and Samsung smartphone models at the time.

Learning the sales side was easy and managing orders and customers easy. The digital marketing that I learned after I started to boost my traffic namely that was and still us something I am learning today. But I understand the core parts of digital marketing which is mostly SEO, email marketing, social media marketing, social media campaigns and setting up payed advertising, wringing content, website development(light or heavy skilled), business deployment for offline businesses and a few others. They are all what anyone who is looking at any kind of online business or have a business they want to grow online it will help you so much in fact you may be able to save money on hiring those that do the jobs you will be able to in a few months learning and trial and putting to action what you learn. 

So this took me up until today where over the last 2 years I’ve been involved in learning cryptocurrency and the technology’s behind them and also the modes of business to the people who trade it every day and those who have done since Bitcoins release in 2009. Like I knew about Bitcoin as many did or most did. We all heard of the digital internet money that was a “scam” and even today I have family who say any crypto and Bitcoin is all a scam saying that “where is the value? A company stock has $ value and physical value this bitcoins have no value!” And I’m just like yep we will agree to disagree. Especially when I am not one to argue nor to try and pursued someone into believing something that I believe. Since I’m agnostic for religion and beliefs in general. I don’t push my opinions or beliefs on others and I would expect the same from anyone else. In that I don’t want to have beliefs of anything be it a religion or a event like moon landing or theory’s like flat earth or anything that has no argument sake to learn from having a debate and or something that is wifey knows as being debunked or the truth is known. 

The only thing that can be hard to judge is religion and say god. I understand what most or some see as god. But I don’t see it the same way. I see it as a means to say or understand what everything in its entirety within our universe and of which is not scientifically proven like how large the universe is or it’s exact or the Big Bang and when or how and why and what was before it and then what was before that event or place in time and space.

I don’t want to keep going and I actually just removed 4 large text bodies to keep this post some what readable! Sorry if it’s tooo long.


Still it’s been a pleasure to be involved in this sub and the many subs I have become involved in. I hope to meet many more of you amazing people across the world and grow even larger connections."
[F4A] Enslaved By A God Among Men At First Sight,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/qo5mff/f4a_enslaved_by_a_god_among_men_at_first_sight/,plastixfantastic,1,2021-11-07 01:59:35,0,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/qo5mff/f4a_enslaved_by_a_god_among_men_at_first_sight/,NaN,"""Will you marry me?""

He's finally proposing. I've been dropping hints for *months*. I'm ready, and I won't find anyone better. Sergei works in finance and could probably afford to buy the very nice restaurant we're in. He's confident yet kind, and he keeps himself in very good shape through daily visits to the gym. He's generous, and he wants to give me the best life he can. The life I *deserve.*

Yes, I love him, but I love myself more. Don't roll your eyes. Anyone would be in love with themselves too if you looked in the mirror at *me* every day. Flawless, milky porcelain skin. Wide, piercing doe eyes. soft, elegant lips with the perfect cupid's arrow. Elongated, graceful limbs. 

And on top of my genetic superiority, I actually have self control, unlike most pigs these days. Kate Moss once said, ""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels,"" and I live by that. I simply don't have a BMI. Oops, where did it go? every curve on my almost-supermodel body is fat free. I have upper-class, teardrop-shaped breasts, the petitest of waists, and the hips of a world-class ballerina with the cavernous thigh gap to match.

And my legs. Slender, luminously smooth ivory towers that would look like stilts on a lesser woman, but just affirm my love for myself. I wear Givenchy. I wear Dolce. I wear Prada. I don't even care to look at anything less.

I'm about to accept him when the doors open, and *You* walk through. I'm rendered speechless mid-yes. Time slows down to a crawl, and I can't remember what Sergei was talking about. You're a mountain of a man. A slab of pure granite. Your imperious, disdainful scowl calls to me. You're so incandescently magnetic that at first I don't notice that the two women hanging on your arms look like Victoria's Secret models. No, wait, they *are* Victoria's Secret models. Some of the most famous women in the world.

""Would you excuse me for a moment?"" I asked, leaving a shocked Sergei and stalking towards You. I circle you, nostrils flaring as I take in your overwhelming musk, barely hiding what I'm doing. By the time I'm finished inhaling, I feel myself changing. Just being in your presence perfects my almost-perfect genetics. Skin purer. Breasts fuller. Hair raven black and in a high, silky pony. Waist so thin you could practically fit two hands around it.

My jet black dress leaves nothing to the imagination, and my razor-sharp stiletto boots reach to my thighs. Was I wearing this before? Who cares? I take your hand, more in love with someone else than I am with myself for the first time in my life.

""Right this way, *Daddy.*""

Sergei is terrified. He looks weakened. Frail, even. He's getting wrinkles. I feel myself feeding on his suffering. ""Up, servant,"" I sneer at him, snapping my fingers. ""Take my God's order.""

I'm in your lap faster than lightning, my long, graceful, almost alien-like fingers unzipping your pants and lazily stroking the mammoth trunk I knew I would find there. I was so instantly enslaved by you body, mind, and soul. And yet I know this is only the beginning."

I am sharing my thoughts on my farming strategy and the direction I want to take next. Feel free to ask me any question or to share your thoughts, other perspectives are often helpful

Overall strategy:

*  I have been farming ftm since July and I decided to put most of my coins in the ecosytem at the end of August. I have been keeping and compounding all my ecosystem token as my first take was that ftm would overperform all other ecosystems in september and october. I am still very bullish in the ftm ecosystem but I am starting to take profits. I don't plan to rotate my main investments in the short term but I am considering bridging some assets to other ecosystems over the upcoming weeks.

Classic ecosystem farms: 

* Spooky: I am in BTC-FTM, ETH-FTM,BTC-ETH. My strategy is still to only accumulate BOO and stake xBOO as I feel this is undervalued. The APR's are not the highest but these are all pairs that I just plan to hold for the long term
* Spirit: I am in BTC-FTM and ETH-FTM boosted farms as well as FTM-MIM ""regular farm"". This week I reached my first target of locked inSpirit tokens, so I locked only half of my Spirit farmed in inSpirit and sold the other half to deleverage my position on abracadabra. I love Spirit, but I feel its short term potential is lesser than boo.
* Curve: Just letting my RenBTC compound as well as increasing my 2pool (Dai+usdc) position with other farming proceeds. 2pool will serve as a ""buy the dip fund"" + pay my taxes fund

Slightly degen:

* Tarot: I like to keep the pairs that pay a great APR on Tarot (CRV-FTM and TAROT-FTM). I am however reconsidering keeping my ETH-FTM in this farm because the APR dropped and because leveraged yield farming is higher maintenance than simple LP yield farming. I am eagerly awaiting for xTarot to drop because the Tarot token needs to have new utilities to stop its inflationary drop. Tarot is a great project with great synergies with other projects but the token is currently mostly a farming token.
* Tomb finance: this is the place to be. My holdings lost pretty much all their value because of the hack (late august / early spetember). But I held all my tokens, first as memorabilia of a great project and community. Then Harry took over and this has become by far my highest earning project. I feel tomb is just getting started (CEX announcement with binance being the most exciting news). I am compounding most of my farming proceeds as my thirt for tomb and tshares is unquenchable. I force my self to take a slight percentage of my proceeds out to build my ETH and stablecoins positions. 

Other farms I am in: 

* abracadabra: I am slowly deleveraging the wftm position I deposited as I plan to convert it to a yvWFTM deposit to earn interest. This is turning to be a well timed leverage and I deposited as I borrowed MIM to buy MIM-FTM lp's on spirit when ftm was around 1.20$. This as provided me with a nice spirit income while my LP gained good value.
* I am also in scream, beethoven x, reaper, geist, abracadabra... but not much going on with these

Farms I will evaluate next: 

* summit defi: looks like a fun mix of farming and gambling
* coffin finance: algo stablecoin always tempts my inner degen"
GME or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Algo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qosm4h/gme_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love/,killmeandeatme,1,2021-11-08 00:57:45,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qosm4h/gme_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love/,DD,"# Intro

Okay  fellow degenerates, my nose is three crayons deep and it’s time you all  get educated about the only thing that matters in the world of finance,  graph functions. Naked shorts, synthetic CDOs, shorted ETF baskets; all  of it is just fancy words for “fucking with the graph”. So how do they  fuck the graph, how have they been fucking GME, and how did they get  fucked so bad by GME? Strap in, lube up, we’re going deep.

# Assumptions

Couple of assumptions we’re gonna run through, get ready stuffs about to get nutty.

&gt;A single function is responsible for the output, of which, every price graph in all speculative markets is made of.

None  of this Bollinger bands, Elliot waves, Fibonacci numbers. They’re all  gesturing to the actual function, but they’re like trying to guess  someones eye color from their shoe size. It is one single function  running since time immemorial and it applies to every asset. Currency, stocks, pokemon cards, housing, everything.

&gt;The function is cyclical.

The  function runs repeatedly, with no gaps or bridging patterns. It’s first  and last stage of the cycle directly feed into each other, and it  continues for as long as the asset is tradable.

&gt;The function is graphable and deterministic.

The  function always produces the same kinds of graphs without question or  exception. And the pattern of the function is (mostly) deterministic.  Occasionally rare outside events that couldn’t be predicted, like the  planet of the apes finding a working Bloomberg terminal, affect the size  or length of the graph, but the basic shape and cyclical nature doesn’t  change.

&gt;The hedgefunds are aware of it, have influence but not control of it, and plan all actions with it in mind.

Your  Monday coin surge, the post earnings slump, the fuckery we’ve all  come to grow and love is all a result of hedgefund influence via the  financial and criminal mechanisms available to them. But they can’t  directly control the graph, otherwise we wouldn’t still be here to drink  salty hedgie tears when MOASS, only influence it.

&gt;The market is always in equilibrium due to massive amounts of liquidity and sub second high frequency trading

As  sacrilege as it sounds, the price is always right. On assets with low  liquidity infrequently traded, the shape of the graph is less clear, but  the speculative assets hedgies wine and dine in have such massive  liquidity, and volume of activity, the shape of the graph is clearly  defined. Picture a square. As you add more and more sides, such that  they’re all equal length, the shape becomes more round. As you approach  infinite sides, the square becomes a circle.

Now that we have that out of the way, lets dig in.

# The General Market Equilibrium curve

&amp;#x200B;

[Ain't she a beaut?](https://preview.redd.it/4m75ov5yc7y71.jpg?width=2227&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7bbbf6a7968654207b0074b6579c0e8a0c459b5)

Presenting  the General Market Equilibrium Curve, or GME Curve. This graph is the  shape of every blue chip, moonshot, etf, or meme stock you’ve  ever touched. Look familiar? Maybe you’ve seen some of her sisters:

Okay  I know you apes like pictures, but I don’t trust you for a second to be  smooth brained enough to know what you’re seeing without mommy here to  spoonfeed it to you. How does thing thing work?

# The 9 Steps

[The Build Up](https://preview.redd.it/y8kk113jd7y71.jpg?width=1467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f89b429cac7132288d0ce373c5ed41097956b1d)

We  start with the build up. Hedgies need retail’s money, so how do they  get it? We take our asset and we slowly increase the price up to a high,  then once we have bagholders, we have the price sink to the original  level, occasionally lower, so that retail “cut their losses” and Wall  street pockets the difference. Once we’ve reached max loss cutting  without there being panic sells, we start to rebound and build up some  fast momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Climax](https://preview.redd.it/dfi9etmkd7y71.jpg?width=1552&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398c04157e7d460cabfdf7864f5a88ffc34b9c12)

I  love this guy! You got your January sneeze, your crytomoon shots, your  current day inflation rates. Number go up, and fast. Stock go eeeeeeee.  We get some nice spike ups, with small pockets of profit taking and stop  loss hunting before we peak and climax.

[Post-nut Clarity](https://preview.redd.it/uqrnp35md7y71.jpg?width=1521&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcba2144b2eea3df69bbc6584dab05992886a3b1)

After  we climax the price comes to its senses, it can’t possibly go this high  or higher, and falls right down into a nice bull trap. People panic  sell, right into the next spike up because this is only the next leg of  the moon shot right?! This right here is where bulls hopes and dreams  are trapped and left to die.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Beer Goggles, they do nothing](https://preview.redd.it/vjiwmoxod7y71.jpg?width=1273&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6eb891e63f50535b26488145add2524d4449f7a)

Look,  we’ve all had that sobering morning after bringing home some cute  asset with a dog in it, next thing you know you’re on the wrong side of  a crash of a massive market cap asset with no utility or long term  prospects. This were we reach peak profit realisation from the Hedgies  and crash the price into the earth, retail be damned.

[The Rebound; Is it too late to love again?](https://preview.redd.it/gix2f8wpd7y71.jpg?width=1973&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74095f46fbebd67912cb75f28d4bc36066712e40)

&amp;#x200B;

But  hey we’re breaking out of the crash! Slowly and steadily even, maybe  this thing has legs. Maybe we can make it work. I could start a garage  hedge fund and day trade, I’ll just sell the car for the initial  capital. She can raise the kids, I’m sure mom would love her. What could  go wrong?

[Hopes dashed](https://preview.redd.it/bzhnxvvsd7y71.jpg?width=1477&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa73953c71e9676ea0ff71afe730f81d3df0cb7)

Or  maybe it’s just a shit stock and the time has passed, we slide faster  down than we did up into our lowest point of this cycle and shake off  the last of the damn dirty apes holding onto the roller coaster. This  stage repeats an additional time, just in case you didn’t learn your  lesson any of the previous times you absolute madlad.

[Log Hits The Spring](https://preview.redd.it/s35kowbud7y71.jpg?width=2195&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32c48a782c5d1c931c1f1d3354b12f014bcafb5c)

Oh  hang on? What’s this? We’re rebounding a little off the floor of the  cycle. Can’t have a bull trap without a bear trap to counter it now can  you?  This spring is building up the momentum of a log falling on a  trampoline before flying into low orbit. All hands on deck. Hedgies  prepare for profit.

[This shits got nuts](https://preview.redd.it/vl6yvs2wd7y71.jpg?width=2041&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b949bbab7f5f44f890a079238cf88b89121d2de0)

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing  some nice spikes in price up, good solid gains. Just enough to get  retail to fomo back in before they miss the boat, because we all know  what’s coming next.

[FLY ME TO THE MOON](https://preview.redd.it/dw4w1s00e7y71.jpg?width=1809&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f8f58389d184a50c15ab454b19697024d0fd5b)

She’s back baby! MOASS MOON ad infinitum. Here’s where we go peak fomo as  repeat the cycle again, and again, until the world burns from the hot  flushed faces of squeaky faced college students experiencing their first  hit of gambling addiction.

Put it all together and what do you got? A highly predictable pattern with  numerous built in opportunities for peak profit taking, followed by  dirty cheap consolidation, ready to go again tomorrow night. Who needs  the philosopher's stone when you can buy gold at fire sale prices, if  you just wait for the next bear trap in the cycle that you know is both  guaranteed, and within a predictable timeframe.

Now  I can hear the comments already, thanks again to copious amounts of  crayon sniffing. This can’t possibly account for every graph? What about  the time scales, or all the missed dates, or cycles that have been  proposed and debunked? I’m glad you asked imaginary ape I created to ask  me questions to transition me between rants. None of that matters! And  why don’t they matter? Simple:

We now resume our regular shitposting

# Fractals

As any of you psychedelic abusers are sure to know nature loves a good fractal. Your Romanesco Broccoli, your river deltas, your dendritic copper crystals. Fractals are everywhere, because math is everywhere. No matter how far you zoom in or out, the patterns always the same, and infinite. And guess what? The stock market is no exception. The GME curve is itself a fractal. It repeats all the way to the all time chart, and all the way down to the sub second. The graph is built into itself. Which is very handy if you’re trying to go long, or short, assets over the course of years, while also high frequency trading ahead of retail’s order flow at the sub second level.

Now it’s all well and good to say it’s a fractal, but we need the deets. So lets deets.

## 3 cycle pattern

[The Tricycle Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/q52cs9llf7y71.jpg?width=1305&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d8592cf5521168d5fa195d9be52521c5b0faf9)

Each cycle is made of a tricycle at the next level of magnification down. The first instance of the subcycle is the tallest in price range and the quickest in time. This is the smash and grab that gets your best profit. The second cycle is the goldilocks of being just normal looking as to avoid suspicion. The highers are lower, and the lows are higher. Finally we have the third cycle. It takes so long as to be mind-numbingly boring, with very little price movement. Here’s where we consolidate before we launch into the next cycle.

The curve of price range decreasing against length increasing can be given by the simple formula:

[Bear growth function](https://preview.redd.it/pma4ujkqf7y71.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a8fd1100fc5caef720ce080832ced265e14ee7)

&amp;#x200B;

And the picture for the smooth brains:

[Bear growth graph](https://preview.redd.it/yzr5fkbsf7y71.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2be412507cb61c8b43bd1f1e26921a4aed207c5)

&amp;#x200B;

As we come out of the peak of the spike starting cycle 1 from y approaching infinity, the price range of subsequent subcycles in the same cycle will slide down this line, and when the price range finally hits 0, the next cycle kicks off.

Now the smart amongst you will realise “But that chart only goes down, how do you know how fast it’ll go up?” And you’re exactly right! If we have the bear growth function of cycle length and time, where’s the bull growth function? Thankfully you won’t need to remember another long scary string of numbers. It’s the same line, only it approaches the wall of tendies, instead of sliding away, and it’s 5/12ths the length. Why 5/12ths? Fuck you, ask nature, I didn’t code this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if we put those two graphs together what we have is the underlying ratio at the heart of the GME curve

[Bull growth function](https://preview.redd.it/g1s457lvf7y71.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b6a16f2e9126b524a7b6b2a3b4fa5c390fbfc86)

&amp;#x200B;

[Bull growth graph](https://preview.redd.it/mljby5wxf7y71.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4ff91678facef0d4aeb171a4e7fe26e51aff851)

[The 5:12 Bull to Bear ratio](https://preview.redd.it/5xv6rcb2g7y71.jpg?width=1499&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0214e864b1ed1ba3c8ccc878fb4d8e6c7d8c8aae)

Every 5 units of time we squeeze up, and every 12 units of time we flatten out ready for the next squeeze. Everything that line very nearly touches (0, infinity), and everytime it slams off y=0. Of course it could never hit (0, infinity), that’s your financial divide by 0 right there.

## 

[Combined Bull\/Bear cycle](https://preview.redd.it/3thjzfz6g7y71.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ee88098794457b9ff850f6aac8ec5b9734a4e8)

So it’s all well and good to discover that nature and the financial markets are a math nerd, but what can we actually do with it? Remember way back I said the cycle was deterministic? That means we can make some pretty accurate predictions. Here’s how we know if we need to get second mortgage, or a first yacht.

## The Up Cycle

&amp;#x200B;

[Uptrend Tricycle](https://preview.redd.it/lxmnkxicg7y71.jpg?width=2163&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5da5cd7a6bde9010e90f5c67473639ae3d2e332b)

In the uptrend our same understandings of the 3 subcycles remain true, lengths and widths of each circle conform to our graphs. But the placement is key here. In an uptrend, the peak of 2 will be lower than 1, and when 3 enters it’s climax it’s amplified by nature of being the climax of its parent cycle. These are where your true moonshots lie, when you hit multiple layers of 3 finishing together. The uptrend cycle doubles also as the FLY ME TO THE MOON stage of its parent cycle.

## The Down Cycle

&amp;#x200B;

[Downtrend tricyle](https://preview.redd.it/smg4b3lgg7y71.jpg?width=2625&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec6d8f077c91c37a27151e6befbedb40620d24cd)

In the downtrend, the peak of the two is going to be higher than the peak of the 1, and when the 3 falls into its hopes dashed stage it is amplified by the hopes dashed of any parent 3s. The downtrend doubles as the hopes dashed stage of its parent cycle.

These can be simplified with the shapes:

&amp;#x200B;

[Simplified indicators](https://preview.redd.it/yjdli43og7y71.jpg?width=1662&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fab178c3326f083e706a23df59e083fe4ba8de7)

So now that we know what bullish and bearish cycles look like, what does a bullish and bearish all time look like

Bullish

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There may have been a point where fundamental analysis actually meant anything, but it’s not in my lifetime. Fundamental analysis done by anyone who isn’t you, is a psyop marketing push to make you a bag holder after the stock/coin has already had it’s climax, and the times only get worse from here. Fundamental analysis is less than worthless, it is actively harmful to any worthwhile trading strategy. In the Gilded age of Speculation, it doesn’t matter if the company ever profit, or what the company even does. Something blockchain, here comes the angel investors with the buckets of money. Technical analysis is the only game in town and the Hedgies know it. So how do they profit from a deterministic graph that is public information. FUD, Aftermarket, and the secret ingredient crime.

No, Elon isn’t going to not sell his shares if the twitter poll loses. He’s seen the graph and knows he’s hit the peak of the beginning of the 1 cycle, and Tesla is about to crash and hard. Twitter is just a scapegoat so it seems like the crash has a catalyst.

I can’t stress this enough. The movement on the chart happens first, and then catalysts are invented, not the other way around.

They have their stooges working in the finance media telling you to bet the farm on Bear Sterns 2 days before they buy the farm. If anyone anywhere, who you don’t know, is trying to sell you on a stock they are not to be trusted.

Wouldn’t it be such a lucky coincidence for hedgies if the low points of the cycle hit during market hours, and the most profitable parts during market open. 

[November 3rd GME](https://preview.redd.it/sae92989h7y71.png?width=2445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b46cc878826a786514f0704120e32d58c31d19a)

&amp;#x200B;

While this one was fresh in your mind. The end of multiple 3 cycles happened during after hours on November 2nd, resulting in that huge after hours spike. The price falls just enough during after market for the consolidation of and completion of a subcycle, before completing even more 3s on top of each other, right out of the opening bell, just so we could catch the 1 of a new larger cycle, and experience the massive crash price range that comes with a 1.

And how much did that cost the hedgies to do?

[November 4th AT&amp;T ](https://preview.redd.it/4jhnfhueh7y71.png?width=2447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bb155b6af2e94f9edff655e21b6a1eaca950ab)

While GME was peaking, AT&amp;T, which Citadel are long on, and increased their position in tenfold since March, dropped pretty hard into it’s own consolidation. Looks to me like someone had to take a whole lot of profit all at once. But why not try and fleece retail while we’re at it. Bet we all noticed the sudden influx of people talking about BBBY along with that after hours spike. Billion dollar share buyback, “they’re becoming the catalyst themselves”. Do you hear that?

&amp;#x200B;

[November 3rd BBY](https://preview.redd.it/udrm9m5ph7y71.png?width=2448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b26403a717af75ca24ce1e053cb8ba2d29e96c)

That’s the sound of anyone who thought it was a good idea to diversify into BBBY taking an absolute bath after a brief smash and grab shill campaign to try and get some apes to buy BBY into a losing subcycle.

So then what is the catalyst? Buy and hold? DRS? Loopring?

I remind you, fundamentals don’t matter. All that matters is the graph.

The catalyst is a date, but not like any of the dates you know.

April 3rd, 2020, 5:30pm.

# The Day The Money Died

[April 3rd 2020, 5:30pm](https://preview.redd.it/8c0o9p6wh7y71.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a34b111b7d936012b59b467da48f64eacde8a4eb)

Whats’s so important about this date?

When you zoom out just far enough, the GME curve has the same flow of shape as the 5:12 growth decurve functions. When an asset is in an upswing, it’s in it’s 5 until it reaches the peak of it’s 1 cycle, and falls into it’s 12. We all know Citadel have naked shorted Gamestop into oblivion. They tried to force the 12 downtrend to go down as hard as it could. If the price reaches 0, and Gamestop goes bankrupt, it’s maximum profit for the hedgies. So all they had to do was get it to reach 0 before the 12 curve bounces of the x-axis.

They made just one fatal mistake. They didn’t read the graph.

[All time Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/zywqbtj2i7y71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54539e1f1bb46e48f1bc83ebc40e25b3d6e021c3)

&amp;#x200B;

April 3rd was the day we bounced of the x-axis of our 12, and moved into the uptrend of our 5. It was the day the squeeze became inevitable, and the day Citadel died.

Kenny, not only did you not take notice that the top of your current cycle was below the top of the previous 1, meaning you’re in an uptrend. You massively naked shorted a stock to astronomical levels right into its build up of the start of a bigger length of time cycle 1 than Gamestop has been a stock for. You didn’t bury the company into the ground. You shorted enough critical mass to make a black hole. Cohen saw it, DFV saw it, and now we see it. Thanks for the gravitational slingshot straight to the moon, you’ll be seeing us from your prison cell.

# How I learned to stop worrying

So where do we go from here?

If you want some predictions based on TA, stick around otherwise

TL;DR: MOASS INEVITABLE

&amp;#x200B;

[GME with Cycles](https://preview.redd.it/4yrkvrp6i7y71.png?width=2443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0b797cb69dd96185ee3f1c63ed63bd47f306a8)

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently in the first leap up in the build up at the end of cycle 3. This cycle 3 is also the end of cycle 1. The top of cycle 2 didn’t exceed cycle 1, so we are still in an uptrend. This cycle 1-3 ending will shoot us up below the top of the January sneeze if we continue to be in an uptrend and haven’t bounced off the y axis, otherwise it it exceeds the January sneeze and doesn’t continue climbing into MOASS, I expect the uptrend to have reversed into a downtrend. This cycle 2 will be longer, consult the 12 line to deduce how much longer, and then a longer again 3 until we complete the next super cycle. My understanding is that the scenario where Citadel finally collapses and can no longer constrain GME to the GME curve, is when we finally achieve the never achieved (x=0,y=infinity) of the 5:12 model.

When the number of wrinkles on the brain approaches infinity, it is indistinguishable from a smooth brain

# How I learned to worry again

MOASS is inevitable. Kenny is fucked by math, and he can’t crime his way out of it. But I would be remiss to say it’s all sunny uplands ahead.

Gamestop is undoubtedly in an uptrend, and will MOASS, and DRS and buy and holding is increasing the powder keg of our next cycle end.

But GME is the exception. The purchasing power of the dollar is fast approaching y=0, and somehow I don’t think it’s going to bounce off.

The inflation levels are only on the first spike up on the build up stage, and going by 1980s method of calculating inflation, we’re sitting pretty precariously at 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

What goes up must come down. The market looks at this graph and sees fantastic returns, healthy economy, party never stops. I look at this graph and I see the incoming all time high, for good, the bull trap, and the bear trap meaning not just the crash of the global economy. But the 100 year uptrend, reversing in to a downtrend 12/5ths as long. I don’t know about you, but I’d hate to be a person using, holding, or being paid with money anytime in the next 240+ years.

All the people at the top, who get paid very good money to listen to the direction of the music got too distracted by exploiting short term gains, breaking all the laws and rules in pursuit of more money than a person could ever dream to spend in a life time,  more money than our brains are capable of conceptualising appropriately. 

And they didn’t notice that the music stopped.

Apes, it has been a privilege holding with you this year.

I tip my hat to you

☢️☢️☢️ The U3O8-Ultimate ASX Uranium Company Performance and Comparison - Updated Nov 2021 ☢️☢️☢️,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/qpzbfk/the_u3o8ultimate_asx_uranium_company_performance/,Calculated-Punt,1,2021-11-09 16:32:38,154,/r/ASX_Bets/comments/qpzbfk/the_u3o8ultimate_asx_uranium_company_performance/,DD,"# Introduction

Without a doubt 2021 has been the most pivotal year for the uranium industry in more than a decade. The markets, politicians and corporations appear to have recognised that without nuclear power being a part of the energy conversation, a sustainable, zero carbon emission future will be near impossible to achieve.

This recognition, coupled with multiple other factors including; major supply deficits, the exponential growth of the EV industry and its increasing power requirements and, more recently, the emergence of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT), has helped the spot uranium price hit near decade long highs. 

As a result we have seen massive gains across the uranium equities, particularly those on the ASX. But the best part is that the current cycle is still in its infancy. It is unlikely new production will come online during the next 12 months and further uranium price increases will be necessary for brownfield and almost all greenfield projects to commence.

To put how small the uranium market still is into perspective: The WHOLE global market is worth only about US$42 billion (to date). That is all the uranium equities all around the world, the ETFs and major funds are worth a combined $42billion. Now Glencore is just a single major coal producer and has a market cap of US$64.46 Billion !  Let that radiate for bit.

# Types of ASX Uranium Companies

The uranium companies can be divided into 3x Key Categories: **Miners** or near term producers, **mine developers** and **exploration** companies. There is also one uranium enrichment technology company on the ASX - Silex Systems (ASX: SLX) - but that is not included in the coverage.

**ASX Uranium Miners / Producers**

This covers the few ASX companies that have a uranium mine somewhere in the world that uranium can be produced from though may require some capital investment to restart. Currently ALL ASX dedicated uranium miners have their mines shut-in on care and maintenance while uranium prices are too low to sustain operation of the mine. The uranium miners will be the first to re-introduce supply to the uranium market when higher contract term prices are signed. Some of these miners, even though shut-in, have been purchasing physical lbs of uranium (like BOE to PEN) as a strategic stockpile investment and to also meet existing contract deliveries. There are also companies like BHP and Rio Tinto that have some uranium production, though this is not a primary asset, and for the likes of BHP uranium is a by-product from the copper Olympic Dam mine. These companies are not included in the coverage. Below are the main ASX uranium miners

* **Peninsular Energy** (ASX: PEN) ---- Lance Project ISR Mine in Wyoming.   Previous Producer. On care and maintenance.
* **Lotus Resources** (ASX: LOT) ------ Purchased the open-pit Kaylekera mine   in Malawi from Paladin in March 2020. On care and maintenance
* **Boss Energy** (ASX: BOE) ----- Purchased the Honeymoon ISR mine from   Uranium One in 2013. On care and maintenance
* **Paladin Energy** (ASX: PDN) ---- Retained the Langer Heinrich mine in   Namibia - developed in the last cycle. On care and maintenance

**ASX Uranium Mine Developers**

These companies are those that have proved up a significant uranium resource and have conducted a series of studies or pilot plants for a large mine development. The Uranium Mine developers include: 

* **Aura Energy** (ASX: AEE) ----Tiris Project in Mauritania
* **Bannerman Energy** (ASX: BMN) ---- Etango Project in Namibia
* **Deep Yellow** (ASX: DYL) ----- Tumas Project Namibia
* **Toro Energy** (ASX: TOE) ----- Wiluna Project - Western Australia
* **Vimy Resources** (ASX: VMY) ----- Mulga Rock Project - Western   Australia

**ASX Uranium Explorers**

Not necessarily dedicated to just uranium exploration as many exploration companies are in the search for other minerals such as gold, vanadium, battery metals and rare earths and will jump between what is hot at the time. This selection has some drilling or exploration committed to uranium exploration with at least 40-50% of the company and funding focused on the asset. 

* **GTI Resources** (ASX: GTR) Exploration in Utah and Wyoming (USA)
* **92 Energy** (ASX: 92E) Exploring Athabasca basin (Canada)
* **Elevate Uranium** (ASX: EL8) Largest tenements of exploration in Namibia
* **Alligator Energy** (ASX: AGE) Exploration tenements in SA and NT  (Aus) 

There are a  number of additional “uranium exploration companies” that don’t meet the criteria for worthwhile assessment.

# ASX Uranium Companies Brief and Update

# Lotus Resources (LOT)

**Brief History**

Lotus purchased the Kaylekera mine (Malawi) from Paladin in March 2020 along with the surrounding exploration leases and infrastructure. Kaylekera previously produced 11Million lbs under Paladin operation from 2009-2014.

**Key Activities Last 6-12months**

* Ore Sorting Trials - Results of increasing grades by up to 100% with higher recoveries &gt;92%  (i.e. they autonomously sift through the ore to dispose of excess waste material before it goes through the mine plant).
* Increased ownership in Kaylekera from 65% to 85% (remainder 15% with Malawi Government)
* Near mine exploration - very under-explored with high upside potential
* 5,000m RC Exploration drill program -  exploring for uranium AND rare earths
   * 4,000m focused on Uranium and 1,000m focused on RE - results due late 2021
* Acquired tenement with proven 6M lb in ground resource for $0.004/lb (total $25k)
* Cash of $29.1million with many options yet to be converted

**Potential Catalysts and Forecast Activities**

* Exploration Drilling results due late 2021 --&gt; increase uranium resource size
* Rare earth discovery 
* Definitive Feasibility study (DFS)  due out in June/July 2022
* Looking to go into contract negotiations in  2022
   * “Plan is to lock in multiple contracts in a layered approach with some produced lbs kept to the side for sale into spot market to maximise capital value”

**Timeframe to production**

* DFS +6months to negotiate capital and on contracts → end of 2022 for FID
* Refurbishment of plant to take 12-15months to complete → be producing uranium by Q1 2024

[Lotus Resources Pros vs Cons](https://preview.redd.it/mwq0q5fzxiy71.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e0763fd77883ae43d942da53410f1bdeec22fd0)

# Boss Energy (BOE)

**Brief History**

Boss Energy (formerly Boss Resources) purchased the HoneyMoon mine and plant in central South Australia from US company Uranium One in December 2015. BOE has since increased the JORC resource size from 16.6Mlbs to 71.6Mlbs (\~331% increase), undertaken a number of studies and plant optimisation improvements and purchased 1.25 Mlbs of U3O8 as strategic stockpile.

**Key Activities Last 6-12months**

* Feasibility Study (FS) - Released in January 2020
* Completion of Enhanced Feasibility Study (EFS)  - Released in June 2021
   * Plans to remove the existing SX plant and replaced it with IX capacity to increase the production profile to 2.45Mlb/annum over a 10+ year mine life and reduce operating costs to achieve industry benchmark goals for low-cost producers of AISC of US$25/lb and cash costs lower than US$20/lb. 
* Completion of two significant capital raisings: first for $15 million(@ $0.067/share Oct 2020) and an additional $60 million (@ $0.14/ share) during March 2021.
* Purchase and acquisition of 1.25 Million lbs of physical U3O8 @ US$30.15/lb - March 2021
   * Total cost of US$37.68M (A$49.69M) . This inventory is now valued at US$53.75M (A$73.83M) at spot price of US$43.00/lb. A$24mill book return on investment.
* Accelerated development of the exploration program which has already seen a JORC increase from 16.6Mlbs to 71.6Mlbs.

“In addition to the substantial profit we stand to make on this investment, the stockpile de-risks our start-up process and therefore strengthens our hand in negotiations with potential customers.” - Duncan Craib (MD)

**Potential Catalysts and Forecast Activities**

* Ramping up of exploration activities with drill programs commencing in the December quarter 2021.
* Signing of first long term contract(s)
* FID and expediting time-frame to mine and plant restart

[Boss Energy Pros and Cons](https://preview.redd.it/lqfvuuj3yiy71.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80183476c81d5259dcf989511b1cfc6b61f45d3)

# Peninsula Energy (PEN)

**Brief History**

PEN is an Australian listed uranium mining company which commenced in-situ recovery uranium operations at their flagship 100% owned Lance Project (Wyoming) in December 2015. They have an existing contract book with about US$8mill revenue per year despite having their mine shut-in for the past 3 years. They are currently embarking on a trans-formative initiative to change from an alkaline ISR operation to a low pH (acidic) operation with the aim of reducing the cost profile and improving production efficiency. PEN requires approx US$6mill to convert the whole mine from alkaline to pH operation and approx 8months time frame following FID.

**Key Activities Last 6-12 Months**

* Advancing transition to low pH ISR process through field demonstration
   * Demonstration has been operating for 12month - with uranium grades indicating that Lance is better suited to the planned low pH process than previous alkaline based operations.
* FY2021 uranium sales of 275,000 lbs - continue to generate cash for PEN
* An increase in lbs sold and for a higher recognised price per lb
* Cap raise of A$15.4 million (@ $0.015/share) to purchase 300,000 lbs or uranium at US$31.35/lb
* As of June 30th 2021, Net cash of US$6.7mill + 309,507 lbs of uranium inventory (book value of US$9.7mill @ $31.37/lb)

**Potential Catalysts and Forecast Activities**

* US Dept of Energy progressing Uranium Reserve - PEN seeking to be active participant (potential funding from reserve or offtake agreements)
* Completion of field demonstration (started in August 2020, expected to run 18-24months)
* FID and restart of operations (will require some additional funding \~US$6mill)
* Likely to develop additional fields to replace depleting ISR operations ($$)

# Uranium/Nuclear ETFs - ASX Companies

For the u/ASX_Bets crowd here, most of us don’t know what an ETF is, except that we make fun of u/AusFinance for frothing over their 6% returns. But for the uranium market, ETFs are a very important contributor to some of your asx equity gains.

An ETF or exchange traded fund works by holding a portfolio of assets (stocks, bonds, physical commodities, funds) that are usually tracked to an index. The portfolio will hold x% of stock AAA and y% of stock BBB and z% of the commodity for a total weighting up to 100% of tracked assets.

* ^(When the uranium price increases, investors pile into the nuclear/uranium ETFs. If the ETFs trade above their Net Asset Value (NAV) for a period of time they are obliged to buy up additional individual stocks and assets to curve the NAV to fund value.)
* ^(The two major uranium ETFs are URA and URNM and comprise mostly of US/Canadian stocks and funds as well as Kazataprom and Paladin. But as of February-2021 a number of small ASX uranium stocks      were included and added to the “buying list”. This is called rebalancing and involves stocks being added (or removed) and changes in % allocations.)
* ^(The ETFs account for significant fund flows  into the ASX uranium equities as the whole market is still so small. URA “rebalances” twice per year, usually on the last day of January and July, where URNM can rebalance up to four times or quarterly throughout the year.)

**Uranium/Nuclear ETFs and the ASX holdings**

| **The Global X Uranium ETF**  (ARCA: URA) | PDN, BOE, BMN, DYL, PEN, LOT, VMY, GGG |
|:-|:-|
| **North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF** (ARCA: URNM) | PDN, BOE, BMN, DYL, LOT, PEN, VMY, TOE |
| **Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF**  (TSX: HURA)  |DYL, PEN, PDN, BMN, TOE, BOE, LOT,   VMY   |
| **VanEck Vectors Uranium + Nuclear Energy ETF** (ARCA: NLR) |PDN|

Inclusions in ETFs are mostly based on market cap being over a certain value for a period of time and a few other factors. It can be worth looking into the criteria and who is not yet included in an ETF and when/what opportunities might be coming up ;)  \*cough \* January 2022 \* Cough.

^(Disclaimer: This is NOT financial advice. These are my personal and subjective opinions. Rating is based on a number of factors; some mathematical and financially related, while some are based on opinions of management and projects. These ratings change overtime as company value and progress changes.)

The rating is out of 5x 🚀. This is not an anticipated number of “x” returns but a rating of what makes up good further potential value return and strong uranium company fundamentals : good management with commodity and company leadership experience, an attractive and achievable project, solid financials, time-frame and upside potential.

Workhorse ($WKHS) Sentiment/Takeaways,https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/qq8cr4/workhorse_wkhs_sentimenttakeaways/,Abefraim,1,2021-11-10 01:13:20,8,/r/WKHS/comments/qq8cr4/workhorse_wkhs_sentimenttakeaways/,Ape Facts,"I wont lie, in the past 2-3 weeks, my days of diamond handing this for \~2 years felt severely numbered. 

Today I went from from doubting this company to re-establishing my faith. This company went from having an incompetent egg-head CEO/previous management to literally a management team that will carry us to the end of the rainbow. A few takeaways from this morning...

$WKHS is 100% in talks with big players (UPS, FedEx, potentially Walmart as alluded to in the call), the big players seem hesitant due to the circumstances currently with backlog, delays and semi-conductor/production shortages; for those of you doubters who think this is ONLY a Workhorse problem, please think again. The semi-conductor, labor and production shortages are INDUSTRY WIDE. Even Tesla is experiencing major delays for full-scale models like the Model Y/Model 3. I am not comparing our product with a more scalable Tesla, but the point stands... Shortages and delays are what EVERY big player such as UPS, FedEx, Walmart, etc. has to live with for the next 8-10 months. They will account for these delays in their strategic thinking and future plans. In the next few months we will see the game-change and we will have FAA approval if everything falls in place. Then these big players will really have no choice. We will have a working, functional, tested vehicle with innovative and forward thinking technologies which NO other OEM will come close to offering. *Other companies are putting batteries into vehicles... Meanwhile Workhorse is creating a system of interconnected technologies ready to face the demands of the future (tested/certified electric trucks, drone delivery, infrastructure, application connected for companies to track costs/etc.)*

Second point, the new CEO has done more in the past 90 days then what the previous egg-head CEO did in his full term at Workhorse. Keep in mind, this CEO has been thrown curve-ball after curve-ball from the previous management cleanup. Rick has managed to clean-up 75-80% of the mess from the last management in ***90 DAYS***... Give this man some slack and let him steer the ship to where it SHOULD have been from the beginning. Yes we are disappointed we are late to the party, but in fact, we are way ahead of the competitors. Osh-Kosh does not even have an EV vehicle, Arrival is delayed until 2023 and without a manufacturing facility. Whereas, Workhorse has some small hiccups with VEHICLES ALREADY BUILT AND SOLD. ***What ship would you rather be on? The ship that hasn't even been built? Or the ship that has sailed and just needs to re-calibrate its direction? Pick wisely.*** 

Lastly, today was going to be a disaster as per what the shorties were claiming on Reddit, Stocktwits, Yahoo Finance and other forums. We can officially say that our bottom is between $6.40-$6.60. Many of us have bought in at these prices and will be laughing the next 8-10 months time. I do not want to say that we can't go lower, but with all the BS that has been thrown at this company over the past year, I am very happy to say, I believe this is the bottom. Every time some bad news hits, we seem to re-establish down to these lows. On the bright side, we can officially close a chapter of this terrible year and move onto more focused thinking. Let the shorts do whatever they want, we know what the future holds. I can guarantee most of the shorts don't even know Workhorse has a aviation division. They still think we are struggling due to the USPS contract. Laughable at this point, but keep shorting. I will happily take your money in the next 8-10 months.

If you have any further DD or thoughts or takeaways from todays call, I'd love to hear it."
Crypto Investors Need Better Metrics,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qq9pc3/crypto_investors_need_better_metrics/,bkcrypt0,1,2021-11-10 02:15:47,8,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qq9pc3/crypto_investors_need_better_metrics/,ANALYSIS,"How does any investor know whether a crypto company is doing well or not? At some point market cap and price increases won't be enough to distinguish projects that are making it vs. ones that will likely disappear through the next bear market. 

Before that arrives, a lot of new money will enter this market with much of it from traditional financial institutions. They won't be satisfied with ""to the moon"" predictions to understand a company's potential for adoption and profits.

In traditional finance analysts have a bevy of metrics to use in figuring out a company's prospects and performance, and ultimately whether to buy or sell an asset.

These include:

* Earnings estimates
* Price-to-earnings ratio
* Price-to-book ratio
* Accounting standards like cash flow, earnings, gross/net profits, etc.

There is also plenty of research into competitive positioning, comparing features, and deep dives into technological advances that may or may not result in market benefits.

Crypto struggles with this as there are no market-mandated metrics or accounting standards to go by.

For some sectors the amount of investment is practically the only metric. Take blockchain infrastructure for example. There are at least 30 of them publicly traded from behemoths like Ethereum at over $387 billion to new comers like Kadena at $257 million.

How many blockchains will survive the next five to ten years is anyone's guess. This is made exponentially more difficult by the lack of revenue statistics for these firms. This [watchlist](https://coinmarketcap.com/watchlist/605cc4969068e024455c99b1) tracks through CoinMarketCap with the basic stats available.

[Photo by Luke Chesser on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/s9ncrhqc1my71.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=999048b010a3e4d0bb2322ccd09660e2f65e222d)

There have been some attempts, like total value locked in various blockchains, bitcoin dominance %, and broader metrics like the [Fear &amp; Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) (which may not even be correlated with actual short-term price movements -- it has pinged extreme fear in the past and then the market jumped 10%.)

https://preview.redd.it/fhpw034r1my71.jpg?width=776&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41cd0ce0f5c7467ffd53cbb28b5c9b38fdd1f510

None of these tells us anything about the underlying business strength of individual crypto companies. Are they profitable, bringing on more users, managing their margins well, taking on significant debt?

One example of a company getting ahead of the curve is [Enzyme Finance](https://app.enzyme.finance/network/assets), an Ethereum-based, on-chain asset management platform. Their website posts usages statistics.

https://preview.redd.it/autyn4md2my71.jpg?width=1034&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289d7990274b24fc3901df726cf9058756689add

While there isn't a graph to show growth over time (analysts are going to have to work for their money), recent tracking shows that their vaults have more than doubled in a little over six months to 906 (11/9/21) from 436 (4/28/21) and their assets under management have nearly 6x'd to $181M USD from roughly $33M over the same time period. The company makes their money in fees, so these can give some indication of top line revenue growth.

This is materially different than statistics that merely show number of blocks created on a specific blockchain for example, or the number of active wallets. More specificity is needed to help determine what a company may actually be taking in as revenue.

Costs are even more difficult to assess, accept to examine, if possible, their on-chain wallets holding native tokens attributed to the company.

As more institutional money flows into crypto, questions about company performance will need answers.

And with the distributed nature of these projects (located all over the world), there is no commonly accepted set of metrics to use (like Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, GAAP, which itself is not even globally accepted).

For those that get a head start, the money may quickly follow."

[https://thedefiant.io/metis-latest-optimistic-rollup/](https://thedefiant.io/metis-latest-optimistic-rollup/)

The competition to become the dominant Optimistic Rollup Layer 2 solution just got a new player and a $100M fund boosts its chances. 

Metis is joining the fray, where Arbitrum and Optimism have so far ruled. The project is set to launch its mainnet the week of Nov. 15 and is also launching a $100M fund, which Metis describes as a “decentralized autonomous company” (DAC), called Genesi, to support projects which join its ecosystem. 

Genesi will be allocated across a wide range of high-potential projects in all major crypto verticals including, DeFi, gaming, and DAOs, according to a press release provided exclusively to The Defiant.

A committee consisting of Metis and its investors, which include Digital Finance Group and Master Ventures, will be in charge of allocating the $100M. Metis is led by co-founders Elena Sinelnikova, Kevin Liu, and Yuan Su and also has Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin’s mother, Natalia Ameline [on staff](https://www.metis.io/company/) as a technology researcher.

Metis’ $100M venture stands out among L2 solutions using Optimistic rollups — Arbitrum and Optimism, the two leaders in the category, have yet to deploy funds in order to bootstrap activity on their solutions. 

Metis fund comes after a flurry of similar efforts from Layer 1 chains. Harmony One deployed a [$300M ecosystem fund](https://thedefiant.io/harmony-300m-ecosystem/), while Avalanche has a [$180M incentive program](https://thedefiant.io/avalanche-incentives-aave-curve/). 

Metis’ Genesi will be an experiment to watch as L2s look to gain traction against heavily subsidized rival L1s. 

“From the start, our goal has been to build a large, strong, diverse ecosystem of dynamic blockchain projects, offering technology, marketing, and funding opportunities for projects with the most potential,” Elena Sinelnikova, Metis’ CEO and co-founder, told The Defiant. 

#### Optimism Hard Fork

While actually a hard fork of Optimism, Metis differentiates itself from its “parent” by using multiple sequencers, the software which stores and submit transactions, as opposed to one, as Optimism does. 

The company believes this offers higher degrees of decentralization than Optimism.

Metis also implements something called the Ranger System, outlined in the Metis’ [whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7CmKFt-FkfVXxSNu06hNgoZXxMzTC-/view). This implementation allows the company to move towards [EVM Equivalence](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), which Optimism has chosen to do as well, while also maintaining a higher degree of decentralization than its predecessor, according to a Metis [post](https://metisdao.medium.com/metis-to-launch-andromeda-honoring-our-commitment-to-decentralization-fa2d03394398).

EVM equivalence is “complete compliance with the Ethereum yellow paper,” as Optimism put it in their [post](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) on the topic. This essentially means that all tooling, like node implementations, can integrate with the L2s which implement it.  

Metis will also offer what it calls “[no-code middleware](https://metisdao.medium.com/blockchain-middleware-ccb41ded0fab),” smart contract templates which will enable anyone to migrate onto the L2 with a couple of clicks, as the company said in its [post](https://metisdao.medium.com/metis-to-launch-andromeda-honoring-our-commitment-to-decentralization-fa2d03394398) outlining the mainnet launch."

[Finance/Tech workers] Any suggestions ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoungFIRE/comments/qqr3mv/financetech_workers_any_suggestions/,FrenchToTheMoon,1,2021-11-10 18:06:22,8,/r/YoungFIRE/comments/qqr3mv/financetech_workers_any_suggestions/,Question/Advice Request,"Hey,

Quick story : I’m 21, french and will finish my Master in Corporate Finance in June 2022.
Obviously, being young with a degree at that age is a blessing that I don’t wanna ruin. 

I’m on my way to FIRE.
Current Net worth ~50k, 36k in stock market, 2k in crypto, 12k in cash. No debt, still living wih my parents.


I invest 1000€/month (approx 1200$/month) with 90% in the stock market, 10% in crypto. I’m not a fairly believer of the « buy VTI and forget » (feel free to ask me why, I’m not a fortune teller but I have my reasons), and prefer a strategy including safe-growing dividend (currently 5,6% yoc, making 110$/month, growing every year).
I have some non divy stock in my portfolio that I’ll sell soon. 


I currently have no job (??? you’ll say, but wait), but earns 900€/per month (unemployment) which is more than enough for now, since I have no bills to pay.
I have 5-days weekends, Thursday and Friday I’m at uni. 
So, that gives me a whopping 120hours of free time, and while I’m trying to learn new thing in my field (finance), I would like to implement some tech inside my learning curve, since I think finance and tech are the fastest paths for FIREing.


I plan to restart working in Sept 2022, move from my parent place (yes/not a good deal?), and continue my path to Fire from there.

Two questions : 


- Does mixing Finance and Tech (70/30) is a bad idea ? 
On the one hand, I won’t be focused on one field, that can slow down my progression. On the other hand, I think tech will boom soon, I find finance archaic.
As an investor, I don’t want to put my eggs (read here education) in the same basket. I like learning new things and I know I am my biggest asset.


- Any suggestions from finance/tech workers on some skills I can (must) improve to earn high 5-low 6 figures in the beginning ? To make things easier, imagine I’d start from the bottom. 

I got time, so I don’t care spending most of my rest days on it, I’m fairly consistent with my work at uni, so I can allocate 80% of my free time on learning new things.

Thank you!
Feel free to ask any question."

i was a mere peasant with no parents because they died of smallpox and i was left to fend for myself in the harsh world. the streets were filthy. i had always hated the way no matter how hard i scrubbed the floorboards, the stench lingered unbothered. i was always told i was different, perhaps i wasn't meant for this depressing old town. lately the hunger had gotten progressively worse, i was forced to steal food from a local baker named tabitha. of course the baker chased me angrily, accumulating a group all chasing me. at some point the townspeople had chased me far enough i was able to hide in a dark and dingy alleyway, far from the view of the mob. suddenly i was jolted to my senses when i heard someone behind me.

there was a man that spoke to me and said “is that cheese and crackers kid?” my scared and frail body turned around and looked up. i saw a tall male of exotic origins i had never seen before, dark hair that grew out like algae and a strange contraption on his eyes that looked like monocle but altered and on both of his eyes. he must have been taller than my old landlord as he towered over my pathetic and small frame.

i stood in terror, not fully comprehending his sentence when my bloodshot pink-eye infected pupils peered down to the strangers blouse. it was a shade of dye i had never seen before in my life, so vibrant that i’m sure it would cost a small fortune to have buy. my parents (god bless their souls) had to pull me out of the local school to work the fields for a denarius a day. that being said i was illiterate so the strange foreign lettering on the bright tunic stood out to me like leprosy.

the mans extravagant metal jewelry littered his hands like stars in the night sky. i could tell he had to have been at least a royal to be able to finance such luxuries. suddenly i was shaken out of my thoughts, “IS THAT CHEESE AND CRACKERS YES OR NO”  the man screamed as he violently shook me by my shoulders. as he did i could feel my body sweat excessively from fear, staining my dark rag i called a ‘hoodie’.

the man then started muttering to himself after letting me out of his grip “if only they let me play” he shuffled with his overgrown dark follicles “i wouldn’t have gotten bored and gone through a stupid machine viol2t showed me”. how did he speak the numeral out loud in that manner? what was he not allowed to play in? i was so shocked by his speech and mannerisms. i was scared the exotic wizard was about to curse my bloodline until i noticed him silently staring deep into my soul with his piercing, unnatural dark eyes.

i was so terrified by the man's appearance i had not noticed his pale beige sacks he wore on his legs. as he pulled a mysterious dark-green-hued potion bottle from them that consisted of colors out of space. i could not begin to describe the appearance of the object, colors that should never be viewed by the human eyes and hundred of white bubbles unnaturally floating within the potion . he spoke in a soft but scary tone of voice, a foreign incantation of great doom and curse “chugU.”

my weak and puny body could not resist the man forcing the burning fluid down my esophagus, it felt like fire and brimstone had collected within my throat and was scorching it’s way down to my soul.whatever this man was, he was pure evil. but before i could drop to the ground completely i had a reflection of my life building up into this moment. the flat world spun into a bright heavenly light where i saw a younger version of me, still small and frail and with a youthful curve to my face i had not completely grown out of. i was sitting at the dining table, waiting for my mother to bring me cheese-thous, my favorite meal. my head snapped up as i heard my mother call for me “matty watty poos!!!” she exclaimed.

if i were to ever tell my strange, foggy yet descriptive memories to ta1yo i’m sure he would talk to my family and friends about finally putting me into a mental facility (if not already for thinking arbys is edible).

# 1. Introduction

Without a doubt, 2021 has been the most pivotal year for the uranium industry in more than a decade. The markets, politicians and corporations appear to have recognised that without nuclear power being a part of the energy conversation, a sustainable, zero carbon emission future will be near impossible to achieve.

Political will has been coupled with a multitude of bullish factors. Existing Uranium demand is greater than our current supply, and this excludes the additional strain expected on the world’s power grid with the rise of electric vehicles. With these factors in mind, the emergence of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) has propelled the spot uranium price into near decade long highs, and on the verge of making new mines profitable. 

The best part is that the current cycle is still in its infancy. New production is unlikely to come online during the next 12 months. Further uranium price increases will be necessary for brownfield and almost all greenfield projects to commence.

But before we dive into the uranium market performance, understanding how Sprott works, SMRs and why it's so controversial, let's look at what it is all for --&gt; emission free nuclear energy.

# Nuclear Physics 101 

Brought to by /u/Mutated_Cunt

Alright time for me to take over and make this more deranged/suitable for /r/asx_bets. This is where you cunts interested in this sort of thing get a primer in nuclear physics.

Everything practical about Nuclear Energy is based on our understanding of this chart, the average binding energy per nucleon (protons or neutrons) as a function of the number of nucleons in the nucleus.  [The Binding Energy Curve of Common Isotopes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg/1280px-Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg.png)

https://preview.redd.it/90sggxc7k3z71.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f438e826e4d9b2127c2cb564b315e169366eb54

Because of the equivalence of mass and energy (E = mc2 ), this chart tells you two ways to make energy. You can combine two very light nuclei to make a heavier one (fusion), or you can split a heavy nucleus into smaller fragments (fission). If you are at the Fe-56 nucleus, you cannot generate any energy as you are at the “peak” of the binding energy curve.

Currently, all nuclear power plants in commercial operation use fission of the isotope U-235 (92 protons, 143 neutrons) to produce energy. This is because U-235 is the most abundant “chain reaction” isotope. You trigger fission of  U-235 by firing a low energy neutron at it. When splitting, along with two large fragments, the nucleus fires off an additional 2-5 neutrons (avg 2.5), which trigger more reactions, more neutrons, and so on. 

Only 0.1% of the mass of a U-235 atom is converted into energy, but this is more than enough to power a civilisation. To give you an idea of how absurd this energy density is, from one kg of coal you get 8 kWh of power, but in one kg of U-235, you can get 2,400,000 kWh of power.

 

[Energy Density Comparison of 1x Uranium Pellet to Other Fossil Fuels](https://preview.redd.it/eyjiyff7j2z71.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e8a6a104311eb8165dd986feee24992a58a253)

Luckily for us, U-235 is a rare isotope. From natural Uranium mined from the ground, you get about  99.275% U-238 and 0.7202% U-235, with the rest a mixture of other useless isotopes. For our beloved U3O8 miners, this means we got to dig up a substantial amount out of the ground ($$$$$) to get enough of the magic U-235 isotope. 

After digging up the ore, you have to enrich your yellow cake to increase the relative concentration of the U-235 isotope. For weapons grade Uranium, this is about 70% U-235, but for reactors, we only need about 10-20% U-235. This process is where the centrifuge comes in. Because you have a very slight mass difference, if you spin it around in a chamber, the heavier isotopes on average move further to the edge. You extract the Uranium that is closer to the middle of your centrifuge, and on average, that Uranium is richer in the light isotope U-235. Repeat this process a ridiculous amount of times, and you’ll have some very nicely enriched Uranium (as long as Israel doesn’t get involved). 

## Nuclear Fusion

One thing an observant one might notice about the binding energy chart is that the slope of the energy per nucleon determines how much energy you get. You’d also notice that on the “fusion side” of the chart, this slope is much much steeper than the “fission side”. This implies that fusion has an even more enormous potential for creating power than any fission plant, and also explains why Hydrogen bombs are the most terrible thing humanity has ever created. 

Essentially, for fusion to generate power, you need a large source of power to bring atoms close enough to fuse to give you an even greater source of power, because positively charged nuclei repel.  Fission has no such problem, because the “initiator” of the reaction is a neutron (neutral particle).There are two ways to find this power. A. you can build a Sun and use its gravitational effects, or B. you can use giant magnets to force the charged particles to collide. Obviously, the most developed experiments use option B, building Suns on our planet is rather difficult. 

It is a common joke in the Nuclear physics community that “Nuclear fusion has been 50 years away for the last 50 years”. If you ask an actual professor if fusion will be available soon, their most likely response is to laugh in your face. 

Why is this? You need to simultaneously solve Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics and the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics to control your Plasma to generate fusion. Sorry for any PTSD I just caused those who took those courses. Considering no known solutions exist for the latter, good luck. The “more wrong” your electromagnetic fields are, the  “less control” you have of your plasma, and the more power you need to generate to “correct yourself”. Current frontier experimental nuclear fusion can sustain a “net positive fusion power generation” for merely a few seconds at best, then it turns back into a power dump that accelerates global warming.  

You can safely predict there will be no economically viable method of nuclear fusion generating power plants in this century. 

# Nuclear Power 101

All of today’s commercial nuclear plants use nuclear fission for harnessing the immense energy that is released from breaking apart dense fuel materials such as uranium (most common), but also plutonium and thorium (far less common).

The difference between a nuclear bomb and nuclear power plant is that a bomb has all the energy released very rapidly and a power plant controls the reaction in a stable and constant form.

Remember how I mentioned that a fission of U-235 occurs when a low energy neutron hits it? Well, the reason that all nuclear power plants aren’t atomic bombs is that fission produces “fast neutrons”. To have a successful chain reaction, you need a material to act as a “moderator” that can slow down your neutrons to produce more fission events. 

As well as moderators, another essential feature of a nuclear power plant are the control rods. These are giant rods made of a material that absorbs neutrons (cadmium, boron, hafnium). As the neutron flux within the reactor increases, you reduce their R\_0 (just like covid) in proportion to how far the control rods are inserted. This allows for a nice, steady power flow that is pretty much automated these days. 

The most common Nuclear reactor in the world are pressurised Water Reactors (PWR). Because water is an excellent moderator of neutrons, and you use heated water to power turbines, you get a two for one solution with this reactor design. 

That’s right, from two millennia of progress in the physical and natural sciences, we have combined the profoundly unintuitive consequences of special relativity with the mastery of atomic physics to boil water. The best carbon free way to make your lightbulbs turn on is to build a giant kettle boiled by splitting atoms.

# The Negative View of Nuclear Power

But if nuclear power is so great, why does it not supply 100% of the global energy and power requirements? Well it could, but we have some problems. First of all, Nuclear has an absolutely terrible PR team. In the public perception, Nuclear Power is defined by its two major failures, Chernobyl and Fukushima, not the 18,500 cumulative “reactor years” of operation in 36 countries around the world. 

As of 2019, Nuclear power reduces our carbon emissions by 470 million metric tons per year, equivalent to removing 100 million passenger vehicles from the road. At its very worst, Nuclear power can make a region unsafe for human life for the next 100-200 years. In comparison,  fossil fuels will make the entire world unsafe for humans forever. Fighting climate change without Nuclear power is like challenging Mike Tyson to 12 rounds but with one arm behind your back. At least pretend to give yourself a chance. 

Of course, an ideal world would replace Nuclear power with various forms of renewables and completely forget about toxic waste.  But guess what, we don’t fucking live in that world. We’ve got one where environmental activists are campaigning to phase out nuclear without sufficient renewable capacity or capability. No prizes for guessing what fills that gap.  There is no desire that nuclear power replaces renewable energy sources, we need to be working together to conquer fossil fuels. Further still, no power source is without its negative consequences.

A number of green renewable energy sources have several negative environmental consequences. Hydroelectric dams have a devastating effect on local ecosystems, and cause catastrophic damage with floods/breakages. Large volumes of critical minerals are mined for manufacturing solar photovoltaic cells with a significant carbon footprint with limited recyclability. The short life spans often result in filling up a landfill with solar panels and turbine blades. 

But the global situation is about reducing carbon emissions, particularly from fossil fuels (burning of coal, gas and oil) to prevent climate catastrophes and clean up our precious breathing air. 

Nothing is perfect or will provide a one fit solution, but nuclear power is considered necessary and viable in providing a baseload power which in many countries is still being provided by fossil fuels. Some countries have walked away while many others, especially in the Middle-East and developing countries, are giving it their best shot. 

# 2. The Uranium Bull Market

Over a year  ago (Sep 2020) I shared an in depth coverage of the “Global Uranium Bull Market” that was unfolding. The post was then revamped in Feb 2021 (Link to [The Emerging Global Uranium Bull Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lftl86/the_emerging_global_uranium_bull_market_a_summary/)) and between the two posts they covered: 

* The decade long decline of supply since 2011 
* The lack of new mining and production developments due to suppressed U3O8 price for long periods (&gt;10yrs)
* The drawdown on inventory supply by utilities as mines were shut-in
* The growing demand for nuclear - especially from China, Europe, the Middle East and Asia 
* The impact of Covid-19 on supply - the postponement of production from the largest global producing mines in Canada and Kazakhstan

As well as what ASX stocks were involved with Uranium at the time and my best guess for maximum leverage.

**The Outstanding Supply/Demand Dynamics**

* Today 442 nuclear reactors supply 11% of the global baseload electricity and heating requirements
   * About 200Mlbs per year of uranium fuel total consumption
* \~20Mlbs pa sector deficit + additional 22Mlbs disruption in 2020 due to covid
* Covid extended through 2021 resulting in further reduction in mined supply; total \~50-60Mlbs deficit by end of 2021 anticipated
* Limited new supply has become available (Uranium Spot price not high enough)
* Rapid growing demand for more nuclear power plants and improved technologies:
   * 442 nuclear reactors currently operating in 32 countries
      * US(95), France (57), China (47), Russia (38), Japan (33)
      * Total 200million pounds of uranium per yr 
   * **52 New Reactors under construction** right now. Majority in China (18) and India (7) with South Korea (4), Russia (3), Turkey (3), UAE (2), the UK (2)...
   * **101 Further Planned** (approvals, funding or commitment in place): China (37), Russia (27), India (14), Egypt (4), UK (2) (+16 SMRs), USA (3), 
   * **325 Proposed New Reactors** (specific programme or site proposals, timing uncertain)
      * China (168), India (28), Russia (21), Saudi Arabia (16), Japan (8), South Africa, (8), Turkey, (8), USA (18), Poland (6), Brazil (4)

The below graph represents the demand and known anticipated supply of uranium. The pink area is the unspecified supply gap. A new source needs to be found to fill up this curve.

[Growing Demand vs Total Existing and Known Future Supply](https://preview.redd.it/do7p753123z71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=760db45a0c0e4b117efb511af54c87776797795f)

 \***Very Important\***

* Unspecified supply (pink area) is supply that will need to come from mines that are not yet sufficiently advanced for The World Nuclear Association (WNA) to include in their database. 
* This report was last published in 2019. Next report update anticipates an even wider gap of unspecified supply
* WNA reference scenario did not account for: Covid disruptions, Kazataprom extending supply discipline measures, financial buying (Sprott + Kaz physical trusts) and junior uranium companies buying physical uranium off the market.
* The Red arrows represent where actual uranium supply is tracking, extending the supply deficit.  

 

Most of the new energy demand is coming out of Asia where 60% of the world’s population lives. We are also seeing renewed interest across the rest of the world, including the Middle East, Canada, USA, Russia, the UK, and countries in Europe. However, China is massively leading the way in building new nuclear energy, as well as wind and solar.

# China is Becoming A Nuclear Power House 

China is building reactors of almost all available designs and are also putting a lot of development into the smaller and cost competitive Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) - which they intend to eventually outsource and become a major competitive supplier to other parts of the world.

During 2016-2020, China built 20 new nuclear power plants with capacity of 23.4GW, **doubling their total capacity to 47GW**. Their next target is **70GW** of nuclear generation **before 2025**. According to Luo Qi of China’s Atomic Energy Research Initiative, “**By 2035**, **nuclear plants in operation** should reach around **180 GW**” which will be more nuclear than the United States and France combined. China is even setting up a [nuclear university in Tianjin](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2151693/china-open-university-tianjin-train-workers-nuclear-power) to train nuclear workers for this expansion.

China is planning at least 150 new reactors in the next 15 years (by 2035)! Consuming an additional 80-90Mlbs

While the world nuclear fleet amounts to 442 reactors today, that marks an increase of \~30% from China alone. Add to that the future new reactors of India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Europe,... We have a Nuclear renaissance.

**What's Changed? (last 6-12months)**

Well the thematic driving the market is still the same - supply is low, demand continues to grow and there is a supply deficit pinch unfolding. That part hasn’t changed much, other than a few factors increasing on the demand side and other financial institutions now playing a part on the supply side.

But what has notably changed the most is the now more common and growing awareness by politicians, corporations and the public of just how useful and important Nuclear Energy is. Especially in combating climate change and reducing emissions while advancing global electrification.

# Signs of an Important Political Shift in Europe

A sea change in Europe:  Europe is turning around as a whole in accepting nuclear power as a clear player to net zero emissions. (as well as Japan, Saudi Arabia and more)

[European Companies \\""For\\"" Nuclear to be Included in EU Taxonomy](https://preview.redd.it/2umzf4bu43z71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab1bb41305dbba0c8a939ab0f84e21907268ccc8)

* This doesn't mean Germany is going to re-board the nuclear train.
* But it does mean the EU taxonomy on nuclear being denoted as a green finance energy source. The additional ESG funding and investment this attracts is HUGE!
* Group of 10 EU companies formed a nuclear alliance, led by France. Netherlands then asked to be included (10+1)
* This could mean we see Belgium turn around and put on the brakes of shutting down their 7 nuclear reactors. Also we may see Spain turn around and flip to being pro nuclear from the current left government anti-nuclear stance.
* The forecasted supply gap in 2019 assumed the closure of multiple European reactors in 2020-30. Lifetime extensions on these plants is a game changer.
* All happening in lead-up to COP 26 and all happening in an energy crisis.

Now there are consequences for politicians if there is an energy crisis. If in February there are issues providing electricity for heating etc then politicians will be hanged (metaphorically) for not making decisions that will put them on the proactive foot for the coming winters. There's accountability now.

* What has held nuclear back is public perception and policy makers fear of public perception.
* This energy crisis unfolding in multiple parts of the world could be the attested moment for a lot of this public perception fear to change. Climate change fear is outweighing the fear of nuclear.

The world is also on the cusp of introducing small modular reactors (SMRs) to create a layered demand source for uranium. The promise is a smaller, safer design with high versatility. Imagine what problems we could solve with a power plant that can be transported on the back of a truck. SMRs can help industry more than help the government. See the SMR section for latest on that front and the developments currently under implementation.

Overall upside scenario - entering the new nuclear renaissance. Not necessarily a new renaissance but more a modern reframing in a narrative that people can understand and get behind. The underlying technology hasn't changed.

**Massive Uranium Financial News Marker - Kazataprom Physical Fund:**

On the 18th-Oct Kazataprom (largest global producer of Uranium) [announced their investment into a physical uranium fund](https://www.kazatomprom.kz/en/media/view/kazatomprom_obyavlyaet_ob_investirovanii_v_fond_fizicheskogo_urana) \- A second major fund that will complement and compete with the relatively new but already the largest physical uranium fund - Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT).

The Fund (ANU Energy), established on the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) will hold physical uranium as a long-term investment with its initial purchases financed through the founders’ round investment totaling US$50 million, sourced from Kazatomprom at 48.5%, National Investment Corporation of the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NIC) at 48.5%, and Genchi Global Limited (the Fund Manager) at 3%.

At the second stage, the Fund is expected to raise capital of up to US$500 million from institutional and/or private investors, with the proceeds to be used for additional uranium purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. The Three Sp's: Spot, Sprott and Sput

**The Uranium Spot Market**

Unlike other metals such as copper, nickel, gold or iron ore; uranium is not easily traded on an organised commodity exchange (London Metals Exchange for example). Instead, it is traded in most cases through contracts negotiated directly between a buyer and a seller. More than 95% of uranium trade is via 3-15yr term contracts with producers (miners) selling directly to utilities (power stations), reflecting security of supply. NOTE: utilities need secure supply as they cannot risk having to shut down their power plants for lack of nuclear fuel - it is very very costly to shutdown, yet alone start-up again.

The Spot Uranium Market is mostly made up of some approved traders (hedge funds and uranium funds), as well as some spot supply from U3O8 enhancement and storage facilities and often traded between producers who may need to meet term contracts. But this is relatively only a small function in terms of satisfying reactor needs.

Utilities purchase uranium under specified pricing (series of fixed prices) or market-related pricing which is linked to the delivery date and often trading at a premium (sometimes a discount) to the spot market indicator. Spot is what everyone looks at, but what is the underlying focus for companies is the term price.

Only a small percentage of uranium in circulation is traded on the spot market. The liquidity is pretty low. Liquidity typically has been around 220,000lbs a day, until recently when Sprott started rocketing it up close to 400,000lbs a day. 

This near doubling of liquidity has meant  that the Spot market price has risen from US$32/lb in early August to a high of US$50/lb by mid September, and settled around the mid $40s going into October. 

But what is Sprott?

**Sprott Asset Management**

Sprott, founded by Eric Sprott in 1981, is an investment firm and asset management corporation. They are a resources giant out of Canada with a focus on acquiring precious metals, managing bullion trusts, equities and mining ETFs .

They hold 4 bullion trusts (Gold, Silver, Platinum and Palladium) worth a total \~US$13Billion and have an overall \~US$18.6B total in assets under their management with over 250k investors.

During the last uranium cycle (2005-2011) Sprott developed a financial vehicle for buying physical uranium. But they were “late to the party”, in that fund didn't kick off until about 2010. But this cycle they have come in much earlier not only with buying up uranium equities but also in having a physical uranium investment vehicle established before other major funds.

On April 28th 2021 - Sprott Asset Management Group [entered into an agreement ](https://www.sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-asset-management-enters-into-agreement-with-uranium-participation-corporation-to-form-the-sprott-physical-uranium-trust/#)with Uranium Participation Corp (UPC) to form Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT). The partnership allowed Sprott to be an authorised and approved entity for buying, investing in and holding physical pounds of uranium. It is a trust that allows investors (fund managers and retail) to invest in holding uranium without having to be an approved uranium trading entity.

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT)**

Sprott filed for an At-The-Market (ATM) equity offering sales program → i.e. an investment vehicle that allows them to issue shares into the open market whenever they are trading at or greater than 1% of their Net Asset Value (NAV), up to a certain amount. They then use the proceeds generated to buy additional physical uranium and charge a 0.35% annual management fee.

* The initial ATM was for US$300mill and on August 17th the ATM went live - issuing the first shares. They immediately started buying physical uranium for the Trust.
* Within 3 to 4 weeks their aggressive buying on the spot market, spending close to their max $300mill, drove the spot price up over 50% from $32/lb to US$51/lb.
* On the 9th September 2021 Sprott amended their shelf prospectus and increased the ATM from US$300mill to US$1.3Billion
* As of 12th Nov 2021 SPUT has purchased a total 19.4Mill lbs, raising approx US$903.68million or 69.5% of their US$1.3billion ATM and have approx US$57.2mill cash on hand.
* To keep up to date how much SPUT is buying - here is a [Sput Tracker Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cH_2BM6T48FJDP8ShHBL9IRGFbR99ChH_SPSAWRGvt0/edit#gid=504025026)  updated daily - courtesy of Alex Weinstein on twitter.

**But what if SPUT just sells their uranium?**

SPUT is a closed-ended fund, unlike ETFs which are open-ended,  there are no redemption options when SPUT units are sold or bought-back. SPUT’s mandate is to accumulate physical uranium and sequester it, not to return pounds to the market.

Sprott makes their money from the 0.35% annual management fee. It is in their best interest to build the trust up in value and then hold for long term sequestration.

John Campigoni, the CEO of Sprott Asset Management, stated “The only circumstance under which SPUT would sell uranium would be if it were necessary to cover the expenses of the Trust.” In short the only selling would be in small amounts if (ever) needed to cover operating expenses.

They are an investment vehicle that offers direct exposure to the uranium price. 

If the uranium price drops, SPUT buys at lower prices. If SPUT is trading at less than 1% premium to their NAV then they cannot issue more units to raise funds until it increases again, which will swing on market sentiment. But when the fund share units are trading &gt; than their NAV then they issue additional shares to buy additional U3O8 (and UF6) in the spot market to increase their NAV so that the premium over NAV decreases. That additional spot buying pushes the uranium spotprice higher which in turn drives further sentiment in buying more SPUT. And hence a Uranium flywheel effect is created (see below) 

[Price of Uranium Futures and Impact of SPUT](https://preview.redd.it/zpoywmu5b3z71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05534677cff1db8f13051d2fba50d1efd5ac7abf)

# Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

Unlike Gold where there are dozens of ETFs, Uranium only has 4 pure play ETFs.

* **The Global X Uranium ETF** (ARCA:URA) - US ETF tracks mostly miners. Largest ETF
* **North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF** (ARCA:URNM) - lists both producers and explorers
* **Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF** (TSX:HURA) - ETF for Canada created in 2019
* **VanEck Vectors Uranium + Nuclear Energy ETF** (ARCA:NLR) - launched in 2007, tracks market cap

ETF, exchange-traded funds, are somewhat like a mutual fund but are traded like a single stock. They are made up of a basket of stocks (and funds like SPUT). The biggest in the uranium sector are URA and URNM.

* When investors see the spot price of uranium increasing, they turn to the ETFs to seek broad exposure to the sector.
* URNM and URA have seen triple-digit gains in the past year, with URNM up 216%, while URA has gained 146%
* These ETFs have grown about 10xfold in asset value the last year
* The URA ETFs rebalance semi-annually - usually on the last business day of January and July. Last rebalance in Jan 2021 saw a number of ASX equities such as Deep Yellow, Bannerman, Lotus and Peninsular Energy added to the ETF index.
* URNM tracks a market cap of uranium miners, explorers and developers and rebalances quarterly through-out the year.
* URNM holds 8% of their portfolio in SPUT. While URA will be adding SPUT in January 2022

# The Uranium FlyWheel Effect

[Uranium FlyWheel Effect and Additional Dimensions](https://preview.redd.it/5rudxxwqd3z71.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=569a7187dc5b377a6d89f6b3d011587e55388135)

 **Flywheel Effect summary**

A financial Investor (SPUT) raises money at their ATM Facility → they buy physical lbs of uranium with those funds → increases the demand for uranium → results in increasing the price of uranium → drives sentiment → drives further demand of SPUT units (on TSX) which enables SPUT to trade at a Net Asset Value premium → SPUT issues more units → Buys more Uranium and the cycle continues.

Additional market participants buying uranium other than SPUT adds an extra dimension to the flywheel. 

* We are now seeing more traders and hedge funds come into the market. Producers who need to buy uranium to meet long term contracts, and soon utilities will be entering the market more and more.
* This has created extra demand, increasing the price, and so the wheel spins

Now the ETFs add a further dimension to the flywheel.

* URNM holds 8% of their index as SPUT
* URA doesn’t hold any SPUT by a fluke event of the last rebalancing (July) occurring on the same day UPC was bought by Sprott.
* URA when they next rebalance (January 2022) will have to buy up SPUT to make up to \~10% of their index

The flywheel effect gains even more momentum, drives money not only directly into SPUT but also indirectly from the robot buying that the ETFs will do as more investors pile into these ETFs. And so the flywheel begins to spin faster and spread further.

Markets Roundup: Ethereum Burn Rate Surges as DeFi Tokens Post Mixed Performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qsf747/markets_roundup_ethereum_burn_rate_surges_as_defi/,TheDefiantNews,1,2021-11-13 00:41:37,1,/r/defi/comments/qsf747/markets_roundup_ethereum_burn_rate_surges_as_defi/,NaN,"*A weekly recap of DeFi market action from* [*Sam Haig*](https://twitter.com/samuel_haig)

DeFi assets saw a mixed performance this week, with roughly half of the sector’s leading protocols suffering drawdowns by both TVL and token. Still, sector-wide TVL and market cap have continued trending into previously uncharted territory.

##### Market Cap Moves

According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi), the combined capitalization of DeFi tokens has continued to press into new all-time highs this past week, currently sitting at a record of $173.7B equal to 16% more than  the previous high from early May.

Terra (LUNA) remains at the top of the rankings with a nearly $22.9B market cap, followed by Chainlink (LINK) with $15.5B, and Uniswap (UNI) with $12.8B.

##### Top Gainers

*Two top DeFi tokens gained by more than triple digits this week, while a further seven tokens posted significant gains of between 25% and 50%.*

Keep3r (KP3R) + 217.4%

Loopring (LRC) + 175.3%

Lido DAO (LDO) + 50.1%

Liquity (LQTY) + 48.2%

Frax Share (FXS) + 47.6%

##### Biggest Losers

*More than half of the sector’s top 100 tokens by market cap suffered drawdowns for the week.* 

Popsicle Finance (ICE) – 40.7%

Spell Token (SPELL) – 28.8%

Ampleforth (AMPL) – 28.8%

Trader Joe (JOE) – 25.9%

KeeperDAO (ROOK) – 23%

##### TVL

According to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/), the total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector also posted new highs this week, tagging $275B for the first time on Nov. 9 before retracing to $268B.

More than two-thirds of DeFi capital is locked on the Ethereum network, which posted a record TVL of $182B on Nov.10 before retreating  to $179.5B.

Binance Smart Chain’s TVL saw modest growth this week, representing $21B in locked capital. However, BSC’s TVL is still down 35% compared to its May high of $32.4B, suggesting that rival EVM-compatible networks have amassed some of the liquidity previously on Binance Smart Chain.

Solana ranks third with $14.1B after posting a record high of $15.2B on Nov. 9, followed by Terra with $10.8B down from $11.5B, and Avalanche at a new high of $10B. Fantom also ranks sixth with $5.3B after hitting a new high of $6.1B, while Polygon ranks seventh with $5B — down more than 50% from its June record of $10.5B. 

All other networks host a combined DeFi TVL of $22.3B.

Curve currently ranks as the single-largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $20.7B across seven different networks, followed by MakerDAO with $19.5B on just Ethereum, and Aave with $16.1B across three chains.

Nearly half of the 100-largest protocols saw capital outflows for the week.

##### Burn Rate

Ethereum’s burn rate has increased by nearly nine times over the past fortnight, with 88,641 Ether (roughly $407.7M) having been destroyed in the past seven days according to [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money/).

Uniswap v2 was the largest burn source destroying 13,672 ETH ($62.9M), followed by wallet transfers with 9,596.5 ETH burned ($44.1M), and Tether with 5,636 ETH ($25.9M).

Uniswap v3 also ranked fourth by burn rate with 4,377 ETH ($20.1M), closely followed by OpenSea with 4,017 ETH ($18.5M), and Ethereum Name Service with 2,691 ETH ($12.4M).

##### Layer 2 Growth

According to [L2beat](https://l2beat.com/), Leading layer-two Arbitrum saw its TVL largely trend sideways at $2.7B this week, tagging a new high of $2.8B on Nov. 9.

Second-layer derivatives protocol dYdX ranks as the second-largest L2 by DeFI TVL with $967M despite a 4% drawdown, while rollups network Optimism ranks third with $325M after posting a record of $341M this past week.

##### Fees

Leading DEX Uniswap’s fee generation [surged](https://cryptofees.info/) this week, with the protocol driving $9.1 million worth of fees each day on average. Compared to just two weeks ago, Uniswap’s fees have nearly doubled.

DeFi assets saw a mixed performance this week, with roughly half of the sector’s leading protocols suffering drawdowns by both TVL and token. Still, sector-wide TVL and market cap have continued trending into previously uncharted territory.

##### Market Cap Moves

According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi), the combined capitalization of DeFi tokens has continued to press into new all-time highs this past week, currently sitting at a record of $173.7B equal to 16% more than  the previous high from early May.

Terra (LUNA) remains at the top of the rankings with a nearly $22.9B market cap, followed by Chainlink (LINK) with $15.5B, and Uniswap (UNI) with $12.8B.

##### Top Gainers

*Two top DeFi tokens gained by more than triple digits this week, while a further seven tokens posted significant gains of between 25% and 50%.*

Keep3r (KP3R) + 217.4%

Loopring (LRC) + 175.3%

Lido DAO (LDO) + 50.1%

Liquity (LQTY) + 48.2%

Frax Share (FXS) + 47.6%

##### Biggest Losers

*More than half of the sector’s top 100 tokens by market cap suffered drawdowns for the week.* 

Popsicle Finance (ICE) – 40.7%

Spell Token (SPELL) – 28.8%

Ampleforth (AMPL) – 28.8%

Trader Joe (JOE) – 25.9%

KeeperDAO (ROOK) – 23%

##### TVL

According to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/), the total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector also posted new highs this week, tagging $275B for the first time on Nov. 9 before retracing to $268B.

More than two-thirds of DeFi capital is locked on the Ethereum network, which posted a record TVL of $182B on Nov.10 before retreating  to $179.5B.

Binance Smart Chain’s TVL saw modest growth this week, representing $21B in locked capital. However, BSC’s TVL is still down 35% compared to its May high of $32.4B, suggesting that rival EVM-compatible networks have amassed some of the liquidity previously on Binance Smart Chain.

Solana ranks third with $14.1B after posting a record high of $15.2B on Nov. 9, followed by Terra with $10.8B down from $11.5B, and Avalanche at a new high of $10B. Fantom also ranks sixth with $5.3B after hitting a new high of $6.1B, while Polygon ranks seventh with $5B — down more than 50% from its June record of $10.5B. 

All other networks host a combined DeFi TVL of $22.3B.

Curve currently ranks as the single-largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $20.7B across seven different networks, followed by MakerDAO with $19.5B on just Ethereum, and Aave with $16.1B across three chains.

Nearly half of the 100-largest protocols saw capital outflows for the week.

##### Burn Rate

Ethereum’s burn rate has increased by nearly nine times over the past fortnight, with 88,641 Ether (roughly $407.7M) having been destroyed in the past seven days according to [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money/).

Uniswap v2 was the largest burn source destroying 13,672 ETH ($62.9M), followed by wallet transfers with 9,596.5 ETH burned ($44.1M), and Tether with 5,636 ETH ($25.9M).

Uniswap v3 also ranked fourth by burn rate with 4,377 ETH ($20.1M), closely followed by OpenSea with 4,017 ETH ($18.5M), and Ethereum Name Service with 2,691 ETH ($12.4M).

##### Layer 2 Growth

According to [L2beat](https://l2beat.com/), Leading layer-two Arbitrum saw its TVL largely trend sideways at $2.7B this week, tagging a new high of $2.8B on Nov. 9.

Second-layer derivatives protocol dYdX ranks as the second-largest L2 by DeFI TVL with $967M despite a 4% drawdown, while rollups network Optimism ranks third with $325M after posting a record of $341M this past week.

##### Fees

Leading DEX Uniswap’s fee generation [surged](https://cryptofees.info/) this week, with the protocol driving $9.1 million worth of fees each day on average. Compared to just two weeks ago, Uniswap’s fees have nearly doubled.

Aave was the second-ranked DeFi dApp by fees with a daily average of $2 million, followed by SushiSwap with $1.8 million. By contrast, the entire Bitcoin network drove roughly $1 million in fees each day."

For those of you who don't have discord, here's a transcript of our no holds barred AMA with Yamcha and Krill last night! Thanks to Mighty M for organising the event and Ringsel for putting the document together:

**FIRST TRANQUIL FINANCE DISCORD AMA 11 NOVEMBER 2021**

**TOP QUESTIONS BY VOTES** 

**Q**: How does Tranquil strategically plan to compete with popular lending protocols coming to the chain like Aave?

**A**: An advantage we have over a large cross-chain protocol like AAVE is being much more nimble and responsive to the needs of the Harmony ecosystem in particular. If you look at Sushiswap and Curve on Harmony, they are clearly after thoughts by their dev teams. The most critical piece of this strategy is launching a liquid staking token (stONE), which would be a key differentiating factor for Tranquil.

**Q:** Hi guys. Im a huge fan of the platform (as are we all). What plans do you have for $TRANQ utility? Right now all we can do is hold it and/or trade it for $ONE.

I would like to add, besides being a potential governance token. What other utility would tranq have.

**A:** Right now, you can stake TRANQ in the single staking pool or provide liquidity on Sushiswap, so there is already utility. We want to add TRANQ as a lending/borrowing market, but this is too risky at the moment.

I think “utility” is a somewhat misleading concept to think about tokenomics. Ultimately, we want TRANQ to reflect the fundamental value that the protocol generates. Most cryptocurrencies have limited “utility”, so I think the underlying concern here is actually the price going down.

Some ideas we’re considering are a bit further off, like experimenting with GameFi and NFTs, or launching new protocols and airdropping tokens for TRANQ holders. We’re still very early, and there’s so many more avenues to explore in the future.

**Q:** How do you plan to counter sell pressure of TRANQ, any mechanisms in pipeline? Like tranq collateral or rewards for locking similar to dfk? I believe sale pressure is from rewards of lending/borrowing, so if the whales come in then it will increase sale 

pressure too.

How do you plan to increase buy pressure of tranq? Any plans to introduce launchpad? Or providing incentives to burn tranq? Any new ways to use it like providing FLASHLOAN using tranq as collateral?

**A:** Given the community discussions, we’ve been thinking about this issue a lot. Other lending platforms, like Geist, are facing a similar problem. Unlike a farm where you need to buy the farm token to participate, there is no natural buy-pressure from simply depositing assets with little risk. This is why rewards are very small on established protocols like Compound and AAVE.

We do like the idea of a lockup mechanism. Instead of rewarding TRANQ to lender/borrowers that they can sell right away, we can potentially reward a new token rTRANQ instead, that can only be redeemed to TRANQ in X months. This would prevent immediate dumping by farmers.

**Q:** What are the plans for the ONE liquidity from the ICO? Are there any plans to try and peg the price of TRANQ to another asset?

Follow on with this question. Are there any plan to incentivize the project with ONE token from xtranq sale? If yes, what is the % will be use for incentivize. Can you give us a few example on how it’s being use?

**A:** The goal of the ICO funds is to fund the long term development of the protocol. Although it’s tempting to simply use it to prop up the token price with various incentive schemes or simply buying back TRANQ, we want to make sure this builds long term value for Tranquil, rather than a short term flash in the pan.

To give an example of a potential good use case, we would want to boost incentives before a major push to attract TVL. This would be a strategic decision when the time is right to maximize impact.

Given xTRANQ holders are locked up for a few more months, it’s clearly not in their interests to support the price right now with short term incentives, as tempting as that may be. Ultimately, the token price needs to reflect the fundamental value of the protocol, which is the only sustainable approach.

**Q:** Any plans to list on a CEX or is anything in the works?

**A:** A maybe on this one

**Q:** Harmony has a bridge with Terra Luna.   Can we please add UST?

**A:** We’re definitely looking into other stablecoins to add to Tranquil, like DAI and UST. We want to wait until after integrating Chainlink before adding new markets though.

**Q:** Any plans on below items

1. Automatic restake of rewards from xtranq to single staking.

2. Automatic restake of rewards from single staking to single staking.

3. Automatic restake of rewards from LP pool to single staking.

4. Automatically stake of rewards from lending/borrowing into single staking.

5. Lock single staking coins for 7 epochs similar to Harmony One.

Above will reduce price swings and investors can comeback after xtranq unlock or CEX listing without bothering dev’s much.

**A:** Thanks for the suggestions. These autocompounding features seem like qualify of life improvements. There are already a few autocompounders for Tranquil already, but our own would be nice as well. Just have to balance this work with other dev work.

**Q:** Will the future staking derivative of stONE be activated through the native tranq token to add usage to the token or will it automatically be done through ONE?

I see stONE being important to the success of Tranquil and differentiation from aave and aave forks. Do you have any more information your able to provide on specifics &amp; timelines?

**A:** You’re absolutely right, we also believe stONE will be an important step for Tranquil to succeed. We have a plan mostly hashed out on how we want to achieve this vision. It’s still early, so no specific details yet, but we want to launch this by the end of the year. Like most liquid staking protocols, it would simply involve converting ONE -&gt; stONE and vice versa.

I know that's a lot to read!

**PUBLIC QUESTIONS**

**Q:** What is the time update for BTC Bridge and ChainLink ? These 2 features seem paramount. Also, how closely do you work with the Harmony (ONE) team? 

**A:** Those items are a bit beyond our control but based on Harmony’s roadmap they should be coming by the end of the month, I also want to add we support both these projects 100% and will integrate as soon as they are ready

**Q:** Is there are any major partnerships with projects inside and outside the harmony chain. Defi Kingdoms is a common one which comes up

**A:** We would be open to partnering with defi kingdoms but they seem to be more focused on gaming aspects at the moment. We are talking to a few other teams behind the scenes but one thing we want to be very careful with is on boarding new collateral assets

**Q:** Besides potentially locking TRANQ rewards, are there any plans for having a locked cooldown for the single staking pool of TRANQ? If part of the ICO funds are used to attract and retain investors on a strategic moment, could these sort of locks counter a potential pump and dump?

**A:** Yeah it’s something on our mind to have rewards but locked for a certain amount of time. It doesn’t prevent dumping after the unlock however, but it should help a bit

One thing that concerns me about these lock schemes in other protocols is whether you are simply kicking the can down the road

**Q:** Question for both Yamcha and Krillin What drew you two to the Harmony Network? Also how many developers on your Tranquil Finance Team?  I would love to know more about the team and your backgrounds.

**A:** Currently it's just the 2 of us working as devs. However, we plan on hiring a few more devs to add more features and launch more projects.

We were attracted to Harmony ONE due to the low cost and high transaction speed of the block chain. Also, we think the dapp ecosystem and community has much more potential than other L1 chains.

*Both of us have had over 10 years of software development experience at large US software FAANG companies. Yamcha also had previous experience working on crypto-security projects you may have used on your phone. We are very interested in blockchain web3 technology and believe this is the future of computing.*

**Q:** Thoughts on stake tranq earn one?

**A:** This is an idea we're discussing. It falls into paid incentive schemes that we want to make sure build long term value

**Q:** Another frequent question we get from our friends who share concerns in general chat is, how will Tranquil finance be combatting emissions?

**A:** I feel the only way for Tranquil to be sustainable is to have emissions as low as Compound and AAVE. That requires time to build trust, however, but in the meantime, we're looking at lockup schemes that may alleviate the short term dumping

**Q:** So when do you plan to add liquidity? There was over $5 mil raised and team hasn't added any liquidity.

**A:** Liquidity is not the issue here. We have sufficient liquidity for the circulating supply and market cap.

**Q:** another question we got asked a few times in the last week is, once three security goals have been completed, will there be a big marketing push to bring off chain money on to Tranquil finance?

**A:** Yes this is the plan! However, we definitely need the help of the harmony team for this. It’s hard to do this  singlehanded

**Q:**  What are the new adjusted daily emission from pools/rewards

**A:** It's 186.9k TRANQ per day currently for pool / reward emissions. Seed Vesting at 65k / day.

Total: 252k TRANQ per day

You can find the updated emission schedule here:

https://docs.tranquil.finance/technical/protocol-info#reward-emissions

**Q:** Other than stOne, do you have plans for other differentiators from competition?

**A:** We envision our end goal as a decentralized FTX, which we believe is possible thanks to the speed and low cost of the Harmony blockchain.

https://docs.tranquil.finance/info/roadmap

In the long term we want to use the collateral you deposit in Tranquil to power leveraged trading and borrowing use cases like a decentralized FTX.

Given the success and adoption of DFK, we also have ideas of combining Gamification with a lending market.

**Q:** Are There any partners help #tranq get in touch with other companies/governments?SO ,How big is word-of-mouth marketing for Tranquil ?

**A:** I think we have good presence so a lot of projects reach out to us directly for partnership

**Q:** What is the advantage to do a LP pool and reward tranq for providing liquidity rather then just add tranq from the lp pool with ONE to liquidity at the launch?

**A:** Incentivizing liquidity is very similar to the single staking tranq pool as both give tranq holders a reason to use their token. Liquidity is more useful than single staking as it’s actually providing a service

**Q:** Yeah but if the same amount of tokens that are currently in the rewarding LP pool would be paired with ONE from the start and added the volatility of tranq would be much less cuz the would be more liquidity for people to sell into their rewards

And this is very important because the inflation is the biggest in % in the first days

**A:** This doesn’t really solve the market dynamics though. There would still be selling and the sheer scale in the first day indicates more than just emissions

It was me due to market hype and bust in my opinion

**Q:** There would be selling but due to better liqidity it would not be that volatile and while this LP farm is creating utility like u say in the same time it’s creating more emission  
**A:** The single staking pool also creates more emissions too, but LP providers are offering more utility.

**Q:** What are you gonna do with millions from ICO asking as I saw several lending platform on other chain that currently maintain 500m tvl and had a similar roadmap as yours but had only 500k idos?  
**A:** We’re on a chain with 200m TVL so it’s not really comparable

We have a much higher hill to climb

**Q:** How is 1WBTC used as collateral on the Tranquil Finance site currently, there is 212.3432 1WBTC in the supply markets?  
**A:** 1WBTC is bridged from ethereum and is not native to Harmony ONE. The 1BTC solution the harmony team is building will allow cheap and simpler way to bridge BTC into harmony.

They are 2 different tokens. We hope to partner with Harmony and incentivize people to use 1BTC

1WBTC is different than 1BTC. 1WBTC is bridged from ethereum, but 1BTC is from the new Bitcoin bridge

**TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 2. Good Bad Ugly

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what [exchange platforms](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/its-bye-or-buy-nance) are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don’t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# Apply To Your Project

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add."

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

**TLDR**:For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.

# General Conclusion

Last week, we talked about a possibility of going back to the international gold standard by replacing gold with bitcoin. Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

Terrified about doing college for Computer Engineer undergrad.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qtxzqf/terrified_about_doing_college_for_computer/,PrthReddits,1,2021-11-15 03:59:03,15,/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qtxzqf/terrified_about_doing_college_for_computer/,Major Choice,"Hello I really need some advice and appreciate all the help I can get. Apologies for the lengthy post, but thank you very much in advance if you can read through all the way it to help me out.

I recently joined this sub because I was planning to major in Computer Engineering and have been lurking, reading some posts and comments occasionally. I am a senior in high-school, and I chose computer engineering because computer hardware interests me and I'd like to design it, but I also want to be involved in programming so I can go for a career in either electrical engineering or software engineering. 

After reading a lot of posts and everything, I am absolutely terrified about picking engineering as a major and a future career. It seems like the classes are extremely difficult, require great time investment, and great perseverance and mental fortitude. I have pretty good grades in highschool (3.9 GPA with 12-14 AP classes in total taken after this year) but many of these do not relate to engineering and many don't take much time investment. The only engineering related things I will have done in HS are AP Calc BC (calc 2), AP comp sci A (Java programming), and AP Physics 1 (algebra based phys). I have not done much coding outside of school, though I have tinkered with a little webscraping; I don't really know what to apply programming to at the moment that would interest me, so I have no projects to work at outside of school. I basically have 0 engineering related extracurriculars at all. The worst part is I am not even sure if I would enjoy, or at the very least, find fulfillment/not dislike a career in this field because of the fact that high school essentially tells you nothing about how the career world works. 

I am quite afraid for the future also because of the fact that I am bad at coping with failure. I once received a B in a single semester of honors pre-calculus and remembered writing a suicide note; that was one of the darkest times of my life even though it was trivial in hindsight and irrelevant since I did much better in actual Calc. I have often cried about failing exams and have gone into depressive states for days on end, hurting both myself and some of my closest friends with my horrible behavior. Although this has improved over the years, it is still a major issue that, based on what I have read, will surely be catalyzed by the difficulty of engineering classes in college. I would start my very first semester with calculus based physics with labs and calculus 3, which are absolutely terrifying to me, due to my credits in high school. My emotional and social intelligence are extremely low, as I often feel isolated from others around me and have a hard time thinking or expressing myself in a manner that seems typical and acceptable. I want to blossom in college and fix these flaws, but I am worried they might become worse in an engineering major.

I am aware I am quite ahead compared to other students, as with my credits, I have the option to get a 3 or 3.5 year bachelors in comp eng with my parents being able to pay for my college + scholarships helping out. I am aware my prospects are bright, but I myself am terrified and might turn this whole ordeal into a self fulfilling prophecy of failure. I am always thinking of my future. Every day. I am terrified and worried about failure, about the prospect of failure, and about coping for failure. In fact, a 66% on my last Physics 1 exam prompted me to write this, and before writing it, I imagined myself driving to a hotel in college in the middle of the night and shooting myself after failing an exam. I always resort to the worst outcome and scenario in my mind when any single event does not go the way I wanted it to. 

I believe these destructive tendencies are from the result of comparing myself to my peers for years, peers who are at the 99th percentile of intelligence in the US, who score the highest marks on every exam, who can take any form of rigor, who are all geniuses in their own right with ironclad work ethics, perseverance, emotional intelligence, and coping mechanisms. This comparison has been reduced over time, but I still see their feats and often wish I could be like them. After all, they are my closest and best friends. 

If I can't cope with these trivial problems in high school, I simply don't understand how I will succeed in an engineering field even though I am ahead of the curve and could technically do it reasonably in 3.5 or 3 years. I am also afraid of investing all this time to make my problems worse, and even if I were to get through college, of not enjoying my career or finding it monotonous. I am afraid more than ever, and I really need some clarity to fix my indecision before senior year ends. I am honestly not sure what other major I could do other than one in STEM; perhaps one in business/finance? I am interested in finance, but am turned off from the fact that lots of social/humanity classes are involved which I wouldn't find very interesting. This is why I see engineering as my only viable option. I want to go into engineering with clear resolve so I have the strength to persevere.

Thank you again for reading, I can clear anything up in the comments if needed. Sorry if anything was unclear."

https://preview.redd.it/vkzs1mz9fpz71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeda2f45799522db93d4bb8231be5469dfcd4c3d

 

Oct, 2021,vincy@footprint.network

Data Source：[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/9819c526-4bc6-4b58-9f30-70ee2401994a/aave-vs-compound-dashboard)

Despite its platform being launched in just 2020, Aave (AAVE) outgrew its established competitor Compound (COMP) and multiplied its market cap eightfold within half a year. In an industry with plenty of fast ascents and precipitous falls, many wondered whether the platform had the staying power to remain a central institution in DeFi lending . 

Nearly 2 years later, Aave is still going span, especially in relation to its one-time close rival. 

This article will take a closer look at the two platform’s strengths and weaknesses and explain why Aave was able to overtake Compound.

**Aave and Compound TVL Compared**

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics： TVL \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/f8h8p1ijfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e386bfc1aaac1af81fdf4debd7d4ebeab12c9eb)

As of Oct. 20, the DeFi market has surpassed $200 billion in total locked-in value (TVL) at $241.575 billion, with Aave’s TVL gaining the largest share at $18.89 billion. This is followed by lending protocols Curve ($18.01 billion), MakerDAO ($16.4 billion) and Compound ($12 billion).

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Latest changes to the ranking of the top 10 TVL platforms](https://preview.redd.it/21c2ormkfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e549794d93469f3b1ecde9ecfe7db9213f8181d0)

In the lending space, Aave's TVL has been way ahead of Compound in the last six months. This can be attributed to its model, which is similar to traditional finance, and ability to operate in Financial Conduct Authority-encrypted assets.

**Comparison of Market Cap**

As of Oct. 20, Aave continues to dwarf Compound in the DeFi lending and borrowing industry with a market cap of over US$4 billion versus the latter’s $1.97 billion. 

There are two other metrics that indicate Aave’s span position in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave VS Compound Market Cap \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qw2ryvrlfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9b83cd712b4ec7e0fa662fedb20e3bcd508f6a)

First, its circulating supply of 82% is higher than Compound’s 61%, indicating less inflationary pressure. 

Second, Aave has not had any major security incidents, indicating better security mechanisms likely favoured by depositors. 

**Aave’s deposit volumes dominate**

Aave's deposit volume of approximately $21 billion has remained higher than Compound's estimated $18 billion. Compound previously went live with subsidised lending and mining (disguisedly raised deposit returns and lowered lending rates to compete with Aave). Today, Aave has turned to lending and mining, coupled with Polygon's deposit and lending subsidies. Compound's rate advantage has largely disappeared as a side-effect of Aave's ecosystem bargaining power.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave VS Compound Deposited Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/cvm50yumfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3905bf49ce749fca4785daefd1400a1a01dad643)

The Aave team continues to focus on innovation while being highly risk-aware, and adjusts the direction of the product in a timely manner when issues arise, making the platform more secure.

**Can Aave users lend out more assets than Compound?**

Data for the previous month shows that Aave's borrowing balance has levelled off above $8.2 billion per day, which is still higher than Compound’s borrowing balance of $5-7 billion, with little overall volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave vs Compound Borrowed Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/galyhuynfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b3d7e77bdc38d4b1511927b2aef32bd4c705db)

Aave supports a wider variety of tokens, allowing users to lend out more assets and have more liquidity available. Some of Aave's rate agreements are also considered more innovative and have some advantages over Compound, such as unsecured flash loans, rate swaps and line of credit mandates. But on the downside, it comes with relatively high lending rates and loan fees.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Footprint Analytics：Aave's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/7zmxrlxofpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f2ac0af00f9ad43ef9485bf6b65715a40967d1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Compound's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/jek2itypfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e505296989245dd7a1eb2a9e34e5da801f12932a)

Aave and Compound support a variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as DAI, USDC and USDT, and non-stablecoins such as WBTC and UNI. With Aave, users mainly pledge ETH to lend USDC, DAI and USDT.  With Compound, users pledge ETH to lend DAI and USDC. While the supply of DAI and USDC is about the same, the former has more demand than the latter.

It is also worth noting that  Aave is one of the few licensed projects and is freely convertible in the United Kingdom.

**Differences in liquidation**

There are currently two traditional liquidation methods: the auction format of MakerDao and the liquidation method of Aave and Compound, which operate on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Compound sets a liquidation line of 75% as well as a borrowing rate that triggers liquidation when 100% is reached. However, only 50% of its assets will be liquidated. 

Aave, on the other hand, has a 5% safety cushion, mitigates risk, especially for new users.

Note: While the two liquidation methods have some efficiency issues, Liquity is a more innovative liquidation mechanism that differs from the traditional methods of MakerDao, Aave and Compound, as discussed in the article [Footprint: Can Liquity's mechanism really catch up from behind?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyTQi_HplDLXmXx7E9s-EEsqu32HrJxdCbCK66COCKM/edit#heading=h.lgi4s1f3dx3m) 

**Conclusion**

In summary, Aave continues its dominance over Compound, mainly due to  the following points:

* Aave has been more aggressive in innovation and business expansion, having more types of tokens released on its platform and gaining relative traction on unsecured flash lending, automated market makers, line of credit mandates, and with the traditional finance industry.
* On 19 October 2021, Aave TVL hit an all-time high that was made possible by the team behind the company whose focus is on safety, risk management and product strategy.
* Aave has progressed much  faster in terms of compliance to mitigate risk.

Why is hiring a financial advisor the first thing you should do for your business or personal finances?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_avendusgroup/comments/que6b0/why_is_hiring_a_financial_advisor_the_first_thing/,avendusgroup,1,2021-11-15 19:16:06,0,/r/u_avendusgroup/comments/que6b0/why_is_hiring_a_financial_advisor_the_first_thing/,NaN,"  

Financial advisors work with anyone who needs professional help in deciding the best course of action to utilize and possibly grow their money. Entities ranging from individual investors to multinational corporations depend on [financial advisory services](https://www.avendus.com/india/) to help them create strategies to secure their finances, create more wealth, reduce costs and settle debts.

**How financial advisors help a business:**

**They help you set up your business** \- Starting a business takes a lot of planning, work, connections and capital. Whether you’re being funded by a [Venture Capital](https://www.avendus.com/india/) firm, or you are starting from scratch, every phase of developing a business takes a lot of careful planning. And while you are busy setting up the various aspects of your dream project, keeping up with your finances and finding the most effective ways to save cost and utilize money better becomes difficult. It is best to avoid any financial oversight, especially in the early stage of a business since it may ruin your relationship with the vendors or cause the business to shut down.

**They help you grow** – Financial advisory services are not just limited to managing your existing money, maintaining a positive cash flow, and ensure timely payments, they also help you grow your money by helping you strategize how to invest, economize, and look for opportunities. Their astute observation and understanding of the financial markets help you find out which securities to invest in our which [hedge fund](https://www.avendus.com/india/asset-management) shows the most promise of consistently positive returns.

**They help you evolve** – Let’s say you have a company which has hit the ground running and is performing brilliantly. People love your services and now you are unable to cope with the increased demand. Obviously, you have a plan to expand, but you failed to get the funding required to do it. Financial advisors will help you source funding from independent investors or venture capital firms by using their connections and helping you meet the right people.

How financial advisors help individuals:

They help you learn – For an individual with little to no experience in dealing with their personal finances, or even for seasoned investors, financial advisory services help them answer the many questions - how do I invest in securities, what is a hedge fund, what does the current trend indicate, how do I diversify my risks, what is the right time to sell? Financial advisors consistently analyse the market and consider your investment limits, goals and objectives to formulate a personalised strategy to help you manage and grow your wealth.

They keep you ahead of the curve – Being in the world of finance, advisors usually get the whiff of which venture capital firm is raising a round of funding for which start-up. Such insights are valuable information for an individual investor and will help you invest in the right securities at the right time, so you can make a huge profit. Depending on the risk-taking nature of their client, a financial advisor will help you play safe by investing in traditional MFs and hedge funds, or they’ll help you take an insight-driven risk by motivating an investment in an IPO."

I was already starting to look into alternative options as I've felt like I'm outgrowing the software. My objectives shifted from debt paydown and short term savings into long term wealth accumulation and FIRE planning. The price change just accelerated the search for something better at those things. Is there an app out there that has a robust budget tool and allows users to keep an eye on investments and assets in a sane way as well? 

So far Quicken and Monarch money seem like the prime contenders to me, but Quicken has a steep learning curve and weird cross platform differences, and Monarch has a few hiccups with managing non-investment savings between months. Not terribly concerned about cost if it can manage those things well.

Must have features are auto-import and customizable budget categories. 

Thanks in advance!"
Which protocols actually distributes their fees?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qvvfrf/which_protocols_actually_distributes_their_fees/,karthur26,1,2021-11-17 17:20:18,6,/r/defi/comments/qvvfrf/which_protocols_actually_distributes_their_fees/,NaN,"Hi everyone, I'm trying to research into different protocols and which ones actually share their profits with holders?

Here's what I've found, please correct me if I'm representing anything wrong:

* **Ethereum**: fees from the blocks are burned, sometimes more but usually less than the block rewards. https://watchtheburn.com/
* **Uniswap**: 0.3% trading fees in v2 go to the reserves for LPs, and v3 has swap and pool fees, of which none goes to token holders. https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/fees
* **Sushiswap**: 0.3% fee where 0.25% goes to LP and 0.05% goes to a pool that buys SUSHI and gives it to xSUSHI holders (SUSHI stakers) https://help.sushidocs.com/products/sushiswap-exchange https://analytics.sushi.com/bar (they note that xSUSHI holders are getting ~10% APY)
* **Pancakeswap**: 0.25% trading fee, 0.17% of which to LP, 0.03% to treasury, and 0.05% buys CAKE and burned.
* **MakerDao**: they charge a ""stability fee"" ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% APY and then this fee goes to burn MKR tokens https://makerdao.world/en/learn/vaults/stability-fees/
* **Curve Finance**: 0.04% fees on pools, half goes to LP and half goes to veCRV holders (CRV stakers). https://curve.fi/rootfaq


My thesis is that tokens that distribute profits (in the form of buyback or burning) will attract more investors and also long term price sustainability. Burning the tokens would benefit all holders, whereas buy/distribute would only benefit the recipients (ie xSUSHI).  The buy and burn can also be countered by huge mints that cause supply inflation and therefore dilutes the token value.

Overall, this is pretty gloomy imo of tokens that would actually generate meaningful value and distribute.  Any others I should be looking at?"

This is not financial advice. 

**TLDR**:

Asset management is a large market sector in traditional finance with revenue generating $4.2B per year. This is an opportunity for non-crypto native users to tap into the growing DeFi opportunity, and for the DeFi projects to move in this direction or collaborate with existing partners.

In this article, we have shown how five asset managers work. These managers are basically quite similar in operation and token use case. However, each strategy in each protocol is different, leading to different rates of return.

 

# General Conclusion

In the traditional financial market, you may be quite familiar with the ""index baskets"" such as S&amp;P500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), etc. These index baskets each include a lot of financial assets. Products designed by leading experts, helping you diversify your portfolio risk and achieve investment performance in the simplest way.

In this article we will compare 5 blockchain-based asset managers by their goals, how they work, and what is the use case of their tokens.

# Yearn Finance

yEarn Finance is a liquidity aggregator, running on the Ethereum blockchain for lending platforms. yEarn Finance helps users achieve the highest profit during smart contract interactions.

What is the problem that yEarn Finance sets out to solve?

Liquidity mining programmes like Compound or Aave are places that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to provide liquidity and earn profits.

Currently, more and more similar protocols are appearing, with flexible forms of change. The problem is: how can LPs maximise their profits? It is very difficult to switch between protocols continuously.

yEarn Finance was born to solve this problem. It makes it easy for users to optimise profits with algorithms to compare, choose the place with the highest revenue, save research time and switch between parties.

yEarn uses the following protocols for aggregation: Compound, dY/dX, Aave, Curve, and supports the following stablecoins $DAI, $USDC, $USDT, $TUSD, $sUSD, and more.

# Dhedge

dHedge is a decentralised asset management protocol built on Ethereum. dHedge allows anyone to create their own investment fund on Ethereum or invest in funds managed by others in a completely non-custodial way using Synthetics Assets. dHedge brings decentralised, permissionless services to traditional wealth management services.

# Harvest Finance

Harvest Finance is an automated yield farming protocol that allows profit sharing between 'hard worker' and 'farmer'.

Harvest Finance automatically collects the highest returns from DeFi protocols and optimises the profits received using the latest farming techniques.

# Indexed Finance

Indexed Finance is a project focused on developing passive portfolio management strategies for the Ethereum network.

Indexed Finance is managed by $NDX governance token holders, which are used to vote on protocol update proposals and high-level index management, such as defining market sectors and creating new management strategies for investors.

# Vesper Finance

Vesper provides a platform for DeFi products that are easily accessible to users. Vesper DeFi products make it easy for users to achieve financial goals in the crypto space.

Vesper Products: At launch, Vesper offered many profitable “Grow Pools” that allow users to increase profits from holding coins like BTC, ETH, VSP, DAI, USDC. Vesper Grow Pools represent the first product on the Vesper platform. Further products will be provided to users in the near future.

Basically, it's like Yearn.finance (YFI). Vesper helps users maximise profits by automatically sending their funds to high-interest protocols: Compound, AAVE, Curve, Uniswap, etc."

Fantom Farming report Nov 18th,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantomFoundation/comments/qwkcf9/fantom_farming_report_nov_18th/,BBrendanBB,1,2021-11-18 15:19:16,25,/r/FantomFoundation/comments/qwkcf9/fantom_farming_report_nov_18th/,NaN,"Hi, I am addicted to farming the fantom ecosystem. Here are my thoughts and strategies for this week. Feel free to share your strategies, new projects you joined and everything else! i want to know

1-Farms I am currently in: Spooky, Spirit, Beethoven X, tomb, curve, reaper, grim, scream, geist, abracadabra, yearn. I didnot open any new farms on ftm this week. I have focused my research efforts on GameFi, and I have not found any good project on fantom (Rarity is cool, but it is still being built and it is not investable). FYI I decided to join the $ron mining on Ronin chain with a small bag of eth

2-Ftm ecosystem tokens price action: 

* it has been a bloodbath as of late. We were already down big time since the end of October and last week has seen declines between -50% (scream) and -23%(boo). This does not suit my plan very well. I had planned to reinvest all my farming profits from July to October and start using 50% of my weekly farming projects to pay back my borrowed stable coins in November. I feel like some tokens really have a lot of price potential (boo, spirit, tomb, beet) so I am going to reduce to 25% the portion of my weekly farming profits that will be used to pay back my leverage. 
* There are also tokens I feel need to improve their value prop: 
   * Tarot: currently, it is not much more than a farming token. Tigris announced that xTarot is coming and I suppose this will mean that xTarot holders will be entitled to a portion of the fees and eventually vote on proposition. 
      * **I think Tarot usage would sky rocket if they just made the UI to look more like AAVE or geist.** People only see the leveraged LP aspect of the protocol. It looks complicated. But what people don't seem to realize is that you can use the protocol just like a basic AAVE style money market AND often get 40% + apr on single side deposit.
   * Scream: need more use case for the scream token. This is a great money market but I don't understand why:
      * 1-we can't deposit Scream and use it as collateral (come on, show a little confidence in your token)
      * 2-Why they keep the borrowing APR so high. This really turns me off from any borrowing strategies. I take all my borrowing strategies to geist and use Scream pretty much only to deposit.

3-Tomb is still the star of the ecosystem, Harry Yeh is the king of Fantom DeFi and soon Fantom CeFi.

* tomb finance is the best degen opportunity if you ask me. The APR's are insane considering I feel the project is of relatively low risk now. Think about it for a second: 
   * The contracts have been live for 3+ months now, and the best black hats have tried to exploit them. The tax contract that was exploited is now simply removed (love this ballsy move!)
   * Harry Yeh is the official backer of the project. Harry is FTM royalty, his reputation has value. He will not let this project fail
   * The CeFi partnership with binance is huge IMO and it places tomb, tshares and tbonds at the center of the project. The amount of non-crypto friends I have who tell me they want to get in to DeFi but don't do it because it is too complicated... this is the gateway drug for them. Normies will come

4-Other projects (non-farming):

* Retreeb: their token mooned this week and I started researching the project. Cool ftm based payment project
* $GM: I bought my firs t meme coin. I love the GM culture in crypto. Swapped 50 FTM for an incredilbe amount of GM token. It dumped big time, they are worth nothing now. I am not fuking selling! GM peeps!"

I'm about to bridge 1k to the Fantom network, and I'm trying to figure out what strategy to go with.  I'm thinking of buying the FTM dip, depositing for ywFTM, then using either Abracadabra or Mai finance to borrow against, then use the stablecoins to...?   Farm Spell?  Farm curve? Buy more FTM?  SHould I long some Daneile coins like Spell or Ice?    Should I loop the ywFTM in hopes of a nice market bounce back?   SHould I just put the whole 1k in Time and let it do its thing?  Time hasnt really dipped or else I might be leaning towards this.  

What are you all doing during the dip and whats your high yield strategies on Fantom?"

Based on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/harmony_markets/comments/qt3iht/market_analysis_and_ones_state/), we have since entered scenario 1 of price action where ONE has fallen below the descending wedge in the ONE/USD chart. The first major stop is the 50% level (From the local high in march to now) which sits at $0.21321. I will give some updated views about this target and general TA for BTC and ONE.

While a lot of the metrics are bearish, I'm not deliberately making it out as such and is just a reflection of chart patterns. My interpretations of the mare my own and reflect my own plans.

# BTC

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC\/USDT Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/eek7r8ce3g081.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782e0bea9fadf8eba24f50541d11581c77d37998)

Major patterns &amp; signs

* 10d EMA crosses below the 20d EMA
* Formed double top pattern (neckline @ $58.3k, target @ $48K), although not the cleanest.
* Daily close below the 50d EMA ($59k)

Potential supports

* 100d EMA is at $54.3k
* Upward log channel since mid july shows a bottom around $52.5k to $54k (depends how fast we descend to it). This bottom was touched during the september dip before we initiated the recent rally.
* 21 week EMA is at $51.7k and 20 week MA is at $48.5k
* Previous local high at $53k

Indicators

* Daily RSI is 40 and 4h RSI has been sitting at &lt;=40 for a few days.
* Stoch RSI at 0
* Recent daily volume is above 7d average

Other

* Latest 24 hour liquidations are \~$500m
* I think the last 7 days liquidations are \~1.4b

Thoughts:

I think there is a decent chance of going down further and believe the $52k to $54k will be strong support as multiple metrics are lining up in confluence. The double top target is technically at the 48k level but I think the buying pressure will be too much for the price to actually reach that point.

In order to invalidate the down trend the next daily close must be above $58.3k, hold and do so with good volume. I think this will be particularly difficult as the general market is still too greedy and still seems to be overleveraged based on coinglass. Even during these moves the liquidations charts are still showing multiple 24h windows of &gt;=$300m liquidations (most are longs).

I do believe that a full move to the bottom of the channel is a healthy correction before making a next move up. When the recovery comes, I think it will be very sudden and explosive as leveraged short positions will be liquidated in similar fashion as we're seeing now with longs.

# ONE

Major daily patterns &amp; signs

* Broken below descending wedge (and retested), with price target of $0.17825.
* Daily price is below the previous local high @$0.255 (on closing)
* Sitting on a major upward sloping support line since july, this is at $0.242
* Sitting below the 10 week EMA \~@$0.239
* Sitting on upwards channel on the ONE/BTC chart.

Potential supports

* Major 50% level @$0.21321
* 100d EMA @$0.21128
* 20 week EMA @ $0.197

Indicators

* RSI @ 40
* Stoch RSI \~@ 0

ML Forecast

&amp;#x200B;

[ML Forecast - showing a trend reversal soon](https://preview.redd.it/g3p9ks2g8g081.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c527c0ccbe6cc0322cc37711106bc1e7ba5760b0)

Thoughts:

As mentioned before, we have fallen into scenario 1 so I am targeting the 50% level as the first major support. I think the lack of volume for the spikes down is an immediate concern as it signals that the floor is further down. I also think that the retest of the descending wedge and subsequent breakdown was confirmation of lower price levels. If BTC does breakdown further into the 52k to 54k range and ONE/BTC can hold then the ONE price target of $0.213 is also reasonable. In general, many metrics are pointing in confluence down to the lower $0.20s as target.

A potential reversal, I think, would require closing within the descending pattern and hold or keep pumping after a few days. This would be around the $0.26 mark. Although a clean reversal would require BTC to also do the same thing which is also quite bearish.

On a super speculative front: The forecast model is showing a potential reversal by next week. This seems to be confluent around the daily RSI and stoch RSI being quite low over the last week and giving plenty of room to move up.

The main good thing I am seeing is that ONE seems to put in intra-day highs in the ONE/USD and ONE/BTC charts. These are good signs that despite the shit show in BTC/USD, ONE is still able to perform some of these moves.

From a dev and pure tech fundamental level, no major bad news has occurred for Harmony (AFAIK). In fact they've mainly been positive:

* BTC bridge is progressing within their timeline
* Many defi and nft projects are getting grants to develop in Harmony
* Average daily transactions are steadily moving up
* Major project development recently (eg. euphoria, tranquil finance and tranquility city) that are not just a generic DEX.
* Adoption of blue chip defi platforms such as Curve, Aave and Sushi.

The main thorn I can think of is the delay on Chainlink roll out which seems to be on their side rather than Harmony's. Further delay will have timeline consequences on BTC bridge rollout and other advanced defi functionality.

# Closing Thoughts

Outside of major development and external news, I think it is reasonable to expect ONE to move further down before beginning the next leg up. During times like this, alt coins bleed hard against BTC and are very dependent on BTC finding a bottom and making a move up. I think its important to use these opportunities to further build up your positions in ONE and other projects you believe in. **Nothing bad has technologically or fundamentally changed for ONE.**"
An Introduction to DeFi Part 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx637g/an_introduction_to_defi_part_1/,lrod45,12,2021-11-19 10:31:53,66,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx637g/an_introduction_to_defi_part_1/,DISCUSSION,"Long post ahead. This is aimed at being educational (not financial advice) so there is no TL;DR. If you want to learn more about DeFi read on.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I made a post about DeFi and why folks should be paying attention to it and it got a decent amount of attention. A comment I saw come up quite a bit was how people still didn't really understand what exploring the DeFi space meant. There seemed to be interest in learning more about DeFi but not a lot of resources on getting started. Therefore I decided to write a multipart series breaking down DeFi for newcomers and explaining how to actually use the space. This first part will really focus on what Defi is and define a few things to get us all on the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is DeFi? Defi is a movement that allows people to use financial services (borrowing, lending, trading) without the need of a centralized entity like a bank. These services are generally provided by Decentralized Apps (DApps), generally deployed on the Ethereum Network.

&amp;#x200B;

So we know what DeFi is but that's still pretty broad. So what are all the parts of DeFi? Good question. Let's break it down into several categories.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Stablecoins - coins that are pegged to stable assets such as the US dollar. USDT is by far the most popular in terms of use but there are a few other options such as USDC, DAI, and BUSD. While stable coins are DApps themselves, they do make accessibility into DeFi easier since crypto can be extremely volatile
2. Lending and Borrowing - DeFi removes the restrictions that are created by banks when it comes to lending and borrowing money. It also allows people that don't have access to a bank the ability to lend and borrow. Things like credit score become irrelevant in this space. The only thing you need is crypto assets to participate. You can earn a yield by depositing assets and you can borrow against assets you stake in protocols.
3. Exchanges - Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance work as intermediaries and custodians of traded assets. This means your assets are on their platform and they are technically in control of your assets (not your keys, not your crypto). DEXs (decentralized exchanges) allow users to exchange crypto without giving up custody of your coins. Since your funds stay with you, you don't need to trust that the exchange remains solvent.
4. Lottery - DeFi Lottery Daaps have started popping up as DeFi continues to disrupt finance. These Dapps allow users to pool their funds together and invest in a lending app earning interest. At a set interval a random winner is selected to win. all the funds earned in the pool. The ""tickets"" are then refunded to all participants creating a ""no-loss"" lottery. Sidenote: There is a loss here and that's the opportunity of earning those rewards by staking yourself.
5. Governance - this is the business management of crypto. Think like a board of directors except anyone who owns a governance token for an Daap has voting rights. 

There are a few other categories that can fall under the DeFi umbrella but these are in my opinion some of the more popular ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before we get into how to access Dapps and participate in Defi, we need to have an understanding of the Decentralized Layer. Many blockchains give people the ability to build Dapps using their blockchain but Ethereum is by far the most popular so let's start there. Ethereum allows software developers to write smart contracts on the Ethereum block chain. Smart Contracts is essentially a programmable contract that allows two parties to set conditions of a transaction without the trust of an outside party. For example, when you buy a home, a title company is generally responsible for the transfer of assets between both parties. A smart contract would eliminate the need for the title company and handle the transfer all on the blockchain.

Multiple smart contracts are combined together to work hand in hand to create a decentralized application (DApp). This allows Dapps to handle complex processes.

&amp;#x200B;

Dapps have a number of pros and cons to them just like most things in life.

**Advantages**

1. Immutability -  once it's deployed on the blockchain it cant be changed
2. Tamper-proof - cant be tampered with without everyone on the blockchain knowing
3. Transparency - they are openly auditable (many developers have third parties audit their code)
4. Availability - Dapps built on ETH will remain usable as long as ETH remains active

**Disadvantages**

1. Immutability - Human errors are common and as mentioned above, once deployed a contract can't be changed
2. Transparent - transparency can also lead to hackers finding exploits in the code
3. Scalability - Dapps are generally limited to the bandwidth available on the blockchain it lives on

A few example of Dapps include AAVE, MAKER, Compound, Anchor Protocol, and Curve Finance.

 Most Dapps are plug and play. You go to their site and you connect your wallet and you're good to use the platform. As far as wallets go, MetaMask is the most popular option available. If you don't have a MetaMask wallet I would recommend opening one up. Coinbase Wallet is also an option and for mobile Argent wallet is a good option.

In a later post I will go over how to participate in some of these protocols. Due to Ethereum gas fees this can be pretty expensive. Luckily, there are a few options to make this cheaper. Layer 2 solutions exist to help us out with this. Ill briefly discuss what Layer 1 and Layer 2.

**Layer 1 (L1)** \- this is the term used to describe the underlying main blockchain architecture. In our case this would be the Ethereum blockchain.

**Layer 2 (L2)** \- is the term used to describe a network built on top of another blockchain. Examples of this would be the Matic, Arbitrum, or Avalanche networks. They are all built on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows them access to all the Ethereum network provides such as liquidity. Fees are generally much lower on these networks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 will go over some of these protocols, what they offer, and how to use them. So keep an eye out. If there is anything you'd like me to cover in this series or if there is anything you'd like for me to expand upon from this post feel free to ask below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am still learning how to navigate DeFi and am by no means an expert. I will do my best to answer any questions but make sure you do your own research on anything I mention. As I continue my DeFi journey I want to share the knowledge I am gaining as this space can seem very scary and unwelcoming."

The trips will be covered by the travel fee, which is 4% when selling. We will draw at predetermined amounts, but there will be not just one but several prize trips, linked to how long the winner has been a holder. So the longer someone has been a holder and the more CrtT tokens they own they will win more valuable travels.
The holders will be able to vote on the value of the trips to be won. As soon as the amount you have pre-voted for has been added to the travel wallet, we will hold the voting and coordinate the destinations with the winners.



A mere prize draw would of course not be enough to justify a new token. We aim to build ongoing partnerships with various players in the tourism sector, such as hotels and travel agencies. The development of our accommodation and travel search website will be the real milestone in the life of the project, as it will be the first Hungarian-developed project to use cryptocurrency to finance travel and to claim time-based discounts.

CryptoTravel's main goal is to create a secure and transparent system where holders can not only make a profit, but also win trips and exchange their assets for travels. We will make an useful yet affordible way to travel around the world using your cryptocurrency. As a team our ultimate goal is to build a long-term project with a highly detailed roadmap and transparent curve. Loyalty is the biggest value as a holder so we will reward them accordingly.
We will work on a cashback system with our partnered booking accomodation sites. Yes you read right! We will give tokens as cashback when you travel throught our partners.

Introducing Uniswap V3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnityNetwork/comments/qxbsqy/introducing_uniswap_v3/,Alina-6727,1,2021-11-19 16:27:31,1,/r/UnityNetwork/comments/qxbsqy/introducing_uniswap_v3/,NaN,"Uniswap now serves as a critical infrastructure for decentralized finance, empowering developers, traders, and liquidity providers to participate in a secure and robust financial marketplace.

Today, we are excited to present an overview of Uniswap v3. 

Uniswap v3 introduces:

\-Concentrated liquidity, giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against

\-Multiple fee tiers, allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk

These features make Uniswap v3 the most flexible and efficient AMM ever designed:

\-LPs can provide liquidity with up to 4000x capital efficiency relative to Uniswap v2, earning higher returns on their capital.

\-Capital efficiency paves the way for low-slippage trade execution that can surpass both centralized exchanges and stablecoin-focused AMMs.

\-LPs can significantly increase their exposure to preferred assets and reduce their downside risk.

\-LPs can sell one asset for another by adding liquidity to a price range entirely above or below the market price, approximating a fee-earning limit order that executes along a smooth curve.

At Unity Network, we’re focused on giving you the best user experience possible. You can take advantage of this next stage of DeFi’s development because Unity Network’s UNT token is now available on Uniswap V3 (Arbitrum)!

An Introduction to DeFi Part 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxmfeu/an_introduction_to_defi_part_2/,lrod45,1,2021-11-20 02:31:19,10,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxmfeu/an_introduction_to_defi_part_2/,DISCUSSION,"Welcome to part of my Intro to DeFI series. If you haven't read part 1 I would recommend taking a read, especially if you aren't familiar with the space at all. It can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx637g/an_introduction_to_defi_part_1/)

&amp;#x200B;

In part 2 I am going to discuss the AAVE Dapp and talk about decentralized exchanges. Before we get started on that let's do a brief overview on wallets as a wallet will be necessary. There are two types of wallets out there: custodial and non-custodial.

**Custodial Wallets**

Custodial wallets are wallets where third parties keep and maintain control of your crypto for you. Think of centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. When you hold your crypto on these exchanges, your crypto lives in their wallet and you are trusting that the'll store your coins safely.

**Non-custodial Wallets**

Non-custodial wallets are wallets where you take full control and owneship of your crypto. You are responsible for storing your crypto safely and have full control over what you do with it. You'll need to be fully prepared to store your private keys safely as if you lose them, you'll lose access to your crypto. Many people believe in the ""not your keys, not your coins"" mantra and therefore will use non-custodial wallets to remain in control.

The most popular wallet for users is MetaMask. It's a simple web browser extension and they also have an app available for your phone. I'm going to assume you have a MetaMask wallet, but if you don't I would suggest setting one up, it's pretty simple and self explanatory.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright now that we have wallets out of the way let's dive in to some DeFi. Many people new to the Defi space are generally confused as to how they can access Dapps. Where do you go? Is it simply a website somewhere? The short answer is yes. Remember, Defi is just using financial services without the need for a central party like a bank. You may be wondering, well how decentralized can Defi really be since an DApp/protocol is being used. That's a very good question. The truth is that there currently doesn't exist any protocol that is TRULY decentralized. The best we have are Semi-decentralized Dapps which are generally non-custodial, are permissionless, have decentralized interest rate determinations, decentralized development/updates. The examples I provided in post 1 (AAVE, Compound, dYdX, etc) are semi decentralized opposed to completely centralized places like BlockFi, Nexo, or Celsius.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright let's dive into a Dapp. I have recently used AAVE for borrowing/lending which I personally believe is one of the biggest benefits of DeFi, so let's start there. Note: this isn't advice and I don't think people should over-leverage themselves although DYOR and do what you're comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

**AAVE**

Aave is a decentralized money market protocol that has been around for a while and has a very large amount of funds locked in it's smart contracts.

Aave has 8 key features that it makes available to users:

1. Lots of asset supported for lending/borrowing
2. Stable and variable interest rates on loans
3. Rate switching - able to switch between stable and variable rates (depending on assets)
4. Collateral swap - you may choose what you provide as collateral and are free to swap it to other assets
5. Repayment with collateral - you can pay your loan with collateral at any time
6. Flash loans - loan taken out with no collateral that must be paid in the same transaction
7. Flash liquidation - ability to utilize flash loans to borrow capital as part of a liquidation bond (allows for a liquidator to get a liquidation bonus without using their own capital)
8. Native credit delegation - borrowers can extend their credit lines to other who wish to borrow with higher collateral in exchange for a higher interest rate

As you can see there are a lot of things you can participate in on their Dapp. Depending on how you use the Dapp can expose you to a varying amount of risk. It's up to you how much risk you want to take on and what your risk tolerance is. 

The Aave market is built on Ethereum and as we know gas fees can get pretty extreme. Unfortunately, just about everything you do on their platform requires smart contract interaction, which means you have to pay gas. Luckily, they have added the ability to use a couple L2s. The polygon network and the Avalanche network are both layer 2 solutions you can use to lower fees substantially. I am personally using the Avalanche network on AAVE as the rewards are currently higher than polygon.

So how do you use it? Well it's as easy as going to their site, connecting your wallet and depositing some funds.  You can deposit a number of different coins and begin earning interest on it. Essentially when you deposit funds into their smart contract you are adding to the lending pool and people are borrowing your crypto and you get paid a part of the interest they have to pay back. At the time of this writing if you were to deposit USDC on the avalanche network you would earn 2.86% interest for simply keeping your funds tied up in their smart contract. There are also bonus rewards for using specific blockchains. For depositing on the Avalanche network you would also earn 4.78% interest on the amount of USDC deposited paid out in AVAX. Deposit funds on to the platform and earn interest and boom you have now participated in Defi! Honestly, not as exciting as it may seem when you hear about Defi but that's honestly as easy as it is. It's technically no different than staking your crypto somewhere. For instance, if you were to deposit into BlockFi you'd earn interest on your crypto, the only difference is that their platform is completely centralized.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: rewards are generally paid out in a wrapped from of whatever asset you are getting. On Avalanche you receive wAVAX (wrapped Avax) which essentially is the smart contract saying you are owed that amount in AVAX. the wrapped version of the asset is worth the same as the unwrapped version, and to get from the wrapped to unwrapped version you simply need to swap it on a Dex like TraderJoe.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people use this platform to yield farm. Yield farming is an investment strategy where people stake or lend crypto to generate returns. Recursive yield farming can get very risky, but can also lead to higher returns. Many people will stake, for example USDC, on AAVE and then take out a loan against that USDC also in USDC. Then they deposit that loan back into the platform and repeat the process. Say you deposit 5K USDC into Aave and then take out a 3k loan in USDC against it. You would then deposit that 3K bringing your total deposited USDC to 8K and now you're earning interest on the 8K deposited rather than initial 5. Some  people will even take their loans and move to other platforms where they can earn higher returns. Again, this can get very risky and it requires you to pay attention to your LTV ratio to ensure you don't get liquidated. Granted, with USDC it's a bit safer since there isn't market volatility, but if you begin to do it with other assets the risk goes through the roof.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is quick tutorial on how to get funds to Aave and stake them (and take a loan out if you so choose). Again this is educational and not me telling you to do this. DYOR and figure out what your risk tolerance is. Ill explain the process using the Avalanche network since there are better rewards currently. There are also other ways of accomplishing this, this is just how I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Install Metamask
2. Add the Avalanche network to metamask. Here is a nifty [link](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche) from Avalanche that breaks down how to do it. Once you do this make sure you're on the Avalanche network on Metamask
3. Buy some AVAX on Coinbase (or whatever exchange you prefer)
4. Send the AVAX to metamask. Note: The avalanche network has like 3 different chains on it. It can get pretty confusing to use and if you do this a different method you may need to make an avalanche wallet and send your funds there to switch chains to then send to metamask. If you send from Coinbase like I did it's already on the ETH based chain which lets you send directly to Metamask on the Avalanche network. I'd also recommend sending a small amount first to make sure you did this correctly.
5. Go to [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/home) (this is an example of a Dex) to swap some AVAX to USDC.e. You'll need to connect your wallet to their app to make the swap. Gas fees should be pretty negligible at this point since we aren't on L1. Also you'll probably need to approve your funds for swapping then you'll be able to swap.
   1. Alternatively, if you just wanna stake your AVAX no need to swap for USDC.e, you can continue on to the next step.
6. Go to [AAVE](https://app.aave.com/#/) and connect your wallet, make sure you click on the Avalanche version AAVE on their market page
7. Deposit the USDC.e and AVAX (leave a small amount in MM for transactions) If you just want to earn rewards stop here. If you want a loan continue to the next step.
8. Go to the borrow tab and select what currency you want to borrow. I borrowed USDC.e. There is a play you can do here which involves borrowing USDT.e. Lots of people fear that USDT could unpeg from the dollar and if this is the case and the price of USDT unpegged and dropped you'd only owe the USDT amount borrowed not the USD amount. For example if you borrowed 100 USDT.e and it unpegs and is now worth $0.50. You'd still owe 100 USDT.e but it's only be $50 in USD that you'd owe.

When you do this you'll see two interest rates for each asset. The top interest rate (and this is true for deposits or borrows) is the interest rate you are paid in the asset you deposit (for deposits) or the interest you have to pay (for borrowing). There is then a second interest rate below that with an AVAX symbol, that is what you will be paid in AVAX for using the platform. You'll get paid AVAX for depositing and for borrowing. You can claim it whenever you like and you are always free to claim it and deposit it to continue growing your bag. AVAX deposits are currently paying 13.42% (1.72% for depositing and 11.74% as an extra reward for using the platform).

Most other Dapps work similarly to what I described above. Deposit and asset and get paid on the interest. Some other Dapps pay for providing liquidaty pairs (meaning you are putting in a combination of assets so people can swap between them, you get paid a piece for every swap that occurs). This can be very risky, and Ill briefly touch on it below.

Now that we have discussed a Dapp let's discuss briefly a Decentralized Exchange (Dex)

**Decentralized Exchanges (Dex)**

While centralized exchanges (coinbase, binance) have plenty of liquidity and allow large trades, there is still the inherit risk of users not holding the custody over their assets. DEXs use smart contracts and on-chain transactions to reduce and eliminate the need for an intermediary. 

The two types of DEXs are order book-based and liquidity pool-based.

Uniswap, dYdX, Curve Finance, and SushiSwap are all examples of DEXs available for use in the Defi space.

Order-book DEXs, like dYdX, work similarly to CEXs where users can set buy and sell orders (market or limit orders), but the main difference is that the assets for the trade remain in the users' wallets rather than on the exchanges' wallets.

Liquidity-pool DEXs, like Uniswap, let users essentially become market makers by providing a liquidity pair to a pool of assets. Liquidity providers earn a small fee for each swap performed int hat pool, generally proportional to how much liquidity that user provided. Think of how Coinbase takes a fee for transactions made on their platform, instead of Coinbase getting paid for facilitating the transaction, the liquidity providers get paid that fee, hence decentralized finance.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, DeFi isn't really as exciting and mystifying as it seems when you don't know much about it. In a sense, it's basically all the same things you would do normally in crypto with the exception that there is no centralized party you need to trust to make this happen. Instead, everything is handled by smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

The more you dive into DeFi the more complicated things you can do and the more exciting things can get. With that the risk also tends to climb higher. I am using this mini-series as a brief introduction into the Defi space so keep that in mind!

&amp;#x200B;

My next post will probably be my last and it will discuss some of the risks associated with DeFI and probably some pros/cons about the DeFi space. If there is anything else you'd like for me to expand on feel free to let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have found this beneficial and helpful thus far!"

The trips will be covered by the travel fee, which is 4% when selling. We will draw at predetermined amounts, but there will be not just one but several prize trips, linked to how long the winner has been a holder.

As soon as the amount you have pre-voted for has been added to the travel wallet, we will hold the voting and coordinate the destinations with the winners.

A mere prize draw would of course not be enough to justify a new token. We aim to build ongoing partnerships with various players in the tourism sector, such as hotels and travel agencies.

Convex Finance (CVX): ONE Million CVX bought in CURVE Wars!,https://youtube.com/watch?v=5i0-V4nc0ok&amp;feature=share,333Crypto,1,2021-11-21 04:09:37,0,/r/CryptoMarsShots/comments/qydnow/convex_finance_cvx_one_million_cvx_bought_in/,NaN,
Introduction to DeFi yield farming opportunities across EVM-compatible chains,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyftw4/introduction_to_defi_yield_farming_opportunities/,e1icz,1,2021-11-21 05:57:25,12,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyftw4/introduction_to_defi_yield_farming_opportunities/,STAKING,"In January 2021, 99% of Total Value Locked (*TVL*) in Decentralized Finance (*DeFi*) was locked in Ethereum — today, Ethereum represents only 66% of TVL in DeFi. Do not understand it wrong, Ethereum is not on the decline by far because the TVL on Ethereum has tripled since January 2021. However, it is a fact that sidechains, parachains, and L2 chains, are currently attracting more and more money and can offer substantial yield opportunities similar to the Ethereum ecosystem with minimal transaction fees.

Let's have a look at some leading and growing Defi applications (*dApps*) on EVM(*Ethereum Virtual Machine*)-compatible fast-growing chains, particularly on *Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, Arbitrum, BSC, Moonriver, Optimism, and Cronos*. The advantage of these EVM-compatible chains is that they enable running the same Solidity code (*Smart contracts*) as on Ethereum. Also, they share the same standard for public addresses, and therefore interacting with these blockchains is practically the same as with Ethereum (e.g.., *Metamask* wallet can be used). The same address is supported across the aforementioned chains. The main difference is the transactions fees, which are 100-1000x lower than on the Ethereum mainnet.

# 1. Yield Aggregators

Provide auto-compounding to enhance yields on staked assets, typically liquidity pools (*LPs*) or incentivized single asset vaults. The yields are repetitively harvested in short intervals (hourly/daily) and compounded into the deposited principal, transforming the Annual Percentage Rate (*APR*) — i.e., the yearly interest generated by the invested sum — into Annual Percentage Yield (*APY*) — i.e., the interest generated by compounding the short-term profits. Farming with yield aggregators helps achieve greater yields than staking the underlying strategy not only by compounding but also by obtaining yield-aggregator-native or otherwise incentivized tokens of the underlying asset(s).

* **Beefy** \[1\] $1.2B on Avalanche, Harmony, BSC, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Moonriver, Cronos
* **Autofarm** \[2\] $472M on Avalanche, BSC, Fantom, Polygon, Fantom, Moonriver, Cronos
* **Yield Yak** \[3\] $485M on Avalanche
* **Tomb Finance** \[4\] $361M on Fantom
* **Snowball** \[5\] $79M on Avalanche

# 2. DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges)

Provide liquidity for trading pairs on the particular chain. Providing liquidity in pools entitles you to collect small fees from trades. The price movement of the underlying assets changes the proportions of your pooled assets with the constant sum formula, so you can use LP pools to accumulate more tokens of the asset when in a downtrend, or hedge against the price decline or growth typically using pairs with a stable coin on one end and volatile asset on the other.

* **PancakeSwap** \[6\] $6.32B on BSC
* **Curve** \[7\]  $2.5B on Avalanche, Harmony, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum (+$18.5B on Ethereum)
* **Trader Joe** \[8\] $2.43B on Avalanche
* **QuickSwap** \[9\] $708M on Polygon
* **Pangolin** \[10\] $479M on Avalanche
* **ApeSwap** \[11\] $362M on BSC and Polygon
* **Spookyswap** \[12\] $632M on Fantom
* **Defi Kingdoms** \[13\] $240M on Harmony
* **SushiSwap** \[14\] $170M on Avalanche, Harmony, BSC, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Moonriver, Cronos (+ $5.34B on Ethereum)
* **SolarBeam** \[15\] $145M on Moonriver
* **CronaSwap** \[16\] $32M on Cronos
* **ViperSwap** \[17\] $30M on Harmony

# 3. Bridges

Cross-chain bridges enable you to transfer your assets (typically stable coins such as USDC or USDT) across chains. Supplying liquidity into these bridges can also generate you some yield.

* **Anyswap** \[18\] $4.1B  on Fantom, Avalanche, Harmony, Binance, Polygon, Arbitrum, Moonriver and others (+$400M on Ethereum)
* **Synapse** \[19\] $545M on Optimism, Avalanche, Harmony, BSC, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum Fantom (+$90M on Ethereum)

# 4. Lending and borrowing

Lending and borrowing markets enable to act either as a lender (providing assets, typically stablecoins) to earn positive interest, or/and as a borrower (providing collateral, typically non-stablecoin) to borrow assets and pay the interest. Lending is one of the safest source of passive income on stablecoins, whereas borrowing is usually utilized for margin, leveraged, or flash trading where the short-term yields compensate for (and ideally outperform) the borrowing interest.

* **Aave** \[20\] $5.27B on Polygon, Avalanche (+ $10.5B on Ethereum)
* **Venus** \[21\] $2.38 on BSC
* **Benqi** \[22\]  $1.52B on Avalanche
* **Geist** \[23\] $1.11B on Fantom
* **Abracadabra** \[24\] $1.03B on Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom (+ $3.67B on Ethereum)
* **Cream** \[25\] $529M on BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom (+ $1.61B  on Ethereum)
* **Scream** \[26\] $376M on Fantom

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future."

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high.

Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies.

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans.

They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work — the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system — then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful.

**TLDR**:

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time — the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year’s salary to have a scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person’s connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs — it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

So I checked the ""Curve sAave"" vault on [yearn v3](https://beta.yearn.finance/#/vault/0xb4D1Be44BfF40ad6e506edf43156577a3f8672eC), and it shows a yield of **6.14%**. And the strategy says:

Then I checked the [convexfinance.com/stake](https://convexfinance.com/stake) site, and it shows **11.08%** for the sAave pool.

***Could someone explain me why the yields are so different if yearn strategy is to deposit to the convex pool? If yearn is compounding the earned tokens, shouldn't it have a better yield than using convex directly?***

**The radical change coming to the global economy and the investments you need to stay ahead of the curve.**

**China’s growing role in the global economy is showing no sign of retreat. Indeed, recent events have only increased China’s influence—to the point where China is poised to edge out the United States and take the lead. For investors like you, this tectonic shift poses difficult challenges—along with tremendous opportunities.**

**In China’s Rise and the New Age of Gold, one of the 21st Century’s top economic experts, Stephen Leeb, lays out his compelling argument that explosive gains in gold lie ahead. Gold’s price will increase dramatically to as high as $20,000 an ounce. Investing in gold will be the best (and perhaps only) way to generate substantial investing profits in this decade and beyond.**

**Leeb draws from his vast knowledge of macro-economic trends and current market conditions to explain China’s plans to launch a new monetary system centered on gold, which will largely supplant the global dollar-based monetary system. And he provides you with the tools you need to invest in all things gold, including in gold itself, gold mutual funds and ETFs, and the right mining companies.**

**Painting a picture of a fully transformed investing world- one that will make important yet temporary events like the 2008 financial meltdown and coronavirus crash pale in comparison. This prescient guide to 21st Century investing delivers the knowledge and insight you need to draw unprecedented profits as China’s rise truly launches a new age of gold.**

We will make an useful yet affordible way to travel around the world using your cryptocurrency. As a team our ultimate goal is to build a long-term project with a highly detailed roadmap and transparent curve. Loyalty is the biggest value as a holder so we will reward them accordingly.

We will work on a cashback system with our partnered booking accomodation sites. Yes you read right! We will give tokens as cashback when you travel throught our partners.

The idea itself is to create a token where holders can win trips. The loyalty of investors is a key point, which is why it will count in the draw for prizes. 

The trips will be covered by the travel fee, which is 4% when selling. We will draw at predetermined amounts, but there will be not just one but several prize trips, linked to how long the winner has been a holder. So the longer someone has been a holder and the more CrtT tokens they own they will win more valuable travels.
The holders will be able to vote on the value of the trips to be won. As soon as the amount you have pre-voted for has been added to the travel wallet, we will hold the voting and coordinate the destinations with the winners.

A mere prize draw would of course not be enough to justify a new token. We aim to build ongoing partnerships with various players in the tourism sector, such as hotels and travel agencies. The development of our accommodation and travel search website will be the real milestone in the life of the project, as it will be the first Hungarian-developed project to use cryptocurrency to finance travel and to claim time-based discounts.

Moderator:Thank you for coming to SheepDex's AMA. This AMA will consist of two sessions: host questions and user questions. I hope you will be quiet when the host asks questions. Please listen carefully to this AMA.

Moderator: Thank you for coming to the AMA session of SheepDex. I’m sure many of you may not be familiar with this project. So let’s invite Isabel, CMO of SheepDex, to introduce herself first.

Isabel: Hi. I’m Isabel. I'm the Chief Marketing Officer at SheepDex. I have been studying Finance and started to enter the Blockchain industry in 2015. I studied over 50 white papers on background checks, being responsible for global marketing for the STO platform in North America. Now I'm the CMO at SheepDex.

Moderator: Thank you for your introduction, Isabel. Before we start, I have a quick question for you. Why do you choose Discord to run this AMA?

Isabel: Compared to Telegram, there are different categories and channels available on Discord, where users can find the information they want in the first place.

Moderator: Thank you. So, let's move on to the first part of the AMA. Isabel, could you tell us what is SheepDex?

**Q1. What is SheepDex?**

SheepDex (sheepdex.org), which launched on BSC on Oct. 10, is a decentralized liquidity concentrated platform for spot and derivatives trading. It offers *Yield Farming* and *Transaction Rewards* while allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate funds within specific price ranges and provide them with transaction fee refunds if a swap occurs within that range. This greatly improves capital efficiency and provides users with better liquidity and ultra-low trading slippage. According to the roadmap, it will continue to launch perpetuated contracts, leveraged tokens, and other derivatives. SheepDex aims to be a decentralized Binance.

Moderator: So SheepDex is offering a V3 concentrated liquidity function. At the moment UniSwap is the only DEX that has v3, so Isabel, could you give us a brief introduction of what V3 is?

**What is V3 (concentrated liquidity market-making mechanism)?**

V3 is a liquidity concentrated automatic market maker (AMM ) that allows LPs to provide liquidity within a certain price range, rather than spreading their funds from 0 to infinity. On the one hand, this can increase market depth, minimize the trading slippage and offer a better experience for users; On the other hand, it can improve capital efficiency and allow LPs to get better returns.

&amp;#x200B;

Moderator: So compared with other DEXs, what are the advantages of SheepDex’s concentrated liquidity?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Less slippage: Liquidity is concentrated in the price range where most transactions occur, resulting in less slippage and fewer loss, especially for stablecoin pools. Currently in the BSC ecosystem, the slippage of SheepDex’s stablecoin and some of the main pairs are several times lower than PancakeSwap, but PancakeSwap has a TVL of hundreds of times that of SheepDex. This means that V3 can increase the capital efficiency by more than hundreds of times.

2: SheepDex is built on BSC, which means smoother speed and lower gas fees. So in general it cuts the cost of adjusting positions, so users may adjust their positions according to the token price. 

3: SheepDex offers triple incentives and provides users with more incentives than other DEXs. With SheepDex, users have more options for market making, they can either choose a more aggressive or a conservative strategy.

*LP Trading Fees Refunds*: 

Most of the swaps on SheepDex will charge a fee of 0.2% as trading fees, 50% of the fees will be refunded to the LPs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qlnvl3qdq3181.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74df2f0819ba0082c8ec7a4ee3f7ce2ae2fb818

Transaction Rewards:

Users will earn SPC tokens after completing a swap for a trading pair if there are rewards for that pair. They can generate and click to claim the rewards. 

Yield Farming：

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1mb91qgq3181.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f54594feb15571178ecfb7a257fb87780ea5225

Yield Farming can be combined with a variety of trading strategies: SheepDex allows LPs to adjust their portfolios for liquidity provision under changing market conditions in order to get better returns.

For example, when currency prices are volatile, conservative users can choose to adjust the price range to minimize the impermanent loss. But even then they still get better returns than providing liquidity on a traditional DEX.

Market-making can be done with a single currency, which can help users to automatically sell the tokens when it reaches a certain price. And this is not possible with a traditional AMM mechanism.

V3 can be used to provide liquidity with a single token in a price range above or below the market price, the provided assets will be sold along a smooth price curve into other designated assets when the market price enters the range (we can use this function to realize the strategy of buy-low or stop-profit and get the fee reward)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ofiice1pq3181.png?width=1596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f27486435a802297fd8069ee46aa0098bcdb3a3f

2.Provide liquidity and earn: 

Providing liquidity for stablecoin pairs: Adding liquidity in the stablecoin pools is often the first choice for many LPs or market makers, because price fluctuations for stablecoins are usually small so the impermanent loss can be negligible. 

Take USDT/USDC as an example, most of the time the exchange price for this pool will remain $0.99 to $1.01. 

So with SheepDex, you will be able to deposit all your tokens into a narrow range (within 1%) to provide liquidity, rather than spreading your funds across the range from 0 to infinity. 

This way, your capital becomes more efficient and you will earn more trading fees and rewards, because most swaps for stablecoin pairs occur within that range.

3. Providing liquidity for other token pairs is just the same. That is, you can provide liquidity in a specific price range and earn trading fees if the spot price is in your range. But that may require LPs to have some basic knowledge and tactics . If an LP wishes to continuously earn the trading fees, he or she will need to constantly analyze the data and develop different trading strategies, and constantly adjust the price range to accommodate changes in spot price. LPs are able to adjust their positions more often on SheepDex since gas fees are much lower.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6i267frq3181.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c275ed89a4261cc12aeaa269f1b1c6450f887e3

4. It may be a little bit difficult for less sophisticated LPs to provide liquidity in a narrow price range. Because they will need to constantly observe the price fluctuations and adjust the strategies and positions. So we might suggest these LPs to add liquidity in a wider range or spread their liquidity across the range from 0 to infinity, which is a standard liquidity provision in most DEXs with a traditional AMM mechanism. So this is also the charm of the v3 concentrated liquidity system as there are more options for the users. 

**How to calculate the allocation and transaction reward of SheepDex’s range order system?**

LPs can earn trading fees only if the spot price is within the range where liquidity is provided. And SheepDex allows LPs to provide liquidity in certain price ranges based one their strategies. So LPs will be able to allocate their funds more efficiently to increase the overall return. But without this concentrated liquidity function, LPs will have to spread their funds in the range between 0 and infinity, which means some liquidity (most liquidity if it’s a stablecoin pair) provided is idle and not being used to earn fees.  

**LP Fee** = Swap volume × Trading fee/Total liquidity × Proportion of individual LP × LP proportion of capital

**LP Reward** = SPC output (3S × 3.5 × allocation%)/Total liquidity × personal percentage × LP capital percentage

***Transaction Rewards = Personal trading volume/Total trading volume\* SPC output***

How to calculate my transaction reward?

Transaction Rewards = Personal trading volume/Total trading volume\* SPC output

(Total trading volume refers to the total volume with unclaimed SPC rewards)

Why are my SPC rewards changing?

Assume that your individual trading volume and the SPC output in the pool are constant from the moment you swap till the time you claim your reward, the total trading volume is increasing or decreasing, so the number of your SPC reward become less as total volume increases. If there are users claiming the rewards, their trading volume will also be removed from the pool, which means your SPC rewards will increase.

**How to ensure the security of SheepDex?**

SheepDex always focuses on efficiency and security. The smart contract is open-source and the code has been audited by CertiK and PeckShield. More audit firms will be involved to ensure the security of the contract. 

SheepDex is completely open source. So you can view the contract on the blockchain explorer. You can also view the audit reports that are also available online to make sure that assets are secure.

Github：https://github.com/SheepDex/contract

Certik audit report:  [https://www.certik.org/projects/sheepdex](https://www.certik.org/projects/sheepdex) 

PeckShiel audit reportt: [https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit\_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-SheepDEX-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-SheepDEX-v1.0.pdf) 

From the security audit reports, you can also view the **key management** of a project. Due to the functionality of some projects in the DeFo space, such as Lending and Vaults, may need a 24-hour timelock to secure users’ assets. Because these projects have more access to users’ assets. 

But on SheepDex, we don’t have such access to users’ assets. We only have this access when it comes to allocating tokens, and we also plan to implement a MultiSig in the future for securing users’ assets.

In fact, as you can see from previous cases, as long as a DEX’s code is open source and audited by leading audit firms, there should be no problem regarding hacker hacking, which means a DEX's architecture should be secure.

**As a LPs, how to avoid slipepage?**

The advantage of V3 concentrated liquidity is that it allows LPs to allocate their funds in an efficient way, the more concentrated the liquidity, the better trading experience.

Impermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The bigger this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. This happens to all automated market makers (AMMs), especially v3 LPs, where impermanent losses are more pronounced due to a narrower order range and faster price movement in a narrower range.

You can provide liquidity in a wider range or even across a full range in order to avoid impermanent loss. Or you can also make up for impermanent loss by providing liquidity in a narrow range and get higher returns. For example, if you’re losing 5% on cryptocurrency fluctuations but you’re earning 10% in trading fees, it’s still a good deal. 

The narrower the range, the greater the impermanent loss, so be careful when choosing your ranges and positions.

**What is the status of SheepDext?** 

Key progresses of SheepDex: 

1. Aggregators such as 1inch are being integrated and data platforms such as CMC and Coingecko. 

2. Introduces more professional info providers for product optimization and ecological construction. 

3. High-quality market makers are gradually testing their participation in SheepDex and actively exploring SheepDex's market-making strategy. 

4.SheepDex is developing innovative features and setting up funds with institutions to support the development of the V3 ecology. 

5. Working with leading IDO platforms and negotiating with high-quality projects to list more token pairs on SheepDex. 

6. There will be announcements regarding the list of investors and partners. 

**Can you tell us about token repurchasing?** 

SheepDex will refer to the BNB quarterly burn mechanism, all repurchased SPC will be burned. 

Details of the repurchase will be announced via SheepDex official channels.

**SheepDex's future growth?**

DEXs have seen their value as the basic carrier of development and exchange in the space of DeFi. With the throughput and opportunities brought by DeFi 2.0, SheepDex’s v3 functionality will be one of the best tools for users. 

With the traditional order book mechanism on most DEXs, liquidity providers deposit their funds into the pools and earn passive income by providing liquidity for the trades. This results in lower funds efficiency, especially for stablecoin pairs where more than 99% of the liquidity is idle and never used.

While V3 provides concentrated liquidity through innovative features such as range market-making, range orders, multi-tiered rates liquidity provision to achieve higher returns through a more diverse and complex mix of market-making strategies.

Simply put, with V3, you can get higher returns with less capital.

We respect Uniswap's open source and sharing spirit. But we have done a lot of creative work, there are 60% differences in SheepDex’s contract. And SheepDex offers yield farming, transaction rewards (swap mining) and other innovative features that are not available on Uniswap v3.

The emergence of SheepDex brings a new mechanism for leveraging liquidity provision strategies. With the popularity of V3, SheepDex will also become one of the best DEXs.

**User questions：**

**1. The free risk of V3 is greater than the return. What do you think of this? What solutions are there?** 

Incorrect. Because whether it’s v2 or v3, the returns and risks are related to the APR For example SheepDex has a much higher APR and less impermanent loss than UNI V3. So you don’t get problems like this on SheepDex. We believe that the V3 concentrated liquidity will be a driving force for a more specialized industry.

**2.Is it possible to consider implementing the invitation and reward system for user fission as soon as possible?** 

We have no intention of doing that in the short term

**3. The announcement of the investment institution mentioned earlier has passed for some time, can it be announced? Or when will it be announced?** 

We need to verify whether the commitments of the investors can be fulfilled and, if all goes well, we will announce the list.

**4.SPC was launched on HOO, and the project party did not manage the SPC, which caused the SPC to be considered by the HOO community as a rubbish coin.Have you considered such unfavorable results at that time?**

Any exchange can list SPC tokens, which is the freedom of the blockchain market, but this will not affect the development of SheepDex. SheepDex team is very clear about what we should do. So it’s not like what they think.

**5. When can SPC token be listed on CoinMarketCap? Will you speed it up? Will SPC be listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko? Will you consider paying CoinMarketCap for the listing?**

SheepDex is a decentralized exchange and it offers v3 concentrated liquidity. So it’s different from normal projects. It might take some time and effort for those projects to integrate the data of SheepDex. Buw we are working on that.

**6. Could you talk about the specific publicity plan? How do you plan to increase the TVL? Are there any marketing plans?**

We have been working with a number of influencers around the world, and there will be some leading institutions involved, who will work with us regarding operations and marketing, which is on the go. We also hope that our users can help the fresh learners on how to use this platform.

**7.  Is there any consideration in future planning for Bridge""or other derivative-oriented products to increase the competitiveness of SheepDex and make SheepDex have stronger financial attributes?**

We haven’t considered Bridge yet. We think this is not a mature decision as Bridge may bring some risks for user assets. But we will definitely put more focus on our derivatives. And the derivatives on SheepDex will make it a pioneering product in the DeFi space."
Yield opportunities on fast-growing Ethereum-compatible chains,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qzlejk/yield_opportunities_on_fastgrowing/,e1icz,1,2021-11-22 21:28:03,18,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qzlejk/yield_opportunities_on_fastgrowing/,GENERAL-NEWS,"In January 2021, 99% of Total Value Locked (*TVL*) in Decentralized Finance (*DeFi*) was locked in Ethereum — today, Ethereum represents only 66% of TVL in DeFi. However, it is by far not Ethereum that is on the decline because the TVL on Ethereum has tripled since January 2021. Still, it is the sidechains, parachains, and L2 chains, that are currently attracting more and more money and can offer substantial yield opportunities similar to the Ethereum ecosystem with minimal transaction fees.

Let's have a look at some leading and growing Defi applications (*dApps*) on EVM(*Ethereum Virtual Machine*)-compatible fast-growing chains, particularly on *Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, Arbitrum, BSC, Moonriver, Optimism, and Cronos*. The advantage of these EVM-compatible chains is that they enable running the same Solidity code (*Smart contracts*) as on Ethereum. Also, they share the same standard for public addresses, and therefore interacting with these blockchains is practically the same as with Ethereum (e.g.., *Metamask* wallet can be used). The same address is supported across the aforementioned chains. The main difference is the transactions fees, which are 100-1000x lower than on the Ethereum mainnet.

# 1. Yield Aggregators

Provide auto-compounding to enhance yields on staked assets, typically liquidity pools (*LPs*) or incentivized single asset vaults. The yields are repetitively harvested in short intervals (hourly/daily) and compounded into the deposited principal, transforming the Annual Percentage Rate (*APR*) — i.e., the yearly interest generated by the invested sum — into Annual Percentage Yield (*APY*) — i.e., the interest generated by compounding the short-term profits. Farming with yield aggregators helps achieve greater yields than staking the underlying strategy not only by compounding but also by obtaining yield-aggregator-native or otherwise incentivized tokens of the underlying asset(s).

* **Beefy** \[1\] $1.2B on Avalanche, Harmony, BSC, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Moonriver, Cronos
* **Autofarm** \[2\] $472M on Avalanche, BSC, Fantom, Polygon, Fantom, Moonriver, Cronos
* **Yield Yak** \[3\] $485M on Avalanche
* **Tomb Finance** \[4\] $361M on Fantom
* **Snowball** \[5\] $79M on Avalanche

# 2. DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges)

Provide liquidity for trading pairs on the particular chain. Providing liquidity in pools entitles you to collect small fees from trades. The price movement of the underlying assets changes the proportions of your pooled assets with the constant sum formula, so you can use LP pools to accumulate more tokens of the asset when in a downtrend, or hedge against the price decline or growth typically using pairs with a stable coin on one end and volatile asset on the other.

* **PancakeSwap** \[6\] $6.32B on BSC
* **Curve** \[7\]  $2.5B on Avalanche, Harmony, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum (+$18.5B on Ethereum)
* **Trader Joe** \[8\] $2.43B on Avalanche
* **QuickSwap** \[9\] $708M on Polygon
* **Pangolin** \[10\] $479M on Avalanche
* **ApeSwap** \[11\] $362M on BSC and Polygon
* **Spookyswap** \[12\] $632M on Fantom
* **Defi Kingdoms** \[13\] $240M on Harmony
* **SushiSwap** \[14\] $170M on Avalanche, Harmony, BSC, Fantom, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Moonriver, Cronos (+ $5.34B on Ethereum)
* **SolarBeam** \[15\] $145M on Moonriver
* **CronaSwap** \[16\] $32M on Cronos
* **ViperSwap** \[17\] $30M on Harmony

# 3. Cross-Chain Bridges

Cross-chain bridges enable you to transfer your assets (typically stable coins such as USDC or USDT) across chains. Supplying liquidity into these bridges can also generate you some yield.

* **Anyswap** \[18\] $4.1B  on Fantom, Avalanche, Harmony, Binance, Polygon, Arbitrum, Moonriver and others (+$400M on Ethereum)
* **Synapse** \[19\] $545M on Optimism, Avalanche, Harmony, BSC, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum Fantom (+$90M on Ethereum)

# 4. Lending and Borrowing

Lending and borrowing markets enable to act either as a lender (providing assets, typically stablecoins) to earn positive interest, or/and as a borrower (providing collateral, typically non-stablecoin) to borrow assets and pay the interest. Lending is one of the safest source of passive income on stablecoins, whereas borrowing is usually utilized for margin, leveraged, or flash trading where the short-term yields compensate for (and ideally outperform) the borrowing interest.

* **Aave** \[20\] $5.27B on Polygon, Avalanche (+ $10.5B on Ethereum)
* **Venus** \[21\] $2.38 on BSC
* **Benqi** \[22\]  $1.52B on Avalanche
* **Geist** \[23\] $1.11B on Fantom
* **Abracadabra** \[24\] $1.03B on Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom (+ $3.67B on Ethereum)
* **Cream** \[25\] $529M on BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom (+ $1.61B  on Ethereum)
* **Scream** \[26\] $376M on Fantom

I’ve had a really good experience from here a couple weeks ago. 
Looking to repeat!

Looking to start my 30s with a bang! 

Here's my [verified pic](https://i.imgur.com/mKfBGak.jpg)

Fit athletic 30, finance professional, ivy-league educated. I'm 6'1 tall, 180lbs, lean. Triathlete and I hit the gym every day. 

You: 18-40, single/married/partnered.. hwp, Asian, std free. 

Dont worry about shaved/unshaved.. i love them all and prefer natural tbh.

Finally turned 30, new start to a better year (knock on wood).

I'm looking for someone who wouldn't mind coming to my office and having some fun ;)

Since COVID is an ongoing issue, my office is actually really empty right now. 

I know it isn't exactly the norm (other than on this subreddit), I love, love, love eating pussy, and seeing a woman in pleasure is the most attractive thing in the world. 

I have a strong affinity for the female body.. I love everything about it, every curve, every natural scent, taste... 
I pride myself in being patient, working with partners who were previously too nervous to cum.. or willing to let go. Not only do I love feeling the pleasure and intimacy when I'm buried between your legs.. but I also love the wetness.. the amazing, delicious musky scent.. And of course.. the taste..

Sometimes I enjoy it more than sex. And to have you spread your legs and allow me to taste you sounds like heaven to me.. 

Obviously, I've got more pics to share and verify privately. Please don't be shy. Shoot me a message!"

CryptoTravel's main goal is to create a secure and transparent system where holders can not only make a profit, but also win trips and exchange their assets for travels. We will make an useful yet affordible way to travel around the world using your cryptocurrency. As a team our ultimate goal is to build a long-term project with a highly detailed roadmap and transparent curve. Loyalty is the biggest value as a holder so we will reward them accordingly.

We will work on a cashback system with our partnered booking accomodation sites. Yes you read right! We will give tokens as cashback when you travel throught our partners.

The idea itself is to create a token where holders can win trips. The loyalty of investors is a key point, which is why it will count in the draw for prizes.

The trips will be covered by the travel fee, which is 4% when selling. We will draw at predetermined amounts, but there will be not just one but several prize trips, linked to how long the winner has been a holder. So the longer someone has been a holder and the more CrtT tokens they own they will win more valuable travels. The holders will be able to vote on the value of the trips to be won. As soon as the amount you have pre-voted for has been added to the travel wallet, we will hold the voting and coordinate the destinations with the winners.

A mere prize draw would of course not be enough to justify a new token. We aim to build ongoing partnerships with various players in the tourism sector, such as hotels and travel agencies. The development of our accommodation and travel search website will be the real milestone in the life of the project, as it will be the first Hungarian-developed project to use cryptocurrency to finance travel and to claim time-based discounts.

CryptoTravel's main goal is to create a secure and transparent system where holders can not only make a profit, but also win trips and exchange their assets for travels. We will make an useful yet affordible way to travel around the world using your cryptocurrency. As a team our ultimate goal is to build a long-term project with a highly detailed roadmap and transparent curve. Loyalty is the biggest value as a holder so we will reward them accordingly.

We will work on a cashback system with our partnered booking accomodation sites. Yes you read right! We will give tokens as cashback when you travel throught our partners.

The idea itself is to create a token where holders can win trips. The loyalty of investors is a key point, which is why it will count in the draw for prizes.

The trips will be covered by the travel fee, which is 4% when selling. We will draw at predetermined amounts, but there will be not just one but several prize trips, linked to how long the winner has been a holder. So the longer someone has been a holder and the more CrtT tokens they own they will win more valuable travels. The holders will be able to vote on the value of the trips to be won. As soon as the amount you have pre-voted for has been added to the travel wallet, we will hold the voting and coordinate the destinations with the winners.

A mere prize draw would of course not be enough to justify a new token. We aim to build ongoing partnerships with various players in the tourism sector, such as hotels and travel agencies. The development of our accommodation and travel search website will be the real milestone in the life of the project, as it will be the first Hungarian-developed project to use cryptocurrency to finance travel and to claim time-based discounts. Just launched yesterday🔥

CryptoTravel's main goal is to create a secure and transparent system where holders can not only make a profit, but also win trips and exchange their assets for travels. We will make an useful yet affordible way to travel around the world using your cryptocurrency. As a team our ultimate goal is to build a long-term project with a highly detailed roadmap and transparent curve. Loyalty is the biggest value as a holder so we will reward them accordingly.

We will work on a cashback system with our partnered booking accomodation sites. Yes you read right! We will give tokens as cashback when you travel throught our partners.

The idea itself is to create a token where holders can win trips. The loyalty of investors is a key point, which is why it will count in the draw for prizes.

The trips will be covered by the travel fee, which is 4% when selling. We will draw at predetermined amounts, but there will be not just one but several prize trips, linked to how long the winner has been a holder. So the longer someone has been a holder and the more CrtT tokens they own they will win more valuable travels. The holders will be able to vote on the value of the trips to be won. As soon as the amount you have pre-voted for has been added to the travel wallet, we will hold the voting and coordinate the destinations with the winners.

A mere prize draw would of course not be enough to justify a new token. We aim to build ongoing partnerships with various players in the tourism sector, such as hotels and travel agencies. The development of our accommodation and travel search website will be the real milestone in the life of the project, as it will be the first Hungarian-developed project to use cryptocurrency to finance travel and to claim time-based discounts. Just launched yesterday🔥

"""Crypto isnt way too hard!"" It just has a learning curve",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qzsaxj/crypto_isnt_way_too_hard_it_just_has_a_learning/,Tylanmon,1,2021-11-23 02:37:10,16,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qzsaxj/crypto_isnt_way_too_hard_it_just_has_a_learning/,DISCUSSION,"We hear it all the time that the Crypto is ""So hard, thats why it never will be mainstream!"" But i want to disagree on that.

First: What do we even think when we say Crypto?

If we mean using the money, than its super easy! Most of the big exchanges have QR code payment system that gets your order in seconds.

If we mean investing: than its 10X easier than the stock market. You can argue that there are too many terminology going on, but its really nothing compared to regular finance.

If we mean developing, for crypto: Yes... Of course its hard. It always is. One can also say that using Windows is hard cause there are a lot of codes going on. 

Think Crypto like the code, and the exchanges like the  Windows. 

Most of you probably didnt used a PC without graphical interface, which makes sense why would you? But before the Windows (Or technically Macintosh) there was these huge case IBM PCs, where you had to code your own things to use it.

Nothing changed since then, we still use the same coding principle, but you dont see anyone goes ""Using Windows is hard!"" Cause it isnt. 

Even though the Crypto is not as simple as using a Windows PC at this stage, its nowhere as bad as early ages of the project, and will get easier as the time goes on (and on and on 🧅)"

👉 **What is the** **Enecuum** **token exactly?**

Blockchain Mobile Network for decentralized application. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to become a part of the blockchain revolution. Currently, we create a decentralized ecosystem able to bring the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to the real mainstream, involving a crowd with regular mobile and desktop devices into the blockchain network, as well as providing the powerful toolkit for the dApps developers to create fast and low cost applications for millions of people. Enecuum allows each smartphone owner to be a part of our global network.

👉 Extremely decentralized network - Devices connect to the Enecuum blockchain and share untapped data processing capacity. The more devices connected, the higher the network speed, with uncapped scalability potential. Connecting millions of distributed devices will create a truly decentralized, secure and stable system.

👉 Easy join, Easy earn - The owner of the mobile device just needs to download our app to connect to the cryptocurrencies world, earn coins, make transfers and pay for the goods and services fast, secure and without banking fees. Important! ENQ App will not drain the battery of the mobile device and requires very regular specification of the phone – Android 4.4, 1GHz processor, 1.5 GB of RAM.

👉 Dapps web 3.0 Ecosystem- Fast &amp; easy payments. Flexible system stakes reward. Data protection. Tokenization of virtual assets. Decentralised finance instruments. Marketplace for digital resources.

👉 **What is the** **Enecuum** **token exactly?**

Blockchain Mobile Network for decentralized application. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to become a part of the blockchain revolution. Currently, we create a decentralized ecosystem able to bring the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to the real mainstream, involving a crowd with regular mobile and desktop devices into the blockchain network, as well as providing the powerful toolkit for the dApps developers to create fast and low cost applications for millions of people. Enecuum allows each smartphone owner to be a part of our global network.

👉 Extremely decentralized network - Devices connect to the Enecuum blockchain and share untapped data processing capacity. The more devices connected, the higher the network speed, with uncapped scalability potential. Connecting millions of distributed devices will create a truly decentralized, secure and stable system.

👉 Easy join, Easy earn - The owner of the mobile device just needs to download our app to connect to the cryptocurrencies world, earn coins, make transfers and pay for the goods and services fast, secure and without banking fees. Important! ENQ App will not drain the battery of the mobile device and requires very regular specification of the phone – Android 4.4, 1GHz processor, 1.5 GB of RAM.

**TLDR**:

Asset management is a large market sector in traditional finance with revenue generating $4.2B per year. This is an opportunity for non-crypto native users to tap into the growing DeFi opportunity, and for the DeFi projects to move in this direction or collaborate with existing partners.

In this article, we have shown how five asset managers work. These managers are basically quite similar in operation and token use case. However, each strategy in each protocol is different, leading to different rates of return.

&amp;#x200B;

# General Conclusion

In the traditional financial market, you may be quite familiar with the ""index baskets"" such as S&amp;P500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), etc. These index baskets each include a lot of financial assets. Products designed by leading experts, helping you diversify your portfolio risk and achieve investment performance in the simplest way.

In this article we will compare 5 blockchain-based asset managers by their goals, how they work, and what is the use case of their tokens.

# Yearn Finance

[yEarn Finance](https://econteric.com/fundamentals/yearn-finance/) is a liquidity aggregator, running on the Ethereum blockchain for lending platforms. yEarn Finance helps users achieve the highest profit during smart contract interactions.

What is the problem that yEarn Finance sets out to solve?

Liquidity mining programmes like Compound or Aave are places that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to provide liquidity and earn profits.

Currently, more and more similar protocols are appearing, with flexible forms of change. The problem is: how can LPs maximise their profits? It is very difficult to switch between protocols continuously.

yEarn Finance was born to solve this problem. It makes it easy for users to optimise profits with algorithms to compare, choose the place with the highest revenue, save research time and switch between parties.

yEarn uses the following protocols for aggregation: Compound, dY/dX, Aave, Curve, and supports the following stablecoins $DAI, $USDC, $USDT, $TUSD, $sUSD, and more.

Liquidity mining programmes like Compound or Aave are places that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to provide liquidity and earn profits.

Currently, more and more similar protocols are appearing, with flexible forms of change. The problem is: how can LPs maximise their profits? It is very difficult to switch between protocols continuously.

yEarn Finance was born to solve this problem. It makes it easy for users to optimise profits with algorithms to compare, choose the place with the highest revenue, save research time and switch between parties.

yEarn uses the following protocols for aggregation: Compound, dY/dX, Aave, Curve, and supports the following stablecoins $DAI, $USDC, $USDT, $TUSD, $sUSD, and more.

**TLDR**:

Asset management is a large market sector in traditional finance with revenue generating $4.2B per year. This is an opportunity for non-crypto native users to tap into the growing DeFi opportunity, and for the DeFi projects to move in this direction or collaborate with existing partners.

In this article, we have shown how five asset managers work. These managers are basically quite similar in operation and token use case. However, each strategy in each protocol is different, leading to different rates of return.

How Yield Farming on Curve Finance Is Quietly Conquering DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r04eve/how_yield_farming_on_curve_finance_is_quietly/,Independent-Tailor43,1,2021-11-23 12:04:35,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r04eve/how_yield_farming_on_curve_finance_is_quietly/,PERSPECTIVE,"#Introduction to Curve DAO

Until recently, Curve had been extremely under discussed, considering the major role it holds in DeFi across blockchains. Recent shifts in tokenomics led its native token, CRV, to become net deflationary; subsequently, the price is up 122% since the token became deflationary.

Curve is a decentralized exchange, known for its pegged-asset swaps like fiat-pegged stablecoins or assets that trade at a 1-1 ratio. With over $3 billion in deposits, Curve’s largest pool is known as 3pool and contains DAI, USDC and USDT.

The stablecoin pools have gained traction offering high liquidity and low fees (0.004%), because Curve uses its native token to reward liquidity providers instead of higher swap fees. Below you can see the results of swapping $75 million from USDC to USDT on Curve, Sushi and Uniswap, with Curve optimizing the swap with significantly less slippage than its competitors.

[Curve Vs Sushiswap slippage while converting](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/5RRWDDYZNNBCHIRFASAEB67EI4.jpg)


#CRV Tokenomics 

CRV holders may “stake” their tokens in the platform and lock them in fixed periods of between one week and four years to decide their voting weight. Depending on the amount of Curve locked and the length of time locked, stakers are given an adjusted amount of vote-escrowed Curve (veCRV). veCRV holders are then able to vote on how CRV rewards are distributed across Curve’s pools by assigning weight to the “pool gauge” aligning with their financial interests.

Subsequently, a system for bribing veCRV holders to vote in favor of specific gauge weightings has arisen.
Projects like Abracadabra has paid the equivalent of $1.9 million to veCRV holders willing to vote for their stablecoin pool in the last two weeks alone, now giving their pool 32.5% of the relative gauge weight.

The dynamic capabilities of veCRV have kept the demand for CRV strong, even with inflation, to match the demand for maximized yield and low-fee swaps. However, as seen below, the emission schedule has slowed because of the end of early user rewards. The demand for locking CRV has also increased, turning the asset net “deflationary.” 


[The CRV that is locked for voting is not considered part of the token supply, as it is non-liquid and the majority is locked for the next three to four years.](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MMFM5WBEZJHIPBJRFRFUZZI6RI.jpg)

#Summary 

Over the past six months, Curve has made just $34.1 million in swap fees, even though it has $16.5 billion in TVL on Ethereum’s main network and has kept its trading volume consistently high. Oftentimes, liquidity would migrate to exchanges with higher fee brackets for higher returns, and yet Curve has the lowest fees and more liquidity locked than any other exchange. The project’s real secret is subsidizing liquidity with the CRV token, keeping yields high enough for liquidity providers to stay in its pools.

Curve now has almost $20.2 billion in TVL across seven different ecosystems, making it the largest decentralized application, or dapp.

The first part of Jerome Powell’s tenure as Federal Reserve chairman was defined by an increasingly acrimonious battle with the president who appointed him.
‌
The next phase of the Powell-led central bank will be defined by its response to surging prices. And President Joe Biden — who on Monday decided to reappoint Powell in the face of pressure to shift course — will now find his political fortunes inextricably bound to Fed policy in a way his recent predecessors have not.
‌
It bears repeating that, while the Fed chair is a political appointment, the hallmark of monetary policy is its independence. It’s one of the reasons why former President Donald Trump found himself so enraged with Powell that he openly flirted with the idea of jettisoning him.

See the list.
Presuming that Powell passes Senate confirmation, which by all indications he will, given the relatively high levels of bipartisan support he enjoys, both he and the president will find themselves joined at the hip as a still vigorous economic expansion gives way to inflation.
‌
By opting for Powell over Lael Brainard, Biden decided the former was “the right man for the job,” as Jared Bernstein, a key advisor to Biden, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.
‌
When the president thought about “a Federal Reserve that would implement the kind of economic policy [people] associate with Joe Biden — providing opportunities for lower- and middle-income people and making sure Wall Street is amply regulated — he decided Jerome Powell was the right man for the job,"" Bernstein said.
‌
However, amid elevated inflation that’s making the public increasingly unhappy and sandbagging Biden’s approval ratings, what happens next will inevitably be a reflection on both men and their legacies.
‌
Powell’s split with Trump, who vociferously opposed the Fed’s rate hike campaign, refracted Fed policy through an uncharacteristically political lens. Yet it had the side effect of insulating the White House from the effects of an independent monetary policy.
‌
By doubling down on the Powell era, Biden has given a tacit endorsement of the Fed’s response to COVID-19, and will have to own the consequences of spiking prices, and how next year’s expected rate hikes will impact the expansion.
‌
“This means Biden now owns politically the policies of the Powell Fed and its consequences,” wrote Eurasia Group’s Jon Lieber and Robert Kahn on Monday.
‌
While Powell’s renomination was a “lower risk strategy” given market expectations for continuity, “his confirmation will be a referendum around inflation,"" Eurasia's analysts wrote.
‌
""There will be multiple protest votes from Republicans over the direction of monetary policy and its continued focus on ‘maximum employment’ as inflation grew in 2021. Any elevated inflation prints between now and February will cost him more votes,” they added.
‌
Indeed, the markets are already rendering a preliminary verdict on the Powell sequel. According to Tradeweb data, the belly and the front-end of the Treasury yield curve (1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year debt) hit their highest peaks in well over a year after Powell's renomination was announced. Meanwhile, markets are also pricing in rate hikes next year (though exactly when those will come is anyone's guess).
‌
While it’s far too early to call it a no-confidence vote, Monday’s jump in yields was in keeping with a fairly consistent message that bond investors have sent for weeks. They are worried about inflation, and believe Powell’s credibility hangs in the balance of containing those pressures.
‌
The respective tenures of former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen were marked by quantitative easing, incalculable sums of stimulative bond buying that led critics to look for inflation that never actually surfaced.
‌
However, Powell will have the dubious distinction of clean-up duty for surging prices — the likes of which haven’t been seen in decades. He’ll have to own the outcome of effective yet highly controversial policies he implemented — and so will the 46th president who chose him for a new term.

Strap in for a rollercoaster ride through the past, present and future of Bitcoin!

### A brief history of money

Historians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. Think about that. We were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. The origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.

Money served three purposes:

* A store of wealth across time. People could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.
* A medium of exchange, to procure things from others.
* A unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.

Starting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** There was a problem with this system, though. You guessed it.

https://preview.redd.it/yikel8bb7j181.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=868a480c045cd934b49a237de42791ebe358d72b

People who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* This is what happened in Africa when glass beads merchants from Europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (This could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).

**Gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. Mining gold is a difficult task. Flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. But the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.

Governments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. This has always worked fine until it hasn't. As long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. But the people who are closest to the means of production of money - Kings, Central Bankers, Cabinet Members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. Or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. This can be seen in the case of the Fall of Rome and Constantinople, the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, the shift of the US and other countries away from the Gold standard \[1\], and the inflation that is looming over the US right now.

Looking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?

* **Convenient to handle.** It should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. Units should be interchangeable (fungible).
* **Credible.** The validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the Government).
* **Liquid.** It should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.
* **Secure.** If the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.
* **Inflation resistant.** It should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.
* **Stable.** The value should not have significant volatility.

The most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. Money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. If an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.

**How does Bitcoin do on these grounds?** Let us start by understanding what Bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** Let's unpack that.

* **Bitcoin is decentralized.** There is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of Bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \- A form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.
* **Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \- There is no reliance on a central banking system.
* **Bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \- A copy of every transaction ever made on the Bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! But because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named Satoshi Nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. Satoshi open-sourced the code to Bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, Satoshi vanished mysteriously.

https://preview.redd.it/se0cusvd7j181.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=882723795759c4fbf097d5048d866784a96d1b6b

To the layman, Bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. To use Bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. Bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). This is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. There is no central authority over Bitcoin.

Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called Satoshis for convenience.

Since 2008, Bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. But...

### Where does Bitcoin get its value from?

We saw earlier that if it’s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. This was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).

The government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. Imagine you have a million dollars and it’s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. That's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **There is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as ""hard money""**, whose supply is restricted.

That's one of Bitcoin's chief attractions. Bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. Each block that needs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \[2\] Bitcoins are produced by ""miners"" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. When miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in Bitcoins**. This is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/anbhkidf7j181.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=912b73102a1efd011cb4a98884b8c3622e89c60f

The physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. The second feature is that **there can be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence**, ever. This is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \[3\] 20 million Bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). By 2140, all of the Bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. As the supply of Bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.

There is no central authority for Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. For example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in Bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \[4\]. But when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like Bitcoin Cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing Bitcoin Cash's value to drop sharply. Hence, **Bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**

The above points show that Bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).

This tells us about the **perceived value** of Bitcoin, but if the aim of Bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:

1. Liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies
2. Fuel for a thriving economy
3. Stable

How does Bitcoin do on these fronts?

### Liquidity

Let's be real here. Most people are interested in Bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. It's because of the **“Number go up”** that every influencer is shouting about on Twitter as if it’s their personal achievement. That's the reason Bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **How is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no “value” or “business” behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**

The misconception here is that Bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. Bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** The problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**

The story around Bitcoin is this:

**“Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.”**

People who adhere to this vision are called **Bitcoin Maximalists.** And in terms of the stories out there, Bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. It makes sense. When personal incentive is tied with a story, the FOMO kicks in of being penniless when Bitcoin takes over. The possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **And as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**

**Bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. Decentralization.**

Though Bitcoin claims to be “decentralized”, that's only if Bitcoin becomes money in itself. To convert from dollar to Bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** These exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. For example, Tether, which debuted as a *Stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \[5\] Tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **It is one of the biggest intermediaries for Bitcoin to Dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**

Of course, Bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. But is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? Shouldn't Bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**

### The Bitcoin economy - and competitors

One of the biggest jokes in the history of Bitcoin was when Laszlo Hanyecz of Florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. That would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \[6\] But that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with Bitcoin.**

https://preview.redd.it/d26vmkrh7j181.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8cadc1ee32062cdef2864a09a85562671a6eb3d

Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of Bitcoin as a mode of payment. From retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of Bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\[7\] There's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with Bitcoin.** But there are things that you **cannot** buy with Bitcoin yet. There's no direct provision to buy stocks on the NASDAQ (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.

A big market for Bitcoin is their programmability - **Smart Contracts will automate the market of trust.** People don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. A clause like “If rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance” can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. But this is also a space where Bitcoin has tough competition.

Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *AltCoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that Bitcoin couldn’t. Bitcoin Maximalists argue that Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, Bitcoin can absorb into its code - But the facts speak otherwise. When Ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of Bitcoin’s, but after Ether started catering to the NFT and DAO space, **it's now a serious threat to Bitcoin’s dominance**. Other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [I'm looking at you, Elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)

But one thing is for sure - It’s very difficult for a new entrant to the Altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that Bitcoin does.*** There is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new Altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. And that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.

**It's not money unless everyone believes it is.**

A strong warning is in place here: When I say a new cryptocurrency is useless, I’m talking about the long term. Coin Offerings have a very strong possibility of being a Ponzi scheme, so be VERY VERY careful with where you put your money.

There's just one more reason that Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still not widespread in their use.

### Volatility

Bitcoin is very volatile compared to the US Dollar. This is something that even maximalists don't argue with. It is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. This is the reason Bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:

&gt;A 10 year old boy asks his father for a [\#BitCoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitCoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 for his birthday.   Dad can I please have just one BitCoin for my birthday as a gift ?  Father: What ? Why the hell you need $ 14,433   Do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. What would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?

But the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, Bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into Bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (The figures are based on growth in Market Cap, number of users, and number of transactions - Unreliable, because one individual can have any number of Bitcoin Addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of Bitcoin, not retail transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/q1vrnyto7j181.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33b03bff8db50bbfc9586d8f45f231dbfb9f6f49

Here we enter the realm of speculation. We must understand that Bitcoin is the first of its kind - A resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. Some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of Bitcoin, rather than a bug. \[9\] Supporters of Bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, Bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (How exactly? I’m not sure. I don't have enough know-how to assess this).

All this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.

### Will the Government be sleeping?

Bitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. Later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that Bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the Government has over money. El Salvador has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first ""Bitcoin City"". What on earth is going on?

In the standard narrative about Bitcoin, after Bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some Central Bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying Bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** Other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up Bitcoin and rapid adoption of Bitcoin follows suit with Bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. This phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**

That sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. Apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose Bitcoin: **The government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase Bitcoin scalably. How will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? There seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since Satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. Even now, [Bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with Ether at 25th). World countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **It is highly likely that Bitcoin (or other Altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** But instead of Bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning Bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate Bitcoin into their legal framework.** Bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \[10\] Though the Indian and Chinese governments banned Bitcoin, India is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. The lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.**

And though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. The real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \[11\]. Hopefully, it doesn't get that far.

### A bitcoinized world: Good, bad or ugly?

The advantages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:

1. Greater freedom of the individual
2. Resistance to inflation
3. Delegation of trust to a mathematical system
4. Reduction in government interference

The notion of decentralization has created this idea that Bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. There are some counterpoints to that argument:

1. The initial distribution of Bitcoin is hugely skewed. By some accounts, 85% of the entire Bitcoin supply is in the hands of ""whales"" who constitute just 2% of the user base (But this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the Bitcoin economy develops). \[12\]
2. Though Bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the Internet.
3. Bitcoiners’ claim that Bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. There is no clear data on how many people believe in Bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**
4. It isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \[13\]. The hope is that the political neutrality of Bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.
5. Governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that Bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.

So will we see Bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?

### Can Bitcoin replace the dollar?

If we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that Bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. It has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 Trillion in **a mere 13 years (**Apple Computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it)**.** Since Bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.

Bitcoin’s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. Though there is tough competition, some of Bitcoin’s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g Meta tried to start its own currency Libra/Diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. Ethereum isn’t truly decentralized either).

The real challenges for Bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** People will only consider Bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. Till then, it’s an asset at most. Although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like NFTs seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.

Price stability is also more likely when Bitcoin has a strong native economy. There are different assertions about its stability - That high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. The truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it’s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven’t seen anything like this before.**

Government regulation is the biggest factor. Without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards Bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the “global currency” that it claims to be. Some milestones to watch out for would be:

* The first Central Bank to store Bitcoin as Reserve currency.
* Clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to Bitcoin.
* Stock Exchanges trading Bitcoin as a commodity on par with Gold and Oil.

If any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. But with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that Bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**

### Conclusion

Though the American dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. The first American dollars were minted in 1792. But it was only in the aftermath of World War 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!

On the contrary, Bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. It's questionable whether the “market cap” of Bitcoin represents any “real” economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the Dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \[14\]

A brief history of money

Historians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. Think about that. We were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. The origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.

Money served three purposes:

* A store of wealth across time. People could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.
* A medium of exchange, to procure things from others.
* A unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.

Starting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** There was a problem with this system, though. You guessed it.

https://preview.redd.it/8pu2wpgj9j181.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac1cc0fcb67bfdbb88bb05a99b0b9912b5c42dd4

People who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* This is what happened in Africa when glass beads merchants from Europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (This could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).

**Gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. Mining gold is a difficult task. Flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. But the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.

Governments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. This has always worked fine until it hasn't. As long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. But the people who are closest to the means of production of money - Kings, Central Bankers, Cabinet Members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. Or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. This can be seen in the case of the Fall of Rome and Constantinople, the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, the shift of the US and other countries away from the Gold standard \[1\], and the inflation that is looming over the US right now.

Looking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?

* **Convenient to handle.** It should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. Units should be interchangeable (fungible).
* **Credible.** The validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the Government).
* **Liquid.** It should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.
* **Secure.** If the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.
* **Inflation resistant.** It should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.
* **Stable.** The value should not have significant volatility.

The most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. Money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. If an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.

**How does Bitcoin do on these grounds?** Let us start by understanding what Bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** Let's unpack that.

* **Bitcoin is decentralized.** There is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of Bitcoin.
* **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \- A form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.
* **Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \- There is no reliance on a central banking system.
* **Bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \- A copy of every transaction ever made on the Bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! But because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named Satoshi Nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. Satoshi open-sourced the code to Bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, Satoshi vanished mysteriously.

https://preview.redd.it/0b5w8jpl9j181.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4163594c2280db18d36ed9303edf3571c72b4017

To the layman, Bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. To use Bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. Bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). This is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. There is no central authority over Bitcoin.

Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called Satoshis for convenience.

Since 2008, Bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. But...

Where does Bitcoin get its value from?

We saw earlier that if it’s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. This was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).

The government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. Imagine you have a million dollars and it’s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. That's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **There is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as ""hard money""**, whose supply is restricted.

That's one of Bitcoin's chief attractions. Bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. Each block that needs to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \[2\] Bitcoins are produced by ""miners"" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. When miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in Bitcoins**. This is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/otsv8j0n9j181.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d0773966819484ef11c5865f0177bc02d22e6ae

The physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. The second feature is that **there can be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence**, ever. This is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \[3\] 20 million Bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). By 2140, all of the Bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. As the supply of Bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.

There is no central authority for Bitcoin. The code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. For example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in Bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \[4\]. But when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like Bitcoin Cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing Bitcoin Cash's value to drop sharply. Hence, **Bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**

The above points show that Bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).

This tells us about the **perceived value** of Bitcoin, but if the aim of Bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:

1. Liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies
2. Fuel for a thriving economy
3. Stable

How does Bitcoin do on these fronts?

Liquidity

Let's be real here. Most people are interested in Bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. It's because of the **“Number go up”** that every influencer is shouting about on Twitter as if it’s their personal achievement. That's the reason Bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **How is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no “value” or “business” behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**

The misconception here is that Bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. Bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** The problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**

The story around Bitcoin is this:

**“Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.”**

People who adhere to this vision are called **Bitcoin Maximalists.** And in terms of the stories out there, Bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. It makes sense. When personal incentive is tied with a story, the FOMO kicks in of being penniless when Bitcoin takes over. The possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **And as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**

**Bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. Decentralization.**

Though Bitcoin claims to be “decentralized”, that's only if Bitcoin becomes money in itself. To convert from dollar to Bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** These exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. For example, Tether, which debuted as a *Stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \[5\] Tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned Bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **It is one of the biggest intermediaries for Bitcoin to Dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**

Of course, Bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. But is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? Shouldn't Bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**

The Bitcoin economy - and competitors

One of the biggest jokes in the history of Bitcoin was when Laszlo Hanyecz of Florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. That would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \[6\] But that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with Bitcoin.**

https://preview.redd.it/eermktbp9j181.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5df9448e1eaa7b010addbdc12f498f2485577d7

Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of Bitcoin as a mode of payment. From retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of Bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\[7\] There's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with Bitcoin.** But there are things that you **cannot** buy with Bitcoin yet. There's no direct provision to buy stocks on the NASDAQ (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.

A big market for Bitcoin is their programmability - **Smart Contracts will automate the market of trust.** People don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. A clause like “If rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance” can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. But this is also a space where Bitcoin has tough competition.

Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *AltCoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that Bitcoin couldn’t. Bitcoin Maximalists argue that Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, Bitcoin can absorb into its code - But the facts speak otherwise. When Ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of Bitcoin’s, but after Ether started catering to the NFT and DAO space, **it's now a serious threat to Bitcoin’s dominance**. Other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [I'm looking at you, Elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)

But one thing is for sure - It’s very difficult for a new entrant to the Altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that Bitcoin does.*** There is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new Altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. And that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.

**It's not money unless everyone believes it is.**

A strong warning is in place here: When I say a new cryptocurrency is useless, I’m talking about the long term. Coin Offerings have a very strong possibility of being a Ponzi scheme, so be VERY VERY careful with where you put your money.

There's just one more reason that Bitcoin and other Altcoins are still not widespread in their use.

Volatility

Bitcoin is very volatile compared to the US Dollar. This is something that even maximalists don't argue with. It is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. This is the reason Bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:

&gt;A 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#BitCoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitCoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 for his birthday. Dad can I please have just one BitCoin for my birthday as a gift ? Father: What ? Why the hell you need $ 14,433 Do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. What would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?

But the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, Bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into Bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (The figures are based on growth in Market Cap, number of users, and number of transactions - Unreliable, because one individual can have any number of Bitcoin Addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of Bitcoin, not retail transactions).

https://preview.redd.it/pcejw8hr9j181.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df0cfd7a129561830c11ccdf87082b664067f59e

Here we enter the realm of speculation. We must understand that Bitcoin is the first of its kind - A resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. Some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of Bitcoin, rather than a bug. \[9\] Supporters of Bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, Bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (How exactly? I’m not sure. I don't have enough know-how to assess this).

All this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.

Will the Government be sleeping?

Bitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. Later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that Bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the Government has over money. El Salvador has accepted Bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first ""Bitcoin City"". What on earth is going on?

In the standard narrative about Bitcoin, after Bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some Central Bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying Bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** Other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up Bitcoin and rapid adoption of Bitcoin follows suit with Bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. This phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**

That sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. Apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose Bitcoin: **The government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase Bitcoin scalably. How will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? There seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since Satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.

There is no doubt that Bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. Even now, [Bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with Ether at 25th). World countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **It is highly likely that Bitcoin (or other Altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** But instead of Bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning Bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate Bitcoin into their legal framework.** Bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \[10\] Though the Indian and Chinese governments banned Bitcoin, India is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. The lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.**

And though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. The real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \[11\]. Hopefully, it doesn't get that far.

A bitcoinized world: Good, bad or ugly?

The advantages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:

1. Greater freedom of the individual
2. Resistance to inflation
3. Delegation of trust to a mathematical system
4. Reduction in government interference

The notion of decentralization has created this idea that Bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. There are some counterpoints to that argument:

1. The initial distribution of Bitcoin is hugely skewed. By some accounts, 85% of the entire Bitcoin supply is in the hands of ""whales"" who constitute just 2% of the user base (But this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the Bitcoin economy develops). \[12\]
2. Though Bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the Internet.
3. Bitcoiners’ claim that Bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. There is no clear data on how many people believe in Bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**
4. It isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \[13\]. The hope is that the political neutrality of Bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.
5. Governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that Bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.

So will we see Bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?

Can Bitcoin replace the dollar?

If we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that Bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. It has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 Trillion in **a mere 13 years (Apple Computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** Since Bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.

Bitcoin’s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. Though there is tough competition, some of Bitcoin’s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g Meta tried to start its own currency Libra/Diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. Ethereum isn’t truly decentralized either).

The real challenges for Bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** People will only consider Bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. Till then, it’s an asset at most. Although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like NFTs seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.

Price stability is also more likely when Bitcoin has a strong native economy. There are different assertions about its stability - That high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. The truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it’s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven’t seen anything like this before.**

Government regulation is the biggest factor. Without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards Bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the “global currency” that it claims to be. Some milestones to watch out for would be:

* The first Central Bank to store Bitcoin as Reserve currency.
* Clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to Bitcoin.
* Stock Exchanges trading Bitcoin as a commodity on par with Gold and Oil.

If any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. But with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that Bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**

Conclusion

Though the American dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. The first American dollars were minted in 1792. But it was only in the aftermath of World War 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!

On the contrary, Bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. It's questionable whether the “market cap” of Bitcoin represents any “real” economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.

Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the Dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \[14\]

If you want to learn more about the fundamentals of Bitcoin, I urge you to check out Robert Breedlove’s [Money, Bitcoin, and Time](https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04), a series of three essays. Though I don’t agree with everything he says, it gives a solid framework for beginners to think about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and inspired many questions in this article.

**Footnotes:**

\[1\] The Gold standard is a controversial topic. Some have hailed it as utopian, others think it’s impractical for the global economy to revert to it. We’ll never know for sure as there’s no country that has hard money today.

\[2\] The problem is based on the SHA-256 cipher which relies on the fact that it’s very hard to factorize large numbers. Some suggest that quantum computers might be able to break this, but it’s highly unlikely and if it happens, Bitcoin is the least of our worries - Many security systems rely on SHA-256, including modern banks.

\[4\] In spite of this, security remains one of the key concerns of Bitcoin. Also, if you lose your private key, you lose your wealth. There's no central authority to appeal to.

\[5\] Check this [video by Coffeezilla](https://youtu.be/-whuXHSL1Pg) where he does a terrific job of investigating Tether, consulting some experts on the subject. Tether is not the first Stablecoin to come under scrutiny - Iron Finance did [a bank run](https://cointelegraph.com/news/iron-finance-bank-run-stings-investors-a-lesson-for-all-stablecoins) earlier this year, and *it had Mark Cuban investing in it.* No one is safe, it would seem.

&amp;#x200B;

**I AM A BORN &amp; RAISED UNITED STATES CITIZEN:**

* Unlike some tutors advertising on Reddit, I am a native-born and raised U.S. American citizen with an authentic natural U.S. American accent.

&amp;#x200B;

**I ALWAYS ACCEPT CALLS:**

* I have no problem speaking with potential clients on the phone.
* I have a suburban upper-middle-class American accent, similar to the actor: Ben Stein.
* Be wary of so-called “tutors” who refuse to accept any phone calls or have a strict “text / email only” policy. These “text-only” / “email-only” tutors are usually located outside the U.S. (ex. Pakistan &amp; Kenya)  and are afraid their foreign accent will expose their true nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WRITE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL:**

* Approximately 98% of the time, I write all my texts &amp; emails in grammatically correct U.S. English with proper punctuation and occasional typo.

* I write my ad in proper American English, the same way I always text and email people.
* I can guide students on formatting &amp; writing term papers, essays, and discussion posts in APA | MLA | Chicago | Harvard format.
* If the tutor you’re checking out consistently writes using egregiously horrendous grammar, do you honestly think it’s a good idea to trust them to help you do well in your class?

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN:**

* I have absolutely no reservations with allowing interested students the opportunity to analyze &amp; assess my intonations &amp; inflections | my erudite diction | my unique vocabulary &amp; word choice | suburban upper-middle-class American accent | my tone &amp; pitch | my articulation to get a better idea of the way I present myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HAVE A UNIQUE VOICEMAIL GREETING:**

* If you call me and I don't pick up the phone in time, my voicemail recording will play.
* I recorded my voicemail message in my own voice introducing myself as Jim O'Hara and explaining my services.
* A professional tutor running a serious business should have a unique voicemail greeting regarding their services.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’M POLITE &amp; WELL-MANNERED:**

* I consider myself to be a very well-mannered and polite person.
* I always speak &amp; text in a clean proper matter without using obscenities or R-rated language.
* Please be wary of anyone using inappropriate R-rated language (example: f-bombs, sh\*t).
* A professional tutor should carry themselves with dignity and class.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE OBLIGATORY ""IS THIS A SCAM?"" QUESTION:**

Considering the fact that you found my contact information online, it’s understandable to be skeptical regarding the legitimacy of my services. Therefore, I’m willing to do all of the following to help you feel more secure in trusting me with your academic needs:

* **1)** Speak with you on the phone and answer any questions you may have so that you have the opportunity to assess and analyze my tone, articulation, accent, diction, dialect, regionalisms, pitch, vocabulary, word choice, intonations, and inflections.
* **NOTE:** I’m a New Jersey-born Irish/Italian-American, but I have been told that I speak in an erudite &amp; articulate suburban American accent with a “professor style” voice somewhat resembling the voice of actor: Ben Stein.
* **2)** Agree to do some homework questions of yours upfront with the work fully shown in real-time to prove my mastery of the course content.
* **3)** Send you screenshots of at least five past scores I attained from completing exams &amp; homework assignments for other students in the same type of class you need help with.
* **4)** Send you full screenshots of written exam solutions I wrote up by hand for students in the past in the same course that you need help with so that you can see my neat handwriting.
* **5)** Provide you with the contact information of students who have utilized my services in the past who would be more than willing to vouch for my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY REBUTTAL TO THE OBLIGATORY “IS THIS A SCAM?” QUESTION:**

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I consider myself to be at least marginally more intelligent (both academically &amp; socially) than the average person. Therefore, if I ever decided to suddenly risk prison time, risk my reputation, and risk enduring the wrath of modern-day “cancel culture” by scamming people out of their money:

* I certainly wouldn’t do it for such paltry amounts of money. (i.e., anything less than $1,000 per victim.)
* I certainly wouldn’t choose high school &amp; college students as my “target audience” to scam, considering that most people without college degrees have abysmally low annual incomes. Why choose low-income victims when it would be much more profitable to target high-income, high-net-worth individuals earning at least six figures a year? I have knowledge in business consulting, and I promise you that a business owner would be a MUCH more lucrative mark than a low-income college student.
* I wouldn’t choose such a time &amp; energy-draining method of scamming people. Also, communicating back and forth with potential clients is an absurdly long time sink since only less than 10% of all potential clients who reach out to me actually become paying clients of mine.  This means that 90% of my time communicating with potential clients ultimately proves to be a colossal waste of my irretrievable time &amp; energy.
* If you pay me to provide academic services and I don’t deliver, you can always dispute the payment with the payment app and easily get your money refunded. If I were in the habit of swindling money from people, then all of my payment accounts would have been investigated and be completely shut down by now. And I would have been permanently banned from opening new accounts.  Therefore, the fact that all my payment apps have been fully active for years should be sufficient proof that I haven’t had people consistently disputing payments sent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Time Series,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Snoo36930/comments/r1rkzz/time_series/,Snoo36930,1,2021-11-25 16:04:40,0,/r/u_Snoo36930/comments/r1rkzz/time_series/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[**Time Series**](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/blogs-learnbay/)is a series of data points ordered in time. In mathematics, time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. In simple words, it is a sequence of discrete time data. Time series tracks the movement of the chosen data points over a specified period of time with data points recorded at regular intervals.

**Definition:**

**According to Mooris Hamburg “A time series is a set of statistical observations arranged in chronological order”.**

**Uses of Time Series:**

It is used for prediction or to detect the changes in patterns in collected data. Here are few uses of time series mentioned below:

·        Used to predict future values

·        Evaluation of current achievements

·        Identify the changes in economics and business

·        Pattern recognition

·        Weather forecasting

·        Earthquake prediction

·        Signal Processing

·        Astronomy

·        Statistics and Mathematical Finance

**Benefits of Time Series**

1.     Time series analysis helps in identifying patterns:  Identifying patterns can reduce error.

2.     Creates the opportunity to clean your data

3.     Forecasting can help in predicting the future

4.     Allows to see what factors influence certain variables from period to period

5.     Helps to compare the performance of two different series for same time duration

6.     Helps to compare the performance of present series with past series

7.     Assistance in management as timely patterns of data are analyzed in business= metrics

**Limitations:** [Time Series analysis](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/) has some weakness like difficulty in obtaining appropriate measures, problems with accurately identifying the correct model to represent the data and the major limitation is that either linear or polynomial trends can lead to unrealistic forecasts.

**Types of Time Series**

1.     **Classification:** It can be useful across many domains and applications. In this, categories of data are assigned.

2.     **Curve Fitting:** In this, the relationship of variables of data can be studied by plotting data along a curve.

3.     **Descriptive Analysis:** It identifies patterns in time series data.

4.     **Explanative Analysis:** This type of time series understands data and relationships within it.

5.     **Exploratory Analysis:** Studiesmainfeaturesof the data, in a visual format.

6.     **Forecasting:** It is used to predict the future. In this, historic data is studied to predict the future.

7.     **Intervention Analysis:** Measure changes of an event, how can it affect the data.

8.     **Segmentation:** In segmentation, data is divided into segments to show the properties of the source information.

**Components of Time Series:**

**Time Series include four components, these are:**

1.     **Secular Trend:** It describes the movement along the term.

2.     **Seasonal Variations:** It defines seasonal changes.

3.     **Cyclical Fluctuations:** It is related to period or periodical variations not seasonal variations.

4.     **Irregular Variations:**It is related to random sources of variations of series.

**Application of Time Series in Business:**

**Time series** is used to determine a good model which can be used to forecast business metrics.It allows management to understand timely patterns in data and analyse trends in business. Here are following uses of time series in several business:

·        **Economic Forecasting**

·        **Sales Forecasting**

·        **Budgetary Analysis**

·        **Stock Market Analysis**

·        **Yield Projection**

·        **Process and Quality Control**

·        **Inventory Studies**

·        **Workload Projections**

·        **Census Analysis**

·        **Utility Studies**

[**Here are other application of time series in various aspects**](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/data-science-course-in-bangalore/)**:**

**1.     Financial and Business Domain:**  Many financial sectors, businesses like banking, telecom, retails etc. decisions are implemented on the basis of future changes.

Testing physical crypto and DeFi killed my faith in it,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r235ys/testing_physical_crypto_and_defi_killed_my_faith/,Vlox47,1,2021-11-26 02:34:41,45,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r235ys/testing_physical_crypto_and_defi_killed_my_faith/,PERSPECTIVE,"I know this is a very unpopular opinion (also not financial advice!!!), which is one of the reasons I think it is even more accurate. Essentially it has become my view that cryptocurrency is failing horribly in solving any of the problems it was supposed to fix. (PSA: I have been known to buy ETH futures quite regularly - and no this is not a post about losing money or big tendies.)

&amp;#x200B;

Within the last year people who know nothing of crypto started talking about it to me. Everyone would mention what platform they use and all the ""alt""coins and where they hoped such and such coin was mooning too. Having only been involved form the long side in ETH futures I decided it was time to do some testing and actually try to buy some ""physical"" coins and see if any of the initial use cases are working. Plus I wanted to test for myself how practical DeFi was.

Now let's get this straight - I know and HATE many ways that banks take advantage of what the industry calls ""unsophisticateds"". Translation ""these people don't know anything about what is going on here to realize how badly we are ripping them off"". The most blatant example of this is foreign exchange transactions. If you are going on a trip, sending money back home to relatives, or investing abroad - you get your face absolutely ripped off without even knowing it. Banks and FX (foreign exchange) exchanges charge 1-2% regularly on these transactions. The actual market is about 0.001% to 0.05% wide for most currencies for liquidity into the several million! Not every single one is like this necessarily - but be warned (why do you think Robinhood is ""free"" LOL!). Anyway - this is great, crypto will solve this right? WRONG!

\#1 FX

Crypto is about 3x worse actually. First, you have to transfer money from a bank to a ""platform"" - this is just another brokerage/exchange - so not decentralized at all. This can be a massive pain. I ended up e-transfering mine because it was cheapest and fastest, but it limits how much you can move each day and week. Other methods require you to pay and can take a while. Great so now my CAD is out of my bank and on a hopium exchange. So how do I buy crypto? Well it's easy enough, you see the bid/ask on the exchange for ETH (what I was buying) and you lift the offer. NOT SO FAST. I figured this would happen, but to buy ETH, you need USD (you are exchanging one currency for a cryptocurrency so they are traded on crosses, yeah that's to be expected for liquidity sake) - so what does the exchange do? Well they convert your CAD to USD first. The platform I used didn't exactly go out of their way to tell you exactly HOW they were doing this - but if you pull your head out of your backside you can quite easily calculate it all. This FX fee cost me 2% of my capital, so at least as bad as any bank trying to fork your money from you. So I was trying to buy $1000 worth of crypto. my $1000 is now $980 ready to lift the offer in ETHUSD. 

\#2 Spreads

So This is the other thing - with exchanges you are at their mercy for bid/ask and fees (obviously you can research beforehand and you should - but I used a relatively reputable one and I imagine they are all similar). I know roughly how wide institutions can buy FX and crypto, and these platforms are ripping you off. Spreads are often 0.2%-2% wide. Personally, this spread was 1.5% wide when I transacted, so now we are looking at roughly $965 of my initial $1000 now sitting as ETH. Oh but wait - you don't actually own the crypto yet.

\#3 gas/mining/block fees

Whichever ccy you are trading has some way to verify the blocks and your transaction, we all know this. I assume if you are a crypto enthusiast you know how much these are... but if you step back you realize how worthless they make the system for everyday people. These are flat fees, so independent of notional transacted.

At the time when I wanted to move my ETH off exchange I just setup my wallet and got the transaction ready, and bam. Waiting... waiting... waiting... it's not getting verified. I had set my gas fee at normal priority of $12 or 1.2% of my remaining $965. Finally it goes through. Sweet, I now have my ETH in my own wallet! all $953 worth of it. it cost me 4.7% to buy my crypto!!! I already knew where this was going and that crypto is actually worse than the current transaction systems in place. Who wants to pay $20 and wait an hour for a $2 chocolate bar? Crypto is totally worthless as a medium of exchange.

\#Phase 1: DeFi / Phase 2: ? / Phase 3: Profit???

So I didn't leave my $953 alone - one of the big draws of crypto - and ETH in particular is the prospect of a complete financial system with interest earning potential and everything. As someone who has looked under the hood of how traditional funding markets work - I was intrigued at the prospect of uprooting it all to a free market decentralized system! Now, to take part in this interest earning endeavour there are a few ways. The first (not DeFi I know) is to lend the crypto and earn interest. This needs an exchange to bring borrowers and lenders together. This is worthless in my mind and a ripoff as they are making huge spreads on the interest paid and received from lenders/borrowers so I didn't even bother. Traditional finance is way ahead of the dumpsterfire that is crypto CeFi. (They can go after people who don't pay and do KYC etc... and yes i know ""DeFi lending"" exists in fully collateralized form - but what's the point? Still a huge spread and basis risk between collateral and loaned funds).

So what about crypto ""savings accounts"". Well it turns out it's pretty trash too. If you think holding USDT or stablecoin or wBTC or whatever other garbage we've come up with and earning interest in a ""savings"" account on it is revolutionary finance then you should sell all your crypto right now and do something else. The only reason that any of that exists is because the people running those can take your $, leverage it, and earn MORE on it for themselves and pay you a little bit. Sound familiar? that's because it is - banks have been doing it for ages.

Okok... but the reason we're here - DeFi right? makes it all worthwhile? Well no, not at all. So in DeFi you aren't earning interest at all (ok if you really want to call the rewards program things with getting x amount of z thing and turning it into (1+r)\*initial amount of ETH, then yeah ok whatever you are kidding yourself. If you are are participating in DeFi - you're trying to earn ""interest"" by ""yield farming"" - which are both massive lies and misnomers in the space.

All you are doing when DeFi farming is market-making. I tried it. So i took 25% of my ETH and put it into DAI and another 25% and put it into uniswap tokens to ""yield farm"" (again biggest misnomer ever). And YES. YOU GUESSED IT! you have to pay a truckload of fees to do this. you have to cross DAIETH and UNIETH spreads, AAAAAAAAAAND pay gas fees. So gas fees had gone up to $17, and spreads were \~2.5%. so $953\*0.985-$17\*2=$905... or another 5% GONE and almost 10% down from initial $1,000 now.

Ok, so I have 25% DAI, 25% UNI and 50% ETH. Now let's MAKE SOME MONEY!!!!! So this part is kinda cool, but completely mismarketed and misleading. Let's focus on ETH/DAI for now as it's simpler to think about as it follows ETHUSD. What you are doing is saying ""I'll stake my DAI and ETH on either side of the market and earn some of the spread"". So ETHDAI (essentially - but not exactly ETHUSD) was around $3,000 at the time - and the uniswap system is pretty cool because you can set your ""market making curve"" and all that. I just set my curve at $1,000 to $6,000 ETHUSD for the test. So great, my Defi contract is all set and I'm staking ETHDAI! what this means is that if ETHDAI (or ETHUSD) goes down, I am selling DAI and buying ETH - providing liquidity to the pool (and vice-versa). That means if ETHUSD goes down to $1k I am holding 100% ETH and have ZERO DAI left.

Let's do an example of what is happening for completeness. So I had $225 (25% of my initial $900 remaining) in each of DAI and ETH at a ETHDAI price of $3,000. So if ETHDAI starts falling, I will be buying ETH automatically for my yieldfarming contract. my floor on my market making curve is $1,000 - at which point I'd be 100% ETH and 0% DAI, and below that I can no longer stake both sides of the market so don't earn anything. Now at this point, our original $225 of ETH is worth $75. Plus, let's assume a linear market making curve (it isn't - but for crypto math that's close enough given the fees we've seen) so an average cost of ETHDAI of $2,000 on the other $225 of DAI means that we have $1000/3000\*225+1000/2000\*225=$187.5 worth of ETH left from our $450 or a 58% loss. Now on the top-side I capped my curve at $6,000 - at which point I'd be all in DAI and sold all my ETH as per the farming contract. So my original $225 DAI would still be worth $225 in theory (it is a ""stablecoin"") and we'd have been selling ETH on the way up. Assuming a linear curve we would have an average sale price of (3k+6k)/2=4500. so $225\*4500/3000=$337.5 add our $225 and we now hold $562.5 worth of DAI. Note if we didn't yield farm and just left it split between the two we would have $225+$225\*6k/3k=$675, or just left in all in ETH and had $900 (though this is a bit beside the point and could be argued irrelevant - note that if we weren't staking both sides from the get-go and ETH dropped to 1k we would have lost more as well). Please also note here that this only looks one-sided because we measure things in USD - which is the same value as 1 DAI. for the ETHUNI swap for example, if ETHUSD and UNIUSD are stable, but ETHUNI moves a lot - then you are worse off in either direction (in USD terms)!!!

So - what is the point? Well, in return for providing liquidity, I get a fraction of the spread charged by the pool and it is paid back to me. A lot of ill-informed people call this ""interest"" which is a really bad way to think of it - you aren't lending money to anyone, you are literally trading the entire ETHDAI curve on the bid or ask side of the market automatically. So when do I make money on this? If ETHDAI stays relatively still in terms of price move and lots of people trade it. That means that I collect fees and don't lose on my original stakes. To anyone who knows about trading may recognize this setup - YOU ARE SHORT VOLATILITY! This is basically the same as selling VIX futures or straddles on any other product. It works really well when things are calm... until it doesn't! I'm not here to tell you not to do it and experiment, but don't call it yield farming or earning interest. You are selling volatility and that's it - which is HIGHLY risky so please - be careful.

So is it worth it? Well, BEST CASE scenario at the time I staked my coins I could earn around 3% annual percentage rate (APR) on my ETHDAI stake and like 5% on my ETHUNI stake. These rates fluctuate depending on the relative liquidity supply to the market, but let's just say they under optimal conditions the market doesn't move much and these are stable around 5%. Now in order to JUST SET UP my money in DeFi it cost me 10%!!!!!!! so it would take 2 years just to recoup transaction costs under OPTIMAL conditions. Does that sound worth it to you? You are better off leaving your money in a 0% interest hole in the ground - or bank unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR/summary: Cost me 10% of my $1000 to setup a DeFi yield farm contract from start to finish that will earn 5% APY - only if I'm extremely lucky.

Crypto is just a worse version of what we have with even more hidden fees and longer transaction times with higher costs - making it worthless as a medium of exchange. Also - trying to get your crypto to work for you is riddled with issues and mostly a scam. Lending interest is centralized and sketchy (why do you think APRs are so high?) and DeFi isn't interest at all - just short volatility, which anyone but experienced traders have no hope of understanding right away and can easily be blindsided. Crypto is honestly becoming worse than banks for taking advantage of ""unsophisticateds"" (people who don't know the intricacies of finance enough to see when they get ripped of by hidden fees or mislead on risks). 

The only thing going for it is some of the anti-inflationary / store of value aspects - but it all hinges on what other people value it at - because on it's own it is useless and has only exacerbated the problems it set out to solve so far."

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

Why Polygon (Matic) is the Most Underrated Cryptocurrency In My Openion &amp; How to Get Started With it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r2dn6j/why_polygon_matic_is_the_most_underrated/,marty6001,1,2021-11-26 11:22:37,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r2dn6j/why_polygon_matic_is_the_most_underrated/,PERSPECTIVE,"  

The point of this post is to create wider adoption for what I believe to be the most underrated cryptocurrency today.

Polygon (Matic) is mostly a  proof-of-stake sidechain that compliments Ethereum as opposed to competing with Ethereum like Sol, Luna, ADA or Avalanche. **I want to be clear, being bulling on Polygon (Matic) is being bulling on Ethereum**. Like Ethereum it has many DeFi Web3 Daps on it. In fact many of the exact same ones Ethereum Aave, balancer, curve, beefy finance, harvest finance, open sea and Sushiswap, as well as a Uniswap v2 fork called Quickswap. See the link below for more.

[https://defillama.com/chain/Polygon](https://defillama.com/chain/Polygon)

I say its mostly a sidechain because Polygon (Matic) has been buying up zk rollups (zero knowledge rollups) They also put budgeted 1 billion dollars into turning Polygon (Matic) into a zk rollup once its been battle tested and is ready for prime time.

The Polygon (Matic) side chain is ready for prime time today. It has over thousands of projects on it.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/polygon-ecosystem](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/polygon-ecosystem)

Also its daily active addresses is averaging about 350k compared to Ethereums 550k a day. That means as of today Polygon (Matic) has 64% of the users as the second biggest crypto currency but only 2% of the marketcap……

[https://polygonscan.com/chart/active-address](https://polygonscan.com/chart/active-address)

[https://etherscan.io/chart/active-address](https://etherscan.io/chart/active-address)

In order to do anything on Polygon (Matic) you need Matic for gas.

Now that I have established using Polygon (Matic) is basically exactly like using Ethereum why would you use Polygon (Matic) over Ethereum? It’s cheaper and faster. How Cheap. Here are the fees as of today according to my tests.

These are estimated gas fees from MetaMask.

Swap = 0.01063758 Matic x 1.91 per Matic = $.02

Add Liquidity= 0.01063758 Matic x 1.91 per Matic = $.03

How Fast is Polygon (Matic)

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think Polygon (Matic) will be the choice for the next defi wave and not other blockchains that are also cheap &amp; fast like ADA, Luna, BNB, SOL

Well, I could write a post just on that but it boils down to at lease one of these 3 reasons for each coin.

1. Its not decentralized.

2. Its not a functioning project as of today.

3. Its competing against Ethereum. Its hard to build a userbase. Really really hard.

Why is Polygon (Matic) better than Optimism or Arbitrum? They Are layer 2 which is also pretty much exactly like using Etherium. For one thing these projects don’t have a token yet so id use them incase of an airdrop. I like both of these projects; I think they will be successful also and I think they will have multiple solutions to eths high gas problems but here is why.

Layer 2 has not been battle tested. Its just not ready for prime time. Polygon (Matic) sidechain is ready to go today and has 64% of the active daily addresses as the second biggest crypto currency.

Layer 2 rollups are cheaper because they rollup many transactions into one. There are two types of layer 2 rollups. Optimistic rollups and zero knowledge rollups. Out of the 2 zero knowledge rollups are better. Basically, the difference is Optimistic rollups require trust that everything is correct and zero knowledge rollups are trustless. 

Optimism &amp; Arbitrum are both optimistic rollups whereas Polygon (Matic) has been buying up zero knowledge rollups &amp; They also put budgeted 1 billion dollars into turning Polygon (Matic) into a zk rollup once its been battle tested and is ready for prime time so they will probably be the first to do it on a large scale.

Polygon (Matic) has a TLV (Total Value Locked) of $4.93B, Optimism $469M &amp; Arbitrum $2.71B.

For those reasons I think Polygon (Matic) is highly under rated and will be the platform of choice during the next big defi wave.

**This is how to get started using Polygon (Matic) sidechain.** 

This is a simple guide that assumes you already know how to use the Ethereum blockchain and have a Metamask wallet. Its meant to prevent some of the common pitfalls I see people running into.

The easiest &amp; cheapest way is to use crypto.com. they recently added the ability to bridge to Polygon (Matic) for free or very little. But here is how to do it from Metamask.

1 buy Matic  - Your going to need to Matic for gas so I would recommend converting all the funds you want to transfer over to Matic then convert to whatever token you want once on matic because its going to cost you $250 to bridge over to Polygon (Matic) so you only want to do it once.

2 send it MetaMask.

3 go to https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/ and send to layer 2 (pay layer 1 fees) $250 in eth at most

4 Choose your token and hit transfer.

5 open MetaMask, @ the top switch to the polygon network using the dropdown.

That’s it now your funds are on MetaMask. Now what. Defi, buy NFTs, Swap Tokens. Defilama is a great site to do what you want. So I coin market cap.

Why Polygon (Matic) is the Most Underrated Cryptocurrency In My Opinion &amp; How to Get Started With it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/r2drk7/why_polygon_matic_is_the_most_underrated/,marty6001,1,2021-11-26 11:30:03,45,/r/0xPolygon/comments/r2drk7/why_polygon_matic_is_the_most_underrated/,NaN,"  I tried posting this on r/CryptoCurrency and it was instantly removed. i mean within 10 seconds.

The point of this post is to create wider adoption for what I believe to be the most underrated cryptocurrency today as to that purpose you might see this posted on multiple subs.

Polygon (Matic) is mostly a  proof-of-stake sidechain that compliments Ethereum as opposed to competing with Ethereum like Sol, Luna, ADA or Avalanche. **I want to be clear, being bulling on Polygon (Matic) is being bulling on Ethereum**. Like Ethereum it has many DeFi Web3 Daps on it. In fact many of the exact same ones Ethereum Aave, balancer, curve, beefy finance, harvest finance, open sea and Sushiswap, as well as a Uniswap v2 fork called Quickswap. See the link below for more.

[https://defillama.com/chain/Polygon](https://defillama.com/chain/Polygon)

I say its mostly a sidechain because Polygon (Matic) has been buying up zk rollups (zero knowledge rollups) They also put budgeted 1 billion dollars into turning Polygon (Matic) into a zk rollup once its been battle tested and is ready for prime time.

The Polygon (Matic) side chain is ready for prime time today. It has over thousands of projects on it.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/polygon-ecosystem](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/polygon-ecosystem)

Also its daily active addresses is averaging about 350k compared to Ethereums 550k a day. That means as of today Polygon (Matic) has 64% of the users as the second biggest crypto currency but only 2% of the marketcap……

In order to do anything on Polygon (Matic) you need Matic for gas.

Now that I have established using Polygon (Matic) is basically exactly like using Ethereum why would you use Polygon (Matic) over Ethereum? It’s cheaper and faster. How Cheap. Here are the fees as of today according to my tests.

These are estimated gas fees from MetaMask.

Swap = 0.01063758 Matic x 1.91 per Matic = $.02

Add Liquidity= 0.01063758 Matic x 1.91 per Matic = $.03

How fast is Matic?

Why do I think Polygon (Matic) will be the choice for the next defi wave and not other blockchains that are also cheap &amp; fast like ADA, Luna, BNB, SOL

Well, I could write a post just on that but it boils down to at lease one of these 3 reasons for each coin.

1. Its not decentralized.

2. Its not a functioning project as of today.

3. Its competing against Ethereum. Its hard to build a userbase. Really really hard.

DappRadar Unveils Own DeFi Ecosystem — $RADAR,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/r3ofxn/dappradar_unveils_own_defi_ecosystem_radar/,Suezzell,1,2021-11-28 06:17:26,0,/r/defi/comments/r3ofxn/dappradar_unveils_own_defi_ecosystem_radar/,NaN,"DappRadar has announced that it is repositioning its platform to become a full-scale decentralized application ([dApps](https://btcmanager.com/tag/dapps/))  and DeFi store. Via the new DappRadar Dapp Store, users can now discover, track and trade all-things decentralized finance, NFTs, and gaming. The team has also revealed plans to roll out its native crypto dubbed $RADAR shortly.

**DappRadar Launches Dapp Store**

DappRadar, the leading decentralized applications data aggregator and analytics platform, is transforming itself into a full-scale dApp store, making it a one-stop-shop for all things decentralized finance, NFTs, and blockchain gaming.

The Lithuania-based firm revealed plans for its Dapp Store launch during an event in Somnium Space on November 25. In addition to launching its Dapp Store, DappRadar is also putting preparation in top gear to roll out its native cryptocurrency dubbed $RADAR, which will function as the governance and utility token of its new DeFi ecosystem.

Commenting on the launch of the DappRadar Dapp Store and $RADAR token creation, Skirmantas Januskas, co-founder and CEO of DappRadar said:

&gt;“We built DappRadar around decentralized apps. Decentralization stands at the very core of our success and it’s only right to take it to the next level – true decentralization of DappRadar. Bringing the community closer is the only way to keep ahead of the curve and remain successful in the years to come.”

**$RADAR Token Launch Imminent**

DappRadar says it has experienced exponential growth since its launch in 2018, becoming the preferred dApp discovery and analytics platform for its more than four million unique users across the globe. 

At its core, DappRadar tracks and offers its users in-depth analysis of more than 8,300 dApps across 27 blockchain networks, plus its proprietary portfolio management suite, enabling its users to seamlessly explore and track applications and digital assets and take advantage of market movements through token swaps and NFT trading.

&gt;“DappRadar was born with the objective of offering accessible information and tools for those who believe in blockchain and in a decentralized world. In an environment that grows exponentially every day, discovering new dApps and filtering which ones can be useful might be confusing and risky for users, especially when this involves trading and investing,” wrote the team, adding “With its accurate data analysis, DappRadar facilitates users managing their portfolios and helps them to track dApps in terms of transaction activity, token volume, and active users, giving them the information they need to identify the most valuable dApps.”

With the introduction of the RADAR token, DappRadar aims to become a fully decentralized, and community-curated platform where key governance and decision-making activities will be undertaken by holders of the token. 

The DappRadar team has hinted that holders of its native RADAR token will be rewarded for their contribution and involvement in its ecosystem, and further details concerning the token launch will be released shortly.

What Taper? Fed Adds $126 Billion to Balance Sheet in November,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/r45iwi/what_taper_fed_adds_126_billion_to_balance_sheet/,exploring_finance,1,2021-11-28 22:30:27,19,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/r45iwi/what_taper_fed_adds_126_billion_to_balance_sheet/,End The Fed,"This article first appeared on [SchiffGold](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/what-taper-fed-adds-126b-in-november/).

The Fed added $82 billion in Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) and $65 billion in Treasuries to its balance sheet while allowing $22 billion in repo agreements to roll off the balance sheet. The net gain was $126 billion in the month that the “[taper](https://schiffgold.com/peters-podcast/the-taper-is-on/)” was set to begin.

The Fed autopilot buying targets about $120B in monthly purchases split by $40B in MBS and $80B in US Treasuries. The stated objective is to decrease purchases by $10B per month in Treasuries and $5B per month in MBS. This means the Fed should have bought around $70B in Treasuries and $35B in MBS. Based on the latest data, the Fed is ahead of schedule in Treasuries but missed the mark on MBS by over 100%.

To be fair, the weekly data on MBS is a bit more sporadic (see Figure 5 below). The MBS maturity schedule is bulky and occurs once a month. This month, there was no big roll-off of MBS which is what caused such a large discrepancy. That being said, given how much the Fed publicized the onset of “The Taper”, it seems odd they weren’t more accurate with their targeting. Perhaps next month shows a larger decrease in purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 1 Monthly Change by Instrument](https://preview.redd.it/tr88lp9ejc281.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1918774a8862b597c0bdfd96fd085a36ab9af06e)

As [discussed last month](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/did-the-fed-experiment-with-a-mini-taper-and-fail/), the Fed had failed to hit the $120B target for three months in a row. Interest rates had been rising during the entire period the Fed had been underweight in purchases. While a few billion wouldn’t impact interest rates on the multi-trillion-dollar treasury market, it could be argued the market was reading into the Fed appetite for bonds, and responding accordingly.

This month saw another large increase in interest rates. Again, there is no way this is attributable to the Fed lowering Treasury purchases by $15B, but it is entirely possible the market is responding to the largest buyer pulling back from the market.

The data has not yet been updated to reflect the massive drop in interest rates experienced on Friday. Rates went back to where they were on Sept 24 in a single trading session. This can be attributable to fears associated with a new Covid variant. Therefore, the chart below accurately reflects the market pricing given the circumstances laid out by the Fed activities and not market uncertainty due to Covid.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 2 Interest Rates Across Maturities](https://preview.redd.it/ytj4r9qgjc281.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=133b11edce5caca22fddd4e33d981c8ee94b723a)

The table below shows the breakdown of holdings by instrument and the period over period change as indicated. The main takeaways:

* The Fed added significantly more 10+ year and &lt; 1-year debt than the 12-month average
   * &lt; 1-year annual avg is $5B a month vs $16B added last month
   * 10+ year annual avg is $25B a month vs $30B added last month
* 1-5 year and 5-10 year saw the opposite moves
   * 1-5 year annual avg is $35B a month, but only $16B was added
   * 5-10 year annual avg is $15B a month, but only $2.5B was added

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 3 Balance Sheet Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/rkxivwpijc281.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3c8908f2008550a7402199b00cc5c7abcefc802)

It’s hard to know how the Fed determines what to buy each month. It typically goes for the center of the yield curve in 2-10 year debt but decided to go for the tails during November. Can this explain the massive run-up in rates in November? Again, maybe, if the market is tracking and responding to this data. If the Fed is having a more direct impact on rates, then this is a very bad sign of what the market can bear.

If fears over the new Covid strain are overblown and rates resume climbing next week, then the Fed and Treasury are both in trouble. As illustrated in the [debt analysis](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/treasury-binges-in-october-adding-almost-half-a-trillion-in-debt/), every .25% increase on Bills costs the Treasury $10B within 6 months but will increase the cost of Notes by $31.6B once it works through the maturity curve (avg maturity 3.4 years). That means a 1% increase in rates will **cost the Treasury an extra $200B per year** once it gets priced in.

Pretend for a moment the Fed fights inflation and raises rates by 5% points. A conservative estimate given the current 6% CPI. The result would be $1T more in interest payments per year! It’s simply not possible.

The Fed cannot fight inflation, and if “The Taper” drives up rates, which appears to be happening, then the game is over.

***Ownership Distribution***

The chart below shows the relative (percent) distribution by product. While absolute values have increased quite significantly as shown in the table above, the distribution of holdings has only changed some. MBS made up 40% of the balance sheet 3 years ago, but the number has fallen to 30%, up from 27% a year ago. Short-term (1-5 year) and medium-term (5-10 year) sit at 24.5% and 11.6%. These numbers continue to move up each month as the Fed presses on the center of the yield curve.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 4 Total Debt Outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/l3nh69zkjc281.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eefcb471a9e8f5f60fa0f1a4abb278c0f75fbb3a)

***Zooming into weekly***

Another chart to look at is the weekly change in the balance sheet. As mentioned above, the MBS activity this month deviated from the normal pace of turnover.

* A series of MBS Mature about every four weeks
   * This usually results in a slight decrease in the balance sheet for that week. This did not occur this month on the 4th week.
* Treasury purchases this week were also lower than average. Is this “The Taper” or a holiday week?

The table below shows how the latest week compares to the weekly averages over 4, 24, 52, and 156 (3 years) weeks. The weekly averages are shown to gauge whether the current periods (1 and 4 weeks) are accelerating or decelerating.

The latest week shows a significant drop in accumulation relative to the averages.

**Historical Perspective**

The Fed is clearly monetizing US Debt. The chart below uses data from the [debt analysis](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/treasury-binges-in-october-adding-almost-half-a-trillion-in-debt/) and matches it up with the Fed balance sheet holdings. While this is not a perfect one-to-one match due to the nature of reporting, the outcome can be seen below. This chart focuses specifically on Treasury securities: Bills (&lt;1 Year maturity), Notes (1-10 year), and Bonds (10+ years). This is the bulk of debt issuance and Fed purchases.

As can be seen below the Fed has monetized a large percentage of debt issued since Jan 2020. The focus is clearly seen in Notes and Bonds to keep a lid on long-term rates. The first chart shows the debt added by the Treasury in each of the last 4 years by instrument. This shows very clearly how the Treasury has been rolling short-term debt to long-term debt in 2021.

The bottom chart shows the percent of that debt the Fed has purchased. In 2020, the Fed monetized more than 100% of notes and 90% of bonds. In 2021 those numbers have fallen to 33% and 46% respectively, up slightly from last month.

Who is going to absorb all this debt issuance if the Fed tapers? Who can absorb almost half of the long-term debt the Treasury will be issuing for the foreseeable future? This is why the Fed will be so delicate with tapering and inevitably increase it as [spending in Washington continues unabated](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/budget-deficit-represents-greater-than-35-of-total-expenditures/)!

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 7 Debt Issuance by Year and Instrument](https://preview.redd.it/l65nvvvujc281.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b112d647701186eee38c63be9d3d1887846ea82c)

The final plot below takes a larger view of the balance sheet. It is clear to see how the usage of the balance sheet has changed since the Global Financial Crisis. The tapering from 2017-2019 can be seen in the slight dip before the massive surge due to Covid.

There is no way the Fed will come close to shrinking the balance sheet at this stage. With more Fiscal spending on the horizon and an economy addicted to low-interest rates, it is probable that the growth of the balance sheet may accelerate rather than decelerate. The Fed already has $9T in its sights.

**What it means for Gold and Silver**

The [Fed is in a box](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/). They cannot let interest rates rise or else the entire economy will come crumbling down, but if they keep the monetary stimulus flowing then inflation will most likely spiral. As shown above, they have monetized a huge amount of the US Debt this year (\~40%). The government needs this monetary support or else rising long-term rates will put pressure on the [Federal Deficit](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/fiscal-spending-up-18-7-mom-and-4-1-yoy/).

The Fed is attempting to Taper, but the math is working against them. They will inevitably reverse course and begin expanding their balance sheet by more than $120B a month. This will continue driving the [Money Supply higher](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/money-supply-growth-accelerates-into-year-end/) putting downward pressure on the dollar and [upward pressure on inflation](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/cpi-blasts-past-expectations-up-95-mom-with-widespread-increases/). Do they have the tools to fight inflation? Absolutely. But the implications of doing so are so politically devastating that they will choose higher inflation over a collapsing economy. Gold and silver will provide excellent protection during this time.

Ignore the short-term fluctuations. The market is pricing in an aggressive Fed. Nothing could be further from the truth if you trust the math and the data. Real interest rates will remain negative for the foreseeable future.

Cyber Security is FinTech's Achille's Heal,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/r45roq/cyber_security_is_fintechs_achilles_heal/,EagleEyeStx,1,2021-11-28 22:42:29,2,/r/fintech/comments/r45roq/cyber_security_is_fintechs_achilles_heal/,NaN," In more ways than one, 2021 has been a huge year for fintech.  The fintech sector is booming, with a record $91.5 billion in global funding so far this year—that’s almost twice as much as what the sector collected in the entirety of 2020. The past quarter saw the birth of 42 fintech unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion), bringing the year’s total to 200, according to CB Insights’ State of Venture Q3’21 Report.  From a macro perspective,  in 2021 the global fintech industry is expected to grow by 23.41% and reach $324 billion by 2026. However, with the continuous changes in the fast-paced fintech space, financial service providers are looking for advice on how to stay one step ahead.  One key area where this hot new field is falling seriously behind is in the realm of security, where more often than not companies increasingly sacrifice security for innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygvi5hxwlc281.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55b13eb15db63a3b133e5a935a341a874a2aae0

One key area where fintech as a whole is behind the curve is in cybersecurity.  As an increasing share of day-to-day interactions are completed within the digital sphere, implementing high-caliber cyber defensive capabilities is an absolute must for the field as a whole. Part of the issue is structural; fintech companies and startups are more lightly regulated than banks due to modest legal regulations. They also offer shorter time-to-market, which is particularly important from the business perspective.   
 However, rapid release cycles means that fintech companies often simplify their products or skip certain features. As a result, fintech companies often secure their solutions only partially, omitting some security measures altogether, especially when they can’t see the added business value.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6s4tizxylc281.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7c3ac4102e6d35f4f1e29453f8e3fc5349e2070

As fintech takes off, there is another important trend to consider: the alarming rise in both the tempo and sophistication of private-sector cyber attacks (especially ransomeware).  Though specific figures for annual losses due to cyber attacks is elusive,  IMF modelling exercise has estimated that financial institutions’ average annual losses from cyber-attacks could reach “a few hundred billion dollars a year”, eroding their profits and threatening financial stability.  This not not small change for an industry that literally undergirds the global economy.  So whos doing something about it?

First off, there has been an encouraging uptick in G2G/public sector collaboration on this pernicious issue. Just yesterday, the  national Bangladesh Bank announced plans to launch a computer emergency response team for the financial sector (Fin-Cert) to avert cyber attacks.  The Fin-Cert will monitor the banking sector's cyber security situation and provide necessary support and advisories to help prevent probable and imminent cyber attacks. It will also facilitate the exchange of information among all the connected financial institutions.  Also this month in a similar vein, Israel and the US (to global fintech and cybertech leaders)  agreed on establishing a bilateral collaboration to tackle the growing threat of ransomware in fintech. They want to safeguard vital financial infrastructure and emerging technologies as well as expand international cooperation to combat the threat ransomware poses to nations and the world economy.  These are just two recent examples of some of the top-down approaches currently being considered by states worldwide.  On this count, the jury is still out.

Then, there's a number of private sector innovators that are applying military-grade cyber technology to protecting critical infrastructure, finance featuring chiefly therein.   The adoption of new remote-working technologies in the banking and financial services sector is challenging the outside-in security approach. A 2020 IBM survey found that organisations deploy approximately 45 different solutions on average, with most requiring coordination across 19 security tools. One firm rising to the challenge is HUB Security, an Israel-based confidential computing pioneer with its eyes set on NASDAQ.  The company specializes in protecting sensitive commercial information and has an advanced encrypted computing solution for companies and organizations aimed at preventing hostile intrusions and the theft of sensitive commercial information.  They've explicitly named fintech and financial sector as strong candidates for their advanced cyber technology.  Meanwhile, larger industry leaders such as Microsoft Azure, IBM, and Palo Alto Networks are adapting their enterprise security packages to more directly respond to fintech and financial services.  Ideally, public and private sector efforts will continue in tandem until a more secure financial framework is operationalized in coming years.

In sum, the cyber vulnerabilities inherent in much of the fintech space today should be a serious cause for concern.  As blockchain and digital wallet tech continues to upend the way consumers execute transactions and relate to money, the fintech-cyber nexus can be expected to strengthen in coming years.  Preserving that spirit of innovation is key to fintech's future viability and explosiveness, but this need NOT come at the cost of financial insecurity for global consumers."

Look at what open platforms have achieved in just a few months vs single app L2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r46xuu/look_at_what_open_platforms_have_achieved_in_just/,Oxygenjacket,1,2021-11-28 23:36:04,17,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r46xuu/look_at_what_open_platforms_have_achieved_in_just/,DISCUSSION,"&amp;#x200B;

[L2beat.com](https://preview.redd.it/7lf13estqc281.png?width=2211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbfad96a49fdbdbf940373e765e54c606e1938ed)

Arbitrum and BOBA have the highest TVL of any L2 right now. This seems odd because both have significantly higher fees than DYDX and Loopring (which are zkRollups and offer liquidity mining incentives). Also looprings TVL is 80% LRC which some would argue should be excluded from their TVL metric, putting them in 5th place.

I strongly believe the reason for this counter intuitive adoption is that Arbitrum and BOBA are open platforms. Anyone can deploy a contract on these layers just like they would be able to on L1. This means the productiveness of these layers is not dependant on what the team can product through their own work and partnerships. It left to the community.   


Arbitrum already has;

*  Lending platform with 45 million deposited called wepiggy ([https://app.wepiggy.com/markets](https://app.wepiggy.com/markets))
*  Dexs such as Uniswap, Curve and Sushiswap (Uniswap has $75 million providing liquidity)
*  An NFT platform similar to opensea ([https://outoforbit.art/](https://outoforbit.art/))
*  Leverage trading GMX and CAP ([https://gmx.io/trade](https://gmx.io/trade))
*  Options trading dapps  like Dopex ([https://www.dopex.io/](https://www.dopex.io/))
* DAOs like DAOHAUS
* Yield optimizers like beefy finance ([https://](https://www.dopex.io/)beefy.finance/)

and they only launched the network in August!  


BOBA is much newer and launched less than 30 days ago but they already have 500M TVL in a single dex on their network called [https://oolongswap.com/#/](https://oolongswap.com/#/)  


This isn't an arguement against ZK and in favour of Optimistic rollups. It just so happens we dont have any zk based open platforms yet. Im sure once starknet and zksync launch their open zk L2s we will see similar or maybe even faster growth from them."
Decentralised Finance Guide: Using Anchor Protocol,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/r47avb/decentralised_finance_guide_using_anchor_protocol/,ChottoTheFuck,1,2021-11-28 23:52:48,0,/r/singaporefi/comments/r47avb/decentralised_finance_guide_using_anchor_protocol/,Investing,"Decentralised Finance Guide: Using Anchor Protocol
This will be a beginners' guide on how to get started using Anchor Protocol. Before you get started, please do your DD and understand the set of risks you are taking when using the protocol. Lets’ get started.

#The goal
To get Native TerraUSD (UST) or Native LUNA into your personal TerraStation wallet.
In order to use Anchor Protocol we have to get either one of the above two tokens into our wallet, there are many ways to do this, below is the method I believe to be the most optimal and convenient path. I will outline and total up all costs in doing so at each step.

#Prerequisites

StraitsX Account Set up and linked to bank account

Crypto dot com (CDC) App account

CDC Exchange account (linked to app)

Terra Station Wallet 

(guide on how to set up wallet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gnFM1CFbOk&amp;t=70s)
(For ledger users: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aQAk0Z_y08)

**Some things to take note of when setting up wallet**
Ensure you are creating your wallet on the official site not on any Google search ranking scams in fact at any point, always ensure that any protocol link you visit is official and safe.

Write down your seed phrase and keep it safe NOT ON A COMPUTER

#Step One: Converting your SGD

Now if you’ve done with all that, go ahead and send your SGD into your CDC App account. This should take no longer than an hour or two to arrive in your account and it will show up as XSGD in a 1:1 conversion.

Once its there, go ahead and buy some “USDC” crypto. This is another USD stable coin, you want to purchase USDC because the spread on the app is pretty bad so you don’t want to do your trades here. The conversion from XSGD to USDC has minimal spread and has no transaction fees. The goal is to send this USDC over to your CDC Exchange account which you’ve hopefully set up and linked by now.

#Step Two: Transferring to CDC Exchange &amp; Purchasing Luna

Transfer your USDC from your CDC App account &gt; your CDC Exchange account. This is a 1:1 transfer with no fees involved. This transfer should be instantaneous.
Heading over to your CDC Exchange account purchase Luna by the Luna/USDC pair (https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/spot/LUNA_USDC)

#Step Three: Withdrawing your Luna

This is the most important step that you absolutely do not want to mess up. To withdraw your Luna you must first whitelist (add) your Terra wallet address. You may withdraw Luna directly from the CDC Exchange but I like to do it via the app instead to make use of the QR code scanner.

To do it on the app you again transfer your Luna from CDC Exchange back into the CDC app which is again, instantaneous. Once its in the App, head to your crypto wallet and select transfer &gt; withdraw &gt; “External Wallet”

You should be in a withdrawal whitelist page where you can add withdrawal addresses, go ahead and add one in and select the crypto Terra Luna. You should be seeing this on your phone (https://imgur.com/a/iu5R3t8).

Head to your Terra wallet and hit the QR button to reveal your wallet address QR code, going back to the CDC app to scan the code to add in your address. Once scanned check if the address is correct and indeed matching your Terra wallet’s. Name the wallet if you wish and you’re done you can add it to the whitelist now.

Now that your Terra address is whitelisted, you can withdraw your Luna into Terra wallet, this withdrawal costs 0.015 Luna (about $0.70 USD). If this is your first withdrawal to the wallet, I encourage you to withdraw a test amount first to check if things are in order.

**Side notes:**

Ensure that the withdrawal network is “Luna” and not ERC-20, in CDC’s case only Luna network is supported.

MEMO is not required here however, when sending funds from your Terra Station Wallet back into CDC the memo may be required.

#Step 4: Swapping your Luna, we’re almost done!

After withdrawal from CDC, it should take no longer than a few minutes to arrive in your wallet. You will see it pop up in your balances.

Next, on the sidebar of your Terra wallet you should see a “swap” section. This is the Terraswap Decentralised Exchange (Dex) you may go ahead to use the swap there, but they charge dynamic fees over there, swapping directly on Terraswap has fixed costs at 0.3 UST check to see whichever method is cheaper for you. I have no idea why the costs are different.

(Swapping directly: https://app.terraswap.io/#Swap)

After the swap is executed you should now have UST in your wallet.

#Step 5: Depositing into Anchor Protocol

Head over to Anchor Protocol (https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn). Again, ensure that any link you visit for defi purposes is the correct and official link. Once you’re sure its correct, connect your Terra wallet and deposit your UST into Anchor. They charge a dynamic transaction fee but I notice that its capped at 1.6 UST currently which is easily hit when depositing upwards of 1000 UST.

For reference it currently costs 0.518 UST to deposit 100 UST.

Once confirmed and deposited you are done! You will see your balance accrue interest few minutes or so. You will be given aUST which is a token representation of your share in the Anchor pool. You may turn those aUST in when you hit withdraw whenever you wish. Enjoy your ~19% annual returns.

**Total costs assuming 1000 UST deposit into Anchor:**

0.4% Tx Fee on CDC Exchange (~$5.50 SGD assuming 1375 SGD converted)

0.015 Luna fee on CDC withdrawal (~$0.75 USD)

0.3 UST fee on Terraswap from Luna to UST

1.6 UST fee depositing into Anchor

0.25 UST fee withdrawing from Anchor
(Reverse process when withdrawing, check if you need memo!)

Some additional stuffs:

If you're feeling adventurous read up on Mirror Protocol and see how you can use that aUST of yours as collateral to further increase yields!

Branching out you may also wish to explore the Avalanche Network in the future and check out AAVE, Curve and Alpha Homora on the AVAX network for similar yield farming strategies.

Hope this guide will be useful to you guys, feel free to ask any questions."

Dear crypto family,

This is what will happen to us between now and February 2022.
Then there is phase 6.
Then we will have concluded, therefore, forget to trade and stay alive.
Let’s help each others.
We do a mass migration, because if we shoot off their radars, we have won their control.
We take all money out of centralized exchange platforms.
And if you think tomorrow that you will have the possibility to trade again you are wrong, because you will not be able to do anything anymore.

Keep your cryptocurrencies on a private wallet and trade on decentralized platforms.

NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COINS

- Must know your time horizon for investments
  - Short Term Investments – 1 year or less
  - Intermediate Term Investments – 2-5 years
  - Long Term Investments – 5 plus years
- Is the investment Liquid(stocks) or Illiquid (Real Estate)?
- Don&amp;#39;t buy preferred shares or convertible shares of stock. They have tax advantages that individual investors can&amp;#39;t get
- Derivative assets(futures) - derive their value from an underlying security or something else (very speculative)
- Stocks – you are the owner
- Bonds – you are the bank
- Short term securities – cash = principal is safe. Inflation risk still exists.
- Mutual Funds – managed on your behalf
- Stocks have historically done better than bonds but move up and down more (Do you want to eat well or do you want to sleep well?)
  - Stocks have a greater distribution range than bonds. IE – they up 30% one year and down 10% the next
  - Investment returns over time tend to mirror a normal distribution or &amp;quot;bell curve&amp;quot;
  - The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution of returns and the risker the investment. Stocks have wider distribution and more risk than bonds. But long term they provide a higher average return
- Don&amp;#39;t chase the next big thing. You will lose
- Don&amp;#39;t speculate
- Do NOT invest in an annuity
- Short Term Investments - Cash
  - 1 year or less
  - Usually Guaranteed
  - Very liquid
  - Low Risk-Low Return
  - Good place for emergency fund
  - Can lose purchasing power if they don&amp;#39;t keep up with inflation. Which they sometimes don&amp;#39;t
    - Common types
  - Savings accounts – stated rate of interest
  - Series EE savings bonds - Discount method – buy for $50 and redeem for $100 later.
  - Series I savings bonds – indexed to inflation
  - Treasury Bills – 1, 3 or 6-month maturity
  - Certificate of Deposit (CD) – have to be on deposit for a certain amount of time. From days to years. They usually rollover if you don&amp;#39;t stop them
  - Money Market Mutual Fund – mutual fund that invests only in short term securities. Unlike savings, they are not federally guaranteed but are considered risk free because other companies will bail them out in a problem
- Mutual Funds
  - Choose a family, not a fund
  - Professional money management and diversification
  - DCA – Dollar cost average is a great way to invest in mutual funds. You don&amp;#39;t worry what the market is doing or where it is going.
  - Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market. DCA!!!
  - Keep a long-term horizon and DCA
  - Most mutual fund investors BUY HIGH and SELL LOW. Don&amp;#39;t do this. Do not bail out of stocks when the market is down and buy on the way up. Most mutual fund investors do worse than the funds they invest in.
  - Choose a fund family and stick with them. Re-evaluate your investments once a year.
  - PITA (Pain in the A\*\*) factor is low
  - Fees
    - Management fee - Between 0.05% and 2% based on asset value
    - 12b-1 – &amp;quot;Advertisement fee&amp;quot; usually under 1%
    - Trading Cost – not disclosed in the prospectus. Look at the fund turnover. Higher turnover = higher trading costs. Lower turnover = lower trading costs
    - Load – charge a commission when the fund is bought. Paid to the financial representative. Usually 3-5%
      - A – front end load – paid upfront
      - B – back end load – paid when shares are sold
      - Deferred sales charge – ladder down then go to zero. 5,4,3,2,1
    - No Load – no commission when the fund is bought
      - No sales representative
      - 12b-1 Fee can&amp;#39;t be over 0.25%
      - I, F = don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;load&amp;quot; but charge a &amp;quot;management fee&amp;quot; of usually 1-2%
      - Index funds are usually true no load funds – be careful because some 401K&amp;#39;s have index funds with very high fee

- REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust
  - Pass through investments that must distribute 95% of earnings to shareholders
  - Own various forms of real estate
  - Good long-term investment
  - No PITA factor unlike being a landlord
  - Very liquid
  - They are a hedge against inflation
  - No management concerns
  - Offer diversification
- Stocks
  - Allow general public ownership in a business
  - Historically the best return is in stocks
  - Very liquid
  - Primary Market – IPO&amp;#39;s – don&amp;#39;t get involved in this
  - Secondary Market – where most investors trade
  - Stay away from OTC (Over the Counter) markets
  - Bid (Sell) - Ask (Buy) – what they will buy or sell a security for. The market makers make the spread between the bid/ask and provide liquidity to the market
  - Don&amp;#39;t buy on margin
  - Don&amp;#39;t sell short
  - Dow Jones – price weighted index of 30 companies
  - S+P 500 – market cap weighted index of 500 companies
  - MSCI and EAFE – index of foreign companies
  - Stock spin off – conversion of a company&amp;#39;s subsidiaries into a standalone company
  - Stock split – increase in number of shares outstanding. IE 2 for 1. You had 100 shares at $10 but now you have 200 shares at $5
  - Share buyback – company buys back their own shares and this increases the EPS because you have less shares
  - Stocks can have different classes.
    - A – original shares
    - B, C, D, E, etc – companies can have different share classes that have different rights or benefits. IE – higher dividend, more votes, etc. look at what you are buying
  - You want cash dividends, not stock dividends

Valuation techniques

- Fundamental analysis of finance holds that the value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
- The worth of a company is primarily based on the earnings the company will produce in the future (difficult to predict)
- The most fundamental influence on stock prices is the level and duration of the future growth earnings and dividends. However, future earnings are dividends are NOT easily estimated even by professionals – Burton Malkiel
- There is no single financial ratio(P/E) that can summarize the general state of affairs of the company
- P/E ratio – current price of a company divided by the earnings per share. Industries tend to have certain P/E ratios. Some tend to have higher or lower P/E
- Historically P/E was supposed to match its growth rate. IE – 20% growth rate = 20 P/E. But P/E have been 100+ at times
- Growth stocks tend to have high P/E – must have very high earnings to justify
- Value stocks tend to have low P/E – doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it is a good buy
- The P/E ratio tells you how long to earn back your investment back. IE – P/E 10 takes 10 years
- Price/Sales ratio (P/S) – same as P/E but you used sales instead of earnings. Usually used for fast growing companies who don&amp;#39;t have any earnings. Wall St. justified high prices on internet stocks during the late 90&amp;#39;s by using a P/S ratio
- Price/Book Ratio (P/B) – Book value is assets minus liabilities. P/B ratio is current price divided by book value.
- Price Ratio Analysis - Expected stock price =
  - 5-year average P/E or P/S or P/Cash Flow x Current EPS X (1 + EPS Growth Estimate)
  - The Price Ratio Analysis has not been very reliable analysis tool
- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
  - Shares of a stock are valued on the basis of the present value of the future dividend streams the stock is projected to produce
  - This strategy worked very well during the 2001 downturn
  - Value of a stock = present value of all future dividend payments
  - Present value – the value today of a lump sum to be received at some future date
  - Different types of DDM
    - Zero Growth – assumes dividends will continue at a fixed rate indefinitely. Works well for stable income producing stocks
      - Take annual dividends and divide by required rate of return (you generate this number)
      - IE – Dividend of $3 a share and 6% required rate of return = $50 share value
      - Zero growth is another way to think about dividend yield
      - IE – Dividend divided by market price = rate of return
      - Example – Utility stock pays a $2.86 dividend. Current price is $75. If we want an 8% return take 2.86/0.08 = $35.75 – stock is overvalued based on our expected 8% return
      - You can also flip the formula to get what the market thinks the return is going to be. Take the dividend/price. 2.86/75 = 3.81%
    - Constant perpetual growth model – assumes dividends will grow at a specified rate perpetuity into the future. Good for companies with consistent dividend growth
      - Example – dividend of $10 per share and a 5% dividend growth rate. Required rate of return = 15%.
      - (10 x 1.05) / (15% - 5%) = 10.5 / 10% (0.1) = $105
      - 3M example - $230.37 per share. $5.44 dividend. Dividend growth 8%. Required rate of return 13%
      - (5.44 x 1.08) / (13 – 8) = 5.87 / 5% = $117.50 – overvalued based on example. But this formula is very susceptible to changes in required rate of return
    - The constant perpetual growth model is very sensitive to dividend growth and required return rates plugged into the formula
    - You can&amp;#39;t use DDM for a company that isn&amp;#39;t paying dividends
    - Dividend growth rates are very difficult to estimate. Unless you are looking at large cap, well established companies. But for smaller, faster growing companies in new industries, it is almost impossible
    - DDM – The value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows
    - This strategy is good for prudent, long term investors
- The value line investment survey is a good place to get your information. You can get this information at some library&amp;#39;s.
- Doing all this math only tilts the odds in our favor. It doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that it will work like we wanted. Ask yourself a simple question. Would I want to own this company if I had X dollars? That is the real question.
- There is no one financial ratio that tells you to buy or sell a stock
- Balance Sheet
  - Financial summary of firm&amp;#39;s assets, liabilities, and shareholders&amp;#39; equity
  - Assets – liabilities = shareholder equity
  - Current – Less than 1 year
  - Long Term – More than 1 year
- Income Statement
  - Financial summary of the operating results for a specified period
  - Revenue – expenses = income
- Cash Flow Statement
  - Financial summary of the cash flow of the company and other events
- Reports
  - 10K – annual
  - 10Q – quarterly
- Financial Ratios – remember there is no one ratio to consider
  - P/E – Price/Earnings
    - Most popular stock market ratio
    - Price/EPS
    - Tells you how long in years it will take the company to earn back its price. P/E of 5 = 5 years to earn back your investment
    - Look at competitor&amp;#39;s P/E ratio. Don&amp;#39;t just look at one number
    - The P/E ratio should approximately match the growth rate. PEG ratio of 1. Higher than 1 = P/E is higher than growth rate. Less than 1 = P/E is lower than growth rate. More than 1 is common now.
  - Dividend per share
    - Dividend/Number of shares outstanding
  - Dividend Yield
    - Dividend per share/market price
  - Dividend payout ratio – how much of the earnings are being paid out in dividends
    - Dividend per share/EPS
  - Book Value
    - Shareholders equity/Number of shares outstanding
    - It tells you the &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; value of the company if you sold off all the assets and paid off all the debts and paid off the shareholders. Many companies trade above book value because they are worth more intact than split up
  - Price to book value per share – tells an investor how far above the market value is above the book value
    - market price/book value
    - 3-4+ is not uncommon. IE – Book value of $5 and market value of $20
    - Less than 1 is bad because the company is in danger because raiders might try to take the company and sell off the assets
  - Price to cash flow and price to sales – don&amp;#39;t use these
    - A way to &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; companies without earnings. Many companies were valued with this during the internet boom of the late 90&amp;#39;s
- Profitability ratio
  - Net Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned after expenses and taxes.
    - Varies based on industry
    - Net Income/Total Revenue
  - Gross Profit Margin
    - Rate of profit earned from gross profit
    - Gross Profit/Total Revenue
  - Operating Margin
    - Rate of profit being earned from net income adjusting for non-cash items
    - Operating Income/Total Revenue
    - The higher the better with the profitability ratios. But check your competitors and see what is the normal for your industry
  - Return on assets (ROA)
    - Measures profitability relative to its total assets
    - Net Income/Total Assets
  - Return on equity (ROE)
    - Measure of the overall profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity
    - Net Income/Total Stockholder equity
    - Return on equity is sensitive to the amount of debt a company carries. If a company carries more debt, it will have a higher ROE.
    - ROA and ROE can be drastically different, especially if a company carries lots of debt
- Liquidly Ratios
  - Current Ratio
    - Current Assets/Current Liabilities
    - Current ratio of 1.0 or higher is good. It means you have enough money to fund your short-term obligations. Higher number is better
- Leverage Ratios
  - Debt to equity ratio
    - Long-term debt/Total stockholder equity
    - A higher ratio means that the company is financing its growth with debt. The lower the number the better
- Sir Issac Newton – I can calculate the movement of the stars but not the madness of men
- Maynard Keynes – The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
- From 1963-1998 the S+P 500 Index funds beat the active funds in 22 of the 36 years
- Many mutual funds have high expenses and high turnover rates. They also have a short time horizon. This makes it hard for them to beat the market.
- If you hear – BE CAREFUL!!!
  - It&amp;#39;s a new era
  - It&amp;#39;s different this time
  - The old ways of valuing stocks are gone
- Ben Graham – the investing public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some action in progress.
- Mania&amp;#39;s will end with a crash every time.
- Ben Graham – Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy
- John Templeton – Bear markets are born of pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy.
- Diversification – spreading your investments across asset classes to eliminate some, but not all risk
- Diversification – guarantees that some investments will not do well any given year. You have to look at the whole portfolio
- Cash has not been the top performer vs stocks or bonds in the last 25 years."

Let’s help each others to understand how much time we have to act.

Do you think it could be functional to move massively to decentralized platforms to be safe?

If we shoot off their radars, we have won their control.  

We take all money out of centralized exchange platforms.  

And if we think tomorrow that we will have the possibility to trade again we are wrong, because we will not be able to do anything anymore.

There is nothing new in this, but I put some useful infos together for everyone whom could agree with this thought.

Action:

Keep your cryptocurrencies on a private wallet and trade on decentralized platforms.

Before you get started, please do your DD and understand the set of risks you are taking when using the protocol. Lets’ get started. r/singaporefi mods aren't approving my post there so I guess I'll do it here.

#The Goal
To get Native TerraUSD (UST) or Native LUNA into your personal TerraStation wallet.
In order to use Anchor Protocol we have to get either one of the above two tokens into our wallet, there are many ways to do this, below is the method I believe to be the most optimal and convenient path. I will outline and total up all costs in doing so at each step.

#Prerequisites

StraitsX Account Set up and linked to bank account

Crypto dot com (CDC) App account

CDC Exchange account (linked to app)

Terra Station Wallet 

(guide on how to set up wallet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gnFM1CFbOk&amp;t=70s)

(For ledger users: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aQAk0Z_y08)

**Some things to take note of when setting up wallet**

Ensure you are creating your wallet on the official site not on any Google search ranking scams in fact at any point, always ensure that any protocol link you visit is official and safe.

Write down your seed phrase and keep it safe NOT ON A COMPUTER

#Step One: Converting Your SGD

Now if you’ve done with all that, go ahead and send your SGD into your CDC App account. This should take no longer than an hour or two to arrive in your account and it will show up as XSGD in a 1:1 conversion.

Once its there, go ahead and buy some “USDC” crypto. This is another USD stable coin, you want to purchase USDC because the spread on the app is pretty bad so you don’t want to do your trades here. The conversion from XSGD to USDC has minimal spread and has no transaction fees. The goal is to send this USDC over to your CDC Exchange account which you’ve hopefully set up and linked by now.

#Step Two: Transferring to CDC Exchange &amp; Purchasing Luna

Transfer your USDC from your CDC App account &gt; your CDC Exchange account. This is a 1:1 transfer with no fees involved. This transfer should be instantaneous.

Head over to your CDC Exchange account and purchase Luna by the Luna/USDC pair. This will incur 0.4% in transaction fees. (https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/spot/LUNA_USDC)


#Step Three: Withdrawing Your Luna

This is the most important step that you absolutely do not want to mess up. To withdraw your Luna you must first whitelist (add) your Terra wallet address. You may withdraw Luna directly from the CDC Exchange but I like to do it via the app instead to make use of the QR code scanner.

To do it on the app you again transfer your Luna from CDC Exchange back into the CDC app which is again, instantaneous. Once its in the App, head to your crypto wallet and select transfer &gt; withdraw &gt; “External Wallet”

You should be in a withdrawal whitelist page where you can add withdrawal addresses, go ahead and add one in and select the crypto Terra Luna. You should be seeing this on your phone (https://imgur.com/a/iu5R3t8).

Head to your Terra wallet and hit the QR button to reveal your wallet address QR code, going back to the CDC app to scan the code to add in your address. Once scanned check if the address is correct and indeed matching your Terra wallet’s. Name the wallet if you wish and you’re done you can add it to the whitelist now.

Now that your Terra address is whitelisted, you can withdraw your Luna into Terra wallet, this withdrawal costs 0.015 Luna (about $0.70 USD). If this is your first withdrawal to the wallet, I encourage you to withdraw a test amount first to check if things are in order.

**Side notes:**

Ensure that the withdrawal network is “Luna” and not ERC-20, in CDC’s case only Luna network is supported.

MEMO is not required here however, when sending funds from your Terra Station Wallet back into CDC the memo may be required.

#Step 4: Swapping Your Luna, We’re Almost Done!

After withdrawal from CDC, it should take no longer than a few minutes to arrive in your wallet. You will see it pop up in your balances.

Next, on the sidebar of your Terra wallet you should see a “swap” section. This is the Terraswap Decentralised Exchange (DEX) you may go ahead to use the swap there, but they charge dynamic fees over there, swapping directly on Terraswap has fixed costs at 0.3 UST. Check to see whichever method is cheaper for you. I have no idea why the costs are different.

(Swapping directly at Terrawap: https://app.terraswap.io/#Swap)

After the swap is executed you should now have UST in your wallet.

#Step 5: Depositing into Anchor Protocol

Head over to Anchor Protocol (https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn). Again, ensure that any link you visit for defi purposes is the correct and official link. Once you’re sure its correct, connect your Terra wallet and deposit your UST into Anchor. They charge a dynamic transaction fee but I notice that its capped at 1.6 UST currently which is easily hit when depositing upwards of 1000 UST.

For reference it currently costs 0.518 UST to deposit 100 UST.

Once confirmed and deposited you are done! You will see your balance accrue interest few minutes or so. You will be given aUST which is a token representation of your share in the Anchor pool. You may turn those aUST in when you hit withdraw whenever you wish. Enjoy your ~19% annual returns.

**Total costs assuming 1000 UST deposit into Anchor:**

0.4% Tx Fee on CDC Exchange (~$5.50 SGD assuming 1375 SGD converted)

0.015 Luna fee on CDC withdrawal (~$0.75 USD)

0.3 UST fee on Terraswap from Luna to UST

1.6 UST fee depositing into Anchor

0.25 UST fee withdrawing from Anchor
(Reverse process when withdrawing, check if you need memo!)

#Some additional notes

If you're feeling adventurous read up on Mirror Protocol and see how you can use that aUST of yours as collateral to further increase yields!

Branching out you may also wish to explore the Avalanche Network in the future and check out AAVE, Curve and Alpha Homora on the AVAX network for similar yield farming strategies.

There is also the alternative method of using Kucoin to purchase UST directly and withdraw at fees of 4 UST. The costs are similar, but I feel like this introduces more failure points as you cannot fiat on-ramp directly on Kucoin and have to use another exchange on top of Kucoin. Furthermore, Kucoin is a bitch and sometimes turns off UST withdrawals, and in my personal opinion after Binance and Huobi got banned by SG gov, Kucoin is next.

Hope this guide will be useful to you guys, feel free to ask any questions."
