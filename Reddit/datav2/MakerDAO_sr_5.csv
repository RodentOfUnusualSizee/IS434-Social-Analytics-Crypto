I see most people use Tether or USDC and I wonder what the difference is? How much are the fees in comparison? Are there any advantages or disadvantages? Is it private as in kyc?

Ethereum is known by huge gas fees etc, I'd like to understand if this is the case for DAI.

Thank you!"

Two things I'm trying to do.

1. Put the ETH to work without selling and missing out on potential price gains.
2. Put the ETH to work and avoid paying capital gains taxes on it, since I'm not actually selling and creating a taxable event.

For these 2 things..I feel like MakerDAO and defi in general are awesome!  However, the variable interest rate scares me and I thought I read somewhere it was a 20% stability fee at one time.

My current test vault is an ETH-C vault, 3.5% interest with a 175% min. ratio.  Aside from all the obvious risks (hacks to the smart contracts, etc) is the biggest risk the fact that the stability fee can blow up? 

If it does, what's the cycle the rate changes on? 1yr, 6mo, etc?  

What scenario do you generally see these hikes happen in?  

Are there any defi platforms out there with fixed rates that function in a similar manner (borrowing against ETH)?  

Are there any projections of what the stability fees may look like in the future?

In these last year I started to invest in low market cap projects, like HBAR, ONE, HOT, BTT and in the last month I started to look to ICO/IDO to try to get projects in the very start.

First of all, ICO is much more risky than investing in projects in an advanced stage. That's why I decided to invest only a small amount of my portfolio on ICO generally. Always do your own research.

Here on the website you can find all the info about the ICO: [https://merchanttoken.org/](https://merchanttoken.org/?ref=YK5XR7MZ6)

Here the reasons will i decide to invest, i tried to resume much as possible:

1 - The project is amazing! In resume, they will provide consumer protection and concepts from the tradicional card payment industry to enable credit card terminals to accept any crypto with support for smart contracts, like Ethereum, Cardano or Solana.

It solves a real problem that is common to all merchants, the chargebacks. There are very interesting concepts like Automatic Dispute Management (ADM) and Community Dispute Management (CDM) you can find more about in details on whitepepper.

2 - The team behind the project is a Sweden company (Hips) and they work with POS terminals for payments using credit card, qrcode and others already processing payments for over 200,000 merchants globally. This gives the team the perfect background for the team!

3 - As the project is registered Finansinspektionen (FI), Sweden's financial supervisory authority under the number 80658. As it’s being registered in Sweden it will also be under Sweden laws, which gives me some peace to go sleep at night.

4 - It was already announced a partnership with The Payment House, to start in november this year to provide crypto as payment method for over 30,000 taxis in UK and Scandinavia.

5 - There are only 100,000,000 tokens as the maximum supply, with a fully diluted market cap only 120 millions! If this project reaches the market cap of only 1,2 bi it will make 1000% on the investment! As comparison some projects with similar market cap would be Bakery Token, Celo, Ankr, Kucoin and others around #87 to #93."

I'm asking this question while pondering the long term growth and use of DAI; I can see a future where the dollar is no longer the primary currency for global commerce, but exists in competition with a number of currencies."

What makes token price keep rising?

I summarized 3 types of logic for rising token price.

What is the rational token economy model behind token price? How can some cryptocurrencies’ price keep solid in the long run?

Vitalik once mentioned in his blog his valuation for medium-of-exchange token based on Fisher’s formula: M * V = P * T

Here:

— M is the total number of coins;
— V is the velocity of money, that is, the number of times an average token changes hands everyday;
— P is the price level, this is the price of goods and services in terms of the token, so it is actually the inverse of the currency’s price;
— T is the daily transaction volume, which is the economic value of transactions per day

To put it simply, if there are M number of tokens, each of them changes hands N times a day, then there’s a daily economic transaction scale corresponding to the value of M * N tokens. If daily transaction volume is T, then token price is T / (M * N), and the average price level P is T’s reciprocal: M * N / T.

If we simplify the analysis, let H = 1 / V, then H represents the average time span a user holds the token. Let C = 1 / P, so C represents token price.

Then M * V = P * T can be simplified as M / H = T / C or M * C = T * H

We can come to a simple conclusion, purely from a market perspective, that when other basic conditions (M and T) stay the same, the longer a token stays in user’s hands (H), the higher token price would rise.

Of course, the above is a static model. In reality, demand and trading volumes keep changing.

In fact, this is an important reason the U.S. stock market has prospered all these years. A large number of institutional investors and even individual investors in the US stock market are holding stocks for a long time. The holding time is often measured in years.

So in DeFi perspective, what could make users hodl tokens for a long time?

Now we can talk about our main topic: the logic behind rising token price.

On the high level, we all know that creating more token usage scenarios and increasing demand for tokens certainly help promote the rise of token

From a token engineering perspective, successful blockchain projects with good token economy design can be roughly divided into three categories:

The First Category is Tokens with the Mining Logic：

When the token has good fundamentals, the mining token provides a passage for rising token price：

The feedback process of token price growth：Found price of mining coins as A -&gt; price rises -&gt; more miners join -&gt; mining cost increases -&gt; mining cost rises to high level

With a good fundamentals, tokens with mining logic provides a good price support.

The feedback process of price support works like this: the price of coin falls -&gt; price falls to the mining cost -&gt; miners reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; coin price stop falling

The more miners, the more stable the system will be. With the mining cost continues to rise, coin price gets a high support and the bottom of the mining cost to rise.

In the long run, as long as the feedback loop continues to go on, Bitcoin’s price (no matter as digital gold or as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash) will have a higher and higher price support.

Of course, mining is not something that all tokens should take. In some cases, a 51% attack can wipe out the entire value of a project. Mining logic is valid only if the value of the blockchain project itself continues to grow.

The perfect thing about Bitcoin is that the more miners, the more stable the system, the more obvious the network effect of Bitcoin, and this fact itself raises the value of the Bitcoin network.

The Second Category is Tokens with Delegated Proof-of-Stake

To some extent, EOS’s supernodes are like miners, and in order to obtain mining rights, supernodes need to buy EOS tokens in the market to obtain mining rights; EOS will allocate a part of the additional issuance of EOS to these supernodes.

It is important to know that there is a capital cost to participate in the supernode election due to the lock-up of EOS tokens. Furthermore, some of the EOS tokens of supernodes are borrowed, the costs above are to some extent the mining costs. The hardware cost, operation and marketing costs can also be considered as fixed mining costs.

The feedback process of token price rise：price rises -&gt; more people join supernode election -&gt; cost for being elected as a supernode increases -&gt; cost for being elected rises from B to B1.

The feedback process of price support: token price falls -&gt; price falls to cost B1-&gt; supernodes reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; DPOS token price stop falling.

During this process, it is more ideal for the supernode election to happen in real time. Since the DPOS tokens will inevitably need to have additional issuance, the demand for DPOS coins must be increased.

The Third Category is Platform Tokens:

By platform tokens we specifically refer to tokens from trading platforms that regularly distribute profits to token users. The most successful case is BNB from Binance Exchange.

Benefits of BNB: 20% of the quarterly net profit of Binance Exchange is used for BNB buyback, and the BNB tokens which got bought back are burned.

Now sitting at over 600, BNB’s buyback-and-burn mechanism is proved to be one of the most successful method for price-pumping.

The feedback loop of token price growth is that the buyback action will directly raise token price. Some people will buy tokens because they want to arbitrage, which will push up the price. So every time buyback happens, the price will be pushed up, which in turn will push up the cost of holding these platform tokens. In fact, a buyback program with token burn is very similar to a dividend program.

Another hidden logic for platform token is that: If platform token holders can enjoy the usage of the tokens, they will be willing to hold it for a longer time, otherwise the arbitrageurs will sell soon after buying. Similarly, platform tokens are not suitable for large-scale additional issuance.

Platform tokens perfectly conform to two characteristics:

The first is that all the holders of the token are protectors and even promoters of it.

The second is that the holders of the tokens are also the users of the tokens, so people will purchase platform tokens to use them.

It is obvious that the platform token logic is only valid when the value of the blockchain project itself has growth potential. In the case that an exchange can continue to prosper, the price of the platform token will continue to rise.

The bottom line of the price support for the platform token is provided by the value of the platform itself. If the exchange users are exhausted, the platform token might still drop to zero.

To summarize：

The three models above are summarized as follows: turning speculation into investment and allowing holders of the tokens to obtain stable return.

Of course, for methods like staking and mint-and-burn to successfully decrease the liquidity of tokens and increase holding time of tokens, it requires the support of the value of the project behind the tokens so that the tokens are actually used.

Team Missile Farm is determined to create more use cases for MSI so that it is granted an intrinsic value rather than a nominal value.

How does Missile.Farm work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/n6sw8n/how_does_missilefarm_work/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 15:26:22,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/n6sw8n/how_does_missilefarm_work/,NaN,"**We** know that many have lost money in altcoins and have high levels of skepticism about this new opportunity.

So let’s break down what Missile Farm does in language as close as possible to how the current financial world works.

1. You know what interest is:

You have $10,000 in your bank account and you earn a 12.5% annual return on your investment. After 12 months, you receive a deposit of $12,500 as an interest payment. After five years, you have $16,250.

2. You know what compound interest is:

It’s interest on interest. You get interest on the initial amount you put in, and you get interest on the interest already accumulated from the previous years.

So with compound interest, after 5 years you won’t have $16,250, you’ll actually have $18,020.

So far, so good.

***But what if there was a “third way”?***

This is the question we asked ourselves as programmers.

3. Here’s what Missile interest is:

When you take your crypto and lock it up on Missile Farm we find ways to add to the compounding of your asset. If one of the platforms we use gives away a promotional coin on top of any interest, then we take that promo coin and sell it for more of what you staked.

‌���The result is a significantly higher overall annual return.

When Missile Farm combines your 3402% annual compounding interest with the 2480% interest of another site’s promotional coin, you get 5882% APY on Missile Farm.

Missile Farm’s wBNB vault is doing just that. At the time of writing, you get 6132% APY for your BNB.

***After just 1 month, that 10,000$ would already amount to 20684.5$. How about 12 months? An astounding 613,200$! ; even with a more realistic APY, which according to our predictive model would approach to 280% in 6 months, the 5 year ROI will be around 1,721,036.8$; all in the asset you actually staked!***

Even if the mechanism is not identified, this possibility may be a factor to deter some users from using DAI. I think this could be alleviated by explaining better the interplay between MR, DAI and the rest of the crypto market ecosystem. In practice, there are many scenarios that could be simulated using multi-agent simulations. The result of the many scenarios could be published and peer reviewed to demonstrate that DAI is resilient to certain scenarios and not resilient to other scenarios. This work could also help MakerDAO foundation to make more informed proposals."

MKR owner and holder over here. And I'm very happy to be a part of this amazing opportunity to have two of these coins, as I'm a big believer in the future of the price of this coin.

So, I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and have a question I wanted to pose...I hope it doesn't seem complicated, but basically, my question I've been pondering is—I know there are only 995,239 in circulation out of a max supply of 1,005,577.

According to Coin Market Cap, you can purchase the coin on:

\-Binance

\-OKEx

\-Uniswap

\-Coin Base Pro

My question is, how do all these platforms keep an accurate amount of coins that are available. For example, could someone purchase this coin and the coin not actually be available? I know there is a saying, ""No Keys, No Wallet.""...But, how is the overall MKR database actually able to keep track of the ""995k"" coins?

Are there times when this coin is overbought and a buyer is simply buying into the liquidity of the certain platform at the time? 

I do know of the Maker Burn website and the coins that are burned being shown live. I'm curious if their website just has these platforms funneled live into their AI configuration? I am curious if anyone can provide any more in depth information on this. Thank You!"

Nonetheless, my mind struggles with some of the working mechanisms of MakerDAO and, especially the governance voting. **The fact that voting power is proportional to the MKR holdings goes against my intuition of decentralization.** I understand that more involved people are probably more knowledgeable about the technology and possess bigger bags. However, this creates a barrier for newcomers to educate themselves about Maker and participate in votings. Moreover, the more people possess MKR the higher their voting power and the higher the centralization. In theory, big banks could buy loads of MKR to have an important influence on decisions? 

In my ideology, decentralization is a way where everyone has the same power to influence governance and where money is out of the question. What are your thoughts?"

On the other hand, Maker value accumulation is also a hedge against instability in the black swan event, and a higher priced Maker token would mean less Maker would need to be minted to overcome a short-term shock in the system.

We should set a blanket policy for buffer growth that is matched to the rate of increased DAI minting, and one that is not voted upon only when the previous buffer is filled. In other words, X amount of DAI is minted, Y% of DAI Buffer is created.  Something like that.

Buffer growth should be built into the Maker protocol, and no longer a matter of voting; same with the burn rate, which should be higher than 25% to sustainably increase value to Maker holders."

Ignoring the recent insane gas spike for the dog flavored meme of the week, could anyone summarize the numbers for me?

If a typical eth transfer is \~21,000 gas, what multiple of that can I expect in creating a vault? How much gas would a repayment consume?

&amp;#x200B;

Is the stability fee, the compounding interest rate I will be charged? Taking ETH-C for example where it states 3.5%, is this the charges I accrue per year? Or does it end up higher with the frequent compounding per second/block/day (however it's calculated)

&amp;#x200B;

If the liquidation Ratio is 175%, does this mean I would be liquidated at $1000 of borrowings against $1750 worth of ETH? How do buffer ratio's affect interest rates, and how does this correlate with a riskier ETH-B vault?

It is a platform where you can get a crypto loan for just 5% APR. We also have other cool features like unlimited loan terms, no recurrent payments, and the loans are almost instant to take (unlike Nexo, for example). In fact, it usually takes about few minutes to receive your loan. 

Right now we are just walking around Reddit, trying to see if there are people in coin communities who would be interested in loaning/borrowing specific assets.

So, the question is: Would any of you guys be interested in loaning MKR against USDT/USDC?

Even though we are a relatively young project there are some reputable partners working with us already such as ChangeNOW and Guarda wallet. Also, we continuously look for more great projects to work with!

Also, we’d be grateful for literally any feedback — be it positive or negative. If you like it, let us know. If you think it looks scammy/unreliable, PLEASE let me know. Cheers!"

Long story lead up to my question because I welcome guidance on my journey.

I think the concept works for my business investment strategy:

I want to invest $100k in my company and I have the asset now.

If I open a vault with $200k, I can withdraw DAI 100k and loan it to my business. 

Then my company pays back 4k DAI monthly for 50 months and the loan is repaid. 

In the meantime my vault is growing with the value of my crypto. I can continue to capitalize my business with the same asset.

My company borrows interest free, and if all goes according to plan my asset doubles or quadruples in value and my business operation turns profitable.

So on Oasis it says i can fund my vault with Ethereum, but how can I fund with MKR? 

Or is there a reason why I shouldn’t?

So I started to read articles and watch videos to understand its functioning and there is one thing that isn’t clear…

If I understood it right, in the case the value of the crypto used as collateral (es ETH) fall under a certain “limit”, the smart contract burns the DAIs of the user who minted them and returns him his ETHs.

But what if I just buy my DAIs on an exchange, do I have to worry about collaterals’ quotations? And how do I know which crypto has been used as collateral for my DAI?

On the other hand, what if I mint some DAIs depositing ETHs as a collateral and then I sent all my DAIs to a friend? In the case collateral isn’t enough anymore what happens?

Thanks in advance and sorry for the banal question :)"

I updated the ETH app on Ledger Live and when I tried connecting using the Ledger on Legacy, I see a pop-up window saying Oasis app wants to connect, and below is a message saying No compatible devices found, and yet on the old Oasis app I have  just generated DAI using the same Ledger device and deposited ETH back to my vault.

I am still trying to wrap my arms around all of this. I have a coinbase pro account still holding some ether and mkr.

My objective here is to store everything in a secure location and ultimately open a mkr vault so I can borrow DAI.

But I need to figure out the best way to buy my ether/crypto (via US bank to somewhere) without doubling or tripling the fees to transfer from coinbase to a wallet to a vault.

I assume the PETH that's sold off are other people's collateral? Doesn't this have a lot of downstream negative effects? For example, if someone gets liquidated in the PETH-DAI pool and their PETH is not enough to pay back the debt, then someone else's PETH is sold to pay off the DAI, but that could cause someone else to be liquidated and so on."
💵 xBTC💵 allows the use spot price to synthetically speculate on every single digital asset.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Did a bit of a deep dive on this one and wanted to pull out some parts of the white paper that kind of blew my mind:

&amp;#x200B;

xBTC is a brand new asset class that will revolutionize how individuals use digital assets. xBTC is completely synthetic and decentralized, it can be used without KYC, using a closed system, or providing collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

xBTC is an open market price on Bitcoin Dominance. Users can use this open market price to synthetically hedge against Bitcoin dominance rising or falling. 

&amp;#x200B;

They can also use this spot price to synthetically speculate on every single digital asset.  It’s like a synthetic index of every digital asset other than Bitcoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the underlying assets are never held and there is no collateral restraint. xBTC’s fully synthetic nature allows it to be used at a scale the market deems necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of tracking Bitcoin’s price, xBTC tracks Bitcoin market dominance. This type of hedge is much more responsive and adaptive than a price hedge. Bitcoin’s price could stabilize, or even go up, and not keep up with the rest of the market.

&amp;#x200B;

A Synthetic Dominance Hedge only takes into account how well Bitcoin is doing against other digital assets. xBTC also acts like a synthetic tracker (index) of all digital assets. 

&amp;#x200B;

It connects the price movement of every digital asset to xBTC supply. This is the most diversified metric a token can track in digital assets, sans Bitcoin. The simplicity and accessibility of xBTC are unmatched.

&amp;#x200B;

More information at our website.

&amp;#x200B;

Features of xBTC:

1. ✅ Synthetically access Bitcoin Dominance; 

2. ✅ A synthetic tracking of all digital assets versus Bitcoin;

3. ✅ A synthetic asset that rewards holders and community members;

4. ✅ An effective trading pair through a more stable spot price;

5. ✅ Simple one token access to all the above.

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi, Social Networks, Gaming, Smart Contracts – all blockchains and use cases are tracked with  xBTC.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin dominance will be much less volatile than individual asset prices. This means xBTC’s price will be less volatile. Rather than reward holders with price swings, they are rewarded with supply swings. With less volatility in spot price, xBTC can act as a more effective trading pair and transfer of value.

While I know there are a lot of people that love the decentralized, ""democratic,"" and ""free"" nature of crypto, the part where crypto promises to upend stagnant systems and  break capital out of moribund systems, there's a real need for there to be some order to the crypto system.  I think most of us who participate in crypto would agree that paying taxes on gains is appropriate, and that it is in our best interest to ensure that crypto remains an above-board part of the global economy, not some back-channel for illicit transactions and tax avoidance.

I say bring on the regulation.  Let's make this space more mature.  Let's show that the promise of crypto can work in parallel with existing national systems, and in so doing, create global trust in crypto, in defi, and in the promise of the blockchain technology."

You can exchange each Kovan **MILLI** token for .001 **Mainnet ETH** at this site: [MILLI Token Exchange](https://www.tokenup.app)

(If you like the domain name **TokenUp.app**, then please like this post.)

Kovan confirms transactions in less than 15 seconds, with no gas fees. On the Ethereum Mainnet, transactions can take hours to be confirmed. Sites like Uniswap and OpenSea often charge more than $50 in gas fees.

The **MILLI** token has the following advantages over **DAI** (and side-chains that require DAI, like **xDAI**):

1. **MILLI** retains the same value as **ETH**. If you had exchanged your ETH for DAI or xDai a year ago (when ETH was $200), you would have missed the **2,000% increase in value** that ETH has experienced in the past year (ETH was as high as $4,382). **MILLI** is always worth the same as ETH, so when ETH goes up in value, so does MILLI.
2. To convert **ETH** to **DAI** (or vice versa), you must use a site like **Uniswap**, which often charges more than $50 in gas fees. To exchange ETH for MILLI only requires a simple ETH transfer, which currently costs less than $5.00 when the Gas Price is 50 gwei.

**Here is a Decentralized App that uses MILLI Tokens:** (Log into Metamask first.)

[Roulette for MILLI](https://predictionwagers.github.io/Roulette/milli.htm) lets you be the House that others play Roulette against. The House receives a 5.26% advantage over the player, since payouts do not compensate for the two additional spaces on the board (0 and 00). [Roulette for Kovan](https://predictionwagers.github.io/Roulette/) is the same app, except it uses ""play money"" (Kovan ETH) instead of MILLI.

**For Programmers:** You can add **MILLI** Tokens to your app, using the same technique as adding **DAI** Tokens. Here is the MILLI Token Contract Address: **0x4Eb71318c6260E95626cF0fD7886577252dC9523**"
Is the Kovan Testnet trustworthy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ni2957/is_the_kovan_testnet_trustworthy/,SkillDuel,1,2021-05-22 04:36:35,5,/r/MakerDAO/comments/ni2957/is_the_kovan_testnet_trustworthy/,NaN,"I created a tool which allows Kovan Testnet ETH to be exchanged for Mainnet ETH: [https://www.TokenUp.app](https://www.TokenUp.app)

Several people have questioned the trustworthiness of the Kovan Testnet. For the following reasons, I believe Kovan is trustworthy, so I will appreciate any evidence to the contrary:

1. Kovan has been 100% dependable since it was created in March 2017.
2. There have been no reports to indicate that Kovan is not trustworthy.
3. Kovan uses Proof of Authority, which requires **a consensus of Authorities** to create blocks. According to the following article, ""This makes PoA based blockchains very popular amongst the market leaders, such as DNVGL, Walmart, GE Aviation for supply chain use-cases."": [https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/proof-of-authority/3577](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/proof-of-authority/3577)
4. Kovan's blocks are validated by Authorities that include Etherscan, MakerDao, and Parity Technologies.
5. A single malicious Authority cannot irreversibly alter the Kovan blockchain.
6. Kovan's blocks are mined every 4 seconds. Therefore, it would be very easy to identify a malicious Authority, as their block's timestamp would not be exactly 4 seconds after the previous block."

advantages:

- fees from uniswap you earn

- stability fee 1% easily can earn that back with loaning out dai on compound for e.g. 

disadvantages:

- high gas costs of opening a vault, it would take a large amount of minted dai loaned on compound at 5%ish to make up for this.

- ?? anything else?

im wondering what peoples experiences have been using the LP tokens. particularly the use of stablecoins, you get the fees from uniswap as income, but are the fees substantial? and if loaning out the dai on compound for e.g. what kind of amounts of dai do you mint to make the gas costs worth it?"

I've been following the conversations around liquidation as I, too, lost everything. Nothing new to add to that conversation; the 13% liquidation confusion also caught me.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*My issue is with the increase in minimum to $5000 DAI\*\*

I understood the risk that somehow all of my collateral could be lost in a freak event, but I had my risk managed at a level I was comfortable with. Then one day I have to more than double my collateral at risk to meet the new $5k criteria, or I can't transfer or manage my own available ETH or DAI. I do not find this acceptable as now I have lost more than I desired to risk.

&amp;#x200B;

What can be done to compensate?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for everyone's support.

For the past year the story has been USDC, BUSD, and DAI taking market share from USDT, but of course all four are growing at incredible rates.

DAI grew spectacularly in 2020 with the DeFi summer. This year DAI market cap has still grown incredibly quickly, but it hasn't kept up with USDC or BUSD. Furthermore, the rate of growth has dropped every month this year. In fact this last week during the crypto market ""dip"" the supply of DAI dropped, while other stablecoins continued to grow.

The following chart shows supply growth for each month in 2021.

DAI only has about 5% of the total stablecoin market cap, so it's important for it to keep up to stay relevant. Does anyone have thoughts on DAI's future growth? Maybe Ethereum upgrades and reduced gas fees will be the catalyst for more DAI creation relative to its more centralized counterparts?"

say I purchase some eth for 10$, the price of ETH rises so that it now has a value of 20$, I take out a loan in DAI for 13$, ETH drops to the original value of purchase, 10$. I understand that while this can be interpreted as me having sold my ETH for 13$ when it was valued at 20$, but I'm not sure how the DAI I now have is worth 13$, as after liquidiation there are no more assets backing it.

What I am guessing is that colatteral is bought in DAI, which is consequently burned to offset the original minting.

Is this correct?"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock"
