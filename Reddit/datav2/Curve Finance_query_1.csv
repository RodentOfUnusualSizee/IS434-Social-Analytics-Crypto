IWTL how to enjoy an inspiring hobby rather than sinking time into Xbox,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ko5n9m/iwtl_how_to_enjoy_an_inspiring_hobby_rather_than/,annonyka,1,2021-01-01 13:19:09,34,/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ko5n9m/iwtl_how_to_enjoy_an_inspiring_hobby_rather_than/,Misc,"My problem is not exactly that I play too many video games, it’s that I don’t have any other ‘relaxing’ hobbies. I have a lot going on in life (uni, work, volunteering, relationship etc.) and sometimes I just want to switch my brain off. This is where Xbox comes in because I can mindlessly shoot things whilst still feeling like I’m making progress and being social.

The issue is that video games more than often put me in a bad mood. Either I lose terribly and just feel shit, or I play for long stretches of time and feel very apathetic afterwards. It’s stopping me from feeling inspired, productive and energetic for the rest of the day. 

I have learned how to do a few things such as skating, drawing, journaling etc. but I never actually FEEL like doing them. They are more something to check off a list and say ‘yes I improved this today’ but I don’t actually crave them the way I do video games.

I recently achieved that feeling when I decided to learn about finance. I felt productive but also always wanted to keep learning more. It was a brief period where I felt amazing. But once I finally invested I really had nowhere to go with it so I just went back to video games. 

Im envious of my sister who loooves guitar. She sinks tonnes of time into it just to wind down (what I do with video games) but for me guitar was kind of frustrating. My boyfriend is really into gardening but for me that’s also more of a chore. 

In general I find that the learning curve of things will turn them more into a project rather than a hobby or I will simply not crave the thing I want to want to do. 

But yeah TLDR: I want to find a hobby that is de-stressing and that I crave to do. Video games do this but leave me feeling crappy afterwards so I want something more uplifting."

I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Here’s why.,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koonr3/i_think_wsb_is_sleeping_on_a_huge_opportunity_in/,WBuffettJr,1,2021-01-02 10:17:47,300,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koonr3/i_think_wsb_is_sleeping_on_a_huge_opportunity_in/,DD,"**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I’m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I’ve bought outright calls. Here is what I’m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here’s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The “super cycle” rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn’t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a “super cycle” of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I’ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Here’s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush’s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don’t read around here.    
&gt;""Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds … **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,"" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a ""stretch goal"" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is ""north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards – an eye popping figure)"" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
&gt;**""We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.""**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
It’s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
It’s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it’s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn’t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my “macro” and “risks” sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here’s a Barron’s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that’s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn’t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you’re “allowed” to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn’t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I can’t track down the things I’ve read here and there on Twitter and I’m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple’s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing I’ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that’s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that’s a big “if” for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I don’t know.  Based on the reports I’ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn’t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn’t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don’t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it’s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

I’m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late ‘21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it’s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don’t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn’t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don’t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I’m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don’t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that’s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I don’t believe in technical analysis. Charts don’t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. 

## Fun rumors    
I’m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that’s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn’t really my cup of tea, but if it’s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
I’m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn’t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent “to the moon” meme stocks) with limited float. (That’s not to say those aren’t great companies or great trades. I’m just sayin’).


## My positions: 
I’m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you’d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that’s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don’t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism    
If you think I’m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don’t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it. 

## The Most Important Factor    

This ain’t my first day around here, and I know that DD is absolutely useless without rocketships, therefore: APPLE TO THE 🌙  🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

by [**Patrick M. Wood**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking02a.htm)  
**formerly titled 'For Sale: The United States of America'**

**from** [**AugustReview**](http://www.augustreview.com/) **Website**  
 

How well has America fared in the last 25 years?

As a country, are we financially healthier or are we on the verge of a melt-down?  
These issues are explored, along with some concrete examples of how the ""money-laundry"" works.

The [Trilateral Commission](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_trilat.htm)'s 1973 vision of a ""New International Economic Order "" has swept the world like a hurricane.

**Introduction**

In 1978, [Trilaterals Over Washington](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_trilat07.htm) revealed the global strategy of [the Trilateral Commission](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_trilat.htm) and it's co-founders [**David Rockefeller**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_rockefeller.htm) and [**Zbigniew Brzezinski**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_brzezinski.htm). Brzezinski, in particular, provided the intellectual reasoning and political strategy for the ""New International Economic Order"".  


Brzezinski was also an astute political operator. He is credited as the first person to take interest in Jimmy Carter, to mentor him in globalism starting in 1973 when Carter was chosen to be part of the Trilateral Commission.

Upon Carter's election victory in 1976, Brzezinski was appointed National Security Advisor. By the end of 1976, Carter had appointed no less than 19 members of the Trilateral Commission to high-ranking government positions. These 19 members represented just under 20% of the entire U.S. delegation of the Trilateral Commission.  


The stage was now set for their power to become permanently embedded.

Each successive Administration has been disproportionally dominated by members of the Trilateral Commission:

&gt;George H.W. Bush  
William Jefferson Clinton  
Richard B. Cheney

Each administration filled top posts from the Trilateral Commission. Think-tanks connected to the Trilateral Commission cranked out volumes of studies that droned on and on about the New International Economic Order and the need for political change.  


Looking backward to Brzezinski, however, is necessary because he most clearly and lucidly embodied the heart and soul of the rush to globalism. He created the watershed that initiated the plundering of America and the buildup of the global corporate elite. This issue intends to quantify the extent of this plundering.  


Brzezinski was interviewed in 1974 by the Brazilian newspaper *Vega:*

&gt;""How would you define this new world order?""

Brzezinski declared,

&gt;""...the reality of our times is that a modern society such as the U.S. needs a central coordinating and renovating organ which cannot be made up of six hundred people.""

In his 1969 book *Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era*, he wrote that the,

&gt;""nation-state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.""

Indeed, members of the Trilateral Commission chosen from north America, Europe and Asia (mostly Japan), are all in agreement on this point -- the nation-state only gets in the way of so-called ""free trade"" and therefore must be closely manipulated for their own common good.

Collectively, they have taken a self-induced quantum leap above national law, into an elevated position of making their own rules as they go. We see some direct evidence of such an attitude, for instance, when President Bill Clinton had no particular legal qualms (or consequences) of giving (free or for money) top-secret missile technology to Communist China.  


The gathering of corporate elites in the Trilateral Commission started with names such as:

&gt;Coca Cola  
Ford Motor  
Deere &amp; Co.  
Hewlett-Packard  
Cargill  
Chase Manhattan Bank  
Cummins Engine  
Texas Instruments  
Honeywell  
Bechtel Corporation  
Weyerhauser  
General Motors  
Boeing  
and many others....

Today, we see the same kind of makeup:

&gt;Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)  
J.P. Morgan-Chase  
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.  
Pitney Bowes  
GE  
Citigroup  
American International Group (AIF)  
Bank of America  
Xerox  
Halliburton,

...just to name a few.  


To summarize then, the real *plundering of America* *started with the founding of the Trilateral Commission in 1973* and the consolidation of power in 1976 with the dominance of the *Carter Administration.*

When one begins to see the pattern emerging, many unanswered questions start to clear up. Why does President George Bush so pointedly want to eliminate the U.S./Mexican border? Why the stampede to outsource American jobs, even to the hurt of our own citizens? Why do people around the world intuitively hate the *World Trade Organization*, *NAFTA* and *CAFTA?* (The last question suggests that the U.S. is not the only nation-state being plundered these days.)

Nations are financially disintegrating while global corporations grow fantastically richer.  


One might protest that the scope of this operation is just too fantastic and huge to be real. This writer would remind the skeptic that U.S. history is littered with monopolistic tycoons who tried to get a lever on the societies they lived in. Monopolies are blind to politics, except when politics can be manipulated to establish or extend the Monopoly.

The vast majority of Americans are left completely in the dark because American mainstream media, collectively slanted toward globalism, has been dominated by the very same globalists who founded the Trilateral Commission in the first place:

The reader is encouraged to read [Trilaterals Over Washington](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_trilat07.htm), Volumes I and II, to get a deeper sense of background on these issues.

**The State of the Nation**

This issue attempts to give the reader a background and perspective on the state of affairs of American business.  


There are three factors to consider.

&gt;First, there is the government itself.  
Second, there is private industry. Although they are very different types of entities, they both can adequately be described in terms of flows of income.  
Third, we will look at the transfer of ownership of U.S. based corporations to foreign ownership.

In the case of the government, there has been virtually no restraint on keeping its spending within its income. Whenever it spent outside of income-in-hand, borrowing whatever extra was needed was all too easy.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/m17b0x23k2961.gif

 You can quickly see what the last 37 years look like from the chart above. Prior to 1975, budget deficits were very small. The upward trend started in earnest in 1975. A brief surplus was recorded between 1998 and 2001.  


Presiding presidents are purposefully not mentioned because they are irrelevant to the big picture.  


It should also stand out that there are three troughs: the first ""peaked"" in 1986, the second in 1992 and the third in 2005. The extremity cycle is approximately 6 years long. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5vr8zza6k2961.gif

 

The cumulative effect of these deficits on the U.S. national debt is quite dramatic. In 1970, the debt was well under the $1 trillion level. Today, it stands over $8 trillion, a 10-fold increase.  


To put this in personal terms, every man, woman and child in America owes $28,500 each. A family of 4 collectively owes $114,000. You might say, ""But, that's the government debt, not mine!"" The fact is though, *we are the government*. Except that taxpayers pay taxes, the federal government would have no source of income whatever.

So, let's take a look at the business economy now.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/n0b7tfgbk2961.gif

 

A trade deficit occurs when we import more than we export. A surplus occurs when the reverse is true. Whether positive or negative, the figure is called the ""current account"".  


Since 1981, America has been in the red every single year. The curve is similar in nature to the National Debt curve: very low deficits in the 70's and early 80's, then rising dramatically during the 90's into the current decade.  


In the chart to the right, you can see that the gap between imports (orange line) and exports (purple line) is widening at an increasing rate every year. The bottom curve shows the negative balance on the current account as it accumulates more and more red ink. Currently, the annualized rate of the current trade deficit is easily $600 billion.  


By contrast, there were only two years in the decade of the 1970's that had small trade deficits.  


In March, the *Business Telegraph* in London reported that the March (2005) deficit of $55 billion was well below the $60 billion that was expected by the markets.

&gt;""It's a relief,"" said James Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan Chase in New York. ""It does dampen the fears that there was something bad going on in the US economy.""

The psychology at play here is amazing. The fact that the trade deficit for a single month is $55 billion instead of $60 billion is a cause for reassurance that nothing bad is happening to the U.S. economy? On the other hand, note that Glassman is senior economist at JP Morgan Chase bank which has been at the very core of the New International Economic Order from the beginning.  


The third area to look at is transfer of ownership. Corporate mergers are everywhere. It's so confusing that most people don't have a clue who owns what anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

[Outlays for New Investment in the United States by Foreign Direct Investors, 1980-2003 \(Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis\)](https://i.redd.it/e6a93wpik2961.gif)

 

During the 1960's, American business increased its ownership in the U.S. every year except one. During the 1970's, there were only 5 years that we increased our position. Since 1982, there has not been one single year where foreign investment did not outstrip our own... and dramatically so, to the tune of $3.8 trillion.

You ask, ""How can this happen?"" Simple.  


Mergers.

Consider a few mergers from recent history - do you recognize any of these ""American"" names?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgx50vfnk2961.png?width=966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ef144a10e0a7c95508641cbe4d9248fa781d65a

 

These few examples are listed only to give you a flavor of the depth of penetration of foreign purchases into the core of American industry. In order to get to an aggregate of $3.8 trillion, you can hardly imagine how many billion dollar deals there have been over 20 years. In short, America is literally being sold out from under us.  


Let's summarize this now. In the past 35 years, the U.S. government has racked up over $8 trillion in debt. The current trade deficit for 2005 alone will likely exceed $600 billion (importing more than we export). The $3.8 trillion of showcase American companies have been sold to foreigners.  


Is something wrong with this picture?  


When this writer began to do research for *Trilaterals Over Washington* in the late 1970's, we focused on the *Trilateral Commission* because it was very apparent that it was laying the groundwork for -- in their own words -- a ""New International Economic Order"" The concept of the nation-state was outdated and we were moving into an era of ""interdependence.""  


David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski *founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973*. It has been composed of slightly over 300 members chosen from North America, Europe and Asia (primarily Japan). The members are literally the Who's Who of global elitists: top politicians, think-tank philosophers, industrialists and bankers.  


We clearly documented in *Trilaterals Over Washington* that the move toward global economic consolidation was well on its way. Twenty-five years later, we are standing under an avalanche of economic deterioration.  


During these 25 years, America has literally ""LOST its shirt"". We are technically quite bankrupt.  


Corporate profits during this same time, however, have seen huge and consistent profits. Those global-minded companies in particular (e.g., corporate board members who belong to the Trilateral Commission) have profited even more.  


According to the BEA, aggregate corporate profits totaled $874 billion in 2002, $1.02 trillion in 2003 and $1.2 trillion in 2004. Exxon increased its annual earnings from $21.5 billion in 2003 to $25.33 billion in 2004. This was not uncommon.  


Is it possible that the U.S. can be stripped to the bone while multinational corporations get rich? Was it planned this way from the beginning (circa 1973)? Yes, and yes.  


There is another aspect of national bankruptcy that needs to be mentioned, namely, the landslide loss of technological genius that made America great in the first place.

Putting aside the legal and illegal transfers of technology to China during the Clinton administration, consider the case of IBM:

&gt;*Lenovo*, China's largest PC company, has completed a $1.25 billion acquisition of IBM's Personal Computing Division (PCD). *Lenovo*, which already has a third of the Chinese PC market and shares in enterprise PC markets around the world, says this deal makes it a new international IT competitor and the world's third-largest personal computing company.  
   
The PCD acquisition, first announced in December, means, according to newly named *Lenovo CEO* Stephen Ward, that the company will have combined annual PC revenue of about $13 billion and volume of about 14 million units. Ward says *Lenovo* expects immediate synergies through complementary customer bases, product offerings and geographic coverage, among other things.  
**(SA Computer Magazine, 5-3-2005)**

That is, the very company that invented the PC and literally revolutionized the world has now sold 100% of their Personal Computing Division to a Communist nation who have sworn many times that they will bury us. Chinese engineers will soon be moving into IBM's Armonk, NY headquarters to take over.  


Another example is that Steven Chen, a Taiwanese-born American citizen and one of America's most brilliant and top supercomputer designers, quit his post with *Silicon Graphics* and is moving to mainland China. He is choosing to build his next generation supercomputer in China  


According to IDC, the premier intelligence resource and forecaster in the computer world,

&gt;Attracting a leading supercomputer designer like Chen is good news for the growing Chinese computer industry. China has recently been primarily focusing its high-performance technical computer designs on commodity component clusters. In general, clusters provide very attractive price-performance but lack some of the high-end capabilities provided by traditional supercomputers. Chen plans to bridge the gap by building high-performance blade-based clusters in China and offering them for sale around the world.

If America's technology prowess is a national treasure, then people like Steven Chen are national treasures also. How is it that we cannot offer enough enticement to keep such a talent in the United States?

In an age where sports figures can command million of dollars per season for pure entertainment, this seems rather odd. It's not just that Chen isn't helping the U.S. but that he is helping a Communist government develop technology that can be used against us - commercially and militarily.  
 

**Example of a ""Blind Eye""**

The *New York Times* carried an article on May 17, 2005, ""[Bush's Choice: Anger China or Congress Over Currency](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E4D61F30F934A25756C0A9639C8B63).""

China bought more than $200 billion in Treasuries last year, bringing their total ownership of U.S. debt to a whopping $650 billion. These purchases essentially finance a comparable trade deficit with China. Because China's currency, *the yuan*, is pegged to the U.S. dollar, China is in a position to manipulate the system (undervaluing its currency) and gain a whopping trade advantage over America.  


U.S. Businesses have filed volumes of complaints with the U.S. Trade Representative, Rob Portman, about issues ranging from China's dumping of products at prices below cost of manufacturing, to widespread copyright and patent violations. Congress is somewhat sensitive to this issue and, bucking the president, is pushing for tariffs and quotas against China to punish them for milking the system.  


Bush must now be critical of China (and infuriate China) or give China a clean bill of health and say that everything is fine (and infuriate Congress and the American people).  


So, what do you do when you've invited an 800 pound gorilla into your living room? You pray he doesn't get mad when you ask him to leave.  


Treasury Secretary John Snow is on the spot. In the past, he has refused to criticize China openly, but rather seeks to rely on ""financial diplomacy"" instead. He believes that China can be persuaded that flexible exchange rates ought to be in its own interest.  


Mr. Snow, in an interview on Monday with CNBC, reiterated his optimism that China would change policy on its own.

&gt;""I'm convinced they will move,"" Mr. Snow said. ""Now is the time. We're anxious to see them move. It's time.""

What evidence does Snow have that China will voluntarily pull back from an opportunity to plunder the U.S.? His wishful thinking that they might compliantly respond to our being ""anxious"" to see them move?  


It is easier to understand the conflict of interest if you look back a few years at John Snow's career.

From 1994-1996, Snow was chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of 250 chief executive officers of the largest corporations, representing over $3.7 trillion in combined revenues. During that time, he was a key player in supporting the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  


He recently received the Marco Polo Award (2001), awarded by the U.S.-China Foundation for International Exchanges as the highest honor that can be given to a foreign business leader. He is a director of CarMax, U.S. Steel, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Verizon Communications, sits on the boards of Johns Hopkins University, is chairman of the Kennedy Center Corporate Fund Board, and is a member of the Business Council and Business Roundtable.  


In short, Snow has been at the corporate center of promoting globalism and in particular, building China's trade for many years. As Treasury Secretary, he is in an influential position of trust to protect the American people from economic harm. But, will he?  


To understand more completely, ask yourself this question. Who invested money in, and built up, this 800 pound gorilla?  


Take Bechtel for instance, one of the largest construction and engineering companies in the world.

In 1994, Bechtel was the first U.S. company to receive a construction license in China. It has completed 80 major projects in China and has permanent offices located in Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong. Its latest project is a $4.3 billion petrochemical complex in Daya Bay that will produce 2.3 million tons of products annually. It's being touted as one of the largest Sino-foreign investments to date, and is 50% owned by a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell.  


If we say, ""China is really profiting from the U.S."", to whom are we really referring? It's true that the Chinese government is getting an advantage from the increase in economic activity, but who are the front-line collectors of revenue and aggregators of profit in China?

That's right, it's the same multinational corporations.  


So, as noted above, when John Snow reiterates his optimism that China will change policy on its own, you can see just how selective his vision is. As long as China's policy remains as it is, America gets plundered and the global corporations in China rack up record profits.  


This issue contends that *America is For Sale*.

The sale is ""under the table"" in that the American people don't have a clue that it's being slowly sold out from under their feet, one piece at a time. The sale is deceptive because as the red ink grows larger and larger, we are told by these same globalists that trade and budget deficits don't really matter that much. The sale is dishonest because it was planned from the beginning by elitist groups like [the Trilateral Commission](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_trilat.htm), to twist and manipulate the system to their own benefit.  


The fact that America's downward financial spiral started in earnest shortly after the Trilateral Commission was founded by **David Rockefeller** and **Zbigniew Brzezinski**, is not incidental.

The very policies that brought us the ""New International Economic Order"" (their own phrase) have wrecked our country. This is not an anecdotal observation, as will be demonstrated over and over in future issues of *The August Review*.  


America is in a very grievous and trepid situation.

Any number of isolated incidents could touch off a financial firestorm that burns our house to the ground. When a company goes bankrupt, it is seldom advertised in advance. Its customers, shareholders and debtors are invariably in a state of shock when the bankruptcy occurs, even though hind site shows that there were ample evidences of impending bankruptcy. So it is with America: There is evidence everywhere of what is happening to us, but there are few eyes to see it nor ears to hear it.  


In 30-40 short years, America has gone from the strongest and most stable nation in the world, to one of the weakest and unstable.

Poor Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall and had a great fall, but few people will see the real truth that Humpty was actually pushed!"

The case for $200 UNI - A short thesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/kqtoi2/the_case_for_200_uni_a_short_thesis/,sexydefi,1,2021-01-05 15:58:20,3,/r/ethtrader/comments/kqtoi2/the_case_for_200_uni_a_short_thesis/,Discussion,"UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, which is the most used decentralized exchange ever and likely will be. And it is going to $200 in the coming alt-season, in my humble opinion.

Uniswap's daily volume yesterday crossed $1 billion, not for the first time but it looks like it will sustain at such levels in coming days, weeks and months as ETH has crossed $1000 without much hype and with much criticism. Liquidity is over $2.7 billion, even when there are no incentives.

Institutional liquidity is flowing into Bitcoin and it will soon flow into Eth too. Eth will get it’s CME futures, the OCC has given banks a go ahead for launching stablecoins on public blockchains and Ethereum has the ecosystem and toolset ready for everything that is about to come. After Bitcoin &amp; Eth, DeFi governance tokens will be tokens people would want to hodl. And in that, the top ones. And when the HNIs &amp; institutions (non crypto-native ones) start looking into DeFi, the first thing they’d come to know about is the likes of UNI, Comp, etc., the products which are not much difficult to understand and have good reputation and are decentralized. By the time this happens, Uniswap will also likely be on Optimism with the cash-flow switch turned on. With the interest rates close to zero and negative, P/E ratios can virtually be infinite. That’s another point to add to the value proposition. And don’t forget Uniswap v3.

Besides this, Uniswap is deeply integrated into the DeFi ecosystem and all the projects. MakerDAO now accepts Uniswap LP tokens for minting Dai. And also, think about this as betting on the Uniswap team. We know what the team is capable of and we know they’re highly competent and innovation won’t stop at v3. 

At $200, Uniswap's fully diluted valuation will be $200 billion. So, really, am I being stupid here? Nope. $200 UNI will happen when BTC is above $100k, ETH is over $10k. When we're back to a Jan 2018 type of scenario. I'm not saying that it's an 'if', but a 'when'. Cardano, for context was trading at a fully diluted value of $40 billion in last cycle's alt-season, without any product or users, pure hype.

And of course, $200 won’t be sustainable for the next couple of years at least, but we are early. Even crypto people from 2017 don’t want to hold crypto tokens for a few months. They just want to flip and most end up burning their ETH &amp; BTC. Just by buying now and holding patiently would be rewarding imo.

UNI is between $5 and $5.50 now and I’m putting this out here that UNI is going to $200 in the coming alt-season.

The ""major"" competitor to Uniswap is Sushiswap, but at the end of the day, Sushiswap is just a fork project. They can add new features, refresh their front-end and blah blah but it is what it is- a fork. Sushiswap has volume and liquidity right now only because of its ongoing liquidity incentives. And Uniswap doesn't have it going right now. Look at what happened to Swerve (the Curve fork)- I think that is what will ultimately happen to Sushiswap. Sure, Sushiswap is now a part of Yearn Finance but you don't see new projects providing liquidity for their projects on Sushiswap, you don't see projects celebrating Sushiswap listings. Uniswap is the king in the DEX space.

Balancer and other such tweaked and more innovative AMMs are good but the volume and liquidity on Uniswap speaks for itself.

The high gas fees problem- retail can't use it. Uniswap has shown us already that it can work well on Optimistic Rollups. And Optimism is starting their launch this month. In a few months, this won't be a problem and so we don't have to worry about AMM volumes being drained away to other blockchains.

So what I'm saying is, SEND IT!!!

And above all, do your own research. This is not financial advice. Don’t buy UNI just because I said so. Think for yourself. I'm not responsible for your losses or profits.

I would love to hear what you all think about this :)"

Welcome to 2021, QDAO DeFi lovers! We’re happy to see you all in a good mood and in good health. The New Year holidays have just ended but we are ready to share some interesting updates! Jump in! 

## Cryptocurrencies and DeFi coin market analysis

The crypto market is in a zero-gravity zone now. We saw a massive rise to $34,500 for Bitcoin and $1,150 for Ethereum, followed right after by a colossal drop for Bitcoin to $29,000. At the time of writing, the BTC price was holding above the $31,000 mark but the smell of correction is felt in the air.

The DeFi market is performing well these days. The total value locked in DeFi sees its highest point at $17.8 billion. Tokens have begun to grow too. Here are the changes in price for some of the popular DeFi coins:

* ChainLink: +16.58%
* Aave: +41.71%
* yearn.finance: +4.56%
* Compound: +14.73%

The situation in the market can be called “grab and pray”. Altcoin began to boom right after Bitcoin but the main cryptocurrency seems to be preparing for the correction.

## DeFi news 

There is a lot of news about DeFi. Here are the most important events of the week:

* ETH price finally overcame the $1,000 mark. Of course, BTC helped it to surpass the long-awaited height but we see how Ethereum 2.0 is already bringing positive results for the network.
* Cover Protocol lost 97% of its price. Just before the New Year, a suspected hacker exploited the Cover staking protocol, inflating the token supply by printing over 40 quintillion ""coins"". He managed to drain out over $5 million. The token price dropped almost to zero but the project management team came back with a compensation plan.
* The times of high ETH fees are back. Recently, fees in the Ethereum network grew to the August levels, when DeFi projects were booming hard. Aavegotchi even had to postpone their NFT game launch. Now, fees remain inflated.

AMA: Low GPA / No Job -&gt; Accenture -&gt; Boutique -&gt; M7 MBA -&gt; MBB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/ks0bus/ama_low_gpa_no_job_accenture_boutique_m7_mba_mbb/,TakingIt1StepAtATime,4,2021-01-07 07:41:35,107,/r/MBA/comments/ks0bus/ama_low_gpa_no_job_accenture_boutique_m7_mba_mbb/,AMA,"Here's my story:

I grew up in a poor immigrant family in a poor neighborhood.  My parents came here from Asia without speaking a word of English.  They came here to give me a better chance for success in life. 

 They prized education above all else - growing up, they never took me to the movies, but I could get any book I wanted.  Their dedication to education got me all the way into a top 10 university.

That's also where I promptly ran into a brick wall.  I was a fish out of water - I had trouble connecting with my new classmates, I had to work to support myself, and honestly just got too distracted by the freedom I had never had before.  I played too much video games, I spent too much time chasing girls.  For most of college I felt like I was failing everything - it was just too much and I wasn't ready.  I floated for most of college at a 2.X GPA, and had to use extra semesters to graduate with almost exactly a 3.0 GPA.  I wasn't really involved in extracurriculars - didn't even really know about the professional clubs that were on campus.  I had crappy internships - sophomore year, I ended up working IT support in a company in Asia, but only thanks to a relative.  Junior year, I did a little better, ending up as a management intern at a small retail chain in the US.  I did not have a job lined up by the time I graduated.

I moved back into my parents' place after graduation.  While my friends were starting their new finance, consulting, marketing jobs, I was playing video games really not sure what had went wrong.  At some point, I just got tired of living at home grinding my life away on World of Warcraft.  I ended up applying to everything that looked even remotely appealing.  Places I've never heard of ever again.  I sent out dozens on dozens of applications - most never replied, I bombed a couple, and then I got lucky.

I know Accenture gets made fun of on Reddit a lot, but I'll be forever grateful to the interviewers that saw something in me.  One of the MDs (RIP) even asked me if I had a story for why my GPA was so low, which gave me a chance to share more about myself.  At the end, they said they didn't have any openings in the offices I was interested in, but could potentially find me a spot somewhere else.  Right before the New Year, I moved across the country - farthest I'd ever been in the US - with two suitcases, ready to try something new.

I did fine at Accenture.  The analytical work and thinking work came pretty easy.  The people side was a real work I progress.  Asides my three month internship, this was really the first time I was interacting with busness people.   So it was a real learning curve.  I was a really good Analyst - got promoted to the post-MBA position really quickly.  But it was too early (for me).  I didn't do a good job handling the new level of responsibilities.  I wasn't great with clients.  I was getting pigeonholed into being a modeling guy.  I took on some really hard projects and felt like my managers didn't understand what the hell they were doing (they really didn't).  The last straw was after a tough year, they docked my performance rating a whole grade because I missed 2 or 3 time sheets.  I started looking at MBA as a way out and perhaps try to get to a better place.

After studying my butt off, I got a 760 GMAT - high off of that, I applied to all the top schools.  I probably spent an okay amount of time on all the apps, but maybe I was stretched too thinly.  Still I was hopeful.  I had the GMAT, I had a good career trajectory, I had good LoRs, I thought I had good essays.  I was devastated when rejection letter after rejection letter rolled in.

Ultimately I couldn't bear working at Accenture anymore for all the reasons above - when a boutique consultancy in my hometown asked me to jump on board for a sizeable pay raise, I did it.   I left on pretty bitter terms - my career counselor said some pretty unnecessary shit to me on the way out, but it certainly made my decision to leave easier.  Took a long vacation with some buddies and moved back to start something new.

That next cycle, I applied to MBA again - and was fully rejected again.  I had lowered my hopes even as I was applying - my title hadn't really changed and I was at a no-name place, but I thought that perhaps some of the schools would reward my persistence.  So, I couldn't help but be disappointed in myself again.  Luckily those feelings was cut a bit as it just so happened that I started off a deep, new relationship around this time.  It let the girl and I spend much more time together.  Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise - if I had to move for MBA, the relationship may not have lasted.  Who knows?  We're married now.

The third year I tried applying to MBA, I had just been promoted to a manager position, but I knew that this was probably going to be my personal last shot at MBA.  I just couldn't imagine another year devoting the time to this dog and pony show of a process.  So to try to ""seal the deal"" on this last go, I also hired a MBA consultant.  He was definitely helpful - he opened my eyes to what MBA adcoms were looking for.  He helped me restructure my essays to tell a better and clearer story.  

And it worked.  I finally got into an M7.  I ended up struggling a bit with the decision as deadlines were nearing - I had to ask myself - did I still really want to go or was this just some kind of unfinished business?  I was comfortable, making good money, and my new firm liked me.  But ultimately I decided the chance to recruit for a top company would open up new doors, and that I wanted to see what that life was like.

""Redemption MBA"" - I only heard this after I had already graduated, on this subreddit.  But that's exactly what my two years at the M7 were.  I ended up graduating near top of the class.  I was heavily involved in clubs and in leadership positions.  I could finally afford to do things like vacation and other events that I couldn't afford as an undergrad.  I ended up getting recruiting for tech and consulting and got opportunities in both.  But after having done consulting at Accenture and then a boutique, I just couldn't turn down MBB.  I wanted to turn it down for work/life balance - but I just wanted to know for myself - was I missing out on something from a top firm?

Twelve years since I graduated from undergrad with an unclear future, I'm now an Associate Partner / Principal at MBB.  Things are pretty good all considered.

"FLS: 2021. 7 January, Finance",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy/comments/kse2p6/fls_2021_7_january_finance/,janetheautomaton,1,2021-01-07 22:15:09,13,/r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy/comments/kse2p6/fls_2021_7_january_finance/,NaN,"Let's talk about money.

I'd like to start by listing a few resources:

r/investing and sundry other subs, but take them with a fistful of salt.

[The Intelligent Investor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106835.The_Intelligent_Investor).

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)'s lessons on finance, particularly [Personal Finance](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance) under Life Skills and [Finance and Capital Markets](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance) under Economics. Great starting point if you're a beginner.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for various finance courses from different universities

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/), which also has an investments simulator!

I am not a financial expert. I am, in fact, just getting started myself in a lot of ways. (Oy, to have bought Tesla last March! I wept tears of blood.) So I'd like to lay out some basic steps and then open the floor.

1. Budget. However much money you make, it's always good to have a budget. Two of the most common budgeting apps/programs I see are [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) and [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/). Tracking your financials and earning, spending, and saving responsibly are HV behaviors.

2. Earn. Careers will be a whole other post, so I'll be brief here. Value your work and expect to be compensated for it accordingly. Keep an eye on the market rate for your job and skill set, as well as on how much your peers are making. Multiple streams of income are ideal, and I think the most common streams are something like: pay/salary, investments, real estate, side hustle.

3. Save. In my opinion, there are three parts to this.

* Emergency Fund. Conventional wisdom says there should be six months worth of expenses in this fund. Like if you quit/get fired unexpectedly tomorrow, you should be able to live relatively comfortably for at least six months. I personally think a year would be safer, but then people start coming at me about my money just sitting there not doing anything.
* Fuck Off Fund. You should always have enough money to be able to immediately bail out of a bad situation. Bullying/Sexual harassment at work? Report it, quit, or both, you can afford it. Living with a man who waits until the lease is signed to show his ass? Move out into a new place even if you have to break a lease, because you can afford it. Stranded somewhere? Call that $200 Uber/buy that last-minute flight, you can afford it.
* Retirement. You should always have a retirement fund going. Whether that's through work with matching or on your own with a Roth IRA, you should always be putting some money in it at least every month. Let that compounding interest work for you.

4. Investments. 

(1) Have a retirement fund, per above.

(2) If you're new to investments, it's okay to ease into it. Research and choose a brokerage according to your needs. (Example: Really hands on and not afraid of a steep learning curve? Ameritrade. (Robinhood if you're slumming.) Want to make some choices and just leave it while you learn? Charles Schwab.) Read the fine print for what fees you will have to pay.

(3) Don't be afraid to buy certificates or to look into high yield savings accounts. For example, if you bank with Navy Federal, they have an EasyStart certificate with a 3.5% APY, though the maximum you can deposit is $3000 and it's only for one year. If you're a beginner, this can be an easy and very safe way to dip your toe in.

(4) Stocks. This is a whole other post, and I don't know if I'm knowledgeable enough to really get into it. Anyone?

5. YOUR FINANCES ARE YOURS. Oh my God, if I read one more story about a woman who has, advertently or inadvertently, comingled her finances with a partner she's not married to and/or somehow made herself dependent on them. No judgement, because I've done that too, but GIRL, NO.

* If you're married to them, that's one thing. But if you are not, DO NOT make a partner your primary income, your insurance, your means of transportation, or your landlord. Even if you are, you MUST have financial resources of your own, whether that's a savings account just for you or an emergency fund or whatever. And your name MUST also be on things like leases, deeds, and titles. But not debt. Do not put your name on debt that is not yours, though if you're married and the debt is incurred during the marriage... (IANAL.)
* If you're with a partner long enough (and don't want to get married, valid choice), then your finances will naturally intertwine. Usually. But *do not* make yourself financially dependent on them.
* This is verging on FDS territory, but! Watch how a partner deals with finances, both their own and yours. A HVW neither allows herself to be taken advantage of nor takes advantage of others. You can love someone with no money just like you can love someone with lots of money, but you are no one's sugary metaphor.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's what I want to do in 2021.

* Savings. I'm actually well ahead of myself here because I've been saving aggressively for years, but now I have a big chunk of cash that's not doing anything. I want to do something with it, leading me to:
* Investments. For the sake of my neuroses, I've eased into this with certificates and a mostly hands-off portfolio, and now I'm trying to get into trading. This is hella stressing me out. I'm seriously considering just hiring a financial advisor.
* Retirement. Shit, I forgot to adjust my percentages.
* Philanthropy. I donated off and on last year, but this year I want to do it regularly. I should probably make a budget or something.

&amp;#x200B;

LADIES, what canny decisions are you making this year?"
Why I'm shorting the market via going Long VIX Calls and /VX Futures.,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ksp4ll/why_im_shorting_the_market_via_going_long_vix/,duke_of_yachtsville,5,2021-01-08 06:58:47,39,/r/investing/comments/ksp4ll/why_im_shorting_the_market_via_going_long_vix/,NaN,"I want to take the r/investing community on this journey with me.

I've learned a lot from this community regarding economics, valuations, corporate finance and bottom up style investing.

I've been watching the market trade over the last several months and tracking the spreads between volatility futures.

I believe that the risk/reward between Implied and Historical Volatility is priced incorrectly and that the possibility of a move that exceeds 2 Standard Deviations is a high probability within the next 2-3 months.

I own many of the momentum growth stocks that reddit communities seem to love. I think these companies have potential for long term growth over the next 20-30 years.

I also believe that the valuations of these companies have reached such levels that there is no reasonable justification for their share price at the current moment based on fundamental or economic metrics.

I think that a decade of QE and ZIRP has distorted the financial markets to such a point where there is no greater fool.

I've tracked the retail option flow in FAANG and momentum stocks and retail tech weekly call buying has reached levels never seen before.

Option market markers at big quant firms (Citadel and Two-Sigma mainly) have actually had to push growth stock prices higher to cover their short delta positions from a gamma squeeze.

The VIX futures curve could have an explosive move if we were to see 25-30% move in implied volatility.

The curve would shift from contango to backwardation in a large move that could blow up the Short Volatility trade that has been so profitable of the last 10 years. (RIP SVXY Holders)

If I'm wrong and the economic expansion continues I will feel comfortable with what I'm willing to lose on this trade.

I have started a position as of today and will look to add to the full clip size I'm willing to risk on this position.

God Speed.

* **WARNING**: this post is long. By necessity, one has to flesh out linear chains of reasoning in long form. I'll give you the one-paragraph **TLDR** at the end. No rockets.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a series of **linear** chain of reasoning with known facts that lead to an outcome that is guaranteed but not priced in. The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. 
2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the ""high"" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. 
   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)
   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** 
3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. 
4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. 
5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. 
6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. 
7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.**

&amp;#x200B;

**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe ""local"" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**

[This won't be surprising. The Chinese do big infrastructure, and half the Party back in the 90s were hydrologic engineers. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ycsi1d5i0a61.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fafd25e782fbd27964d1b1f958e80ea46fc855d6)

In addition to these maps, look at the [**global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. 

&amp;#x200B;

* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --&gt; population center is still needed. 
* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as ""the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere"". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. 
   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. 
* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)

* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--&gt; heightened demand --&gt; green is cheap --&gt; it needs to be hooked in --&gt; regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. 

# Conclusion

I do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. 

\------------------

TL/DR:

**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.** 

Sorry no rockets. Also, there aren't options available, so you'll have to slow boat this."

Hey folks. In 2020 crash I had a lot of cognitive dissonance and I have changed my mind quite a bit regarding high growth stocks. Shedding value investor skin was painful, but I learned quite a bit. I would argue I understand tech high- growth stocks' business models way better now.

I never did DCFs. From engineering background I knew errors compound and DCF's take a lot of assumptions.

Revert to mean financial ratios was my main quantitative tool before, which got me into some value traps before.

This is my first post in this subreddit, and I would like to share my low-profile website blogpost on the topic:

[Value Investor’s “Expensive” Fallacy](http://www.generalistlab.com/insights/finance/value-investors-expensive-fallacy/)

Topics covered:

* Market structure and flows between asset classes and regions according to their reward/risk profile;
* Already made remarks on 2020 mindfuck from value investing and economy stance;
* Assertions about current state of market (liquidity, innovation, regulators, concentration, effectiveness, central banks' policy)
* business cycle S curve and targeting for max growth (revenue as well as portfolio return wise)
* Amazon as ""value stock"" from Bezos letters example
* high growth companies playbook
* SaaS Twilio example breakdown. Why it's such a beast, where are the hidden profits?
* Portfolio structure: impact of growth vs ROIC on long term portfolio returns
* tech stocks industry context;
* What the hell is TAM
* Stock based compensation
* Why and how financial ratios break down on high-growth stocks
* Shortfalls of DCF's.
* Why I think markets are getting increasingly efffective.
* Real Options to complement DCF's.
* Secular trends outside help in investing. What are they?

Hope my 2020 learnings will be of value to you. Have a better and more open 2021!"
My uncle found a podcast on our school website and it’s got me paranoid. I don’t think I’m safe.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ku0woi/my_uncle_found_a_podcast_on_our_school_website/,Yoel_Dei_Umbra,1,2021-01-10 06:23:23,6,/r/nosleep/comments/ku0woi/my_uncle_found_a_podcast_on_our_school_website/,Series,"*“The downfall of man is the arrogance that we are all above the many forms of evil, simply by ideal alone.”*

My lungs burn, and I had only been running for a good 2 minutes. I really need to stop skipping Sunday-gym. No time to think. Don and Rob were on my tail, running through campus. A car bumps my side. Damn thing really struck me. I slide over the hood like a spy agent. Though, it probably wasn’t nearly as smooth as I imagine it in my head.

*“This is not what you think it is. If anyone is listening, you’re in the jaws.”*

I make it inside the building, I curve at the front desk. The lady behind it yells at me to slow my roll, but I ignore. Class 126 of side B in Jimena Hall. Almost there. I bust my ankle ignoring a “wet floor” post which caused me to slip and slide as if I were running on Nickelodeon slime.

*“If you’ve come for dreams, I wholeheartedly apologize. First victim was before even the very first semester. That girl…they couldn’t even wait.”*

I busted through the classroom door. The horns shriek, a baritone rips in an upper octave, a guitarist plucked a string. 

“Hey, what the fuck is this about? What are you doing? Out,” The instructor yelled.

We ignore. There’s another door to the far-left corner. We get in and it’s this storage room for instruments. We’re probably breaking shit as we drop cases in our frantic search for what ‘the man’ told us. There’s a sink with a cabinet under. We open it. 

*“Under sink, right corner. The small keys will be there. I leave those keys every morning between the hours of 11:00am and 12:00pm.”*

It’s not there. I’m searching but it’s not there.

“Well, is it there, bro?” Don said. 

“I doubt it. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, it’s not there isn’t it? I told you, little man. This is crazy,” Rob said.

The instructor was tomato faced. “Is there something you’re looking for, Mr. Henderson?”

“No, we’re just leaving. I’m so sorry, Mr. Kay. This is embarrassing behavior,” Rob pleaded.

“Just get this fucking lunatic out of my class or I’m calling it in.”

Rob grabbed me by the arm while I’m still searching thin air. “Come on, little man. We’ll talk about it later.”

As we exit, I take a look at the students. Of course, I’m a bit blue in the face. I do a fake cough and say something like: “Sorry, guys.”

Some snickered, others are looking at me like I’m- well, what Mr. Kay said. There’s one that stood up, he wore a green hoodie, green beanie and green pants. Looked at me with his mouth open, a state of bewilderment. 

Thinking back, it was more a: 'It’s been 3000 years,' type of face. 

“What a fucking drama-queen. Never got your class interrupted by some paranoid freak?” I think to myself.

We get back to my dorm, Rob and Don get me to breath at a normal rate. 

False alarm.

Rob looked at me with the type of glare I hadn't received since childhood. “Are you done acting like a crazy person?”

“This was a whole new side of you, my man,” Don said. “I like it, you should do it more often.”

“I know what I heard,” I ignored Don and responded to Rob.

“We all heard it. I told you, it's just random bullshit or a prank. I thought you were a levelheaded fellow.”

Rob was right. Don too, I’ll admit. I must’ve been going nuts.

Rob stayed with Don and I for a while after my little breakdown. We chatted about school, played games, and he helped me with some lab work. It’s evening, I unhook the chain lock and let him out.

“…And if you hear any other spooky things: try not to freak out, will you? I don’t get why that shit is there, but it’s nothing to be paranoid about. Got it?” 

I looked at my feet.

“…Got it?” Rob said. 

“Got it.""

Don went back to texting on his bunkbed, and I went back to my room. My laptop: still open. Whenever I look at it, can sense a migraine form and I have to look away for a moment to rub my temples. Won't opt to go for another round of deciding which tabs are safe to execute, and which ones I might need at a sooner date. Screw it, I pin all those mother fuckers in one fell swoop. 

It’s good that I have Uncle Rob here with me. 

Yes, he’s my actual Uncle. He’s been aspiring to be a technician for years and decided that it would be best to head back for a Bachelors. He always slept on it, as most people do. They say: “I’m gonna go back to school, get my degree, and be back on better footing!” It’s rare that it’s acted on. However, no one in their right minds would have turned this place down at such low cost.

Yes, my actual Uncle just so happened to make it to the same college. It also happens that his friend’s daughter, Diana, also made it into the college.

That’s one of the things about my university I didn’t get at first. Everyone here knew each other. Not to imply every woman and man here is familiar with one another or grew up in the same neighborhood. No, I just mean that if you see a group of friends, they’ve probably been a group of friends since high-school or even further than that. Was crazy too me. The way I worked it out in my head was that they used familiarity as an incentive for people who’ve been selected to try out the school. A brilliant marketing tactic, but an odd one for a school that should be at the caliber of a Harvard -- at least in the aesthetics department. It suggested that if someone were to sign up, that increased the odds of your friends also being selected if they signed up too. Like, for example: I didn’t know Diana all too well, but Rob knew Diana, and I know Rob very well. Rob doesn’t know Don, but I know Don very well -- so on and so forth. Don’t get me wrong, it’s cool. It was cool. It’s also…almost too convenient. Of course, that’s the cynic in me. People like me, and I guess people like Brittany Flowers – a former classmate of mine - are always gonna look for the endless “Side-affects may include:” label. 

My laptop’s calendar displayed Election Day on November 5th, 2019. Great, spoiled my nice, holiday off over that fucking cursed podcast Rob found on our school website. Lemme tell you about it.

Toward the end of August, the first semester of sophomore year kicked off. To say the least: it wasn’t off to the greatest of starts. If the year before was a piñata full of treats, sophomore year was like opening one of those cookie jars in your grandma’s house, but lifting the lid revealed some useless appliances instead. There was nothing more quintessential to this than our students &amp; staff website. There, it was normal to see updates that ranged from just about everything. Schedules of activities, classes, your grades, finances, due dates, and my favorite: checking my photography club statuses. Some of the images we took would even appear as wallpapers for layouts and such. All the categories listed on top, you could change how you wanted thumbnails to appear, seamless loading, and Professors responded in record breaking time. There were even these sweet little biographies of every single attendant. Had it all, and it could have still had it all if proper maintenance was consistent. There lies the problem. Updates became slow or nonexistent. On several occasions, I would wake up late for a class, book it there, and upon arrival, I would be greeted to a notification saying the professor wouldn’t be arriving. Witnessed Brittany Flowers roast the living shit out of Mr. Hamilton because he mistakenly put the testing date as a day before it was gonna happen. I can be pretty forgetful, but I refuse to believe that my password was entered wrong 50 times but was magically correct on the 51st. Glitchy, unresponsive, and overall a pain in everyone’s ass. 

Uncle decided he had enough and attempted to hack into the school’s website to see what was truly going on behind there. He did it out of boredom, and honestly didn’t think there was a chance in hell he could do it. He done it with relative ease -- managed into the website’s scripting, and as he suspected, it was a disjointed mess. He couldn’t believe a school could back something so faulty. It truly was the case that this website was thrown together on a whim, and they could care less what happened to it. In no time, it would be a waste of internet space. There was something interesting he stumbled upon, though. There was some key text labeled: “J1M1NEY P0DCA5t.com”. He was about to click off and wouldn’t have noticed had it not been in all caps and in a different font. He entered the URL. No joke, it brought him to a podcast. If that seems random or too unbelievable, it definitely is. 

It was called “Jiminy and the Cold Boys.”

According to Rob: these guys were hilarious. Said there wasn’t a minute he wasn’t grasping his stomach from a lack of air, and all his time that morning was spent listening to them. 

They streamed every morning at 10am, when discovered, it was about 6am, so he saw a message that said: “we will begin at 10:45am, your time.”

I gave it a whirl. Got up early, put in the URL on my phone, and tuned in.

Jiminy, the host, would introduce himself and the rest of the cast. “Rise and shine stay-at-home sluts, because I know darn too well the husbands are too busy workin’ that 9-to-5 than be listening to this crap in the early bird.” 

Explosion noises popped off.

“I kid, I kid, don’t trip, don’t trip. The spook-time is ridin’ on up through this lovely Monday morning. Of course, ain’t no rodeo without my main men Pete and…what the fuck is your name again? Always forget.”

“Yeah, screw you, Pal,” The man who hadn’t been introduced said. 

Talks of pop culture, new movies, their college experiences, and politics. Also, Rob was right, they were hilarious. A bit offensive for sure, but no more offensive than the Family Guys and South Parks I grew up watching. Over the next month and a half, I was a regular viewer of their website. It became something of a morning routine, a coping mechanism through first semester, and it helped there was a new stream daily. I would put the URL on my phone, head out with headphones on, and laugh my way over to a lecture. 

So, it was October 28th, 2019. I’m in the library at Peter Hall waiting for my next class to start. Their stream would end at noon, so it had about 30 minutes left of runtime. Perfect, cause that’s also when I go toward Jimena building, around the corner, for Music History. Their usual schtick of commentary, jokes and mocking each other continued. Would have it on when I studied or did application fill-ins for part-time job offers at the university since they wouldn’t allow you to have one outside of it. 

“I tell you what, Pete,” Jiminy said.

“What’s it to ya, Jim?” 

“We got so caught up talking about that shit-bird celebrity, I almost forgot about that new scandal. We can’t end this without talking about that.”

“Wait, what Scandal? I never heard anything about that, I wanna know,” the third crewmate of their show said. His name was Reso. He always sounded like he was eating but talked with his mouth open. “Say, how come you only tell Pete?”

“Reso, cause you take nothing seriously. This is for Pete. That’s why I go to you for the jokes, and Pete for the drama. You probably looked at the divorce papers your wife handed you the same way legally blind senior citizens look at parking tickets.”

“You know what, Jiminy? I’m fed up with your shit,” Reso said in between chewing something.

“Believe me, Reso, when I say none of us doubt that you’re being fed. Look, there’s this jackass kid, right, Pete? There’s also this old ass bank clerk whose daughter had recently been kidnapped. Sweet little red head named Dia. Now, no one knows who kidnapped Dia. Some theorize it could be apart of some sex trafficking case. Scary shit. Back to this kid. He calls this guy, this clerk, while he’s working. Well, first he called the bank, and they gave him the phone. This kid is also using some payphone, thinking he’s a smart cookie. Tells this poor old fella that he’s the one who has his daughter. If he wants her back, he needs to pay a hefty price. I’ll give it to the knucklehead; he wasn’t too overzealous. He asked for $40,000. Average yearly earning. The old man pleads, begs, but the deal wasn’t happening any other way.”

“That’s insane, what kind of evil bastard would do that?” Pete said.

“Oh, c’mon. Ya mean to tell me that old man really believed him? No proof?” Reso added.

“Yes, also no. Gotta understand, when you have a daughter – something you wouldn’t comprehend, Reso – you would be willing to do anything for ‘em. Anything. The guy already believed the kid, but kid was prepared. Now he was just rubbin’ salt in his wounds. Daughter was a blogger, constant updates on them social medias. He spliced up and edited voice clips of her, played the clips for the old man. You get me? To make it seem like she was asking her daddy to save her. He was convinced, or at least willing to risk it all, but he didn’t have the money in pocket.”

“Don’t tell me the old man…He didn’t,” Pete said.

“Oh, yes he did. Right under the bank’s noses. No one suspected a thing. Who would? Been there for decades. Old man was caught before the transaction could go through.”

Pete cleared his throat. “So…kid got caught?”

“You bet your sweet candy ass. The police did a darn simple procedure. His mistake was his usage of the pay phone. I don’t know the mumbo jumbo, but they had a record of the call. It was a matter of checking databases for electrical grids that matched the signals, then using that knowledge to dig up any surveillance of payphone booths within the grid’s radius. They matched the date &amp; time -- caught the sucker.”

Pete played a clapping effect from the soundboard. “Hurray for justice. But I can’t believe it’s that easy in 2019 for a clerk to swindle a bank.”

“It’s an old story,” Jiminy said.

“Huh? You said it was recent.”

Jiminy chucked. “It is.”

“What?” Pete said. 

“The story is old, yes. But I reckon the themes are relevant today. In fact, as relevant as it ever will be. Moral of this tale: if it’s too good to be true, don’t take the bait.” After Jiminy said that, he got really close to the mic like someone leaning over a campfire during a story. “But that ain’t where the story ends, folks. Because there’s a twist. See, near closing of the investigation, the police went over to the old man’s house. They heard a ruckus from beneath his floorboards, like vibration or machinery. They went down to his basement, and what they found became the reasoning two out of those three cops retired that same year.”

“Well, what is it? What did they find?” Pete asked.

“In horrific irony, it turns out that the old man was…actu-…daug-...wome-…h-hosta-...but-…”

What shit timing. There was a static hum that brewed over Jiminy’s voice and completely messed up the frequency. My pencil laid flat over my homework, my laptop on rest. I refreshed the page, but the static continued. Perfect, perfect, it must be the Wi-Fi acting up. Another stupid thing about sophomore year: the Wi-Fi was twice as shitty.

Waited for a good minute for the show to return. 

The voice I heard after a few minutes wasn’t Jiminy’s. It wasn’t his crewmates either.

Within the static, I could make out distant vocals. Sounded like another man. Turned up volume and paid attention. It was a voice line on repeat. 

*“D-a…Tel-…hear-…”*

Took every ounce of my concentration to make out anything.

*“Dia is a Tell-Tale heart, Dia is a Tell-Tale heart, Dia is a Tell-Tale heart, Dia is a Tell-Tale heart.”*

Okay then…

“*Red-head too vocal, Red-Head too vocal. She sways opinions.’*

Here I thought the college website was buggy, what the hell is this about? 

*“Every day…like clockwork… behind Jiminy’s big sickle… she yells. Same complaint everyday…demands change…”*

That was the last thing said. Jiminy’s voice return as the static faded. “And so, the investigation came to a close.”

“That’s the most terrifying story I ever heard. The world is truly filled with evil,” Pete said.

“It sure is, Pete. It sure is.”

Great, I’d missed whatever the hell he said. 

It was noon, their podcast ended, and I was off to my next course. I stepped passed the library doors which triggered a life-sized witch prop that spewed some typical ‘I’m gonna put a curse on you,’ automated line. She held a broom and would look right to left. Threads of spider web fabric decorated the exit of the building with a large tarantula above the sliding doors. 

I’ll give the school some credit, at least they had still known how to be festive. Most buildings in our little town of a University carried the same decorative theme. Skeletons at the end of every street, carved pumpkins littered the grass mixed with autumn leaves. At Jimena Hall, there was a reaper with a big scythe that haloed the top of the entrance. Inside wasn’t as crowded as usual, thank goodness. I climbed the stairs, and on my way to Music History, I could hear a voice shouting from across the hall. 

“Don’t make me call my daddy and have him talk to you lot. I guarantee he would not enjoy this crummy B.S.”

I recognized the voice. ‘Is that little fireball, Brittany, arguing in one of the finance offices?’ I walk pass and have a peak through the door’s glass.

Was right. I got the jest of what had upset her. Among the plethora of ‘things that have gotten worse’ list, our tuition spiked by a couple thousand dollars. I have zero clue if that shit is even legal. She was giving it to them, along with a bunch of other students. They were all in this debate, threats were flown left and right by both Brittany’s led crowd of over-worked students, and irritated staff. I only ever heard her argue with Hamilton, so it was interesting to witness her combat something else for a change.

The words “red-head too vocal” from the podcast popped up in my mind. 

I laugh. “Yes, red-head very vocal indeed.”

Then the rest of my day proceeded.

The fall sky was dark, I’d returned to my dorm, and Don’s home. I drag my feet to my room and ask Don for some peace and quiet for the rest of the night. He made no promises.

Laying my head on a pillow, I stared at the ceiling. After Don had brought Diana over back in September, and she wounded up missing due to some strange circumstances, I spent as much time outside as possible. At that point, I had no idea what happened to her. 

Then the podcast came up in my mind. That story Jiminy decided to tell -- It was quite random. He said the story wasn’t recent. He wasn’t the type of guy to go off on random tangents like Pete was. ‘And that static interruption? What the hell was that about?’

I still wanted to know what happened at the end there. An idea sprouted. I’d call Rob and ask him. After all, he listened to it too. 

“Top of the evening, little man,” Rob said.

“Hey, you watched the podcast, right? I mean today?”

“Yeah, it was funny.”

“Yeah, well, my thing screwed up while Jiminy was telling that story at the end. Did you hear what happened with the old man?”

Rob goes on to tell me that he wasn’t paying too much attention. Was much too busy helping some freshman out with a “Raspberry Pi” project. However, he recalled hearing some static over the reception so he wouldn’t have heard it either.

“Wait, you actually heard it too? Really?”

“A little bit. Again, I wasn’t too focused on it, so I turned my volume down when it came.”

“There was a voice of a man. I don’t think you would have heard that, though. He said random things. Like…Di-…Dia has a Tell-Tale heart? Something like that, I think.”

“Okay,” he said. I felt he might have been shrugging.

“Well…wasn’t it weird?” 

“I don’t know. Was it?”

He wasn’t buying what I was selling, and his demeanor was starting to make me wanna bang my head against the wall.

“Okay, listen, never mind. I’ll talk to you later.”

When it’s late in the night, I get in the pensive mood. You guys know I mean, right? Like shower thoughts, almost. You start thinking about things in your daily life, other people’s lives, or even about the universe. Maybe sometimes you look at events that happen to you throughout your day, and you connect dots, for better or for worse. You do this until you get bored, fall asleep without realizing, or most times, until you start getting that sudden “bu-dum” sensation in your heart. Like a jolt that burns your chest, and it makes you go: “okay, that’s enough for now”. Telling yourself that usually doesn’t work. Now, that -- only some of you reading this will get me on. 

“Dia has a Tell-Tale heart”. Curious. What did it mean? I had zero clue. I re-read Edgar Allen Poe’s story that night. Not that I needed to, everyone knows it. A story about a maniac who kills someone, then hides their body beneath the floor. In the end, the man who committed the deed confessed due to a guilty conscience.

My thoughts ran rampant, searching for ideas:

‘Rob heard it too. The static, at least. Was their podcast hijacked? Man, Jimena will be so flipping upset if that’s what happened. It’s gonna be hilarious-‘

Ba-dum.

‘Wait. Jimena? Right, I meant Jiminy. Jimena Hall…Jiminy. Coincidence? Of course.’

‘But wait. Pete…Peter Hall? Another coincidence, duh.’

*“Behind Jiminy’s big sickle, she yells.”*

‘Big sickle…like a scythe? The reaper at Jimena’s entrance has a big sickle.’

Bu-dum.

‘You’re thinking too much. Alright, stop thinking. Sleep, you need to be up early.’

Bu-dum.

‘Who’s ‘she’ then? The red head. Brittany was a red head. Brittany was yelling behind Jiminy, or Jimena, building’s big sickle in the finance office. She’s very vocal.’

Ba-dum.

Before I knew it, I woke and it’s 2pm in the afternoon. I’m in a cold sweat, but I’m also hot as shit. That burning sensation had never ceased either.

“Fuck, I overslept.""

I get a text from Uncle. 

“So I heard your little static man.”

I respond, still groggy. “What are you talking about?”

“I don’t know, you tell me. Was watching Cold Boys, static played, and I heard a voice. Said some weird things.”

“Well, what did he say?”

“Hard to tell.”

“You must’ve made out something. Rob, what did he say?” I said. Was sounding a lot more demanding than I intended to, and I didn’t know why.

“Relax, relax, Nephew. He said something like…”

“Like…?”

“Like get your ass out of bed, into class, right now.”

…Sheesh.

In all seriousness, he had heard it. When I met up with him, only then would he tell me. 

Here’s what he heard:

*“They hide in plain sight...they hide in plain sight…you’re too comfortable.”*

*“Shakespeare…the red head’s paradise…something evil's lurking in the dark...with the dancing zombies…I’ve tied it there at the closet shelf. Find…”*

It seems that ‘cryptic’ was the name of the game for these podcast interventions. As my uncle and I parted ways after the calculus we shared, it still lingered.

Okay, what if I were to play with the idea? I was bored, had a two-hour break, there’s nothing to do but study or take pictures for our broken website. Harmless thought game. If Jiminy as in Jimena Hall, Pete as in Peter Hall, and red head as in Brittany, then what would Shakespeare represent? Hmm. As it happens, there is a Shakespeare statue at Monroe – a Hall for theatre. Inside, there’s a well-known drama class, I’ve attended shows there. From the little I knew of Brittany, she wanted to be a famous actor. The building with the Shakespearean statute, for theatre, would be Brittany’s paradise. 

Ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous. I laughed my way over to Madison. The Shakespeare statue: a stunning piece of magnificence in the afternoon gleam – is what I would say if I wore a scarf, a beret, and had Art as a major. I walk inside. Always loved the way it smelled in there, like a new box of shoes. Probably not the best comparison, but it’s all I got. There’s two adjacent staircases at the far left and right of the room. In the center, there’s a downwards stair that led toward a theatre. It sounded like there was a show or movie playing in there, so walking in was a no-go. Upstairs, there was a corridor that led to a dance class. 

Even so, how could I approach this? Can’t just barge in and demand to look in their closet. Tried coming up with a bunch of excuses. Until, on the wall, I spotted a list of students from that class who will be in a “Michael Jackson: Thriller” Halloween special. Could this have been the “dancing zombies""? Recognize one of the names. Tommy: a friend of mine.

Like a creep, I stare through the glass to see if I could spot him. By lucky odds, he hadn’t shown up that day. Perfect. I walk inside. Everyone stares at me with their tattered outfits and rotted makeup. 

“Sir, is there an issue?” The lady instructor said. 

“My friend Tommy is having a sick day, but he said he left something very important in your closet...? Sent me here to pick it up. If you need me to wait, I’ll wait. Sorry for the interruption.”

If she'd known why Tommy wasn't there, this plan was gonna fall right on my face.

“Seems unlikely. You a friend?”

What kind of stupid question was that? Ugh, come on lady, bite.

“Yes.”

Instructor looked at me like she were looking at the hands of a magician. 

I wanna take a quick second to mention that the person in the red &amp; black jacket - the person who was supposed to play the part of Michael - would not, not for a second, quit his dance during this interaction. All this while making as much eye contact he could manage.

“Fine,” She said while digging in a desk. She tossed a pair of keys to Jackson.

He goes “hee-hee”, does a 360 spin, and caught it. He proceeded toward the closet door in fashion of the smoothest impression of the moonwalk I’ve ever witnessed. Like gliding on air with ice skates. I might be remembering this next part wrong, but I swear he managed to toss the key into the lock, like how Michael tossed the coin in the slot. Door open, he did that classic MJ spin away from it.

I stepped inside the open closet. A variety of outfits ranged from mid-west cowboy vest to ballerina blouses hung on the rails. The top shelves were messy, and my eyes jumped around from one useless piece of junk to next.

“Found what you’re looking for?” Instructor lady said with an unreasonable amount of sass.

Shit, I was about to look like an idiot. My brain decided to remember a particular detail.

*“I’ve tied it there at the closet shelf.”*

Tied up, right? At the far end of the shelf, there’s a tied up green plastic bag underneath some books. Took a gamble in grabbing it and exited the closet. Waited to hear the “what are you doing with my—” whatever the hell. However, no one seemed to have a comment about what I had in my hands. Also, the Jackson clone was still spinning, and I have no reason to believe he ever stopped since he opened the door. 

I hadn’t planned on showing up to that done-to-death Thriller show, but if this crazy fucker would be there, may have reconsidered.

“Is that it? Okay, you may go now,” She said.

I got outta there. On my way out, wouldn’t you have it, I pass by Tommy. Guess he had been running late. 

“Oh, wassup man? What are you doing around these parts? Watcha got in your hands?”

“Nunya,” I responded. Walked past him while staring at the bag I obtained. Was sure I’d get some flack later over that stunt, but it was trivial.

Later that night, I’m home sitting on Don’s bottom bunk since he wasn’t back yet. Finally, I’d get to open this thing and see how much I wasted my time. 

It was a CD player. Don’t know which model. It was a green, rectangular box. Were some cords at the bottom, a remote, and a disk. I set it up at the living room TV then pressed play. A whole lot of nothing, at first. Top right, the title of the video was labeled as: “Tell-Tale, part one.” There was movement, lots of background fuzz. If you ever tried to record something but didn’t wanna let it be known, you can get the jest. When the camera pulled up, I saw a white room. Busy, but not crowded. Made out some women in lab coats. One of them set off bells. Paused the video on her face, motion blurriness made me take a second to figure it out. This woman looked just like Counselor Burlesque. 

Before any point or subject of the video could be made, the screen went black. I waited…nothing.

 I wanted to slap myself. Probably stole someone’s cinema project. I decided it would be best to return it the next day.

If you been paying attention thus far, you can guess that’s not what I did. Instead, during a midnight spiral, I dove into more irrational possibilities. Without knowing it, I had set off a cycle that would end up catapulting me into a world of shit.

Every day was the same after that.

I’d wake up, listen to the podcast, wait for static. There would be a new clue, a new hint, or at least I’d consider them as such. I would pull these mental gymnastics in order to decipher these cryptic locations. After classes, I’d get to each new update.

*“The King at the library of Reso, I’ve had 110 dreams.”*

In Residence Hall’s library, I found a CD in a Martin Luther King Jr. biography, on page 110.

*“Pete found glory in the tiger’s eye.”*

In a box of CD’s under a cabinet of my Music History class, I took the disk out of Survivor’s “Eye of the tiger” album case. The tape didn’t have any artwork or label. “Is this it?”

The disappearance of Brittany Flowers turned the burning coals fueling me into ash. This Easter Egg hunt lasted for a week straight. During that week, she had gone missing after Don brought her over from a Halloween party. Was last seen in our dorm when she mysteriously vanished. Somehow. “Red-Head too vocal. She sways opinions.” Had I been warned about Brittany before it happened?

There were twelve of these things. Twelve of these hints I had to decipher and find the prize. I stopped getting CD’s after the tenth. I’ll tell you what the last two were, but for now, I’ll tell you what the CD’s looked like when all together. I got Don to watch them with me. 

The tapes showcased more of the same, at first. Familiar looking people walking around in lab suits. The person holding the camera was still being discreet. Don was trading glances between his phone screen and the TV. The next tapes are when Don put his phone down. Guy or girl with the camera showed a metal plate, then they plopped something on it. It was the size of a newborn, it was white, its eyes are a yellow color. It stuck like a slug, on it’s back, and it gazed at the camera.

“Cool…” Don uttered. “This like a found footage horror?”

The next tape started out with the ‘thing’ again. Its eyes stared at the camera. It brought its hands together. ‘What is it doing?’

In slightness, it titled its arms back and forth with every position shift of whoever was holding the camera. The ‘thing’ was that of a mime attempting to give off the impression of interacting with a physical object. ‘Why was it doing this? Why was it copying the cameraman?’

The last tape was the same, almost. It was the ‘thing’, but the cameraman held up a separate camera. He looked around, no one was watching him, he took a picture of it. The flash made it blink rapidly. After a few minutes of studying, it stopped cooperation. ‘Thing’ put its hands down, got still, and then the next moment it fucking exploded. Even Don jumped. It wasn’t loud. There were no blood, goo, or bits flown. It was a silent explosion. An explosion of gas, it turned into steam. Had the camera not been panned on it, we would have thought it vanished into thin air. The cameraman flinched, an audible gasped escaped him. Tape ended there.

As I said, there were two more codes to decipher that hadn't led to tapes, so I’ll tell you about those now. The next day:

*“Reso has big curtains. They conceal the evil eye. Do you hear our hideous heart beats?”*

It didn’t take me long to make the connection that he was talking about the auditorium in Residence Hall. I made my way there, climbed the stage's staircase and explored behind those red curtains. Spent a good five minutes going in circles, until I spotted a door. It had a pin device on it – a passcode. A key lock on the direction of it. I went to grab it, but then felt a grasp on my shoulder. A security guard pulled me away and escorted me out of the building. 

That must have been it. All the other messages gave me specific locations in vague ways, but this gave me a general location. There must be something behind that door. ‘Why would he bring me to a door that I had no way of entering?’

The twelfth message is what will bring this update full circle.

Rob came over in the early morning with plans to help me with lab work. I asked him about the podcast. He hadn’t known about my scavenger hunting. When I told him about it, he checked me for signs of brain injury. Told him about the tapes too, but he wasn’t having it. He said that I had an opportunity, I should be focusing on school instead of idiocy. He spent half an hour arguing with me that everything I found had been some dumb, elaborate prank. 

Don sat back and ate imaginary popcorn.

“Just forget about it. You have responsibilities, you don’t have time for this shit. Your mother would be furious if she find out how you were kidding around here,” Rob said.

“Uncle just hear me out for two seconds. Listen to the podcast with me. We’re gonna hear the message, and we’re gonna decipher what he’ll say. Come with me and you’ll see. I feel like I’m so close to figuring out something.”

“About what?”

“About this school. You don’t think it’s weird? This entire University is so shady, it’s so illusionary, isn’t it? Who even owns this property? All these benefits, all these opportunities to people who wouldn’t have ever deserved it. How the hell did Don and I ever make it to this place? Yeah, things have degraded this year, but it’s still leaps and bounds over what we deserved.”

“Hey, I’m stupid smart,” Don said.

We ignore him.

“You’re just like your dad, little man,” Rob said. “Always gotta look at the thorns for the roses. A little open arms and you melt like ice cream.”

“Just once,” I said. 

With a sigh, Rob folded. 

“I’m game,” Don said. “I wanna know what the hell you guys are talking about. Not like you to leave me out of shit, \*\*\*\*\*\*.”

Rob sat down. “So, what have you ‘deciphered’ so far?”

“Pretty much everything,” I explain. “It’s been flawless. Once you get the language down, it’s almost predictable. Wait, I lied. There is one that has me stumped. It’s the very first one that I told you about. ‘Dia has a Tell-Tale heart’.”

I explained to them my thought process, how the different names of the podcast crew correlated with the names of our different Halls. Didn’t wanna show him the tapes yet, I needed him to be sucked into my cold world.

“That’s the basics of it,” I said. “Still have no idea what ‘Dia’ is and what Edgar Allen Poe had to do with it. I feel like I’m missing a piece of the puzzle. There aren’t any areas here I can think of that start with D-I-A.”

Rob spared some moments of thought, fed my ideals.

That’s when Don popped out of nowhere. “Dia…Dian-…a?”

Ba-dum. 

“What?” I said.

“Sorry, that was fucking stupid. Shouldn’t have said that. My fault,” Don said.

“No, Don, you brilliant fool. You might be on to something,” I said.

Diana is a Tell-Tale heart. A story about a killer who hid someone’s body underneath floor. In open-house, Diana fell through the floor. She then saw something that copied her “every movement”. Something white with yellow eyes. The ‘thing’ in the tapes, the mimicking, the lab, the silent explosion into steam – I’m so close. 

On cue, Jiminy’s voice came from my phone. 

We sat through it. At the end, the static came in per usual. Only this time, he had a lot more to say.

*“The downfall of man is the arrogance that we are all above the many forms of evil, simply by ideal alone.”*

*“If you’ve come for dreams, I wholeheartedly apologize. First victim was before even the very first semester. That girl…they couldn’t even wait. This is not what you think it is. If anyone is listening, you’re in the jaws.”*

*“Jimena Hall, B side, class 126. Under sink, right corner. The key to her heart will be there. I leave those keys every morning between the hours of 11:00am and 12:00pm.”* 

That was the first time he wasn’t cryptic. Rob was stunned, Don had a smile on his face like he just joined a secret club. I checked the time. He said from 11:00am to 12:00pm. It was 11:40. Before anyone could say a word, I bolted out of our apartment and headed towards where he said. You know the rest. We make it there before twelve o’clock, interrupt a band class. Whatever he insinuated didn’t turn out to be there. Looked like an idiot. On our way back to my dorm, Uncle and I talked. He carried this “I told you so” demeanor. 

“What’s been up with you, lately? Off your rockers,” He said.

I confessed everything, about the impacts of Diana’s and Brittany’s disappearance on our watch. How it affected me.

He put his hand on my shoulders. “Still tearing yourself up over that? You put too much weight on your back. If only I knew this was still the problem, I would have remembered to tell you sooner. Figured someone must have informed you already. I'm sorry, nephew. Thought it stopped being a bother to you a while ago. Just like your dad, flawlessly making it seem like everything is fine and dandy.”

“Tell me what?”

“Go talk to Sal, her roommate. She knows more about what happened than I do. She works at that little café you like. Diana is fine. I talked to her mother just a few days ago. As for Brittany, I don’t know. But you said the security people weren’t worried about it, right? Give it a rest.”

It took me some time to get around to it. I needed things to go back to normal for a minute before I worked up the courage. The podcast had also stopped airing, the website no longer available. No clue why, but it was a blessing, I was able to take my mind off of everything. I stopped by the Café on November 17th, Sal and I talked for a while, and she gives me confirmation of Diana’s whereabouts. Even showed me a recent photo of her back home. She was safe. Made the past week seemed almost pointless. 

It was almost enough.

If you’ve read the first post in this series, you know that Sal’s explanation nearly brought everything to a sense of bliss. The tapes, the website, the codes – strange? No doubt. That didn’t matter. During that week of diving into that podcast, I couldn’t eat more than one meal a day. I’d fall asleep with a burning chest and wake up exhausted. My own dorm was a lion’s den for my mental state. Communication with Don dwindled, like I were living with a stranger. If things were going to get back to a regular program, I needed to take uncle’s advice and shove everything behind me. Fuck the possibilities, fuck connecting dots, and fuck complaining about school. It’s a great place, even with its downsides. I was gonna shut up, get through the days, study hard, and the years until graduation would pass in no time. As I walked home after meeting with Sal, I decided that would be my dream moving forward: move on.

A dream shattered when I grasped the knob to my home and made a realization about the chain lock.

A dream shattered when I walked into my apartment, headed for my room, but noticed the sound of footsteps come from behind me.

As I looked back at the apartment door and saw shadows of feet scurry across the bottom light line. On the ground lied an envelope, an envelope someone slid from underneath. 

I picked it up, hearing the steps get further away from my dorm. On the heading were the words:

*“My favorite color is green. Your lucky numbers are: 2, 2, 5 and 1.”*

I opened it. Inside remained a small key.

How I plan on using One Finance after using Simple,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneFinance/comments/kukfhg/how_i_plan_on_using_one_finance_after_using_simple/,news_nerd826,1,2021-01-11 03:03:53,8,/r/OneFinance/comments/kukfhg/how_i_plan_on_using_one_finance_after_using_simple/,General,"Ok after doing the research, I decided to give One Finance a try. I currently have 9 expenses in my Simple account. I used goals to auto-fund my savings each paycheck until the end of the month when I would transfer the full amount to my Marcus HYSA. I used protected goals as my “buffer account” for unexpected expenses and allowed Simple to round up money into that account.

With One Finance, I created an “expenses” pocket that I’ll lump all of my bills into. I already know the exact amounts for those bills and when they are due from looking at my YNAB account. From there I'll set up auto-pay for those bills using the account number for that pocket. For the merchants that require a card number (like streaming services), I’ll use my credit card and set up auto-payments from the expenses pocket each month to pay the credit card off. That way I get points and pay my bills on time. Until virtual cards become available for pockets, I think this is a better alternative than switching which pocket is linked to the debit card before purchases. You can also set up direct deposit into this pocket so you can still get that feel of Simple auto-funding your expenses each paycheck.

The “auto-save” pocket will be how my protected goal worked before allowing the round-up feature to build that account. And the “save” pocket will be where I house my savings since 1% APY is much higher than Marcus’ current 0.50% so I’ll be taking advantage of that. I currently save 30% of my paycheck so I may divide between “auto-save” and “save” since auto-save is limited to 10%.

Then my Spend account will be where I will always know what is “safe to spend.” 

I already have mobile check deposit through my Capital One 360 account that I use to bill pay my landlord since Simple's version wasn't as reliable. I also would highly recommend trying out YNAB to replicate Simple's envelope method of expenses/goals. I watched [Nick True's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPVEB759gkU&amp;t=1073s&amp;ab_channel=NickTrue-MappedOutMoney) to help me get over the learning curve. The advantage is that you can create and track as many expenses as you want in YNAB so you don't have to create so many ""pockets"" in One Finance. You can also tag expenses (color code them even!), write notes on transactions (like in Simple), view reports on where you're spending, track debt and net worth, etc. I started using YNAB in September because while Simple was great, it didn't show me how to plan my money for the future.

I think one lesson to be learned from Simple shutting down is to always have a backup and not rely so much on one bank. Clearly Simple was ahead of its time if no other bank has its features, but at least One Finance can serve as a somewhat close alternative. Hope that helps!"
Nano Dimension DD ($NNDM),https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kutffb/nano_dimension_dd_nndm/,cashmoney_nio,2,2021-01-11 10:44:56,35,/r/trakstocks/comments/kutffb/nano_dimension_dd_nndm/,NaN,"Please keep in mind, I am freshman college student. I got into stocks like a month ago, so take everything, especially my analysis with a grain of salt. 

 

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, just like any other company, invest at your own risk and do your own research.*

**Overview**

Nano Dimension is a company founded in 2012 and led by CEO Yoav Stern. This company produces 3D hardware capable of printing electrical hardware. It’s main product is the DragonFly LDM Lights Out Digital Manufacturing system which is able to produce Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), antennas, capacitors, sensors and more with minimal need for supervision. This company is the first of their kind to market 3D printing machines with these capabilities.

*Advantages of the Dragon Fly LDM Lights Out Digital Manufacturing System*

* Saves time by allowing customers to produce electronic prototypes in the matter of hours, rather than weeks.
* Saves money by allowing customers to manufacture their own prototypes instead of outsourcing production. Some circuit boards may only cost $10 to print.
* Increased confidentiality since customers are able to produce their own intellectual property.
* Eco-Friendly by reducing waste that comes with the current manufacturing process.
* Able to produce complex designs.
* Automated printed allows for minimal operator maintenance.
* Able to be used 24/7

**Company Management**

NNDM’s team consists of credible and experienced professionals with a diverse range of education in finance, material science, product development, and other relevant areas. Yoav Stern, the CEO of the company holds a MA in International Relations and Affairs, a B.Sc in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science, and a Practical Engineering Diploma in Mechanical Engineering and Automation.

**Investor Relations**

Nano Dimensions is currently listed on the NASDAQ as NNDM with a small market cap of 1.2B. Many investment firms have been buying into large positions of NNDM throughout the past year. The most notable of which being ARK Invest who specializes in disruptive companies with large potentials for growth.

Nano Dimension’s largest position can be found within ARK’s ARKQ ETF which includes large cap companies such as TSLA, AAPL, and AMZN. As of now ARKQ currently holds 5,256,734 shares of NNDM, worth $49,181,955.56. This suggests that ARK Invest has a bullish outlook on NNDM, especially when you consider the fact that they increase their position regularly. Another bullish sentiment can be seen when ARK Invest increases their holdings even when the stock is at all time highs; which has happened various times. Ark Invest purchased 42,000 shares of NNDM on December 30th when the stock was trading at a high of $9.55. This is a bullish sentiment which suggests that they believe NNDM to be valued at least above $9.55.

Nano Dimensions has executed multiple different direct offerings over the course of 2020 which gives large investors opportunities to buy into the company at discounted prices. Some argue this could be bad for the stock, but given that the company is not yet profitable; these direct offerings help by providing them with cash flow. The most recent direct offering provided the company gross proceeds of $250-300 million bringing the company’s cash balance to about $400 million.

Yoav Stern spoke on their strategic use of this new found capital which will benefit their business in the upcoming quarters.  A recent statement from Yoav Stern regarding these plans goes as follows: “We are adjusting our focus in order to leverage our strong cash on the one hand and the clam on the markets as a result of the continued influence of Covid-19. While Wall Street is behaving unstably at the moment, on ‘main street’ there is a continuing slowdown following the closure of factories and delays in capital expenditure. This is an environment that allows Nano Dimension to make effective use of the support of its shareholders and we have at the moment two targets on which we are focusing: speeding up and promoting our RD (research and development), and at the same time looking for a private company to acquire at the right price whose value has fallen, and that is synergetic.” Nano Dimensions will capitalize on their increased cash flow by buying out any potential competition, and increasing their research and development to produce better products.

Coronavirus directly affects Nano Dimensions due to the fact that they produce hardware. Customers need to present in a workforce or lab in order to operate their 3D printers which is limited due to social distancing regulations. Moreover, many companies are struggling and avoiding spending money which limits the sales of their Dragonfly printers. Yoav Stern plans to take advantage of the slowed economy by using raised funds to assure that they stay ahead of the curve with their technology, while simultaneously improving it.

*Note: Acquisitions of companies sometimes lead in the decline of share price for the acquiring company. However, Yoav Stern specifically states that they’re looking for a private company which usually does not result in the same pullback since there is no other stock for the money to move to.*

**Markets**

Electrical products can be found in many multibillion dollar markets, so NNDM’s equipment can be an attractive product to many corporations throughout many different markets. Nano Dimension is currently working to become a new disruptive player in research institutions, medical fields, the aerospace field, the defense field, and the automotive field. Theoretically, Nano Dimension’s printers can be applied in many more markets as well.

The DragonFly printer has been used by The Center for Biomolecular Nanotechnologies (CBN). Three different studies conducted by CBN used the Dragonfly LDM printer which yielded successful results. One of the studies included 3D printed optical fibers which were able to stimulate the brains of mice. Thus, showing the usefulness of their products in research environments.

Previously, PCBs were impossible to be created on-site for Aerospace companies. The productions of these were often expensive and outsourced. However, the addition of a Dragonfly printer would make on-site, cheap PCBs a reality. Harris Corporation is a leading technological company which focuses on Electronic systems, Communication Systems, and Space Intelligence Systems. When working with Nano Dimensions they were able to create complex Radio Frequency (RF) circuits which showed similar performance to regular RF circuits. This study supports Nano Dimension as a viable player in the aerospace industry. 

HENSOLDT is a technological company which is geared towards data management, cyber security, and robotics. This company has been looking for a solution to the slow process of prototyping PCBs that only Nano Dimension has been able to provide. In a collaborative study, Nano Dimension was able to produce the world's first 3D-printed 10 layer PCB which passed every electrical test, and proved durable throughout assembly. This study showed Nano Dimension’s capability for remedying the prototyping issue in the defense field. 

In addition to this solution, NNDM solves another problem in the defense field. Outsourcing the production of PCBs causes a confidentiality issue because oftentimes these PCBs are intellectual property. Defense systems are particularly sensitive to this issue, as is the medical field. Having a printer which can produce prototypes and PCBs on-site would greatly reduce this risk.

Nano dimension’s capabilities allow for many small non-invasive medical parts to be printed and tested for companies in the medical field. The convenience of having a Dragonfly printer on-site can speed up clinical trials by providing quick complex production of small parts. This was demonstrated with Piezoskin, a start up company when they used NNDM printers to produce parts for a thin piezoelectric transducer. This is a small complex device that can be applied to medical procedures.

There are many more examples of where NNDM’s technology could be beneficial. With the rise of Electronic Vehicles (EVs), their products could make the production of EVs much more efficient and cost effective. Not to mention the continued rise and demand for new smartphone models. Their product is especially marketed towards industrial manufacturing companies which may relate to many different companies. NNDM has a plethora of markets to choose from, and to grow in.

**Financials**

To put it bluntly, Nano Dimension’s financials are not good. This explains why their market cap remains relatively small considering their innovative technology. Nano Dimension is not yet a profitable company, and their financials have been on a decline with the addition of coronavirus. However, before the emergence of coronavirus the company had steady growth from 2017-2019 by their increasing total revenue. Although they have grown they still remained unprofitable and likely will remain unprofitable in the near future due to their machines requiring a lot of research and capital to produce. Despite the company struggling from the coronavirus and low income, Yoav Stern has raised enough money for the company to last at least 5 years.  This effectively allows the company to outpace the effects of the coronavirus, and as stated before, he has a plan to capitalize on growth while revenue remains low. This situation, while not ideal, gives investors a chance to enter into a holding for Nano Dimension before their company is able to really take off and expand into its many markets.

**Conclusion**

Nano Dimension is a company with a solid innovative product. They have the potential to disrupt many different markets. Smart business strategies and investors continually increasing their holdings suggest a promising future for Nano Dimension despite their troubled financial history. However, my position in Nano Dimension leads to confirmation bias which hurts the validity of this research. Nano Dimension is still a small cap stock who does not profit, so investing in them comes with more risk than many large cap stocks. I am not a financial advisor, and can not give financial advice so I urge investors to approach with caution and do their own research.

Look backwards to see forwards. We have to. There's no other way. The information war has started because they need to keep us in the dark. **Dark days ahead. Dark Winter.** It's hidden in plain sight, but we refuse to see, and when some of us do see, we find ourselves caught in a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. There isn't much one can do to figure out what is disinformation and what is real information, but when you can find the assorted peices of the puzzle, you can trace it forwards to a probable endgame. And that endgame isn't on a timeline, it has many players with many interests. Are any of them actually altruistic? Not sure now, and I may never be sure. So before you grab the pitchforks and eat the rich, be very careful that you aren't being manipulated by Psyops using Dark Propoganda.   


##The Pitchforks Are Coming    


It was 2014. I had just read an article and I was ecstatic. It dealt with the rising inequalities between the rich and the poor, and how measures had to be taken before the pitchforks were brought out. You know, like in revolutionary France and the Red October in Russia. Because nobody wants to be dragged out of their beds by the mob for injustices in society. Nobody. Especially not the people who make more in an hour than most people can make in an entire year's worth of labor.  


&gt;**You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state,” he wrote in the Politico essay. “Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. It’s not if, it’s when.** [The Pitchforks Are Coming](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014)     


Hmmm. A police state or an uprising. Not if, when. That's a pretty predictive thought. But honestly, it wasn't hard to see, not even back in 2014, just a short while before the Plauge Doctor video in 2015, and only to be followed up with Killer Clowns in 2016. And now we're here. In 2020. With a pandemic police state. Welcome to the New Normal. Do you think this is normal? I don't. You don't. But we aren't New Normies. We might not have seen it coming, but we recognize it when it's here, don't we? Of course we do. 



So where do we **Stand**? Let's keep digging. Because words matter, and right now they matter a lot. Like the word, pitchforks. Unusual word to be throwing around, isn’t it? It's not exactly a common everyday word in wide usage.    


How about, RunObama.com, is there anything weird there?    


&gt;**November 22, 2016** • ""The purpose of this site is to let him know that if he does decide to run there will be an army of grassroots supporters out there **ready to pick up the pitchforks** and run with him,"" Webster said when I talked with him yesterday. [Source Here](https://www.chicagotribune.com/chinews-mtblog-2006-11-pitchforks_for_obama-story.html)      


You get a pitchfork, I get a pitchfork, everybody gets a pitchfork! Let's get our Corona party started! Now here's the interesting thing, and be forewarned, this series is going to get a little harder to follow from now on. I wish I could do a better job of simplification, but I can't right now. So strap in tight, the road to get ahead of the curve is complicated.    


This article in the Chicago Tribune also says this;    


&gt;Still, we wondered who was behind it. A Whois search led me to an inside-the-Beltway Democratic media consultant named Todd Webster. He was once communications director for former **Sen. Tom Daschle** and deputy communications director for **Vice President Al Gore's** 2000 presidential campaign.    



Neat names. Names matter too.    


&gt;The House suspended work and three Senate office buildings were closed yesterday as congressional leaders announced that 26 Senate staffers and five police officers had been exposed to anthrax spores that arrived in the office mail of **Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle** (D-S.D.) on Monday. [Source Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/24/when-anthrax-laced-letters-terrorized-washington-new-york/)    


Oh, right, the 9-11 Anthrax strikes back, attacks. You've got mail, so run ~~Obama~~ Forest, run. **This wasn't typed out on a Corona Typewriter, because I don't use them**. [Flatten the Curve. Part 55](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/juvdxd/flatten_the_curve_part_55_tom_hanks_rita_wilson/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)


One month later, in June, Johnson was joined at the **2008 Bilderberg meeting** by Geithner, Holbrooke, Summers and Ross, as well as Obama’s first choice for HHS secretary, **Tom Daschle**, and Sebelius, who at the time was included on some short lists of prospective Obama running mates and who also attended the 2007 meeting in Istanbul, Turkey.
According to the Bilderberg press release, the meeting was designed to “deal mainly with a nuclear free world, cyber terrorism, Africa, Russia, finance, protectionism, US-EU relations, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Islam and Iran.” Approximately two-thirds of the 140 expected attendees came from Europe, according to the release, and the rest from North America.
Had the meeting been held outside the United States, that might have been the end of the Obama angle. **But the conference, which took place from June 5 through 8, was held at a heavily guarded hotel in Chantilly, Va. in suburban Washington—coincidentally overlapping with an Obama campaign event in the area**. [Source Here]( https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bilderbergers-excite-conspiracists/)
&gt;&gt;While Obama’s schedule indicated he was to fly home to Chicago for the weekend—and journalists were herded on a campaign plane under the impression they were headed there along with Obama—the future president slipped away for a private meetings and never actually boarded the flight.    
As it turned out, Obama secretly met that evening with Hillary Rodham Clinton in Washington, D.C., but not before raising alarms among the Bilder-busters, who were convinced something was rotten in Chantilly.     


See. Here's the problem. That flight, with the reporters, actually took off and flew the press Corp to Chicago, without telling them or asking them for permission, essentially kidnapping them.    


&gt;Gibbs took on a barrage of questions, and, to his credit, listened to what he called the ""anticipated grievances"" from the press for almost 20 minutes.    
""He's having a secret meeting tonight, and we're not going to see him until Monday"" because of three scheduled ""down days,"" one reporter began. ""I'd like to say that's unacceptable. He's the -- ""    
""Presumptive Democratic nominee?"" Gibbs finished, adding a giggle. ""Yeah.""
Questions centered largely on why the press was essentially held hostage with no candidate and no choice but to fly to Chicago on a chartered plane • [SOURCE HERE](https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/06/btsc.welch.obama.press/index.html?section=cnn_latest)       


And here's problem number two. Bill and Hillary love the World Economic Forum, and Bill has been seen on numerous occasions at the Bilderberg Group meetings. And Obama disappeared with Hillary from Washington, and the Bilderberg meeting was in Virginia. Nothing to see here folks, nothing at all. And did you notice the journalist subtly placing in the pilot's snarky comment of, presumptive nominee and then giggling when he said, yeah. Was, the journalist trying to imply that Obama was pre-chosen?  Nah. Thats just crazy tin foil hat thinking, isnt it? 


Oh. Wait. There is one more item to show you before I continue with this post. Guess who was a member of the Steering Committee for the Bilderberg Group? Klaus Schwab, WEF founder. [Source Here](https://www.geni.com/people/Klaus-Schwab/6000000046719087993)       


So we have the Pitchfork comment by a website urging Obama to run for office, that same PR person had in the past worked with Senator Tom Daschle, who received a package of anthrax after 9-11, and also was at the same Bilderberg meeting that Obama and Hillary may have been at. Oh, and Tom is also behind the biodefense program, and he wanted Mike Pence to run it. Simple. 


Back to the Pitchforks. 


&gt;Schwab seems an unlikely candidate for becoming one of the century's great party-givers. A slender, balding man with a Calvinist expression - he reminds you of the **pitchfork-clutching farmer** in American Gothic - [Source Here](https://www.wired.com/1999/12/schwab/)    



So we have an article about grabbing  pitchforks and going after the 0.1% . Obama had the term pitchforks used in a quote that supported him. Obama also had reporters ""kidnapped"" and probably attended a Bilderberg meeting with Hillary. And Schwab used to steer the Bilderberg Group, and he says were not going back to normal. He said, the short answer is, never. Look it up.      


So where else can we find those pesky pitchforks? Let's ask Obama.    



&gt;**April 3, 2009** • But President Barack Obama wasn’t in a mood to hear them out. He stopped the conversation and offered a blunt reminder of the public’s reaction to such explanations. “Be careful how you make those statements, gentlemen. The public isn’t buying that.”
“My administration,” the president added, “is the only thing **between you and the pitchforks**.” [Source Here](https://www.politico.com/story/2009/04/inside-obamas-bank-ceos-meeting-020871)    



Isn't that odd? Pitchforks for Obama, Schwab looks like he should have a pitchfork. Obama’s standing in the way of the pitchforks. And when do the mobs grab the pitchforks? Why when times are bad. Like in an economic collapse. 


So what is it about pitchforks?
Let's ask UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson what he thinks about pitchforks.     



&gt;The London mayor painted a scene of ""**pitchfork-wielding populists**"" converging on Brussels ""drunk on local hooch and chanting nationalist slogans and preparing to give the federalist machinery a good old kicking with their authentically folkloric clogs"".
Writing in the Telegraph, he compared Eurosceptic parties, including Ukip, Dutch rightwing firebrands and Greek anti-capitalists, to people taking part in ""a kind of peasants' revolt"" or a ""jacquerie"" – a bloody uprising against the French nobility in 1358. [Source Here](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/26/boris-johnson-eurosceptic-success-peasants-revolt-european-elections)



And what about you, Prime Minister Trudeau? What do you think about pitchforks?     



“Once I look at the trend lines in democracy, the empowering of citizens and activists, I know that the government of the future is going to be very, very different than governments of the past. And there will have to be learning done, both by governments, breaking old habits, and by citizens, shifting their expectations. But I know we’re going there eventually and it’s a question of whether we want to step forward with that with confidence and optimism, knowing that we’re going to stumble, knowing that it’s going to provide challenges, or whether we get dragged there kicking and screaming by mobs with **pitchforks, metaphorical of course**…” [Source Here](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/justin-trudeau-quietly-suggests-we-change-everything/)     


There is more to the Trudeau article that I will touch on in an upcoming post, but what about those pitchforks? Seriously. Why is everybody talking about pitchforks? Does Amazon have them on sale? Walmart? Or are all the farmers about to unite, grab dem pitchforks, and start an agriculture revolution? Just say no to Monsanto and GMO? Thank a farmer indeed.         


So why did all three elected officials talk about pitchforks? Well, guess what? One whim I decided to Google search pitchforks and crime. See for yourself.

#During the Davos 2020 meeting of the World Economic Forum something remarkable happened.       
A group of more than hundred millionaires, calling themselves “Millionaires against Pitchforks” spread a letter to governments in which they ask for more taxes. [Feb 6, 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeroenkraaijenbrink/2020/02/06/against-inequality-why-these-169-millionaires-ask-governments-for-8-trillion-more-taxes/)       



#To Our Fellow Millionaires and Billionaires Across the Globe,      

There are two kinds of wealthy people in the world: those who prefer taxes and those who prefer pitchforks. We, the undersigned, prefer taxes. And we believe that, upon reflection, you will as well.    
For that reason, we urge you to step forward now - before it’s too late - to demand higher and fairer taxes on millionaires and billionaires within your own countries and to help prevent individual and corporate tax avoidance and evasion through international tax reform efforts.
We make this request as members of the most privileged class of human beings ever to walk the earth. [SOURCE HERE](https://www.millionairesagainstpitchforks.com/)     


WOW! Praise capitalism and pass the nachos! They do care! While they pay their employees as little as possible and take away benefits...     


Yeah.     


Look. There will be more on all of this later, but it should be obvious that something is going on that 99.8% of society isn't privy too. Now the question becomes, are they just one step ahead of the game, or are we being manipulated and positioned where they want us on the chessboard?        


Personally, I think we're being manipulated. 


One last thing, they also just showed up at recently at Jeff Bozos place with a guillotine.    


Protesters set up guillotine in front of Jeff Bezos’ DC home [Source Here](https://www.foxnews.com/us/amazon-jeff-bezos-guillotine-dc-protests)     


Do you remember all of the Reddit posts freaking out about guillotines? And then we have this suddenly in the papers? Coincidence? Don't think so. And do guess who was the first investor into Amazon? The same guy who wrote the Pitchforks Are Coming article. 

Yep.     


It's going to get worse before it gets better, and the worst part is, we don't know when it's going to get better. Because whatever the chaos is planned, in addition to the environmental collapse they keep confidently proclaiming now with a timeline (just like the pandemic prophecies by Mr Microsoft Gates) of 2030, it looks like they're all in on the upcoming metamorphosis (strange word metamorphosis, there was a poem titled the Metamorphosis by a Roman poet who lived during the time of Augustus named **Ovid**. That was right after Ceasar crossed the Rubicon and Marched on Rome. Which was written about **C**. (or circa) 8 AD. And a concept drawn from the Metamorphoses is the idea of the **white lie** or pious fraud: ""pia mendacia fraude"".)    


A white lie. A lie told not to hurt the recipient. Interesting, don't you think?    


Ok. I'm out for now. More soon.    


Stay safe and be aware. Just don't grab any pitchforks.      


Talk soon."

I decided to go back to a few youtubers I watched back in 2017 to see what they were saying on Dec 22nd, 2017 when BTC reached its previous all time high during the last bull market before we went into a bear market for 3 years. 

Keep in mind, these are just people I happen to watch, I don't really care if you think they're good or bad it's just to give you an idea of the sentiment at the time of how some folks were viewing the market in an effort to put in perspective what some folks are saying today. Also worth noting, I hate reddit's formatting so I'm leaving it as is.

My notes from the video:

* The Bubble Popped Again, perfect intro
* Except for Ripple, ripple is doing just fine [lulz]
* Went from 650 billion market cap, then dropped immediately to 480 billion 
* That's a 170 billion dip in 24h
* has the bubble popped? It is the 5th 30% correction this year
* personal strategy buy a bit but i havent bought a lot, christmas is around the corner, im expecting it to go even lower
* so what alt coins during this fire sale? All of them
* We'll talk about Neo, ICOs upcoming, 27 of them coming could see some price action in the new year been holding neo at $7, not planning to sell for a long time
* coinbase launches investigation into insider trading, bitcoin cash stuff, i dont see any long lasting repercussions to this
* final thoughts: sell if you need to, hodl if you want to.

* a lot of people are gonna be panicking, we've seen huge losses, bitcoin down 25% on the week, best advice, dont panic. Someone bought at hte 16700 top as well

* Sometimes buying the top isn't as bad as it seems

* Few different explanations, is the futures market pushing it down? Can christmas explain the loss, probably not?

* This happens in crypto, market goes down 20-30% will recover in the future, matter of patience - goes down sometimes, but overtime it goes up

* mining difficulty has gone up, hashrate dropped off

* more miners switching over to mining bitcoin cash
* transaction fees averaging $55 as base transaction fees for BTC transactions

* 12.5 bitcoin per block

* lots of discussion about not having upgraded to segwit wallets to drop transaction fees

* accusations of insider trading with bitcoin cash transactions on coinbase

* coinbase temp halted trading due to massive selling, 15 min stop

* french foreign minister at g12 meeting discussing crypto at summit, concerns about all foreign finance ministers getting together and chatting about crypto

* tax free trading in america to end, if you bought bitcoin for $1 and it goers to 10$ and if you want to move to ETH then you gotta pay tax, capital gains blah blah

* hockey player in Denmark asked to get paid in bitcoin for his salary

* Opera browser implemented mining blocker tool to its browser

* 500 petahash facility up and running, GMO

* Is bitcoin crashing? are we enetering a crypto bear market

* Been getting some serious correction to bitcoin last few days
* Volatility highest was (YTD) 7.08% - currently 6.31% 

* honestly think we're gonna see a correction to bitcoin - think we're gonna see 7-8% volatility

* Are we heading into bear market? personally dont believe that, dont see the indicators for that yet. There is a big different between correction and bear market

* I believe we're still in bull market, this is just a correction

* Bear market is no hype no parties, need more dramatic selling. Need more big candle days
* Need to see some whales selling before we can call for a bear market.

* I think we're seeing a healthy correction

* Now that futures are in, what's the next big thing for bitcoin?

* Not dumping btc, but am planning for my next addition into BTC

* I was calling for a correction at 10k, didn't happen, i make mistakes

* waiting for the 50 day to curve upwards, and if it does make contact ill add to my btc ($12900) which will make up for the btc I sold at 10k

* We shouldn't be panicking we're back where we were a few days ago only

* Is bitcoin cash replacing btc? No lolz

* What are my alt coins gonna do? Think alt coins will do well
* Think we'll test 37% of the market dominance in june 2017

* Closing thoughts: think its a healthy corrrection and alt coins are the safe bet

Redditor OPs note: ETH later peaked Jan 12th ~1448 before dropping back to 684 on Feb5th, BTC continued to trend down

Dec 22nd update

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK0sWaYIbTA

* Yesterday we talked about a correction and boy did we get it, came much faster than i expected
* lot of you are worried, with BTC dropping below the 50 day, the cash i got from a previous sell i have reinvested into btc (price is at ~11200)

* Fear is settling in

* BTC isn't invincible could go down to zero, but im bullish on it
* we could slump into the bear market for a bit who knows

* Reality is kicking in, futures news is settling in, what's next. Core features scalability
* Hope those buying at 20k were patient and waited for this dip

* More than 1/3 of the value of btc lost in a week, that's pretty dramatic
* Personally i think we're going to 10k, but we'll see, for now i bought my secondary position, we might just hold at this 50 day, if we get a bounce that would be good
* lot of cheap alt coins out there

* it doesnt look like just a flash sale to me, i dont feel like we're heading into a bear marklet but a healthy correction
* hopefully we can go back up to 20k and make new highs

* final thoughts: prepare for the best and the worst

**tl;dr:** Maybe."
Full-stack software developer here - big vision for Neo!,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/kvhxrk/fullstack_software_developer_here_big_vision_for/,mkultra33,1,2021-01-12 10:11:04,20,/r/NEO/comments/kvhxrk/fullstack_software_developer_here_big_vision_for/,NaN,"I was listening to John Devadoss speak on several interviews last night, and I'm beginning to see the vision. Neo is trying to become THE platform. I think of Neo as analogous to what search engines such as Google allowed for the internet, big business. Literally every big company in the world is online and many do sales online. 

However, Google only gets a cut of advertising revenue that websites choose to display on their sites.. most big businesses with hundreds of millions in revenue DON'T need to advertise with Google, so there is less revenue potential for them.. as the big players make their money else where, not off of user ad impressions.

Neo is trying to become a platform, in a way, like Google, but for the internet ""3.0"". they are trying to digitize real world assets, where finance and business transactions are conducted, logged, and held accountable through the platform's network ledger and services. Neo gets revenue from these transactions in the form of GAS.

In the early days of the internet, early 90s, nobody thought it was useful for websites and they didn't think businesses could make money or significant sales online. With crypto, it is the same mindset, currently, but I think the smart money is starting to realize the true utility of this new space that is emerging. Many of the tokens we see are just simple utility or novelty tokens that really are not necessary it seems, and are an easy way to get ""free"" money and funding for a project.. I think Neo can become big soon, the problem to me is with visualizing a future where business are all on the blockchain and using it to facilitate and log their business, but I believe it will happen. These movements are not by chance, especially when you have this many people in the crypto sphere working hard to make things become a reality.

As crypto continues to become bigger and bigger, more people will start to hold crypto, rather than their native country's fiat, and logically, businesses would want to cater to as many people as possible, so they too will start to deal in crypto and even adding their business model onto blockchain platforms, double dipping from the old world, and then new neo world ;).

I admire the Neo teams efforts and what they have achieved thus far. I like that they have many locations across the world, and are pushing for development friendly tools. That is KEY also. Without the ease of tools, no engineer is going to successful build on any crypto platform.. these businesses will have to have developers that know how to do it, not the actual tokens developers, as they will be busy improving the chain. Many tokens out there seem to be cult like, as in, they have their inner circle or unpaid developers picking and choosing how things get done, that seems risky to me, given that there is no real leader ship outside of their inner circle, it seems like a house of cards that could collapse.. so I think Neo is great in regards to being ahead of the curve. Neo seems to be lower in value, because its vision is BIG. And the average crypto investor does not perceive what is coming, they currently view it as a fad and simply a store of value or an easy way to get rich.

I think they have a true edge compared to other crypto platforms or tokens. It seems that Neo can eventually become a thriving platform that generates revenue, but also a great store of value, due to the fact that many businesses would be facilitating their transactions on the platform.

Fit athletic 30, finance professional, ivy-league educated. I'm 6'1 tall, 180lbs, lean. Triathlete and I hit the gym every day. 

You: 18-40, single/married/partnered.. hwp, std free. dont worry about shaved/unshaved.. i love them all

Finally turned 30, new start to a better year (knock on wood).

I'm looking to make you cum in my empty office.

Since COVID is an ongoing issue, my office is actually really empty right now. This probably won't last so I want to milk it as much as possible! 

I know it isn't exactly the norm (other than on this subreddit), I love, love, love eating pussy, and seeing a woman in pleasure is the most attractive thing in the world. 

I have a strong affinity for the female body.. I love everything about it, every curve, every natural scent, taste... 
I pride myself in being patient, working with partners who were previously too nervous to cum.. or willing to let go. Not only do I love feeling the pleasure and intimacy when I'm buried between your legs.. but I also love the wetness.. the amazing, delicious musky scent.. And of course.. the taste..

Sometimes I enjoy it more than sex. And to have you spread your legs and allow me to taste you sounds like heaven to me..

How to make the most out of your Bitcoin holdings,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kw27bm/how_to_make_the_most_out_of_your_bitcoin_holdings/,Metamilian,1,2021-01-13 06:17:45,72,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kw27bm/how_to_make_the_most_out_of_your_bitcoin_holdings/,FINANCE,"For those of you who are new to crypto and just acquired some Bitcoin, here is how you can earn more Bitcoin with your Bitcoin:

# Vaults

**What are vaults?** You can think of them as savings accounts, each with a different strategy to earn you more of what you put it. In vaults you deposit capital to a contract, which takes control of the capital, and uses it typically to put in a liquidity pool, which typically earns returns based on other users trading through that liquidity pool, and through liquidity mining programs where tokens are distributed based on how much liquidity you provide. The vault can then automate the harvesting of those rewards, which in turn can be traded for the same capital you provided, which in turn grows your savings account. You can do everything a vault does manually, but depending on how much capital you provide, you will be better of with a vault because it shares the gas and transaction fees with everyone who deposited into the vault, so in turn you lose out much less from the gas fees you would have to pay if you did everything manually.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the risks?** Well it depends on the vault you choose. Some can be quite risky because they can be affected by the price of the asset changing. Others can be relatively risk-free (aside from smart contract risk), where the funds aren't exposed to risks when the capital changes price. These latter ones are typically recommended if you don't want to be called an 'ape' or a 'degen'.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who creates the vaults?** There are many organisations creating vaults. The first, best, and the most famous one is [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/vaults). And there are other similar ones, like [Harvest](https://harvest.finance/), and [Badger](https://app.badger.finance/), which focuses on Bitcoin vaults.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you use the vaults?** You could visit any of those links above to get started, but if you are unsure on how to proceed, best visit their communities first to get some help (and be careful with folks who DM you first, they are typically scammers).

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the returns?** If we focus only on Bitcoin here, and the relatively low-risk ones that aren't exposed to price volatility risk, the returns you can expect are between 3-30%, depending on where you turn to. One of the highest one I can find right now is the 'Super Sett' which you can find at [Badger](https://app.badger.finance/), that provides at the current time of writing [31% APY](https://app.badger.finance/super-setts), meaning if you put in 1 BTC at the start of the year, you can expect 1.31 BTC at the end of the year, if the APY stays at this level.

To use that vault, you first actually have to go to [Curve Finance](https://www.curve.fi/ren/deposit), deposit BTC into the pool (you can either deposit regular BTC, or if you already have BTC on Ethereum (wBTC, renBTC etc.), you can deposit that, and then you get a Curve liquidity pool token (in this case a token called 'crvRenWBTC'), and this liquidity pool token you deposit on the Badger site.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vaults are pretty great, as someone myself who prefers long-term holding over trading, a vault is a way to put your capital to work without having to micro-manage it, while staying exposed to price appreciation that may happen. You are still exposed to risks though, depending on the vault, and in general smart-contract risks are always relevant, so be careful out there, this is not financial advice."

I find that using more efficient tools (i.e. apps, websites, …) today is significant in dealing with growing demand for our attention. Hence I have shared a few referral links that I frequently use myself and have found overtime, so you don't have to.

&gt;!There may be companies on this list that are not only for UK customers, such as Pynk and Honey. Although I am unsure about others - if any more are accessible please let me know so I can change this.!&lt;

I have made this post with the hope that more people can contribute to this list by sharing the  financial tools they use often in the comments, whether that includes a referral code or not.

Here are the links to the tools I would recommend that include referral codes:

https://preview.redd.it/fklkqs0oigb61.jpg?width=1268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83d9a4b0cb24d4775045ac4a0a4cbe8816f47bcb

On the Christmas day many DeFi users received a luxurious Christmas gift airdropped by 1inch. On the same day, 1inch (1inch.exchange) launched the governance token 1INCH, and generously gave out gifts to a large number of users. As soon as it was released, 1INCH was listed by major trading platforms one after another. That has added vitality to the slightly sluggish DeFi market, leaving cryptocurrency investors a memorable Christmas.

Speaking of 1inch, we need to mention the DEX aggregator. What is a DEX aggregator exactly? What is it for? What’s 1inch? This article will offer more details.

As we all know, DEX trading has many shortcomings. Under the AMM mechanism, transactions will have greater slippage when the liquidity provided by the LP (liquidity provider) is insufficient. What makes things worse is the swap on various DEX has further dispersed the liquidity. Then the DEX aggregator emerged as a response to such problems as the high slippage and too frequent operations.

What is an aggregator? For example, platforms such as Amazon that accommodate different businesses and users or Meituan that serves tens of millions of catering and entertainment businesses. They are aggregators by nature. Among them are also Uber and TikTok.

The DEX aggregator is an indispensable part of the DeFi ecosystem. Decentralized protocols, various types of DEX, and separate transaction currencies can all be provided for users through transaction aggregation applications.

Common DEX aggregators mainly include transaction aggregators and revenue aggregators. The former include those familiar such as 1inch, Matcha, and Meta Mask wallets that have built-in Meta Mask Swap, ParaSwap, Insta Dapp, etc.; The latter are represented by YFI, YFII, Rari Capital, etc.;

There are also stable currency aggregation protocols such as mStable and asset management platforms like Zapper Finance, Zapion, and Debank.

Most transaction aggregators function as price comparison tools that integrate various DEX liquidity and pricing, spot the optimal price from different transaction agreements, and provide users with the best bargain and minimum slippage. Transaction aggregators are generally committed to saving time and money for users. To this end, many of such aggregators run their own price comparison strategies to directly present users with the optimal transaction path, while providing price information of various platforms as a price comparison tool.

In fact, both transaction aggregators and revenue aggregators try to optimize prices and increase revenue for users. DeFi aggregators, in their progress, have played a major role in popularizing DeFi and facilitating users, thus reducing the threshold for many novices.

The 1inch.exchange, the subject of this article, integrates Airswap, Uniswap, Uniswap2, Kyber, Curve, Oasis, 0x, dForce Swap and other DEX protocols, and boasts the largest transaction volume among transaction aggregation applications. Simply put, 1inch acts as a unified portal for the DEX ecosystem. By integrating with various DEX service providers, it allows users to trade with various ERC-20 tokens on different DEXs for the best transaction prices.

1inch, hailed as the leader of DEX aggregators as well as one of the top DeFi projects, has drawn great attention from the crypto market upon its launch.

1inch was founded in June 2019 by two young Russian men. Soon after it was launched, this project was favored by many investors and secured 12 million US dollars in Series A funding, led by Pantera Capital, at the first try. Its backers also include ParaFi Capital, Blockchain Capital, Nima, Capital, and Spartan Capital Securities.

Most DeFi projects under the Ethereum ecosystem suffer high gas costs, which is also a target of criticism. To tackle this problem, 1inch offers a unique solution: lock in the contract when the gas cost is low, and consume the cheap gas when the gas cost is high. The specific principle is as below:

Through the gas refund mechanism of Ethereum, consume gas to generate CHI gastoken and synthesize the storage capacity of the Ethereum sub-contract when the gas fee is low;

When it is time to exchange, it will trigger the burning, except for the transaction, of CHI gastoken. In this case, Ethereum will refund part of the gas consumed by the previous sub-contract for the transaction.

What is the operating process of 1inch?

When a user performs a swap operation on the Ethereum chain on 1inch, 1inch, which aggregates the liquidity of multiple DEX platforms, will automatically calculate the optimal price and a path with the lowest slippage for the transaction.

For example, when a user submits a transaction, the 1inch in the backstage may split the order into multiple sub-transactions. Say, 60% is completed through UniSwap, and the remaining 40% through Sushiswap. When the aggregator finds that the trading pair selected by the user has insufficient liquidity in most DEXs, it may also complete the transaction by bridging.

For the DeFi industry, 1inch once suggested it had helped solve an industry-wide problem: the impermanent loss, that is, the divergent loss. As we all know, the impermanent loss is inevitable in AMM yield farming, and, for arbitrageurs, high slippage creates possibilities of making up for the spread through reverse transactions.

Mooniswap, an automated market maker service launched by 1inch, has improved the design of Uniswap by redistributing part of the arbitrageur’s income to the liquidity pool, thus protecting traders from preemptive trading attacks. Mooniswap takes advantage of the virtual balance to enable the LP to capture the profits obtained by arbitrageurs. In other words, when a high-slippage transaction occurs, it is executed at the previous price, and then the price is updated to the true value according to the pool balance within 5 minutes. At this time, the transaction fee accounts for a higher percentage of the trader’s profit, persuading the arbitrageur into returning most of the price drop to the fund pool.

Compared with DEX such as Uniswap, 1inch can provide better transaction depth and lower transaction slippage, etc. Such an advantage stands out, especially in large transactions.

1INCH, launched on Christmas Day, is a governance and utility token of 1inch, which is used for the platform’s automatic market maker protocol and decentralized transaction aggregator service. With 1INCH tokens, the 1inch network will be managed by DAO. The total supply of 1INCH is 1.5 billion, to be issued and allocated based on rules as below:

(1) 30% of the tokens will be used for network security and functional maintenance, with a 4-year unlocking period (vesting);

(2) 22.5% of the tokens are allocated to the 1inch core team and future employees, with a 4-year unlocking period;

(3) 21% is used for ecosystem development (yield farming, community construction, research, etc.), with a 4-year unlocking period;

(4) 19.5% is allocated to investors and shareholders, with a 2-or-5-year unlocking period;

(5) 5% is allocated to consultants, with a 4-year unlocking period;

(6) 2% is allocated to the early Mooniswap liquidity providers, with a 1-year unlocking period.

Despite its success in solving many problems for the industry and users, 1inch also has shortcomings, say, the relatively high costs due to the more complex calculations introduced to the DeFi aggregator. Yet with the high gas costs on the Ethereum, 1inch users may need to pay even more gas fees for its processing logic such as order splitting and bridging operations.

As an emerging field in the blockchain industry, the DeFi ecosystem is still faced with many problems, and DEX aggregators is just part of the solution. Fortunately, 1inch has seen rapid growth in less than two years since its birth, with its trading volume and user base accumulating all the time. Its governance token that was just launched has also received extensive attention from the crypto market.

1inch CEO Sergej Kunz once said: “With the right community incentives, we see a chance to get a critical mass of liquidity to beat Uniswap.” Currently 1inch’s transaction volume hovers around one-third of Uniswap’s figure, suggesting much room of improvements for it to catch up someday.

Recent graduate feeling completely unprepared for the modern corporate finance career paths. What do I need to learn?,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/kyqfga/recent_graduate_feeling_completely_unprepared_for/,Pookias,1,2021-01-17 04:14:57,11,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/kyqfga/recent_graduate_feeling_completely_unprepared_for/,Education &amp; Certifications,"I recently graduated this December from a small Midwest private school with a Bachelor's in Finance with a 3.8 GPA. I chose Finance as a degree path midway through my chemistry major because I felt unsure of what to do and Finance seemed like the most well-rounded business degree. 

Unfortunately,  I feel as though my school was quite a bit behind the curve with the curriculum in some aspects. Our statistics courses were an absolute joke. Applying for corporate finance roles in the area often ask for experience with Oracle, SQL language, and just general database management. My school put little to no emphasis on this and I had no idea it was becoming such an essential skill in corporate finance. Perhaps this is my fault for not doing more research on what companies were really looking for but it seems as though everyone just throws around buzzwords like Big Data and you're not really sure where it all ends up. 

At the end of the day, the main apps I have experience with is Excel (Office suite in general) and some Power BI experience with a hint of Tableau. I feel like I have heavily underutilized my free time during this pandemic and am struggling to get motivated to pursue that learning while also having a tough time finding jobs.  

My biggest question is what do you guys suggest I need to get up to snuff or really dive deep into to pursue a career in a general corporate finance role (i.e. financial analysis, corporate cash management, etc.)? SQL, Python, Oracle, etc.? What's a good place to start? Would appreciate any advice."
I need your guidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/kyutzn/i_need_your_guidance/,sahej1999,1,2021-01-17 08:08:55,2,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/kyutzn/i_need_your_guidance/,NaN,"Hi all
I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but i feel you all will be able to guide me the best.
I'm a 21 YO working with a KPO company in the financial services sector for the past 2-3 months(first job) 
My company provides all kinds of financial services(ranging from building financial models, research etc to backend monotonous work).
Here the kind of work that you get majorly depends on the client you have been assigned to. In my case, I've been assigned to one of the biggest clients and they mostly send monotonous work our way(Researching and populating excel).
Initially I went through a rigorous training for a month and I will always cherish that period of time as it helped me push through my limits and taught me some invaluable skills.
It is basically a 2 year analyst programme and my day to day working mostly involves research and poplulating excel from the web.
I felt the learning curve has peaked but my manager told me that they'll be assigning the core financial work after a few months when I get more efficient and reliable(maybe after 3-4 months)
I am expected to put in minimum 9-10 hours of work which can easily extend to 12-13 hours.Because of this I don't have a work life balance and this is taking a toll on my mental health.
Also I'm not able to pursue other things I want to do such as trading in the markets, reading books, exploring my creative side and devote time to my business (I have a side business I started a couple of months ago and is going well but I'm not really sure about it being long term thing)
I have asked others for their opinion too if i leave my job and focus on my thing or stay on the job and gather more experience of the corporate life.
Mostly people suggested me to stick around for atleast a year.
So I wanted your opinion should I stick around in order to get higher up the corporate ladder in the field of finance or leave and increase my knowledge and  pursue the things I love?"
VTC is in my top 10 altcoin picks for 2021!,https://www.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/comments/kzcx46/vtc_is_in_my_top_10_altcoin_picks_for_2021/,DU09,1,2021-01-18 03:22:13,21,/r/vertcoin/comments/kzcx46/vtc_is_in_my_top_10_altcoin_picks_for_2021/,NaN,"**Top 10 altcoins picks for your 2021 portfolio**

**Note**: *While I focus on alts in this piece, Bitcoin should already be part of your portfolio. You should have at least 50% of your portfolio in BTC. Don't underestimate it, Bitcoin is the safest and most secure investment in the crypto market. Ignoring that is shortsighted. Make sure you allocate a fair share of BTC in your portfolio. The promise of moon from alts is very tempting, but don't lose yourself to greed.* 

**Top altcoin picks in 2021:**

**1.** **ETH** (runner up: **DOT**). [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) remains one of the best picks in the altcoin market. This is because its market dominance and ecosystem is the envy of most other alts. While there are some scaling challenges for ETH (to be addressed in ETH 2.0), the momentum of its ecosystem - which is best reflected in the emerging [Decentralized Finance/DEFI](https://defipulse.com/) (now valued at $22 billion) - cannot be ignored. [DOT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/) is our runner up, which could be seen as a live and working ETH 2.5. DOT is the 5th largest coin by market cap at the time of this post after an exponential growth in early 2021. This testifies its strong fundamentals.

**2.** **XLM** (runner up: **ADA**). [XLM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/) is consistently the blockchain with the highest average number of transactions (via [coinstats](https://coinstats.network/)) at around 30 mil transactions / week. The news that USDC stable coin will be available on XLM network in early Jan 2021 and that central banks (e.g. Ukraine) piloted their central bank digital currencies using XLM indicates REAL adoption is taking place positioning XLM as one of the leading blockchains for the world’s financial system. XLM having near instant and free transactions makes it even better. [ADA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/) or Cardano boosts a very strong team and in its third phase will focus on smart contracts integration rivaling some of the activities on the ETH DEFI market. I purposely left [XRP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) out because with the SEC lawsuit ongoing, it's best to stay away. 

**3. LINK** (runner up: **GRT**). As a decentralized oracle network solution, [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) is the to-go solution for smart contracts. With DEFI and ETH ecosystems growing exponentially, LINK became a staple of such solutions and with it, its price and market cap made it a top 10 coin. [GRT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-graph/) or the Graph is our runner up as one of the most popular indexing protocol on the ETH ecosystem. Some called it the google of blockchains, indexing blockchain data for real use cases. For this reason it is another go-to solution in the ever expanding ETH ecosystem.

**4. USDC** (runner up: **DAI**). What - a stablecoin? Yes, you need to know your crypto. [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) is positioned to rival [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) market cap in time, seeing a 4x increase in the past few months and being the second most used stablecoin. With Goldman Sachs backed company Circle as the creator of USDC, you can't go wrong here. USDC is your best bet for a centralized, safe, secure and reputable stable coin pegged to the USD. If centralized stablecoins are not your cup of tea, then [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) is definitely for you as a decentralized stablecoin backed by a basket of crypto assets, including PAX Gold! Last time we saw USD backed by gold was in 1971. This is quite unique. You can mint DAI by smartlocking other crypto assets. USDT uncertainty and lack of transparency in their holding will continue to create a market for sound alternatives like USDC and DAI. It's important to mention [BUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/) also gained significant market share as a stablecoin by Binance. 

**5. BNB** (runner up: **FTX**). With Binance being the de facto leader in the crypto exchange market as well as an innovator in the sector, we cannot ignore its coin [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/) which has seen a tremendous growth over time. BNB has many attractive use cases, from trade discounts on the Binance exchange to being the native token on the Binance Chain. With Binance posting a wooping $80 billion in daily trading volume on 4th January 2021, it's hard to ignore the use case/value of BNB. [FTX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/) token comes second here and it is one of the fastest growing exchange tokens, seeing exponential growth, in line with its corresponding exchange volume.

**6. UNI** (runner up: **SUSHI**). DEFI market has seen unparalleled growth and decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/) have pioneered a new way of trading in the ETH ecosystem, whereby automated market makers and liquidity providers get a share of the trading fees plus incentives! Uniswap decentralized exchange is the leader by volume closely followed by Sushiswap. For this reason [UNI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/) and [SUSHI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) \- the tokens of the two decentralized exchanges - make it on our list. Important to also mention Curve as a dedicated decentralized exchange for stablecoins, with [CRV](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/) as its native token. 

**7. SNX** (runner up: **ATOM**). Similarly, [SNX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/) or Synthetix is a derivatives liquidity protocol on Ethereum network. Meaning that you can issue synthetic tokens on its network linked to fiat, crypto or commodities. The possibilities are limitless and you can trade such tokens on the ETH network. To mint synthetic tokens one has to stake SNX - the native token of the network - hence creating demand and accelerating its market price, which exploded with the DEFI market. In this ever expanding market of crypto coins and blockchains, [ATOM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/) or Cosmos comes to clean it up by allowing different blockchains to communicate with each other. Sometimes described as blockchain 3.0 (1.0 being BTC and 2.0 ETH), ATOM is a good candidate for our runner up spot.

**8. LTC** (runner up: **DASH**). If you are after a more agile, faster and cheaper alternative to BTC. [LTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) is your go-to coin or the ""little brother"" of BTC. Litecoin managed to carve itself a niche in the market and has consistently been one of the top coins by market adoption and usage. Whenever BTC or even ETH face congestions on their networks, LTC is a good alternative to move value for a few cents, unless you choose XLM (that one is instant and reason why is at the top of our list). [DASH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/) is our runner up because it has consistently shown sustained volume and adoption across the world with real use cases and a growing list of vendors accepting it as a payment method. 

**9. MRK** (runner up: **AAVE**). Maker or [MKR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/) is the governance token of the MarketDAO that allows users to issue and manage DAI (see above). Considering DAI is one of the most trusted decentralized stablecoins around, MKR should continue to increase in value, especially since its circulating supply is 1 million. With the crypto market set to explode, DAI and MKR will grow tremendously. [AAVE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) is also a decentralized finance protocol that allows users to lend and borrow crypto and includes ""flash loans"" meaning the loan completes in the same transaction without collateral being needed. As an integral part of the DEFI market AAVA makes for a good runner up. 

**10. BCH** (runner up: **VTC**): [BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/) cannot be ignored simply because of its adoption level and market cap. As an alternative to Bitcoin, BCH will continue to remain one of the top 10 altcoins in the foreseeable future, with significant potential to grow further. It is also the 4th largest asset in [Grayscale's](https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Grayscale-One-Pager-January-2021-Final.pdf) massive $20 billion crypto portfolio. As a runner up, we have [VTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vertcoin/) or Vertcoin which I believe will have a great run in this current cycle thanks to its new mining algorithm set to launch at the end of January. VTC has been around since 2014 and is very similar to LTC. At only 20 cents right now, if the past is to be repeated, we may have a beautiful run ahead of us. Plus at the end of this year VTC will have its halving. Mineable coins have fallen out of fashion, however we may have a rebound in interest for such coins in this cycle. 

What do you think about the above list and what are your recommendations for this year?

That’s not too far off from Uniswap’s $3.5bn. The CRV dao token is used for governance and liquidity much like Uniswap token. I think the market cap could reach $2bn soon which would put the price per token at over $10.

Should I leave a good job for 2x the salary but supposedly bad work culture at the new place?,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/kzqdh5/should_i_leave_a_good_job_for_2x_the_salary_but/,rustyalterego,1,2021-01-18 16:08:01,4,/r/careerguidance/comments/kzqdh5/should_i_leave_a_good_job_for_2x_the_salary_but/,Advice,"I freshly graduated out of college and got hired as a senior analyst. It's a really nice company, and I like the team and clients, even though whatever I'm learning is by myself with not a lot of guidance. The pay isn't that good, but I'm not that concerned right now because it's the industry standard for a fresher and I'm staying at home now so am able to save a bit too. eventually ofc, I will earn more. 

Recently I came across another offer in which I will still be an analyst but in finance (right now my work is more marketing based). it seems like a great opportunity to learn because I have very little knowledge about that sector and would like to learn more, also the pay is almost 2x what I'm making now.

The catch is however that all the reviews I found online are very split. a lot of people absolutely hate the company and are sick of how they treat employees. apparently they also have a very high attrition rate and people are fired frequently. some people however, love the work culture and learning curve. the common thing most people seem to agree on is that there are very long hours and demanding work with no comp offs, but I'm okay with that part, everyone goes through that in the start I guess plus I'll get to learn.

Both the companies are of comparable sizes with big clients and international offices, I'll be given the same location too. 

I'm very conflicted about how I should go about it now. At either company, I plan to stay for only a year or two anyway, after which I'll apply for masters. it also doesn't reflect well on the CV for a fresher to be leaving their job only after a couple of months. I'm also worried that what if I leave this good job and am fired or something over no reason when I go there.

What would you guys advice? Is this a risk worth taking or should I stay stable now since opportunities can always come my way? Since I have minimal responsibilites now and they will always increase here forth, maybe now is the time to experiment? Ah, I can decide. Any help?"

I’ve had a really good experience from here a couple weeks ago. 
Looking to repeat!

Also cross-posting this on RAOBJ.

Looking to start my 30s with a bang! 

Here's my [verified pic](https://i.imgur.com/mKfBGak.jpg)

Fit athletic 30, finance professional, ivy-league educated. I'm 6'1 tall, 180lbs, lean. Triathlete and I hit the gym every day. 

You: 18-40, single/married/partnered.. hwp, std free. 

Dont worry about shaved/unshaved.. i love them all and prefer natural tbh.

Finally turned 30, new start to a better year (knock on wood).

I'm looking for someone who wouldn't mind coming to my office and having some fun ;)

Since COVID is an ongoing issue, my office is actually really empty right now. 

I know it isn't exactly the norm (other than on this subreddit), I love, love, love eating pussy, and seeing a woman in pleasure is the most attractive thing in the world. 

I have a strong affinity for the female body.. I love everything about it, every curve, every natural scent, taste... 
I pride myself in being patient, working with partners who were previously too nervous to cum.. or willing to let go. Not only do I love feeling the pleasure and intimacy when I'm buried between your legs.. but I also love the wetness.. the amazing, delicious musky scent.. And of course.. the taste..

Sometimes I enjoy it more than sex. And to have you spread your legs and allow me to taste you sounds like heaven to me.. 

Obviously, I've got more pics to share and verify privately. Please don't be shy. Shoot me a message!"

Why Small Businesses are Outgrowing QuickBooks in 2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bookkeeping_services/comments/l155gf/why_small_businesses_are_outgrowing_quickbooks_in/,Bookkeeping_services,1,2021-01-20 16:33:34,0,/r/u_Bookkeeping_services/comments/l155gf/why_small_businesses_are_outgrowing_quickbooks_in/,NaN,"If you run a small, order-centric business, QuickBooks may be a practical finance and accounting solution. But if your company has recurring revenue or an assortment of billing models, you'll start to note limitations and growing pains as revenue schedules and invoices become amplified. 

https://preview.redd.it/0f01pqft7gc61.jpg?width=1880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6734b9345aa97718b69778e5294b0f493d3e0daf

As your company scales and you're employed with multiple entities, it becomes increasingly important to possess improved financial visibility. 

Having the proper information within the correct format and in real-time is required for achieving a rapid climb. QuickBooks accounting wasn't built to manage that.

**With QuickBooks, you'd be missing out on various benefits that automation could bring, such as:**

* Increasing company valuation with accurate predict for better business intelligence, project management, partner relationship management, and so on.
* Shortening your hour by the maximum amount as 30-75%.
* Freeing cash which will be redirected to investing in core business functionalities.
* Speeding up quote-to-cash cycles.

Apart from performance and speed problems, there are other signs that your business is outgrowing QuickBooks, and it is time to upgrade. 

Inventory and warehouse problems, operational efficiencies, cost, and lack of third-party software integration are among the foremost common reasons why companies leave QuickBooks for specialized finance and accounting solutions.

## Advantages and drawbacks of Using QuickBooks Online:

QuickBooks Online is an accounting solution developed by Intuit and is meant for small and growing companies. QuickBooks became fashionable small business owners who did not have formal finance and accounting training upon its release. 

QuickBooks could boast about ten years ago having a 94% share within the retail unit within the business accounting sector. The corporate then discharge QuickBooks Online as a cloud solution where users pay a monthly subscription fee to use it. 

It's a special product from the QuickBooks online version and offers integration with various third-party software and other financial services.

## Advantages:

Start-up and small business owners typically manage QuickBooks themselves. Otherwise, they need an outsourced person or dedicated in-house staffs that does its [online bookkeeping services](https://bookkeepingproservices.com/service/book-keeping) and [online accounting services](https://bookkeepingproservices.com/). 

**Let's take a glance at how businesses use QuickBooks.**

## 1. Expense tracking and bills

QuickBooks can automatically keep track of the company's expenses and bills. It's done by connecting credit cards and bank accounts to the software. All payments are categorized and downloaded, while other transactions are often recorded within the software directly.

## 1. Payroll

QuickBooks features a payroll feature that automatically calculates and runs payroll for the enterprise. Alongside payroll tax tables, this feature offers the advantage of getting an updated budget.

## 2. Managing company income and sales

QuickBooks allows you to manage income and sales by creating invoices to trace your company's sales. You'll do that individually for each customer, which helps you retain track of what proportion each customer owes.

You'll also check out your customers' assets reports to look at all the small print of past and current due invoices.

## 3. Inventory tracking

QuickBooks can automatically track and update unit costs and amounts of inventory.

## 4. Business reporting

When business owners manage and record cash inflow/outflow activities using QuickBooks, they will generate pre-built reports with a few clicks. Also, the reports are updated in real-time as they enter and save transactions.

## Disadvantages:

According to user feedback, the disadvantages of QuickBooks include:

## 1. Difficult to find out

If you're a beginner, QuickBooks' interface can cause you to feel overwhelmed. There's a learning curve that needs patience and time. 

You'll encounter account-specific jargon that you must be conversant in to know what to try to do (otherwise, you'll feel lost). If you've got enough time to spend watching video tutorials, you'll get the hang of it quickly.

## 2. Limited reports

Some users find that reporting isn't nearly as good in QuickBooks Online because it is within the desktop version. Cleaning up outdated QuickBooks reports is time-consuming, the report builder is restricted, and charts aren't customizable.

## 3. Audit trail loopholes

The audit trail in QuickBooks is one of the first concerns of this software. Business owners and [online accountants](https://bookkeepingproservices.com/) like having an in-depth and well-documented flow of monetary information. This type of monetary visibility allows them to form data-driven, strategic decisions. 

QuickBooks provides an audit trail for much financial information, but there are situations where that information is often changed without leaving any documentation. 

In other words, the software leaves a loophole that would allow an enterprise's financial records to be altered and exploited.

## 4. Upgrade fees

To keep your software up-to-date, there are numerous upgrades that you will need to purchase, and therefore the promotions are pricey. The updates are typically required once a year to receive the foremost up-to-date features and other additional resources.

In many cases, larger enterprises would require a more customizable and adaptable platform. And as companies grow, they're going to demand several special attributes and extra options unique to their needs. 

QuickBooks is restricted therein. There are only a particular number of licenses available, and a growing business may demand greater scalability power in their business accounting software to be as effective as possible. 

The software cannot provide benefits like connected data, process and controls, and increased financial visibility that support your strategic leader's decisions.

But within the case of small businesses and bigger companies that perform uncomplicated accounting tasks, QuickBooks can still be an economical alternative to more robust finance and accounting solutions.

## Signs Your Company Has Outgrown QuickBooks:

Have you outgrown QuickBooks? It all depends on what industry you're in, your company size, and the way quickly your enterprise is growing. QuickBooks may be a great entry-level solution, but it does accompany a myriad of limitations. 

If you've got sights on growth and expansion, it'll not accommodate your company's needs within the long-run. Let's take a glance at a couple of tell-tale signs that your company is outgrowing QuickBooks and why you should move to a more comprehensive outsourced finance and accounting management solution.

## 1. Your ERP requirements extend beyond accounting

You cannot do much with QuickBooks beyond basic accounting processes. If you're using it as a check writer and reporting with Excel, the time has come to go away QuickBooks for a more robust ERP solution. Also, it is time to ditch it if your transaction volume is increasing, and you'll enjoy CRM functions that integrate your processes with those serving your customers.

## 2. You're entering duplicate data into multiple systems

As an enterprise grows, there are increasing volumes of knowledge that it must handle. If your staff is spending time entering data into QuickBooks then re-entering it again into other systems, QuickBooks doesn't contribute to your business efficiency. 

Some solutions update data altogether systems whenever you create a change. That permits you to ascertain the newest financial record or document version, wherever they're entered.

## 3. Spending much time outside QuickBooks

QuickBooks users know that their financials' most in-depth analysis happens in software or a spreadsheet. This unplanned workflow incurs switching costs, and it's likely to make disparate sourced data that eventually become granary. 

If you add on systems or drowning in spreadsheets to urge the work done, you should consolidate all the processes into an all-in-one solution to tighten your processes.

## 4. Your financial numbers are inaccurate

If it's difficult to work out your actual cash balance, or it takes too long to bill your clients, your business has outgrown QuickBooks. If consolidating financial reports from multiple divisions or meeting the new ASC 606 requirement may be a concern, you should consider switching to a singular solution that supports various report formats, multiple currencies, multi-currency transactions, etc.

## 5. Number of users has become a drag 

QuickBooks Enterprise supports up to 40 users, while QuickBooks' license allows up to 25 user licenses. This may suit a growing start-up or small business, but you'll likely need more people to be connected at some point.

It might be best if you had an answer which will be scaled as your enterprise grows to still use a well-known platform without requiring a reimplementation (which is often time-consuming and costly). 

QuickBooks was designed to handle small volumes of knowledge and obtain overwhelmed relatively easily. If the info is getting corrupted, or the software is taking 15-20 minutes to load, you've probably hit its functional limit.

## 6. You would like a multi-location accounting program

QuickBooks has a web version of the software. It's an economical option, but it prohibits any remote work, which is a problem if you ever got to perform daily tasks or access financial information outside the office.

## 7. You would like a full, electronic database export

It isn't easy to import data from receivables, [billing specialist](https://bookkeepingproservices.com/service/payroll), payroll, and other external systems because QuickBooks uses a proprietary database. 

Which will hamper a business because it interferes with transactions and workflows? By switching to a FaaS solution that supports different types of databases (e.g., SAP HANA, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server), you'll better serve your partners and customers.

## 8. Lacking versatility and automation

Automation is that the most sure-fire thanks to affecting accounting tasks associated with payments and billing. However, QuickBooks can automate nothing quite routine transactions. 

The software often breaks down at the size, and errors can occur even when using the foremost basic automation features. Those errors can accumulate into countless wasted work hours and thousands of dollars in fraudulent payments.

## Conclusion:

Are there solutions for a corporation outgrowing QuickBooks? The solution is yes! If you feel you are dalliance on an answer your company has outgrown, it's going to be time to upgrade. 

It's crucial to note the primary signs that your business is outgrowing QuickBooks and make a timely change to at least one of the more integrated and robust accounting and business management software solutions.

QuickBooks is meant as a generic [online accounting services](https://bookkeepingproservices.com/) and bookkeeping platform for a good business and it fulfills its purpose. However, the software lacks the functionality and features that companies got to increase their efficiency, profitability, and scalability. Business owners need a more robust finance and accounting software solution and trustworthy financial management guidance to watch and guide their enterprise's strategic directions."

Quoted from the article:

Blockchain technology meets the insurance industry

The insurance industry has been around for centuries, but unfortunately, its processes are still very much stuck in the past. Many policies are still processed on paper contracts, consumers still call by phone to purchase new policies, the list goes on.

All things that lead to risk-associated steps in which information can be lost, tempered with, and misinterpreted. In fact, almost half of the 143 U.S. insurers surveyed by the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America and FICO said that fraud accounts for five to 10 percent of their claims costs. There’s much left to be desired in terms of security, efficiency and customer satisfaction.

While blockchain is the hopeful solution, it won’t come without its obstacles. Insurance companies must overcome regulatory and legal hurdles before fully embracing blockchain technology. There are a number of blockchain features that could be inconsistent with current insurance laws. For example, personal customer data and their policy information residing on blockchain must comply with existing privacy and data protection regulations. In addition, decentralization strengthens information sharing and reduces advantages that information asymmetry provides. This provides new challenges for management in pricing, product development, claims services and more.

Coverage for smart contracts has never been more important than now with the explosion of yield farming. However, current providers have limited capacity and/or unaffordable prices leaving most participants uncovered.

Cover Protocol provides peer to peer coverage with fungible tokens. It lets the market set coverage prices as opposed to a bonding curve.

The process starts when market makers (MMs) deposit collateral to cover a product. MMs will receive two types of fungible cover tokens in exchange for their deposit. MMs can choose to sell the fungible token(s) to earn a premium, or provide liquidity in Balancer pools with the fungible token(s) and earn fees. Coverage seekers can then buy the coverage they need.

Cover Protocol allows DeFi users to be protected against smart contract risk. It stabilizes the turbulent DeFi space by instilling confidence and trust between protocols and their users. By bridging the gap between decentralized finance and traditional finance, Cover Protocol will open the doors of DeFi to all investors.

The long term vision for Cover Protocol is to allow anyone to buy coverage on anything.

From this article:

Until recently, Nexus Mutual users have only been able to secure coverage for smart contracts. While this has enabled various DeFi assets to be covered, it has left an enormous pool of capital on exchanges vulnerable to attack.

Insured Finance is an upcoming insurance solution that will allow its users to secure comprehensive coverage on their digital asset holdings. Built on the Polkadot blockchain, Insured Finance provides a marketplace where token holders can request customized insurance for their unique digital asset portfolio.

One area which may be concerning to users is the concentration of funds in the Nexus Mutual liquidity pool. When Nexus Mutual members stake against an asset to provide collateral for claims, these funds are gathered in the Nexus Mutual liquidity pool. With liquidity concentrated in one location, the risk of failure is high. Insured Finance addresses potential security risks in their platform by storing the collateralization for each claim in a separate contract. By distributing liquidity, this approach brings the risk of failure close to zero and protects the collateralization behind claims.

For the most part, I have been playing around with different sub-genres like credit cards, stocks, crypto, etc... So I seem to have come across one specific niche that has really stuck with my channel. The analytics for these specific videos are crazy, where the views data essential mimics an exponential growth curve. Essentially, the further I get from the publish date the more daily views they gain. This is the opposite of my other videos that usually stall out after 4-5 days.  Now you're probably saying that great, why is this a problem? Well, there is a limit to how many videos I can make, as they are essentially product reviews. So at some point (probably 4-5 months), I will run out of products to review.

So should I just go all in and capitalize on the short term success until I run out? Or should I just drop one between other videos to drag out the time horizon?  I am really torn so any help would be very much appreciated."

Curve DAO has trippled since Jan 2021 thanks to Yearn.finance collaboration,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurveDAOToken/comments/l38epx/curve_dao_has_trippled_since_jan_2021_thanks_to/,bootyrockrock,1,2021-01-23 16:28:23,1,/r/CurveDAOToken/comments/l38epx/curve_dao_has_trippled_since_jan_2021_thanks_to/,NaN,"CRV is the governance token for Curve Finance. It implemented a complex time-based staking system to exchange CRV into veCRV, where veCRV is an internal token intended for governance purpose and has a right to claim the cash flows generated by the protocol. 
1 CRV locked for 4 years = 1veCRV
1 CRV locked for 3 years = 0.75veCRV
1 CRV locked for 2 years = 0.50veCRV
1 CRV locked for 1 year = 0.25veCRV
Curve Finance conducted one of the biggest retroactive token airdrops on 14 August 2020 to reward early users, with a vesting period up to 4 years. It intends to have yield farming for all of its pool, with the reward weightage voted by the veCRV holders. 
Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol’s native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. 
Yield farmers will have to constantly monitor their veCRV power to get the maximum payout from the yield farming exercise as veCRV decays with time. There is a calculator built that shows this in detail. For further information do refer to the official documentation"
Introducing the Omniscient Option Writer’s Model (OOWM) to you. I'd like your opinions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3g43k/introducing_the_omniscient_option_writers_model/,OOWMPP,1,2021-01-24 01:13:44,39,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3g43k/introducing_the_omniscient_option_writers_model/,Discussion,"**THIS MESSAGE WAS WRITTEN ON JANUARY 2018.**

Howdy folks, 

First of all, I apologize about the poor formatting here. If anyone wants my spreadsheets which comes with the equations and algorithms in the proper cell, I'll be happy to share it with you, but only if you're an academic or institutional investor. I'd love to get your insights and thoughts about this offline if you're an academic or an institutional investor.  

I a developing a math model for stocks based on the entire universe of calls and puts which expire on January 2018. My assumptions in developing this model, which I call the Omniscient Option Writer’s Model (OOWM), are the following:
1.	The options writers are the smartest investors. They’re like a Supercomputing Godhead.  
2.	If a person were to buy the entire calls/puts for a stock whose expiration date is on January 19th, 2018, there is a range of stock prices that this Universal Options Investor (UOI) would profit. Note, that the motives of the OOW and the UOI are opposing. 
3.	There is a stock price where the UOI would make the least money, and this coincides with the OOW making their greatest profit. This stock price which maximizes the OOW is, imaginatively, called the OOW’s Max Profit Price, OOWMPP.
4.	Conversely, there is a stock price that the UOI would make the most money, and this coincides with the OOW losing the most money.
5.	I’m assuming that the future movement of the stock is based on the OOW Stock Price. So another words, today’s stock price will converge to the OOWMPP on Friday, January 19th, 2018.

To determine the OOWMPP, I must net the entire universe of calls and puts which expire next January 19th. From experience, this requires an iterative algorithm. But just to give you an idea of how I determine the OOWMPP for a stock like AAPL, we will look at the entire options for AAPL. These strike prices for the calls/options are all found here: https://www.google.com/finance/option_chain?q=NASDAQ%3AAAPL&amp;ei=FgDXWPHFIoaa2AbhtY_gAQ

Here is the source code that I used in MS Excel to determine the gains/losses of a call option for a given price. 

This would be placed in H6: =$G6*(IF(H$1&lt; $A6, (-1*$B6), -$B6-$A6+H$1))

H$1 – the stock’s price that we’re testing to determine the OOWMPP
$A6 – Strike Price. 
$B6 – Price of this option.
H$6 – the TOTAL gains/losses if you were to own every single one of these calls based on the stock price that we’re testing from H$1. 
$G6 – Contains the number of Open Interests for this particular option price with strike price located at $a6

Similarly, here is the source code that I used in MS Excel to determine the gains/losses of a put option for a given price. 

This would be placed in H101 = $G101*(IF(H$1&gt;$A101,(-1*$B101),(-1*$B101-H$1+$A101)))


H$1 – the stock’s price that we’re testing to determine the OOWMPP
$A101 – Strike Price. 
$B101 – Price of this option.
H$1 – the TOTAL gains/losses if you were to own every single one of these puts based on the stock price that we’re testing from H$1. 
$G101 – Contains the number of Open Interests for this particular option price with strike price located at $A101

I do this for the entire calls and puts. I graph the total gains/losses VS the stock price for the OOW. For AAPL with a stock price on $139.04, here are the data points to give you an idea of what the curve looks like:

Stock Price
$0
$10
$20
$30
$40
$50
$60
$70
$80
$90
$100
$110
$120
$130
$140
$150
$160
$170
$180
$190
$200


Here is the total gains for each stock price if you’re interested in seeing this curve yourself. 
Total Gains
-$33,005,172
-$28,050,362
-$23,095,552
-$18,140,742
-$13,185,932
-$8,269,550
-$3,511,425
$1,016,960
$5,252,510
$8,939,673
$11,256,440
$11,523,520
$10,565,730
$8,012,385
$4,188,220
-$864,925
-$6,574,400
-$12,523,505
-$18,707,900
-$25,079,490
-$31,451,080

If you graph this, you’ll see that this curve has an apogee (a maximum), and that it intersects the X-axis twice. The points where it intersects the X-axis represents the stock prices where the OOW breaks even. 

The two stock prices where the OOW breaks even are exactly: 
First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32

So another words, the OOW would only make money if the AAPL were priced between $67.73 - $148.32. 

In order to determine the MAXIMUM profit and the OOWMPP at which the maximum profit occurs, we see based on these data points that the OOWMPP occurs at around $110. When I “zoom in” on this model and test prices from $100-$120 using a $1 increment instead of a $10 increment, I see, once again, that the OOWMPP is at $110. As a matter of fact, when I superfine tune this and use a $0.01 resolution, I see that the OOWMPP is EXACTLY $110. 

First $0 Gains stock price  - $67.73
Second $0 Gains stock price - $148.32
OOWMPP - $110.00
 

**THIS MESSAGE WAS WRITTEN ON JANUARY 23RD, 2021.**  Is there any merits or value in my math model?"
To all the college students who are thinking about majoring in finance...,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/l4div2/to_all_the_college_students_who_are_thinking/,Lower-Statistician-8,1,2021-01-25 10:12:02,0,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/l4div2/to_all_the_college_students_who_are_thinking/,NaN,"Just to give you all some quick advice.
I have a B.S. and an M.S. in Finance. If I were to go back and do it all over again, I would major in either math, stats, computer science, physics or engineering. This type of quant degree offers a lot more flexibility. If you are not 100% sure about finance, you can go work in the quant field. But, if you wanted to work in finance, the option is wide open for quantitative majors. While a degree in finance has its place, the material you learn can 100% be taught on the job. I truly believe fundamental jobs like finance and accounting will not be everlasting in the coming years. The world is becoming more quantitative by the minute, and people need to adapt or your job will be replaced. Think of it this way:

Quant degree —&gt; Quant OR Finance Career
Finance degree —&gt; Finance Career

As for me, I’m currently prepping for a Ph.D. in finance. And what am I doing? Self teaching myself multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, and programming. Man, if only I learned this during my undergraduate degree, life would be so much easier...

I’m not telling you to get a quant degree so you can go get a Ph.D like me. What I am saying is that the quantitative and programming skill set has a much higher learning curve, and you will be thankful you learned these skills early on in a quant degree. The finance knowledge can be learned on the job, along with some reading of investopedia.

Do yourself a favor and get the quant degree. It has a greater return on investment and gives you more flexibility when choosing a career.

Cheers."

Why CRV is one of the most undervalued coins in DeFi right now. Price target: $5+,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/l7dwxy/why_crv_is_one_of_the_most_undervalued_coins_in/,zeroknowledgeproofs,1,2021-01-29 08:30:59,1,/r/ethtrader/comments/l7dwxy/why_crv_is_one_of_the_most_undervalued_coins_in/,Discussion,"Not sure if anyone has seen what’s been going on in the DeFi space but Uniswap has gone from $2 to $16 in just a month or so. There is currently still plenty of opportunities to make serious cash in this market. 

Curve Finance is currently very undervalued. 


Why am I bullish on CRV? 

Right now Uniswap is the number 1 DEX (Decentralized Exchange) but this won’t last long in my opinion due to what Curve Finance offers. At the moment they are not a direct competitor to Uniswap as they are just a stablecoin DEX. However over the coming months they plan on adding Cryptocurrency Pools for Crypto pairs, which would make them a direct competitor to Uniswap. They already have a better algorithm that provides traders less slippage when trading in and out of stablecoins. Uniswap has horrible slippage. 

Once Curve Finance adds liquidity for other ERC20 coins, and applies the same algorithm they are using now for stablecoins to those swaps, it will provide traders a better option for trading on a DEX with far less slippage than Uniswap for all ERC20 pairs.

CRV already has surpassed Uniswap in total value locked in the system. So it’s only a matter of time before price catches up."

Crypto's as currencies is a very outdated way of thinking.

Only the wise succeed in crypto.

Concentrating capital into a short squeeze was just an passing opportunity on GME. It is not an reliable investment strategy.

You will get you rekt in the long term if you don't update your mental models.
