The burn on MKR has me salivating and it's just good for the ecosystem. 

Is any complex analysis done (actuarial probabilitys, game theory, whatever; or is it just when the big dogs feel like raising it based on get check feeling?

Bought to load up in MKR and just curious. 

Also probably irrelevant but I'm an actuary by trade so happy to do some risk assessment. Peace"

As a savvy but non-technical evangelist and follower of the Ethereum ecosystem for 4+ years (meaning, I generally ""get it,"" though certain technical aspects can fly over my head at times), I don't need an ELI5 on stablecoins nor on Dai. However, I do feel as though I am missing something. Is it as simple as: there will be as many stablecoins as the market demands? That markets love variety, and if these coins offer different savings rates, governance etc., end users will flow toward those where they find value? Or will network effects necessitate a flow toward a single superior coin?

Put another way: (aside from being a crypto purist who is wary of legacy institutions -- sure, a reason in and of itself, but let's put that aside for now) why would one elect to hold Dai over USDC? What about Dai vs. DeFiDollar? Etc. etc.

"Excellent report on DeFi, highlighting Maker, from St. Louis Fed",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/lfv9fm/excellent_report_on_defi_highlighting_maker_from/,scottrepreneur,1,2021-02-09 13:11:01,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/lfv9fm/excellent_report_on_defi_highlighting_maker_from/,NaN,"&gt; To illustrate the concept, let us use the example of MakerDAO, a decentralized protocol that is used to issue the USD-pegged Dai stablecoin. First, the user deposits ETH in a smart contract classified as a collateralized debt position (CDP) (or vault). Subsequently, they call a contract function to create and withdraw a certain number of Dai and thereby lock the collateral. This process currently requires a minimum collateralization ratio of 150 percent, meaning that for any 100 USD of ETH locked up in the contract, the user can create at most 66.66 Dai.6 
&gt; 
&gt; Any outstanding Dai is subject to a stability fee, which in theory should correspond to the Dai debt market's maximum interest rate. This rate is set by the community, namely the MKR token holders. MKR is the governance token for the MakerDAO project. As shown in Figure 3, the stability fee has been fluctuating wildly between 0 and 20 percent. 
&gt;
&gt; To close a CDP, the owner must send the outstanding Dai plus the accumulated interest to the contract. The smart contract will allow the owner to withdraw their collateral once the debt is repaid. If the borrower fails to repay the debt, or if the collateral's value falls below the 150 percent threshold, where the full collateralization of the loan is at risk, the smart contract will start to liquidate the collateral at a potentially discounted rate.
&gt; 
&gt; Interest payments and liquidation fees are partially used to ""burn"" MKR, thereby decreasing the total MKR supply. In exchange, MKR holders assume the residual risk of extreme negative ETH price shocks, which may lead to a situation in which the collateral is insufficient to maintain the USD peg. In this case, new MKR will be created and sold at a discounted rate. As such, MKR holders have skin in the game, and it should be in their best interest to maintain a healthy system.
&gt; 
&gt; It is important to mention that the MakerDAO system is much more complicated than what is described here. Although the system is mostly decentralized, it is reliant on price oracles, which introduce some dependencies, as discussed in Section 3.2. 
&gt; 
&gt; MakerDAO has recently switched to a multi-collateral system, with the goal to make the protocol more scalable by allowing a variety of cryptoassets to be used as collateral. 
&gt;
&gt; [cont'd]
&gt; 
&gt; There is a large variety of lending protocols. Some of the most popular ones are Aave (Boado, 2020), Compound (Leshner and Hayes, 2019), and dYdX (Juliano, 2017). Figure 5 shows the asset-weighted borrowing and lending rates for Dai and ETH. For Dai, the figure also includes the MakerDAO stability fee, which should always be the highest rate in the system. Surprisingly, this is not always the case, meaning that some people have paid a price premium in the secondary market. As of September 2020, Dai accounts for almost 75 percent of all loans in the DeFi ecosystem.

My initial aim was Ethereum, but having looked around and researched I am very interested in mkr, and having seen them move quite directly with each other (and I understand vaguely how mkr works) I have decided to invest in a couple of mkr coins/tokens. 

I'm not trying to trade or anything like that, I'm 40 yrs old and run my own business so I'm looking at it as a kind of retirement investment but I'm also interested in crypto as a whole. I plan to invest more, and also I have small amounts in ada and bnb, and I'm looking to expand my portfolio. I'm not about to put my life savings (not that I have any) into it, but just want to see where it goes over the next 5-10 years.

My question really is yfi and how it is valued so much higher when mkr has a higher cap and volumes etc. Its quite remarkable how little mkr is talked about. And also where could mkr end up? 

Also any advice is very welcome, thanks in advance...."

\---------------------------  
As I can see, you have sent MKR over a BSC network - [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x201239612ea27052aeb579c814dcb16fbe473bc58918c8a309777f7fe0e2e16b](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x201239612ea27052aeb579c814dcb16fbe473bc58918c8a309777f7fe0e2e16b). Atomic Wallet does not support BSC network, so MKR cannot be reflected on your wallet's balance.

In order to access your MKR, you can import your ETH private key to MetaMask. Here are the articles that can be useful regarding your problem:

1. [How to import Atomic Wallet private keys to Metamask?](https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/138-how-to-import-atomic-wallet-private-keys-to-metamask)  
2. [How to connect Metamask to the BSC network?](https://medium.com/@spartanprotocol/connecting-metamask-to-bsc-mainnet-23e434bc670f)  
\---------------------------  
I have gone through both guides and completed the first one and went on second one but when it comes to the SECTION ""BEP2 &lt;-&gt; BEP20 Bridge"" I am at a loss.

I would appreciate if someone explains to me how to proceed after that since it starts talking about connecting with a smart contract which I am not familiar with.

It would be ideal if there was a web wallet that already has these connections and bridges available so I can import my ehtereum private key or something else and access the coins ...

From the bottom link I was intrigued to see, if the revenue generated from Dai issuance was somewhat correlated to the MKR price since it is the source of the buy n' burn.  


According to the related pic, which is a screenshot from Makerburn. Then the two increases in Dai supply and MKR/USD seem to correlate. If that tells us that the marked believe that: 2b dai make MKR approx 2500USD worth and the two lines continue to correlate, then I believe we have a bright future ahead of us.

Note that it ""only"" took around 3 months to issue 1 billion additional Dai (from 1 til 2). And we have generated 7% of the next billion in just four days.

im in the UK so my life is billed in GBP, theres been around a 10% drop in the USD/GBP rate over the last year. I think it may get back to 1.50 dollars to the pound, heck before 2008 credit crunch i could get nearly 2 dollars to the pound it might even recover that high. the feds money go brrr has to have an effect eventually

dollar against the thai baht is bellow 30, never seen it that low, I lived in thailand for a few years and it was always around 33-36 level so this is global

for these reasons I wouldnt be interested in holding DAI, or any dollar stable coin for that matter, at the moment

time to start thinking about a peg to SDR?"

Why use Dai over USDC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/lqz30b/why_use_dai_over_usdc/,omise_hoe,29,2021-02-24 09:06:24,44,/r/MakerDAO/comments/lqz30b/why_use_dai_over_usdc/,NaN,"About a year ago I would only use Dai when I needed a stablecoin. Multi collateral Dai went live, and I reluctantly converted my Sai to Dai as I saw more dapps phasing out support for Sai.

Now that USDC is usable as collateral in a CDP, why even bother with Dai? If a stablecoin is being backed by a centralized stablecoin, what benefit is there to me paying a slight premium (usually) and fees to get Dai?"

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's the right place, but I have a small issues with the MakerDAO app: After been liquidated, I am trying to claim the remaining collateral. Unfortunately, after signing it successfully, the TX is never broadcast to the network, your app gives the error ""Claiming collateral failed"". I can click on a link to the etherscan TXID which doesn't exist, indicating that the tx is never properly broadcast or rejected every time.

&amp;#x200B;

My collateral is 3.849 AAVE if that helps

Thanks in advance to anyone that can help :)"

Maker would still have the advantage of the vault system against a CBDC. Maker also has the decentralized advantage because Dai is not “freezeable” like a federal programmable money would almost certainly be. I guess the DSR would have to compete rather directly against treasury yields? Does a dollar peg still make sense if there is a CBDC readily available? 
I’m curious what happens to all the dollar stablecoins not just Dai when this happens. Maybe it just gets thrown into Curve pools and there is no big deal or maybe it disrupts?"

I started using defisaver, and a few new transactions were made, but I can't figure out how to get a good new csv file.  The one I had in there didn't account for my DAI liability, anyway.  Downloading one for the erc-20 transactions of the contract gives me an accurate ETH balance, but it doesn't include any of the gas and fees (which we all know are significant these days).  

So anyway, back to the title. What is the best way to get a .csv of my vault activity?"
