* Apricot Finance is the first DeFi project on Solana to do the lending-and-borrowing service.üí∞

* Any new features?ü§î
* üôãOrderbook-based fixed rate loans (unsure about the tech behind, still seeking for answer from their Discord)
* ‚úäClose to zero collateral loans (Keeping an eye on this! It will save a lot if it actually works!)
* A humongous and supportive community with over 25k members on their discord channel (Disclaimer: I am one of them)
* What makes Apricot so special? üåª
* It has a very experienced team with over 20+ developers and managers in the team. They have spent over a year on this project by surviving through various market conditions and overcoming many obstacles. They are working actively on new features to push the project one step ahead of other borrowing-and-lending projects.

Compound (COMP) review // Trading guide // Topic - Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/pc6xq8/compound_comp_review_trading_guide_topic_education/,SevenB_roker,1,2021-08-27 03:44:12,2,/r/Compound/comments/pc6xq8/compound_comp_review_trading_guide_topic_education/,NaN,"## What is Compound (COMP)?¬†

[Compound](https://sevenb.io/currencies/compound) (COMP) ‚Äì is a lending platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. With help of this platform, users can deposit cryptocurrencies and earn interest, or borrow assets by depositing collateral. The protocol is managed by smart contracts, which provides a high level of automation and security of financial transactions.

Unlike direct lending platforms, Compound does not have direct interaction between users, but has a common pool of liquidity. It is a market through which funds are available for borrowing. When you provide assets to the protocol, your balance is displayed in the form of cTokens. Each participant of the network can borrow and take cryptocurrency at interest. Interest rates are a function of the liquidity available in each market, and fluctuate in real time depending on supply and demand, and the more the token is demanded, the more the lender can earn.

## Why should I trade Compound?¬†

At the moment, we can safely say that the prospects for profitable COMP trading are extremely optimistic for the following reasons:

1. The demand for DeFi services is growing exponentially. Compound, as a prominent player in the DeFi industry, has a great chance of prosperity. The project was the first in DeFi to reach a Total Locked Value of 10 billion.¬†
2. Looking at the COMP price chart, we can note an obvious increase. Analysts from DigitalCoin and Wallet Investor consider COMP a good long-term investment.

On August 19, 2021, the price of the COMP coin is approximately $451.95. The market capitalization reaches $2,481,915,663. The minimum price of the asset on June 18, 2020 reached approximately $61. The maximum price was set on May 12, 2021 and amounted to $911.20.

### What to know before exchanging Compound?¬†

Cryptocurrency exchange is one of the simplest actions, but there are still a number of recommendations for those who want to do it safely and without losses:

1. Make sure that you have made the right choice of the exchange platform. Study the reviews about the service on third-party resources.
2. Make sure that you are familiar with the service fees. Compare the exchange rate of several sites.
3. Make sure that the service supports the cryptocurrency and exchange pair you need.
4. Make sure that you entered the recipient‚Äôs address correctly.

COMP is a native token of the Compound network with the following use cases:

* Decentralized protocol management. COMP holders have the right to vote for the proposed changes and propose them themselves.
* COMP is automatically distributed among users interacting with the platform: depositing funds into the pool, loans, and so on.

We are a research collective working with Kevin Werbach (UPenn), Primavera de Filippi (Harvard/CNRS), and Gina Pieters (UChicago) on an industry-wide survey of blockchain governance, and we‚Äôd like to ask Compound to participate. Since Compound is collectively-governed, we‚Äôd love to see a wiki-style response from the community itself! I‚Äôve created a stub response in this Google doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcRxYEcX78wrGjQXgUUzQ03Tjtf4KcZIx4G6sfyw0Rc/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcRxYEcX78wrGjQXgUUzQ03Tjtf4KcZIx4G6sfyw0Rc/edit#). Please help us fill it out‚Äîit could be as simple as dropping a few links or summarizing a few key governance posts from this forum!  Participating in the assessment will help the community better understand Compound‚Äôs governance and how it compares with other major blockchain projects (especially important because a lot of other blockchains have forked Compound‚Äôs governance), and help make governance better and more transparent for the entire ecosystem. All data and analysis will be made public at the end of the assessment period.  If you‚Äôd like to see what a completed assessment looks like, you can see a bunch of examples here [https://cryptogov.net/participating-projects/](https://cryptogov.net/participating-projects/) from projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Uniswap, Tezos, etc.  Feel free to hit me with questions or to use this thread for discussions."
