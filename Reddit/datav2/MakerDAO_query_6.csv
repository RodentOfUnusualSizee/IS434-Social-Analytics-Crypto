Community members integrate play-to-earn features into Dark Forest game,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALT_Heads/comments/npv15h/community_members_integrate_playtoearn_features/,BairakaDV,1,2021-06-01 22:16:03,0,/r/ALT_Heads/comments/npv15h/community_members_integrate_playtoearn_features/,Information,"Dark Forest is a real-time strategy space-conquest game where players discover and capture planets in an infinite, procedurally-generated, cryptographic universe.
It has been built on Ethereum using zk-SNARKs to provide zero-knowledge proofs. The cryptography secures the hashes that are created to represent planet locations in the smart contract.

Broadcast Market has been developed by Project Sophon, allowing gamers to reveal the location of any planet in the Dark Forest universe once every 24 hours. Competitive players need more than a single planet broadcasted, so users can now earn xDAI just by broadcasting a planet for another player, the website explained.

xDAI is a derivative of the MakerDAO stablecoin DAI, hosted on an Ethereum layer-two sidechain under the same name, offering high-speed and low-cost transactions. Project Sophon stated that they would take a 20% listing fee, paid by the creators of Broadcast Requests, for posting on the Broadcast Market."

&amp;#x200B;

i've been a part of this community for quite some time now and as we grow bigger and bigger I see people falling into the same mistakes EVERY TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

so if you are reading this I assume you already know what DeFi is and how it works, you probably heard of MakerDAO, Aave and Cake.

&amp;#x200B;

and you probably heard of this ""new token"" that is the ""next big thing"" and that yields you 100000% APY and you assume, HOLY COW! I found gold!

&amp;#x200B;

you do all the necessary safety checks and it all checks out, they have a reputable team, they are doxxed, they are audited, so you decide: I'm going to go all in in this!

&amp;#x200B;

and you put a fair amount of cash in their house token, say 1k dollars, in 1 day you realize you have earned 100 dollars! this is it, the cash is literally in your account, you just earned 10% in 24h, so you do the logical thing and you invest way more

&amp;#x200B;

the next day you see that the value of the token has dropped a little and you think ""oh the market is sideways its nothing to worry about, it'll come back"" and the next day it drops even more.

&amp;#x200B;

when you see its been 10 days, you have earned 300 dollars and your original 1000 are now 400 dollars. so you literally lost money.

&amp;#x200B;

""how did this happen?"" you pounder to yourself, but the answer is quite simple and its called the ""inflation problem"".

&amp;#x200B;

remember those guys in the news talking about this inflation thing that you never really understood? yeah well, inflation happens when the supply of something rises more then the demand for such thing making its value go down.

&amp;#x200B;

in DeFi, when you are staking the house token and earning the same token, you are literally making new tokens that were not in circulation before, if the token has a high demand that is not an issue as people are willing to pay for that, but the thing is that with time the demand decreases and the sell power increases, causing inflation and losing value.

&amp;#x200B;

so DON'T get all excited to see some crazy numbers, they might not be a scam but they may lose value very quickly."
Borrowing using Crypto as Collateral: My Experiences and Findings,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/nrcvna/borrowing_using_crypto_as_collateral_my/,zucchini_fries,1,2021-06-03 20:57:33,30,/r/defi/comments/nrcvna/borrowing_using_crypto_as_collateral_my/,NaN,"As tax day in the U.S (5/17) quickly crept up on me, I found myself in a predicament: I was crypto rich but cash poor and did not have enough dollars to pay my taxes. This led me to doing research on how to borrow using crypto as collateral for I was trying to avoid selling crypto to pay taxes, which in turn would trigger more taxes.  Here are my findings below:

Since crypto is an extremely volatile asset and there is no yet established credit system in the crypto lending space, meaning crypto-backed loans are all over-collateralized. Most cases, the Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) ranges from 20%-50%. LTV = Loan Amount/Collateral Value. So to borrow 10k with a loan with LTV value at 50%, you would need to put up 20k in crypto value as collateral. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BlockFi**: Custodial crypto company which offers services including trading, borrowing and earning interest on crypto deposits. 

Loan: 10k minimum loan, acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETC, LTC, and PAXG, only allows monthly payments for interest (monthly payments are much lower but you will owe entire principal at the end), collateral must maintain 70% of value or will require more collateral 

Rates:

LTV: 20%, Interest Rate: 4.50% (Only available with BTC)

LTV: 35%; Interest Rate: 7.90% 

LTV: 50%; Interest Rate: 9.75% 

Pros: 

\-Loan direct deposit into bank account

\-No protocol hack risk

Cons: 

\-Limited cryptos accepted as collateral 

\-KYC 

\- Legally binding contract for loan, must adhere to BlockFi’s terms 

&amp;#x200B;

**Salt Lending**: Founded in 2016, Salt was one of the first companies to introduce crypto-backed lending. Salt currently offers institutional-grade crypto custody and blockchain monitoring products as well. 

Loan: 5k minimum, 1m max; acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, SALT, Paxos, USDC, TrueUSD, PAXG, 3-12 month loan duration, option to pay interest only or principal and interest, ability to redeem SALT tokens to lower interest rates (SALT currently \~30c)

Rates:

LTV: 30%, Interest Rate: 2.95% - 4.95% (2.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 40%, Interest Rate: 5.95% - 7.95% (5.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 10.95% - 12.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 60%, Interest Rate: 15.95% - 17.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

Pros: 

\-more reasonable rates with the SALT redemption 

\-loan direct deposit into bank account

\-no protocol hack risk

Cons:

\-availability varies (really only available in the US. Outside US, Canada, UK and Australia are business only; Brazil, HK, New Zealand, UAE and Switzerland for individuals and business) 

\-KYC

\-must accept Salt’s terms and conditions 

&amp;#x200B;

**Celsius Network**: FinTech platform that offers interest-bearing savings accounts, borrowing, and payments with digital and fiat assets. 

Loan: $500 minimum to borrow stablecoins ($25k minimum for fiat except in NY and TX where min is $500); over 35 acceptable forms of collateral; 6 months to 3 year loan duration; monthly payments on interest only

Rates:

LTV: 25%, Interest Rate: 1.00% (.95% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 33%, Interest Rate: 6.95% (6.60% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 8.95% (8.50% if you pay with CEL token)

Pros:

\-wider array of collateral accepted 

\-longer loan duration

\-lower min for stablecoin loan

Cons:

\-more KYC than other platforms (Government ID, Address, Tax ID)

\-primarily a phone app (can only borrow via phone app)

&amp;#x200B;

**MakerDAO/Oasis**: Autonomous protocol built on ETH blockchain that allows anyone to open up a smart contract/vault to deposit collateral and generate DAI. 

https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/MakerDAO

Loan: 5,000 DAI minimum (dust limit); wide range of ERC-20 tokens can be used as collateral (including LP tokens), no duration limit (in order to access collateral again, required to deposit DAI) 

Rates: 

Stability fee (interest rate) ranges depending on the token used. Balancer stability fee is 2.00%, AAVE is 3.00%, ETH is 5.00%. Most stability fees are 5.00%. Liquidation Fee is 13.00%. Non-stablecoin minimum collateralization ratio is around 150% (LTV of 66.7%) but that will risk liquidation for even slight down movement. Recommended collateralization ratio is 200%-300% (LTV of 33%-50%) 

Pros:

\-fully decentralized, No KYC, no restrictions 

\-wide range of collateral including some uniswap liquidity token

\-very competitive rates, fully flexible 

Cons: 

\-entirely up to the individual to understand and learn the process

\-if vault falls under liquidation ratio, it will automatically get liquidated so individual must be aware

\-gas fees on ETH network ( much more reasonable now) 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I did not end up borrowing, I am a fan of MakerDAO as an option. Not only are you getting very competitive rates, but also getting more flexibility and are contributing to the shift towards decentralization of finance. At its core, cryptocurrency is about financial freedom and empowerment through decentralization from traditional financial institutions, and MakerDAO encapsulates this. 

Please do not treat this as financial advice, but rather a starting grounds for your own research and DD for the best option for yourself. I hope this gives people a good overview of borrowing using crypto as collateral."

Although I did not end up borrowing, I am a fan of MakerDAO as an option. Not only are you getting very competitive rates, but also getting more flexibility and are contributing to the shift towards decentralization of finance. At its core, cryptocurrency is about financial freedom and empowerment through decentralization from traditional financial institutions, and MakerDAO encapsulates this. 

Please do not treat this as financial advice, but rather a starting grounds for your own research and DD for the best option for yourself. I hope this gives people a good overview of borrowing using crypto as collateral."
eGold Backed Stable Coins Come To The Elrond Network Via OIN Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/eGLD/comments/nrgh1o/egold_backed_stable_coins_come_to_the_elrond/,AllenOneDC,1,2021-06-03 23:41:22,5,/r/eGLD/comments/nrgh1o/egold_backed_stable_coins_come_to_the_elrond/,Announcement ,"One of the biggest catalysts for the surge of DeFi has been the introduction of stable coins. They are tokens issued on the blockchain whose value is pegged to a fiat currency such as the USD, offering a recognizable denomination for financial transactions and a haven against volatility.

There are many stable coin issuance models, such as backed by bank deposits, managed through an algorithmic function, or collateralized by a cryptocurrency. Out of all the aforementioned models, crypto collateralized stable coins offer the most trust and transparency, thanks to the public nature of the underlying smart contracts and oracles.

In preparation for the Maiar Exchange launch, we are excited to announce that we are working with OIN Finance to issue the first EGLD backed stable coin on the Elrond mainnet!

“The eGold currency has been conceived to be a store of value with powerful utility in the Elrond ecosystem. Its use as collateral for stable coins allows holders to access liquidity and engage in additional DeFi opportunities which will further drive ecosystem growth.” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond Network CEO.

OIN Finance have been a member of the Elrond ecosystem for a while, and in the meantime, they have evolved to offer crypto collateralized stable coin issuance and staking derivatives via OINDAO, as well as a DEX for swapping OINDAO staking derivatives and stablecoins.

Our collaboration will focus on deploying the OINDAO framework on the Elrond Network, to be used in issuing an eGold backed USD-pegged stable coin. In addition, a portion of the OIN token supply will be minted on our mainnet in the ESDT format. Both tokens can be used to pursue DeFi opportunities on the Maiar Exchange.

“We are excited to support the growth of the Elrond DeFi landscape through the issuance of a crypto-backed stable coin powered by OINDAO. Its store of value tokenomics make eGold a great asset for collateralization by long term supporters looking to leverage their holdings in the DeFi ecosystem.” said Amo Huang, OIN Finance Tech Lead.

The collaboration is important for the Elrond ecosystem because it brings an eGold-backed stable coin into our DeFi landscape, which will allow more flexibility for eGold holders looking to engage with the Maiar Exchange and other products that will be deployed on our mainnet.

About Elrond

Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

About OIN FINANCE

OIN is a decentralized stablecoin issuance and trading platform. While MakerDao allows only mainstream assets to be used as collateral to issue DAI, OINDAO allows projects, large or small, to issue their own brand labelled synthetic assets that are collateralized by their own coins; in essence, any projects can mint their own stablecoins to participate in the greater DeFi ecosystem. Having commenced with Ethereum, and gradually expanding to other popular ecosystems such as Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain and most recently Elrond, OIN’s aim is to become a one-stop shop for cross-chain stablecoin issuance, trading, and implementation.

I got banned from cardano,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrvne4/i_got_banned_from_cardano/,wanderingcryptowolf,1,2021-06-04 11:36:28,182,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrvne4/i_got_banned_from_cardano/,TRADING,"Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about the limitations of Cardano's EUTxO model.

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about Cardano's fee model under full L1 load

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it's hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano's token transfers don't cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn't matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)

&gt; * Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network's ""watch towers"". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.

&gt; * Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don't have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It's a chicken and egg. I'll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don't have my fingers crossed.

&gt; * Significant amounts of *grassroots* projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn't matter how *many* projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I'll start taking a second look.

&gt; * IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the ""ERC-20 Converter"" does NOT do any ""conversion"" whatsoever, it's a BRIDGE, and rename it ""ERC-20 Bridge"" so that it's clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.

&gt; * Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it's still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.

&gt; * A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done. Huge pain in the ass.

&gt; * Being more honest about comparing either Cardano's *present* to Ethereum's *present*, or Cardano's *future* to Ethereum's *future*. A lot of the time, Cardano's future gets compared to Ethereum's present, and that's really unfair to Ethereum. Cardano's future 1M tx/sec gets compared to Ethereum's current 15 tx/sec instead of its future 100k tx/sec with sharding and rollups. Cardano's future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum's current Solidity-only support (which isn't even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.) Cardano's future gain in market share is compared to Ethereum's current market share, not the bigger and bigger market share it's likely to pick up over the next few years, etc.

&gt; * Being more honest about how Ethereum's lack of on-chain governance is a deliberate choice based on Vitalik's viewpoints, and how Cardano's on-chain governance is a divergence from those viewpoints to create a blockchain that has a different philosophy. Right now it's touted as a ""straight upgrade"" rather than a difference in philosophy. It also doesn't exist yet, tying into the previous point.

&gt; * In general, having better technical resources. I still haven't seen an easy, straightforward tutorial for how to set up a Plutus dev environment and publish a ""Hello World"" contract to the Alonzo testnet. Compare that to Ethereum where there's about a million tutorials on how to test and publish a smart contract on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo Wii and your microwave oven.

&gt; * Either Cardano's technology catching up to justify its ridiculously large market cap, or the market cap lowering to meet the current state of its tech. There are other chains like Solana that have working products with a lot more technically impressive innovations than Cardano but are worth 1/10th of what ADA is right now. ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it's not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason. There really isn't a lot more room for Cardano to run, because its run has already been *massive*.

&gt; These are a few of the things that would need to change in order for me to admit I am wrong about Cardano being a good investment looking towards the future. Right now, way too many of my questions are going unanswered about it. Unanswered on IOHK's website, unanswered in the Cardano Devs subreddit, and unanswered by any blog article or other resource I've been able to find on Google.

&gt; Because so many of my questions have gone unanswered for so long, at some point I am forced to assume that good answers simply don't exist. Otherwise someone, somewhere, would have written *something* that would have been picked up by Google, or someone around here would know something about and be able to point me in the right direction to get them answered.

Obligatory ""would like to get ethfinance's thoughts on this"".

Credit for words and post to a fellow visionary. Post is copy paste. That doesn't change its value. It pays to know what you are investing in."

Does anyone know how using collateral to take out a loan work e.g. minting of DAI based on ur collateral ether in makerDaO,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinAUS/comments/ntc2sd/does_anyone_know_how_using_collateral_to_take_out/,Neophyte-,1,2021-06-06 11:02:08,5,/r/BitcoinAUS/comments/ntc2sd/does_anyone_know_how_using_collateral_to_take_out/,NaN,"simple example: you have 100k of eth, say you use that to mint 30k of DAI with a stability fee of 4.5% (interest rate). this is just a loan on your collateral. much like if you used an asset as collateral to take out a loan e.g. a mortgage. 

in the regular financial world the new money coming into your account isnt taxed as its understood its just a loan to buy xyz.

Does the ATO treat the minting of DAI the same way? on block explorers the ato can check that the DAI comes from makerDaO smart contracts so its easy to determine if the DAI you have is generated from your colalteral vs just receiving it as a deposit.

id hazzard to guess the ATO is pretty behind this, they probably just mark it as a 0 cost basis asset, so when you dispose of it, u are taxed on 100% of the value e.g. use your dai to buy eth.
this would really suck if true because you can do more with DAI then just use it to take out a loan for leverage, you can mint DAI at a 4.5% interest rate then loan it out on a defi protocol at a higher rate to earn income.

i had an idea to mint DAI using the uniswap LP token when i add liquidity for the USDC/DAI pair. the dai minted i think is 1for 1, so you only need a 100% collateral ratio. so for example i use 100k worht of usdc/dai 50/50 split to add to the liquidity pool in uniswap. i get the LP token and mint 100k of dai at a 1% stability fee/interest rate. 

the benefit of this is that you get 3% in fees roughly a year on uniswap, then you loan  out hte DAI on defi or even on a centralised exchange. you can get &gt; 5% easy for your DAI reliably. 

so in net it looks like this as a return % per year:

5%(loaned dai youve minted) + 3%(uniswap fees) - 1%(stability fee)  = 7% 

you need to subtract gas ccosts of course so this isnt worth it with small amounts. 

Ideally you just pay tax on the income. a 7% interest rate is pretty good as a conservative low bound.

of course this isnt risk free, smart contract bugs can lead to theft etc."

Your bank pays you a quarter percent. But some cryptos will pay you 6% or even way more for locking in funds for the “true-believers” in any particular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. If you’re not afraid of watching your token’s value fall 20% or more, then DeFi yield is your next crypto investment.  

Yield paying DeFi cryptos are one of the main reasons why cryptocurrency investors have been diversifying from Bitcoin to the alt-coin universe, led by Ethereum. But for the past year, at least, it’s also been about Algorand, which I own, because it pays 6% yield. It’s not as safe as the Global X Super Dividend (DIV) ETF, which I also own. But Algorand and other tokens are – for investors – another way to capture yield in a diversified, crypto way.

Many of these DeFi protocols (think of them as fintech startups, in layman’s terms) are for investors that have a deep knowledge of cryptocurrency, the platforms they are operating on, and can lose most of their investment without losing sleep.

In short, there are many ways DeFi projects pay their investors yield, not just through [‘yield farming’.](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-yield-farming-beginners-guide) 

**A Quick Overview and Three Picks**

DeFi is financial services running on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. DeFi tokens earn interest, allow you to borrow, lend, buy insurance, or simply trade as a speculative crypto investment.  

“Yield farming” is a reward scheme that’s taken hold in the DeFi crypto world over the last year. If you want to compare it to traditional investing, it’s like yield on a bond, or a dividend. It is arguably one of the main reasons investors who are not using Algorand, buy Algorand, among others.

Like a traditional dividend paying stock or bond, yield on DeFi tokens fluctuates depending on how these projects and exchanges roll them out. Anyone with a Coinbase account can easily discover which coins pay yield. It’s how I found Algorand.

“The focus of investors should be on the fundamentals of the project, not just the yield it pays,” says Eric Nguyen, CEO of Spores Research, and a former senior investment analyst of Elliott Management, a hedge fund with over $35 billion in assets under management. “If it is decided to hold certain project’s tokens over the long run, then exploring yield-paying systems is an option. But, deciding on coin investment purely based on the yield offered will be problematic since there are also downsides to take into account. One main issue is that annual percentage yield might be high but the staking period available is low – for example you can reach 200% APY in 15 days, assuming it’s compounded daily. In actuality your coin balance will only increase maybe 4.6% in those 15 days,” he says. 

Like traditional dividend payments, if the price per coin goes up, then the yield paid on your crypto gives you new coins and now you have more coins that are worth more money.

But DeFi yield, for traditional Wall Street investors, is a little more like C rated junk bonds. High risk, high reward, if you get the timing right and the underlying instrument is sound and serious about paying what it promises.

“DeFi is trying to imitate traditional financial service providers with a decentralized twist,” says Gil Shpirman, CEO of Don-Key.Finance. In April, Don-Key completed a private funding round to bootstrap it’s Defi social yield farming platform to the tune of [$2.2 million captured from some of the new blockchain funds ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/13/social-yield-farming-platform-don-key-locks-2-million-from-cryptos-top-players/)like Black Edge Capital in Chicago, Genesis Block Ventures in the Caymans, MoonWhale of Bangkok, and Dubai’s Morningstar Ventures, to name a few.

Just as a bank takes a deposit from a customer and pays him 1% interest and then loans that same amount out to another customer and charges 5% in interest, a decentralized protocol will do the same thing but with a “smart contract” in the middle to reduce cost and increase efficiency. Investors are paid in “rewards”, which is like yield and – depending on the project. 

“Some good examples are MakerDao, Aave and Curve,” Shpirman says.

The Maker Protocol is one of the largest decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain, and was the first DeFi application to earn significant adoption. Their DAI coin is a stable coin that basically trades in line with the dollar and pays around 2% yield. It’s one of the biggest stable coins and yield paying coins out there with a market cap of more than $4 billion.

Aave, another DeFi protocol I have been looking at to buy, defines itself as a non-custodial liquidity protocol designed for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets in crypto. If you owned DAI and you deposited it in the Aave application, you could earn 1.57% APY. Aave pay yield for collateral, but not for farming.

Curve Finance is not for beginners. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralized protocols exchange stable coins and capture some yield that way.

“You are providing your capital and getting a return on them, but this is not without risks as some of the smaller DeFi projects have suffered exploits in the past,” says Nguyen, meaning “hacks”. 

“You should pick coins where you understand the fundamentals and believe in their long-term value because the yield might not be able to cover the decrease in their value,” Nguyen says.

As this market becomes more sophisticated, and an extension of traditional Wall Street, investors who ultimately want to allocate more of their portfolio to crypto are going to need to do one of three things:

**1)**     Wing it with the main coins – Bitcoin and Ethereum, or Grayscale ETFs that hold them, should you not want to be bothered opening an account on an exchange (you should do it, anyway)

**2)**     Risk it with the DeFi coins you read about from trusted investors and other sources or;

**3)**    Go find a specialist cryptocurrency firm, open an account with them, and let them do the work. 

**Don’t Fear the Reaper**

The recent volatility in crypto, with Bitcoin struggling to get back over $40,000 and losing around $375 billion in market cap over the last three weeks, is unlikely to kill interest in DeFi investing, says Antoni Trenchev, Co-Managing Partner at Nexo, a regulated financial institution for digital assets with $4 billion under assets based in London. 

“There are so many legitimate (DeFi yield) projects out there, but I think the future belongs to those that are compliant, well-capitalized, and scalable businesses with functional products and highly professional teams,” says Trenchev, who thinks Nexo is one of them. They give their investor clients tax-efficient instant cryptocurrency credit lines, a high-yield on both crypto and fiat, send and pay capabilities, high-level crypto trading, custodial insurance and a crypto wallet called the Nexo Wallet. 

Despite some saying that a new “crypto winter” is starting, DeFi protocols built on Ethereum, for instance, produced all-time high revenues in May, according to data [compiled by The Block. ](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106858/defi-protocols-ethereum-may-revenue?utm_source=coinbase&amp;utm_medium=rss)

The total locked value of liquidity pools in yield farming DeFi projects stood at $7,977,544,158 as of this weekend.

More sophisticated trades use DeFi marketplaces like Venus to lend their coins like a bank, and receive interest, or “rewards” in the Venus coin, XVS. That coin price is up nearly 10-fold since January. Some of the higher yielding lending pools are for those lending in Polkadot (DOT). It pays around 10%.

Pancake Swap is another one for sophisticated traders. Some of the trades on Pancake Swap are like 10x leveraged bets in a traditional market. I’d avoid.

For this reason, I’m sticking with Algorand and watch my rewards pile up in my Algorand wallet. 

“If there’s one takeaway from the recent episode of market volatility, it is the reinforcement of the view that in crypto, you have to take the long-term view because, on the one-, five-, ten-year scale, it tends to outperform just about any asset,” says Trenchev. Their NEXO coin is up over 1,100% in the last 12 months.

“The space has survived and thrived because of and in spite of price declines of 30% and more, and a few times per year,” he says. “Cryptocurrencies remain the only free market left nowadays and show that an asset — such as Bitcoin — cannot be the best performer and also not be volatile. Volatility is an essential feature of high asset performance.”

How to Classify Stablecoins in 2021 :),https://www.reddit.com/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/nualuq/how_to_classify_stablecoins_in_2021/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-07 19:57:09,4,/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/nualuq/how_to_classify_stablecoins_in_2021/,NaN," 

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021.

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021.

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

For the longest time MakerDAO was almost the only serious player on the DeFi market. However, the lending sector sees new projects offering new solutions pop up on a regular basis. 

Credefi is the world's most advanced crypto P2P lending platform, that combines the best practices of DeFi and traditional finance. Our hybrid mechanism solves real life problems and inefficiencies of the conventional banking and finance sector, and provides unique opportunities for both borrowers and lenders. Credefi allows platform participants to invest in credit portfolios, individual credits, or do trade finance, directly through their personal wallet. Those who deposit their funds to the wallet act as liquidity providers, and earn yield on their capital, which is similar to having a bank deposit, except the rate is much better! In addition to this, Credefi is actively working on security mechanisms to ensure maximum reliability for both lenders and borrowers.

The Juice Finance is designed to enable a complete algorithmic money market protocol on Binance Smart Chain. The protocol designs are architected and forked based on Binance Smart Chain and synced into the Juice Finance platform giving the benefits of both systems into one.

**Problems**

The evolution of decentralized finance has created a diverse financial ecosystem built directly on blockchains, which are transparent/verifiable through cryptography and pre-defined coding known as smart contracts. These platforms are redefining the structure of money markets without the need for a central authority or third-party decision-makers. In today’s traditional world, users will need to provide creditworthiness, provable income, and other factors for a lender to make a decision even when the user provides collaterals such as homes or cars.

Traditional lenders do not enable digital assets and cryptocurrencies to be pledged and used to receive loans or earn interest rates for providing them to the lenders and banks.

 

Juice is not the first protocol to help bridge these gaps between traditional financial lending into decentralized protocols on top of blockchains. There have been protocols that achieved this with billions in assets locked into the protocols. However, these protocols are primarily built on Ethereum, which has become costly, slow, and has caused pain points in user experience. These protocols also lack higher market cap assets such as XRP and Litecoin.

The current protocols are also heavily centralized such as Compound, where stakeholders and private equity funds seem to be able to control most of the decision-making and do not have a variety of other control mechanisms. Their distribution plan does not equate to decentralization.

Also, over $1 billion in Ether\[3\] are locked up in MakerDao Contracts that earn no value but come at a cost to those minting assets.

Lastly, in today’s landscape, a user who wants to use their assets to mint stablecoins must remove it from a money market protocol and lock it up in a smart contract with no benefit of the underlying asset as collateral.

**Solution**

Creating a protocol that enables a traditional money market tied into synthetic stablecoin generation will lead to accessibility and benefit of locked collateral. Juice will enable anyone to utilize a high-speed and low transaction cost blockchain by leveraging Binance Smart Chain \[4\] to supply collateral, earn interest on that collateral, borrow against that collateral, and mint BEP20 stable coins on-demand within seconds. These solutions all happen directly on the blockchain and may be utilized using a GUI. This protocol unlocks billions of dollars in value that are currently on-chains that have no lending markets such as Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin, and more while enabling the participant to access liquidity in real-time."

It directly competes with Dai from MakerDao and USDC from Coinbase. However, recently, use of Tether has come into question due to its lack of 1:1 backing by the US dollar. 

Stable coins provide liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by diminishing volatility. Because of this, stable coins are eligible for high yield interest rates up to 12% backed by over collateralization from online banking companies like Nexo, BlockFi, Kraken, Celsius, Etc. 

**Tracking the Tether Premium:**

Stable coins like USDT are *supposed* to be equally valued and completely interchangeable with the US dollar.

A website has been setup to track the so-called “Tether Premium,” the increased price on exchanges when buying in USDT vs USDC. The website is: 

[http://www.untether.space/](http://www.untether.space/) 

The Untether site automatically tracks major cryptocurrency exchanges and details the average price of Bitcoin on each type of platform: exchanges using USDT as their base currency, and exchanges using the US dollar.

**What is Tether Made of?**

In February 2021, 24-hour trading volume using Tether was about $107 billion. Its wide adoption has occurred with both retail investors and cryptocurrency exchange/institutional investors.

In May 2021, Tether published a chart of the composition of its holdings, showing the majority of its assets to be in cash and cash equivalents, the bulk of which is commercial paper. 

[Tether Reserves as of March 2021](https://preview.redd.it/taig3jio0n471.png?width=717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5a6e107f30818dbeecce6a2f27fa4c82e8ca08)

A JPMorgan rates derivatives strategist Josh Younger noted that, if considered among prime money market funds, Tether would be in the top 10. He noted: 

*“Whether the allocation of the Tether reserve is representative of other, smaller stablecoins is unknown. A key question is why they would choose to rely more heavily on commercial paper, which brings with it more logistical and relative value considerations around credit and maturity than comparatively simpler bank deposits. There are three reasons in particular to believe Tether has and will continue to face difficulty accessing the domestic banking system—particularly at the scale required to absorb a meaningful fraction of their already sizeable reserve funds.* ***First****, their holdings are likely offshore, and not necessarily in the Bahamas.* ***Second****,* [*recent guidance*](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) *from the OCC authorizes domestic banks under their supervision to accept deposits from stablecoin issuers only if those tokens are fully reserved (among other requirements), which Tether has admitted to misrepresenting and violating in their* [*recent settlement*](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf) *with the NYAG Office.* ***Finally****, these admissions as well as other concerns will likely raise reputational risk concerns among larger domestic banks that can accommodate a material fraction of those reserve assets.*

*This may seem an extended discussion for what essentially amounts to a modest segment of the commercial paper market. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that this market has the potential to grow significantly.”*

Lastly, a warning from Younger at JP Morgan: “Were any issues to arise that could affect the willingness or ability of both domestic and foreign investors to use Tether, the most likely result would be a severe liquidity shock to the broader cryptocurrency market which could be amplified by its disproportionate impact on high-frequency-trading-style market makers which dominate the flow,”

**Why is MKR a better Tether Alternatives?**

The Maker Protocol, also known as the Multi-Collateral Dai system, allows users to generate Dai by leveraging collateral assets approved by “Maker Governance.” 

Maker Governance is the community organized and operated process of managing the various aspects of the Maker Protocol. Dai is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar and built upon the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is resistant to hyperinflation due to its low volatility. 

Currently, Defi income and DEX volume is at a year low. Levels are equivalent to Sept 2020 with significant undervaluing of all 3 major lending protocols, including COMPOUND, AAVE and MKR. Of these three, only MKR is deflationary.

[DEX Volume is the lowest since 2020](https://preview.redd.it/20wztywj0n471.png?width=2401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79df2aa5ae368f2b4797ff48fc65d7e2b8bea494)

**How does DAI remain stable?**

Currently, there is more demand for DAI than there is supply. This causes upward supply pressure and defeats the point of having a stable coin pegged to the US dollar. Maker solved this problem by introducing the Peg Stability Module (PSM). 

The PSM is a module which allows people to trade USDC to DAI, and vice versa, 1 to 1, minus a .1% fee when depositing USDC.

As the price of DAI increases to more than $1.001, it causes an arbitrage opportunity. Where you could deposit USDC to create DAI and sell it back on the open market for a profit. This increases the DAI supply and stabilizes the price.

It also works in reverse, if at some point in the future, there is too much supply or not enough demand, then there will be downward pressure on the price of DAI. Since there are no fees to withdraw USDC, then anytime the price of DAI falls below $1, it also creates an arbitrage opportunity where you could trade your DAI back to USDC and profit. This decreases the DAI supply and stabilizes the price as well.

The PSM basically allows people to profit should the price of DAI stray too far from the $1 peg. Essentially, because there is money to be made, greed allows the DAI to remain stable. 

**How is MKR Deflationary?**

MKR tokens are burned whenever supply exceeds 

Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) holders accrue interest on the outstanding DAI loans they have taken out. This interest fee can range from 0.5 to 11.5%. Interest which is accrued goes to purchasing MAKR off the secondary market. On the secondary market, those that value their MKR the least are the ones that get their MKR purchased by the protocol’s Perpetual Auction.

MKR tokens which are purchased on the secondary market are burned to diminish supply and increase value. 

In May 2021, 6k MKR were burned. In June 2021, so far, 2.5k have been burned. 

Assuming a VERY conservative burn rate of 4% per month, that’s 48k burned per year, equal to 5% deflation from the 900k total tokens. You can actually follow the rate of burn here:

[**https://makerburn.com/#/**](https://makerburn.com/#/)

https://preview.redd.it/x055jbmy0n471.png?width=1781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e9fb870c6033b0ca91935fde21ce3f6834d58a

**Maker's tokenomics are best explained here:** 

[**https://medium.com/pov-crypto/evaluating-mkr-def6d36092bd**](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/evaluating-mkr-def6d36092bd)

Essentially**,** over time (…LOTS of time), Maker slowly transitions from a buyback model, to a cash-flow model. As MKR holders become fewer and fewer (because the Perpetual Auction keeps buying people out), the few MKR holders left have the privilege to sell their MKR at increasingly higher prices.

**Why is MKR undervalued in regards to Market Cap to TVL ?**

First, we have to understand some fundamentals regarding defi metrics. The total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked into a DeFi platform. On a platform that does borrowing and lending, the TVL would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto the platform, which other users can then borrow. TVL is also being used as a metric to measure growth. If the TVL of a platform increases it generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it is growing.

Like market caps, the TVL can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire DeFi space. On [www.defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/), you can view the TVL for the total DeFi space as well as individual platforms.

The market cap to TVL ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the amount of funds locked on the platform. It can be easily found on [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/). Since the TVL can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly. To calculate the market cap to TVL ratio simply divide the market cap by the TVL. Any value less than 1 means that a platform’s TVL is higher than their market cap. MKR has a ratio of less than 1. Specifically, their TVL is higher than their market cap with a super low ratio of .35 as of 6/11/21. 

[MKT CPT\/TVL Ratio is .3887!](https://preview.redd.it/dhydvpgfom471.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b42eeb2243a648b07a7b1337459b61c76b53e43)

**Conclusion:**

In May 2021, MKR reached a new ATH of nearly 5.1 billion DAI. It has generated an annual profit of nearly 148 million and is significantly undervalued for a token that has actual income, as well as intrinsic value. Fair value based on market cap, actual yearly income, and only 900k available tokens appears to be about 6k/MKR. At present, at a price of around $3100/token, the TVL/MCAP ratio is just 0.35. 

Furthermore, the 5% deflation rate and the fact that Tether is not fully backed 1:1 with asset protection means that institutions are increasingly using DAI and the Maker Protocol. Since the massive May 2021 liquidation of overleveraged positions, DeFi has fallen to its lowest transaction levels in a year. As such, lending &amp; collateralization protocol DeFi tokens, especially MKR, are grossly undervalued even in today’s already down market. Any dip is a chance to accumulate with a likely 2-3x return in less than 1 year."

https://preview.redd.it/sou5j21lgs471.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e07141f2b099b4c121b2932ae957ddf52d3dd93

 

Before the idea of DeFi came into existence, centralized finance was the standard for trading assets. In a centralized [finance model](https://www.leewayhertz.com/defi-vs-cefi/), “all trade orders are handled through a central exchange. Funds are managed by specific running of the central exchange”. In a cryptocurrencies context, this is equivalent to you not owning the private keys. The exchange makes all of the important decisions: which coins/assets to list, for how much, what are the fees, what are the general trading rules. Centralized exchanges often require KYCs and identity checks, and it is their prerogative to refuse someone a trading account, if they feel it is necessary.

When it comes to decentralized exchanges when trading assets, there is no central authority. The process takes place via automated applications. It aims to create a fair, transparent, open-source, and permissionless system, especially interesting for those parts of the world where people have limited access to financial services.

This decentralized financial system offers many services, including borrowing, yield farming, crypto lending, asset storage and more.

“The [benefit of ](https://www.leewayhertz.com/defi-vs-cefi/)using DeFi over CeFi is that you have full control over your assets and own the key pair for your wallet. Moreover, users who want to participate in DeFi need to use decentralized applications (dApps) built on the blockchain platforms to access DeFi services”, said Akash Takyar, CEO of LeewayHertz and expert in the area.

## How is DeFi different from CeFi?

The main issue here is the technology vs.people dilemma. With DeFi, users trust the technology. On the other hand, with CeFi, users must trust the people that run a given exchange.

Both DeFi and CeFi deliver a wide range of financial services, including cryptocurrency-related options. Let’s discuss some of the features and functionalities of both the ecosystems that differentiate them from each other.

## Features of CeFi

Some of the most popular centralized exchanges are Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc. Users can transfer and exchange funds, but also lend, borrow, or even margin trade.

One must remember that due to their established nature, these platforms will require users to share intimate and confidential information about themselves. Data breaches can occur, Kraken was a target of a cyber attack in the past.

“One of the [advantages](https://medium.com/@blockchain_simplified/centralized-finance-cefi-vs-decentralized-finance-defi-the-battlefield-of-cryptocurrencies-bd5250f55cf2) of Centralized Finance over Decentralized Finance is that they support cross chain exchange for multiple cryptocurrencies, although these cryptos are generated on individual blockchains, thus displaying interoperability of cryptocurrencies. CeFi exchanges also enable the conversion of fiat currency to cryptocurrency and vice-versa in an easy and seamless manner”, was mentioned by long-running magazine Blockchain Simplified.

## Features of DeFi

As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is hosted on a Blockchain platform like Ethereum, smart contracts are designed to automatically execute transactions when a particular condition is fulfilled. Since smart contracts are automatic, users can be fully assured that transactions will never fail and will be properly executed. Users do not require any permission to join a Decentralized Finance exchange since it is permissionless, which is not the case in Centralized Finance platforms.

Thus, DeFI is the leader when it comes to the protection of users’ personal data. Users are the sole owners of the data.

Some of the main examples of decentralized exchanges include: Kyber, Totle, MakerDAO.

## Quick Innovation

DeFi platforms are open-source and subject to a quick rate of innovation. One example can be that in functionalities that centralized financial services are best at, DeFi space has worked tirelessly to deliver alternative solutions. For instance, to overcome “the DeFi’s [inability](https://www.leewayhertz.com/defi-vs-cefi/) to facilitate the transfer of incompatible cryptocurrencies such as BTC, solutions like tBTC and WBTC, that are compatible with decentralized protocols eliminate the gap by behaving as tokens pegged to the value of BTC”.

## Remittance Market Solution

DeFi will have an immensely positive impact on the remittances market; the market where millions of dollars are sent across the borders by workers that are working in foreign countries.

With DeFi, it will be [possible](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history) to “cut the cost associated with sending money by 50% and more”.

## Rise to Popularity

Even though Blockchain is more than a decade old, there was not much mainstream popularity of DeFi until 2019. DeFi requires the Internet for connectivity, and before that time, a lot of people were still unable to access it. Thus, it is likely that now, with the advances in technology,DeFi will become more mainstream by 2025.

“The Internet is [growing rapidly](https://101blockchains.com/decentralized-finance-defi/) and is becoming more affordable than ever. India has also seen tremendous growth when it comes to mobiles and internet connectivity”.

## CeFi vs DeFi: Real Use Cases

Some of the most prominents crypto use cases of CeFi includes:

**Coinbase** *—* A cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates trading, borrowing, margin trading, native stablecoin, lending, payments and more.

**Fairlay** *—* It is a Bitcoin Prediction Market and Exchange that runs on the CeFi model.

**BlockFi** *—* A cryptocurrency and fiat borrowing and lending platform.

**Celsius** *—* A cryptocurrency borrowing, payments and lending platform.

**Ledn** *—* An insured Bitcoin to DAI borrowing and lending platform.

**Libra** *—* A global financial infrastructure and cryptocurrency layer.

## On the other hand, real use cases of DeFi are starting to pick up quickly, such as:

**Totle** *—* An aggregator of decentralized liquidity with automatic price optimization.

**Augur** *—* A decentralized predictions market.

**Nexus Mutual** *—* A decentralized insurance tool.

**Kyber** *—* A decentralized exchange.

## What’s best for trading crypto: CeFi or DeFi?

Both centralized finance and decentralized finance aim to achieve the same objective — to make crypto trading popular and increase the trading volume, however, through different means.

Both systems have their benefits and drawbacks. It depends on the individual investor, on what they value more. If their main goal is to maintain their privacy, DeFi is the way. If safety, sharing of risks, increased options to invest, and flexibility are your concerns, [go for ](https://www.youhodler.com/blog/centralized-finance-cefi-vs-decentralized-finance-defi)CeFi.

As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

# 1. Solution to Decentralised Governance

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.

So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.

That is DAO — decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

# 2. Importance of DAO

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary — how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide which autonomous organisation will succeed.

# 3. Economics of DAO

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**."

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.

So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.

That is DAO — decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

# 2. Importance of DAO

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary — how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide which autonomous organisation will succeed.

# 3. Economics of DAO

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**."

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own.

# 3. Economics of DAO

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**."

As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

# 1. Solution to Decentralised Governance

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.

So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.

That is DAO — decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

# 2. Importance of DAO

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary — how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*

Cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where you can exchange or trade cryptos based on the market value. It acts as a mediator between the cryptocurrency buyers and sellers.

There are various Cryptocurrency Exchanges in the world, I have discussed the top 3 among them.

CoinMarketCap reported statistics, According to the survey, the top three cryptocurrency exchanges are Binance, Huobi, and OKEX.

**Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange** is one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges that offer to trade in more than 45 virtual coins including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Binance Coin (BNB).it was founded by changing Zhao in 2017, Malta.

**Highlights of Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange**

Binance[ ](https://www.binance.com/en)is growing in a progressive way, it shows always the biggest crypto exchange platform worldwide for trading altcoins.

Binance provides a [crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/AipiChain/comments/nq72wx/stake_aipi_and_get_33_roi_apy_aipix/) wallet for its traders, where they can keep their currencies.

Binance has its own currency, Binance Coin(BnB).

Binance has launched a kava launchpad recently.

It has a leverage of 125x in October 2019, Binance traders have a bright future.

Binance Chain is tradeable on Binance DEX, providing more trading options for DEX users with full custody over their wallets and assets.

**Huobi Cryptocurrency Exchange** is a Singapore-based global cryptocurrency exchange that has services centers in Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong, Seoul, Shenzhen, Singapore, and Tokyo.

It allows the trader to exchange crypto to crypto, including the USDT token.

It was founded by Leon Li in 2013, Singapore.

**Highlights of Huobi Exchange Platform**

Huobi has innovated with newer decentralized and peer-to-peer exchange trading models.

Huobi exchange has updated Huobi pro for his User Protection Fund strictly separate trader digital coin in cold and hot wallet, storing most of the digital assets in a multi-signature cold wallet.

Huobi also offers two things **HADAX** and **OTC**

The HADAX (Huobi Autonomous Digital Asset Exchange) is more for professional traders.

The OTC focuses to move huge quantities of cryptocurrency.

The exchange has an AML and KYC verification mandatory for the user.

In Japan, huobi raised JPY500m (USD4.6m) in a new funding method. because funding was raised by issuing new stocks to the Japanese financial services group (FPG) through private placement.

They support for **MakerDAO** tokens and decentralized apps **(DApps)** in its wallet. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is managed only by smart contracts and code.

The Huobi Token (HT) is now ready for making real-world online purchases of a broad variety of goods from the e-commerce platform FomoHunt.

**The OKex Cryptocurrency Exchange** was born out of branded OKCoin exchange. Where the cryptocurrency traders can buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens. The OKex exchange allows the standard crypto-to-crypto trading as well as fiat to cryptocurrency trading. It was founded in 2017, Malta."

The popularity of DeFi services is rising, and this claim is easy to back up with hard data. According to DeFi Pulse, the total value of funds locked in DeFi applications has grown from $300 million in early 2019 to several billion in 2021.The ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) has continued to grow rapidly throughout the bull run, and currently stands at over $110 billion!

Lending is one of the fastest growing sectors within DEFI and is host to more than $30B in TVL. Why does this market sector continue to gain more and more traction? It’s quite simple: both the lender and the borrower can enjoy additional guarantees, all deals go through in a quick and transparent manner with no approval needed, and the system has zero bureaucracy — something that has been plaguing the traditional banking system.

For the longest time, MakerDAO was the dominant player in DEFI. However, with the explosion in DEFI, the lending sector has become a showcase for hosting large amounts of TVL.

Multi-Chain Lend (MCL) is an algorithmic money market system designed to bring secure and unique lending and borrowing opportunities like flash loans onto the Binance Smart Chain. The protocol designs are architected and forked based on Aave with revenue sharing components for liquidity providers and token holders that govern the protocol.

Multiplier will launch MCL v2 by Q3 2021 with new and exciting features! Looking forward to that! More info can be found in this medium post: [https://multiplierfinance.medium.com/mcl-v2-features-4bde884c519c](https://multiplierfinance.medium.com/mcl-v2-features-4bde884c519c).

Collateralized loans on Oasis. How to calculate liquidation price and how to understand 'Liquidation ratio'? Please help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/o2mr5n/collateralized_loans_on_oasis_how_to_calculate/,adsorptionspectra,7,2021-06-18 19:18:56,4,/r/MakerDAO/comments/o2mr5n/collateralized_loans_on_oasis_how_to_calculate/,NaN,"I am considering to make a collateralized loan on Oasis but the terminology is confusing me and I want to make sure I understand it completely before doing anything. 

Let's say I will put **1 WBTC** as collateral into vault. Oasis says that I can get up to **25'184 DAI** which is in traditional terms **66%** loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. But it also says that the 'Liquidation ratio' (minimal collateral ratio) is **150%** which is the same as **66% LTV** in traditional terms. Does that mean that if I create **25'184 DAI** and the value of my 1 WBTC drops even a slightest I will be in the liquidation territory?  If this is correct, why does such an option even exist? it is super risky. 

My second question is: Can I generate less DAI as I am offered? Instead of **25'184 DAI** (and making this 66% LTV borrowing) can I instead generate **15'140 DAI** which will be close to 40% LTV ratio which is much safer if the liquidation LTV ratio is 66%?

Is it safe to deal with such high amounts on DAO?

PS: calculating liquidation prices formula on MakerDAO website is strange:  
Source: [https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/)

    To calculate a Liquidation Price, simply use the following formula:
    Liquidation Price = (Generated Dai * Liquidation Ratio) / (Amount of Collateral)

If I plug in the numbers for the above case (for 1 WBTC = 37 776 USD) I get this:

    (25184 DAI * 1.5) / 37776 USD = 1

How is 1 a ""Liquidation price""? I don't get it

Thank you for any help."

Flash Loans are a Democratization Tool,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o504vi/flash_loans_are_a_democratization_tool/,ElBuenMayini,3,2021-06-22 01:12:06,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o504vi/flash_loans_are_a_democratization_tool/,FINANCE,"A sentiment change from the community towards this term is necessary.

Normally when this term comes up over here, the first reaction is an alarmed one: ""this thing, which I don't fully understand, is evil because an unaudited project I recklessly put all my money into was attacked by it!""

Let's make this thing clear: Flash loans are a good thing. 

They allow anyone without capital to take advantage of the many arbitrage opportunities the DeFi ecosystem continously has.

Without flash loan tools, the arbitrage opportunities, and yes, the exploits of some less-quality projects, would only be available to those with enough capital to execute them, giving more capital to the people with excessive capital in the first place.

The latest project to allow flash loans is Maker, with its new [Dai Flash Minting feature](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flash), which I think is amazing, and there is even a revamped [Wrapped Ethereum contract](https://github.com/WETH10/WETH10), already deployed to main net, which has a built in functionality to do flash loans where you don't have to have the Ether to back the Wrapped Ethereum minted, all of this possible only if you burn the minted currency within the same transaction.

What do you guys think? Let's have a proper discussion about this topic, and finally un-demonize it, once and for all."
Ethosphere Timeline update for 21st June - Not all bad. Protocol upgrade dates firming up. Good things still happening. Trust!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/o5302y/ethosphere_timeline_update_for_21st_june_not_all/,Coldsnap,1,2021-06-22 03:16:00,0,/r/ethfinance/comments/o5302y/ethosphere_timeline_update_for_21st_june_not_all/,Educational,"What's up r/ethfinance. Let’s take a moment to avert our gaze, just for a little bit, from the challenging price action and remind ourselves that the overall development plan for the ecosystem is making solid progress and Hawaii 2022 is [definitely a thing](https://hodler.holiday/)! Although perhaps we'll all be too rekt to enjoy it?

In super positive news, the major Ethereum protocol updates - London, Altair and The Merge - are all still on track. London and Altair have additional meat around the bones re: testnet dates. London’s are [now firmed up](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/06/18/london-testnets-announcement/). This week (!) London goes up on Ropsten, with Goerli and Rinkeby to follow each a week apart. **28 July is definitely still in play for the London mainnet date.** Check out 1559 fee burn on the Calaveras devnet [here](http://watchtheburn.com/) and [Cat Herders 1559 pre-launch Q&amp;A](https://youtu.be/AC1FS3LmoT4) with Tim Beiko and the team. For Altair, [solid engineering progress has been made](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/SJoLSp_s_) by the consensus layer client teams, and an early August release date is looking more certain. Altair testnet dates soon to be agreed on 1st July Eth2 Implementers call. 

Not too much news on The Merge this week as all dev team focus is on London and Altair. Variety of date estimates on The Merge right now. Some of the more credible ones:

~ Nethermind - [October 2021](https://twitter.com/nethermindeth/status/1385699335355125766)

~ Prysm - [late 2021](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ethereum-is-about-six-months-away-4b0)

~ Besu - [December](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/)

~ Teku - [Q1 2022](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210522#The-Merge)

~ Vitalik - [early Q1](https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs?t=5691)

Looking beyond The Merge, the Sharding spec [is iteratively improving](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1405711431786434560).

Vitalik also has a proposal out for [state expiry and statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal), to occur over the course of two separate upgrades. These changes will improve scaleability by [reducing the size requirements](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_size_management) for running Ethereum nodes. We’ll need to wait and see if the ideas gain traction (let’s be real, they likely will) over the coming months before assignment to any particular hard forks.

Other things

~ Competition in the ZK-rollups space is heating up with the impending mainnet launches for both zkSync and [Starkware](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-planets-alpha-on-ropsten-e7494929cb95) edging closer (see table below).

~ No update on how close Arbitrum or Optimism are to the same but Arbitrum in particular [are announcing](https://twitter.com/arbitrum) new partner on-boardings at pace right now. Although, not to be outdone, at least Optimism has [The Graph lined up for launch](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/status/1405929132932878339?s=20)!

**THE TIMELINE**

Ethereum protocol upgrades / hardforks in **bold**.

All dates are moderately informed guesses by me, and should definitely NOT be viewed as commitments from the respective teams.

Everybody’s doing fractional co-ownership projects these days, or turning physical art into an NFT, but OMNIA is more than that. OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 
* Focusing on indexing before derivatives
* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
* Liquidity for the middle class


Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022
•  3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)
•  Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)
•  10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 


• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks 

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium

• Cyber security checks later in the month

$OMNIA will have three coins!

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale 
OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval
OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS

Everybody’s doing fractional co-ownership projects these days, or turning physical art into an NFT, but OMNIA is more than that. OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 
* Focusing on indexing before derivatives
* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
* Liquidity for the middle class


Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022
•  3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)
•  Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)
•  10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 


• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks 

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium

• Cyber security checks later in the month

$OMNIA will have three coins!

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale 
OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval
OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS

🚀 **The pre sale is about to start, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem* 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi ?! :O,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/o660z3/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-23 13:03:28,2,/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/o660z3/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,NaN," 

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### [Notional Finance](https://notional.finance/)

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### [UMA's yUSD](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-yield-dollar-on-uma-3a492e79069f)

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### [Notional Finance](https://notional.finance/)

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

Instadapp is a DeFi aggregator that operates primarily on its portal website. The Instadapp protocol (DSL) is the core of the project. It serves as the middleware in DeFi and can aggregate multiple DeFi protocols into an upgradeable smart contract layer.

A DeFi aggregator refers to the platform that aggregates transactions, loans, management, insurance, and other businesses in the DeFi market. It is essentially the front end of a centralized DeFi ecosystem and can significantly reduce the entry threshold for users, especially non-technical users.

The main functions of DSL are account extensions and upgradability. The unique upgradability means that upcoming and new extensions will be upgraded, maintained, and managed by INST governance. The DSL also includes a new operational layer that acts as an “Account Extension”. These extensions allow users to access new and unique features of their DSL accounts. The evolution of these extensions and platforms forms a DeFi Center through which new use cases and extensions can be created. Some examples of possible use cases include flash modules, permission extensions, L2 extensions, and others.

The currently integrated DeFi protocols include Maker, Aave, Compound, and Uniswap. Users can trade in InstaDApp and manage their own LP (Liquidity Pools) in Uniswap, while lending the LP to leverage financing in the platform-supported lending protocols.

InstaDApp connects its products to assets held by users on various DeFi platforms and keeps obtaining the prices in order to display them on the operating interface. Before InstaDApp, users were required to manually write down the prices on each platform to find out the optimal interest rates, loans, and others. At the same time, when the user determined the optimal asset management position, previously a series of complex transactions were needed to transfer assets, and these steps were needed to be completed on each platform. InstaDApp hands over operations such as user transfer of assets to a smart contract designed for automatic execution. Currently, no fees are charged. Users only need to provide the funds to pay for the transfer of assets.

InstaDApp stores all transactions and assets in a contract wallet (DSA) that is fully managed by smart contracts. All data is publicly visible and InstaDApp does not hold any of the user’s assets.

TVL（Total Volume Locked）$5.2 billion USD, ranked 5th（Data from June 22）

Instadapp has achieved remarkable success in the DeFi field, creating nearly 55,000 Instadapp DSAs; the TVL is currently over $5 billion; InstaDApp is arguably the project with the highest number of flash loans ever developed and wrapped for direct use by users. Over 50% of flash loans in Ethereum are generated through Instadapp.

**Flash Loan**

Flash Loan allows borrowers to borrow without any collateral, which greatly increases the utilization of funds. Flash Loan completes the loan and repayment in a chain transaction without collateral. Compound, Aave, and others all have Flash Loan support. The repayment is subjected to pre-set rules for smart contracts and usually requires a certain handling fee. Because a single transaction in a chain can contain many operations, developers can add other on-chain operations between borrowing and repayment, which gives this kind of borrowing more room for imagination.

For example, the founder of DForce mentioned that with the help of Flash Loan, Uniswap transaction fees were reduced from 0.3% to 0.05%, and the following can be done in a single transaction chain:

1. Use a lending platform to borrow ETH worth $25 million USD

2. Put ETH worth $15 million USD in MakerDAO and borrow DAI worth $10 million USD

3. Provide liquidity to DAI with the $10 million USD DAI to Uniswap (providing DAI liquidity with 82% Commission rebates)

4. In Uniswap, perform any DAI-related trades you want to

5. Repay the original ETH loan

In this way, the fourth step in this trade needs only 0.05% of the handling fee, not 0.3%.

**DeFi Smart Layer (DSL)**

The DeFi Smart Account (DSA) was upgraded to the Open DeFi Smart Layer (DSL) in February this year. The DSL consists of the smart contract account standard (DSA), composable connectors to base DeFi protocols, and an authorization framework that allows extremely modular permissions.

**Smart Account**: An upgradable contract account where assets are stored and DSA can perform composed transactions across connectors.

**Connectors**: Used primarily by developers to develop functionality for smart accounts (DSAs), such as cross-protocol transactions, through standardized modules that interact with various protocols.

**Authority**: Users can use it to set up managers or automation robots to manage their DSAs. Permissions can be modular to the connector level. For example, users can allow specific addresses to rebalance their assets to minimize interest payments or maximize returns.

**DSA’s Functions**

DeFi Smart Account (DSA) is a separate smart Wallet.

Multi-account and sub-permission management: On Instadapp, you can create different wallet accounts and assign different permissions such as trading, voting, multi-signing, lending, and others.

Multi-user permissions work together: supports account management for different DeFi protocols and functions, and introduces a number of identity verification modules to ensure security.

Multi-protocol: currently supports Maker, Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and Polygon asset migration, cross-protocol operations.

**Supported Aggregator Functions**

Collateral lending: Lending assets and borrowing assets.

Collateral swap: Transfer of collateral on different protocols.

Debt swap: Transfer of debt over different protocols.

Auto-refinancing of debt: Automatically transferring collateral from one protocol to another to avoid large liquidation fines. (Currently only in Maker)

**Tokenomics**

**INST（DSL Governance Tokens）**

Total Supply: 100,000,000

Community and Ecosystem Development：55%，55,000,000 (Of these, 15% are used for ecosystem incentives in the 6.16 announcement.)

Current Team Members: 23.7% 23,794,114 (4-year vesting)

Investors: 12.07% 12,078,714 (4-year vesting)

Ecosystem and Future Team Members: 7.85% 7,851,941

Advisors: 1.27% 1,275,231 (4-year vesting)

**INST Incentives (15% of Total Supply)**

**Airdrop:**

On June 16, Instadapp announced the INST Token Airdrop Program, with 10% of its total supply to be used in airdrops to users (about 310,000 users) who hold positions on Maker, Compound, and Aave mainnets through Instadapp and 1% for users (about 50,000 users) who manage Aave positions on Polygon. The number of airdrops is linked to the position size. Users who use Instadapp to manage their positions will double their net value after calculation. Users can receive an airdrop by upgrading their account to DSA V2 on the Instadapp protocol and moving their positions to B2. About 36,000 users are eligible.

**Liquidity Mining (June 16 to September 16)**

After upgrading the account to DSA V2 under the Instadapp protocol, users will be entitled to participate in a three-month liquidity mining process. A total of 3 million INST tokens will be distributed proportionally based on the net value of users’ positions on MakerDAO, Compound, and Aave on the Ethereum mainnet.

**UNI-v3 Staking (June 16 to September 16)**

0.01 ETH/INST\~0.04 ETH/INST, the liquidity pool is eligible for a reward of 250,000 INST.

0.04 ETH/INST\~0.1 ETH/INST, the liquidity pool is eligible for a reward of 750,000 INST.

Since Instadapp is a centralized to decentralized process, there are some parts of governance that need attention. Initially conducted by teams and investors, the project will be decentralized when INST is officially released (launched on June 17) through liquidity mining and developer incentives. On June 17, after the INST governance was online in Ethereum mainnet, all protocol upgrades will be conducted transparently through public discussions in the community and votes by INST holders to achieve decentralized governance.

**Current DAO Governance：**

1. Submitting governance proposals requires 1% of the INST supply, or 1,000,000.

2. 4% INST of the supply is required to reach the quorum, with a minimum of 4,000,000 pieces.

3. A voting period of approximately three days.

4. Timelock delay for about two days on execution.

**Practical Scenario Analysis：**

**​Use cases:**

Participate in DAO Governance

DAO Governance, there may be a fee for some components of the platform (INST as the fee)

Liquidity Mining

Governance, Loans, Voting

**Risks:**

Partial cash out of incentives and airdrops

Partial cash out by team members"

**Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!**

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

⏫ Frictionless token yield ⏫  
2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

DORE bonus airdrop🏅  
1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

**1:** 🟨 Discounted Gold Bullion 🟨  
Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

**2**: 🔄 ProtoSwap 🔄  
Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

**3**: 🎰 Lottery 🎰  
Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Early supporters who attend the presale or the IDO on Dxsale will be registered to receive on a 1 to 1 basis upon their Proto holdings an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the Law token. Everyone else will have to buy it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token.

DCE 2 is scheduled to begin shortly on the DXsale platform (DXlaunch), followed by an immediate Pancakeswap listing. Below $400k launch market cap. So things are ramping up now as it gets closer to launch. 900BNB was raised in minutes when the DCE 1 event went live &amp; has smashed its soft cap.

**Proto** is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity.  
**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.  
**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Lightpaper and Whitepaper in 6 languages already ready and live - English, Mandarin, Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian. More coming!

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!**

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

⏫ Frictionless token yield ⏫  
2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

DORE bonus airdrop🏅  
1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

**1:** 🟨 Discounted Gold Bullion 🟨  
Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

**2**: 🔄 ProtoSwap 🔄  
Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

**3**: 🎰 Lottery 🎰  
Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

**More information below:**

Community competitions 🎭  
Proto announced that talented &amp; lucky community members would have the opportunity to win and earn Proto &amp; Law &amp; Dore through the year in the community games and competitions.

DAO - community governance “Law” token.  
Our voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! Early supporters who attend the presale or the IDO on Dxsale will be registered to receive on a 1 to 1 basis upon their Proto holdings an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the Law token. Everyone else will have to buy it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

This subreddit should help to connect austrian ethereum enthusiasts and them provide a platform for ethereum-related discussions here on Reddit.

As we're freshly launching and scaling a subreddit can be a difficult task, it would be great if members could invite their potentially interested friends to join.

To set out a basic set of rules, I'd suggest to keep this subreddit in English so that everyone has the chance to participate. Furthermore let's strictly stick to reddit's netiquette and focus on techical topics instead of memes, price predictions and technical chart analyses. 

Perhaps, especially in the beginnings, it might be helpful if everyone could quickly introduce her/himself and I'll directly start doing so:

I'm nero. I live in Innsbruck and will move to Vienna in a few months to pursue my Phd at WU in cryptoecomomics. I got into related topics quite early in late '13 and since 2017, I have been an active fellow of the ethereum community. I like building dashboards and programm dApps for Proof of Concepts and my main interests include Defi, MEV (frontrunning, sandwich attacks), Arbitrage trading and Eth 2.0. I have special interests in the ecosystems of MakerDao and Uniswap and I'm open for any kind of collaboration.

Looking forward!"

PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!**

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

⏫ Frictionless token yield ⏫  
2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

DORE bonus airdrop🏅  
1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

**1:** 🟨 Discounted Gold Bullion 🟨  
Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

**2**: 🔄 ProtoSwap 🔄  
Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

**3**: 🎰 Lottery 🎰  
Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

**More information below:**

Community competitions 🎭  
Proto announced that talented &amp; lucky community members would have the opportunity to win and earn Proto &amp; Law &amp; Dore through the year in the community games and competitions.

DAO - community governance “Law” token.  
Our voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! Early supporters who attend the presale or the IDO on Dxsale will be registered to receive on a 1 to 1 basis upon their Proto holdings an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the Law token. Everyone else will have to buy it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

Elrond, Matic, Dash, Avalanche, Paid Network, Harmony and Near Protocol all announced recently that they will be using OINDAO to launch their custom stablecoins, coins that will be backed by their own assets, for instance an Elrond stable-coin backed by eGLD."

Today, I came across AAVE Flash Loans and one of its use cases i.e. Arbitrages between two or more DEXs. I found it interesting and researched further by going through official guide, Youtube tutorials and few web articles. I was wondering if it's still profitable in terms of finding arbitrage opportunities and making trades. I was seeking guidance and help in terms of tools that can be used for this purpose and insight in your experiences. For example, any scanners to find arbitrage opportunities, automation tools that can swap trade and earn profit and/or any guides that can help me create or program my own Flash Loans. I saw few posts and articles about earning MATIC etc with Flash Loans or using MakerDAO along with AAVE to earn but no proper guide to follow. Thank you.

Traditional governance systems, such as the ones existing in governments and organisations, are hierarchical and centralised. Because of this structure, most of the power is in the hand of the upper echelons while most users have little to no chance of influencing decision making. This can become an issue when the users are affected by the choices while the people in control are not incentivised to make changes in their favour. Also, decision makers are difficult to audit and are not always held accountable by other parties. This lack of transparency becomes an even greater issue in the context of representative governance. High profile examples of tampering are the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal#Aftermath) and more generally controversies on the [US elections integrity](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud).

Blockchain technology could be deployed to transform governance and community management. This is because a [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp)\-based governance system would be much more difficult to tamper with while also staying transparent and auditable.

&amp;#x200B;

## What went wrong with traditional governance?

* Failure to deliver on what is promised in the electoral campaign
* Information bottleneck
* Lack of transparency and accountability
* Inequality
* Lack of representation
* Barriers to participation

&amp;#x200B;

## Blockchain governance

Governance based on blockchain decentralises the power that is normally held by a small leadership group, allowing users to take more control of the system. This can also help preventing a monopoly of power and influence that can put the users at the mercy of whoever is in control. In a decentralised blockchain governance, there are usually three main parties holding decision-making rights:

* Developers
* Node Operators/Miners/Stakers
* Token holders/Investors

The rights and incentives for each party varies depending on the ecosystem and consensus mechanism involved.

&amp;#x200B;

## How does blockchain governance work without leaders?

Applications built on a decentralised network (dapps) have characteristics that make them ideal in solving the current governance challenges - this is because they are backed by unchangeable [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) ​that control the logic of the dapp independently of individuals or institutions.

Key features of [dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/):

&gt;**Zero downtime** – once the smart contract at the core of an app is deployed and on the blockchain, the network as a whole will always be able to serve clients looking to interact with the contract. Malicious actors therefore cannot launch denial-of-service attacks targeted towards individual dapps.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Privacy** – you don’t need to provide real-world identity to deploy or interact with a dapp.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Resistance to censorship** – no single entity on the network can block users from submitting transactions, deploying dapps, or reading data from the blockchain.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Complete data integrity** – data stored on the blockchain is immutable and indisputable, thanks to cryptographic primitives. Malicious actors cannot forge transactions or other data that has already been made public.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Trustless computation/verifiable behavior** – smart contracts can be analyzed and are guaranteed to execute in predictable ways, without the need to trust a central authority.

&amp;#x200B;

## Blockchain governance strategies

Incentives and coordination - to bring beneficial change to a shared ecosystem, common incentives must be found. All parties involved should have the same ability to coordinate so that a power imbalance is avoided. Off-chain and on-chain governance have their advantages and limitations - regardless of the strategy, please keep in mind that a blockchain project is not guaranteed to be decentralised.

*It's impossible to tell which structure is a better choice without presenting a precise governance context.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Off-Chain governance

This strategy is more similar to existing governance structure - a small, closed group (usually developers or major stakeholders) make and enact proposals.

*examples:*

* Bitcoin BTC - developers issue [Bitcoin improvement proposals](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip) (BIPs) that can be approved or rejected by miners
* Ethereum ETH - funded by the non profit [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) \- anyone in the Ethereum community can issue [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/) (EIPs) which can be enacted by community stakeholders
* [Ripple](https://ripple.com/ripplenet-committee/) (XRP) - very centralised, mostly owned and controlled by large financial institutions, strong B2B focus

*limitations:*

* partnerships with institution/company/foundation - reliance on leadership integrity
* relatively centralised
* lack of innovation incentives

&amp;#x200B;

## On-Chain governance

This strategy deploys the governance system as integral part of the protocol - smart contracts enable users to coordinate proposals and voting.

*examples:*

* [Tezos](https://wiki.tezosagora.org/positionpaper) \- self-amending blockchain, no hard forks, evolves with the community needs
* [EOS](https://eos.io/resources/stake-based-voting-and-rewards-mechanism/) \- staking-based voting rights and rewards
* [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/about/) DOT

*limitations:*

* no rollback and possiblity of hard forks splitting communities (this does not apply to Tezos)
* reliance on users' integrity
* tends towards plutocracy (for example, ATOM requires a minimum pooled amount to make proposals and the votes on proposals are proportional to staked ATOM)

&amp;#x200B;

## Current limitations:

* [gas fees](https://usenobi.com/blog/why-is-ethereum-gas-fee-so-high/) (you can check up to date gas prices [here](https://crypto.com/defi/dashboard/gas-fees))
* dapps are not as widely adopted due to development difficulty and not being as user friendly and well known as web2 existing platforms
* plutocracy and institution/whale buy out - see [Steemit hard fork](https://changelly.com/blog/steem-hardfork-explained/) and its acquisition through a large stake

Blockchain does not guarantee automatic decentralisation - e.g.: [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) is owned and managed by a company, therefore has a governance strategy that is not different from traditional companies.

&amp;#x200B;

## [DAOs](https://aragon.org/dao) - the gold standard of decentralised governance

Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are the most decentralised form of on-chain governance to date. There are various forms of DAOs with different voting strategies - however all DAOs eliminate the need for a top-down hierarchy, by coordinating votes and proposals through smart contracts.

## DAO platforms

* [Moloch](https://www.molochdao.com/) \- the older platform, focused on crowdfunding for Ethereum dev teams
* [DAO Stack](https://daostack.io/) \- more focused on governance tool
* [Colony.io](https://colony.io/) \- newer and less known/adopted
* [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) \- focused on accessibility and user experience, it is in active development to make DAOs accessible to users with no coding skills who want to build a community

## DAOs are not the future, DAOs are now

* [DAONAUTS](https://client.aragon.org/#/0x57ebe61f5f8303ad944136b293c1836b3803b4c0/) which is linked to [its subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/)
* [An extensive list of Aragon based DAOs](https://poweredby.aragon.org/)

## Current issues

* gas fees keeping small contributors from participating (but gasless and L2 solutions are currently in development for Aragon to overcome this)
* low voter turnout
* failure on executing community will
* vulnerability to malicious actors - see [The DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao)
* onboarding and including

&amp;#x200B;

## Snapshot - a ""light"" alternative

[What is Snapshot?](https://defiprime.com/product/snapshot)

&gt;Snapshot is a off-chain, gasless, multi-governance community polling dashboard

Snapshot spaces are widely deployed by well known platforms, but are not as decentralised as DAOs (off-chain and moderated by an admin group). Snapshot is easier and cheaper (for now) to deploy, manage and run.

*examples:*

* [Uniswap](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)
* [Sushi](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth)
* [PancakeSwap](https://snapshot.org/#/pancake)
* [Aragon](https://snapshot.org/#/aragon)
* [Aavegotchi](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth)

&amp;#x200B;

## Why all of this matters to us (tl;dr)

* a new model of governance is sorely needed in the light given the lack of transparency and fairness in existing governance structures
* every member in a community should have the right to propose ideas and vote, regardless of how much currency they are able to invest
* all parties involved should have equal ability to coordinate to avoid power imbalances
* automating voting and proposals on the blockchain will make tampering much more challenging and will reduce the need for vote recounts
* votes and proposals could be done anonymously with smart contracts, giving individuals at risk (or silenced by institutions) a voice
* DAO/Snapshot provide an ideal structure to **coordinate around common goals** (e.g. charity donations) while including people as equally as possible

&amp;#x200B;

## Disclaimer

I have done my best to check the background information and sources extensively (whitepapers, official about, Github pages). I try to stay neutral when covering the various projects, but I will disclose that I quite like Ethereum, Aragon and Sushi after interacting and using the platforms.

If there are any projects you think I should include, please let me know in the comments and I will edit them in :)

Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important? 😮😮,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8zzdf/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-28 00:06:05,15,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8zzdf/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION," What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."
Polyquity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/o94568/polyquity/,subwaybooligan,1,2021-06-28 03:45:24,13,/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/o94568/polyquity/,New Farm ALERT ,"# PolyQuity Protocol

PolyQuity is a fork of the Liquity protocol in the Polygon network. PolyQuity has the features and benefits consistent with the Liquity protocol. In addition, based on the concept of Liquity, we have designed a new tokenomics to adapt to the Polygon network.

## Vision

In view of the perfect system and success of Liquity, we expect PolyQuity to be the next MakerDao in the Polygon network. With the growth of Polygon network, PUSD might become one of the important Stablecoin assets.

We hope that PolyQuity would become the fundamental financial infrastructure in Polygon network.

## Core Feature

* By staking Matic assets, Stablecoin (PUSD) of zero interest-fee is minted to improve capital utilization.
* Minimum collateral ratio of 110% — more efficient usage of deposited Matic
* Governance free — all operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters are set at time of contract deployment
* Directly redeemable —  PUSD can be redeemed at face value for the underlying collateral at any time
* Fully decentralized — PolyQuity contracts have **no admin keys** and will be accessible via multiple interfaces hosted by different Frontend Operators, making it censorship resistant.
* Token (PYQ) holders can earn PUSD (Borrowing fee), Matic (Redemption fee) and PYQ (Tranfer fee).

## Main Use Cases

1. Borrow PUSD against Matic by opening a Trove.
2. Secure PolyQuity by providing PUSD to the Stability Pool in exchange for rewards.
3. Stake PYQ to earn the fee revenue paid for borrowing/redeeming PUSD and transferring PYQ.
4. Redeem 1 PUSD for 1 USD worth of Matic when the PUSD peg falls below $1

# How does PolyQuity work?

PolyQuity is a fork of the Liquity protocol in the Polygon network, so it works in the same way as Liquity, and you can refer to the official document of Liquity for more information.

## What are the main use cases of PolyQuity?

1. Borrow PUSD against Matic by opening a Trove
2. Secure PolyQuity by providing PUSD to the Stability Pool in exchange for rewards
3. Stake PYQ to earn the fee revenue paid for borrowing ，redeeming PUSD and PYQ transfer fee.
4. Redeem 1 PUSD for 1 USD worth of Matic when the PUSD peg falls below $1

## What are PUSD and PYQ?

PUSD is the USD-pegged stablecoin used to pay out loans on the PolyQuity protocol. At any time it can be redeemed against the underlying collateral at face value. Learn more about the stability mechanism.

PYQ is the secondary token issued by PolyQuity. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system and incentivizes early adopters and frontends. The total PYQ supply is capped at 100,000,000 tokens. 

## Does PolyQuity charge any fees?

There is a one-off fee whenever PUSD is borrowed, and when PUSD is redeemed:

* For borrowers, there is a borrowing fee on loans as a percentage of the drawn amount (in PUSD).
* For redeemers, there is a redemption fee on the amount paid to users by the system (in Matic) when exchanging PUSD for Matic. Note that redemption is separate from repaying your loan as a borrower, which is free of charge.

Both fees depend on the redemption volumes, i.e. they increase upon every redemption in function of the redeemed amount, and decay over time as long as no redemptions take place. The intent is to throttle large redemptions with higher fees, and to throttle borrowing directly after large redemption volumes. The fee decay over time ensures that the fee for both borrowers and redeemers will “cool down”, while redemptions volumes are low.

The fees cannot become smaller than 0.5% (except in Recovery Mode), which protects the redemption facility from being misused by arbitrageurs front-running the price feed. The borrowing fee is capped at 5%, keeping the system (somewhat) attractive for borrowers even in phases where the monetary is contracting due to redemptions. Other than that, the two fees are identical and are depicted as ""Fee"" in the following exemplary chart:  


  


## What is the Stability Pool?

The Stability Pool is the first line of defense in maintaining system solvency. It achieves that by acting as the source of liquidity to repay debt from liquidated Troves—ensuring that the total PUSD supply always remains backed.

When any Trove is liquidated, an amount of PUSD corresponding to the remaining debt of the Trove is burned from the Stability Pool’s balance to repay its debt. In exchange, the entire collateral from the Trove is transferred to the Stability Pool. 

The Stability Pool is funded by users transferring PUSD into it (called Stability Providers). Over time Stability Providers lose a pro-rata share of their PUSD deposits, while gaining a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral. However, because Troves are likely to be liquidated at just below 110% collateral ratios, it is expected that Stability Providers will receive a greater dollar-value of collateral relative to the debt they pay

**Experience the DApp**

At present, most wallets can support DApps . DApp is an abbreviation of Decentralized Application.

DApp is an application developed based on the underlying technology of the blockchain. Currently DApp is mainly concentrated on blockchains of Ethereum, EOS, TRON and IOST. The relationship between DApp and the underlying platform is similar to APP and IOS and Android systems.

That is to say, the DApp on EOS cannot run on ETH, just as APP on Android cannot run on IOS system. You can experience the decentralized integration of MakerDAO on ETH in your wallet, experience car driving in EOSRacing to get EOS in return. At present, some large-scale games are in the form of third-party APPs. When experiencing these DApps, you also need a wallet as a medium for logging in, operating, and authorization.

The popularity of DeFi services is rising, and this claim is easy to back up with hard data. According to DeFi Pulse, the total value of funds locked in DeFi applications has grown from $300 million in early 2019 to several billion in 2021.The ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) has continued to grow rapidly throughout the bull run, and currently stands at over $110 billion!

&amp;#x200B;

Lending is one of the fastest growing sectors within DEFI and is host to more than $30B in TVL. Why does this market sector continue to gain more and more traction? It’s quite simple: both the lender and the borrower can enjoy additional guarantees, all deals go through in a quick and transparent manner with no approval needed, and the system has zero bureaucracy — something that has been plaguing the traditional banking system.

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest time, MakerDAO was the dominant player in DEFI. However, with the explosion in DEFI, the lending sector has become a showcase for hosting large amounts of TVL.

&amp;#x200B;

Multi-Chain Lend (MCL) is an algorithmic money market system designed to bring secure and unique lending and borrowing opportunities like flash loans onto the Binance Smart Chain. The protocol designs are architected and forked based on Aave with revenue sharing components for liquidity providers and token holders that govern the protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiplier will launch MCL v2 by Q3 2021 with new and exciting features! Looking forward to that! More info can be found in this medium post: [https://multiplierfinance.medium.com/mcl-v2-features-4bde884c519c](https://multiplierfinance.medium.com/mcl-v2-features-4bde884c519c).

* USDT issued by the company Tether   

* USDC run jointly by Circle and Coinbase   

* DAI, fully decentralized   
P.S. This is a non-exhaustive list. And more Stablecoins will likely be added over time.   
**USDT or Tetherus**   
USDT is one of the most talked about Stablecoins. As of today, it’s market capitalization is third largest among cryptos, after  Bitcoin and Ethereum . It speaks about the popularity and the liquidity of USDT. It is widely used as trading pairs such as  BTCUSDT ,  ALGOUSDT , ETHUSDT etc.   
FYI, USDT is issued by a company called Tether, based out of Hong Kong. The company claims that the price of USDT will always remain at one  US Dollar , as each new coin minted is backed by an equivalent amount of cash or assets being added to the company’s reserves.   
**USDC or USD Coin**   
USDC is run by a joint partnership between Circle and Coinbase. One key difference between USDT and  USDC is that  USDC is based on the  Ethereum network. It came into existence to be used for DeFi or Decentralized Finance applications   
**DAI**   
DAI is an Ethereum-based stablecoin (stable-price cryptocurrency) whose issuance and development is managed by the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization.    
The price of DAI is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and is collateralized by a mix of other cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart-contract vaults every time new DAI is minted.   
**Which is the best Stablecoin**   
Although, there is no direct answer to this, different aspects can be considered to judge the usability of each coin.   
USDC is pegged 1:1 to the  US dollar , held in reserve bank accounts, and is subject to regular attestations to ensure that it stays this way. This process mitigates the market risk from the currency. On the other hand, despite being hugely popular, the transparency with USDT remains questionable.    
To counter the transparency and centralization aspect, the Stablecoin DAI came into existence. To mint DAI, one has to deposit collateral with MakerDAO. Once the collateral has been deposited in Maker, the trader can generate a certain amount of DAI.   
Therefore, DAI appears to be the best Stablecoin in terms of decentralization, transparency and averse to market or liquidity risks. However, it will definitely take some time to catch up with the popularity of USDT."
