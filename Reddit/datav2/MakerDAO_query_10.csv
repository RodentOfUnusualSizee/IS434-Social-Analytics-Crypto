"The State of Coordination, Community, and Future Impact",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/pzb54l/the_state_of_coordination_community_and_future/,mjrossman,1,2021-10-02 00:06:40,0,/r/ethereum/comments/pzb54l/the_state_of_coordination_community_and_future/,NaN,"TL;DR - Pretty simple, we have come a long way, and we're having a bunch of fun in thousands of   
similar directions, but there comes a time to reflect on what we have, what the incumbents want to keep, and why it's so important for us to coordinate on ecosystem-wide frameworks.

Firstly, I'm warning you that I'm going to shill some amazing things in the Ethereum ecosystem. I would even go so far to say as some of these things are so positive sum and self-evidently public goods that shilling them in the ethereum subreddit should be considered neutral. For example, [GitcoinDAO](https://gitcoin.co) is a place where we all have the permissionless ability to coordinate in building tools and services, like [dapptools](https://dapp.tools), for all open-source software, full stop. There's ways to fundraise in public besides joining Discord or sliding into Twitter DM's, like [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money). There is a plethora of industry leaders exploring decentralized hosting for bluechip-scale applications, such as [Skynet](https://siasky.net/).

But why in the hell am I starting off with shilling a bunch of things? Well, two recent publications started to make me think about the gravity of our success. Firstly, as many of you are aware, [Visa is testing out a stablecoin/CBDC payment channe](https://decrypt.co/82233/visa-universal-payment-channel-stablecoin-cbdc)l, similar to L2. OTOH, u/vbuterin has proposed (and there is a team implementing upon) an [account abstraction framework](https://medium.com/infinitism/erc-4337-account-abstraction-without-ethereum-protocol-changes-d75c9d94dc4a). There is a paymaster-mediated, sponsored transaction concept in this post that, imho, changes everything: 

&gt;1. Allowing application developers to pay fees on behalf of their users  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Allowing users to pay fees in ERC20 tokens, with a contract serving as an intermediary to collect the ERC20s and pay in ETH

Now, the disclaimer is that there is higher gas overhead for this framework (and we still need to scale Ethereum via sharding/rollups/PoS), but we're talking about atomically spending in a potentially more stable denomination (much like what happens on xDai). The other implication (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that protocols that offer fixed-rate appreciation of stable value also offer, depending on the transaction cost basis of which layer/chain they're situated, virtually limitless access to Ethereum. In other words, we may see an imminent future where institutions and newcomers with a predictable rate of usage can optimize the amount of upfront capital required to use Ethereum for free. (if anyone is more familiar with gasless transactions/zksnark cost basis, please correct my assumptions in the comments)  


Okay, that's all well and good, but what are the implications of Ethereum's presence from the perspective of incumbents? We've all heard the regulatory FUD revolving around DeFi, and that anticompetitive pressure is simple to understand when one considers that permissionless protocols do not bleed their potential profit margin into middlemen by default. Ethereum, as an ecosystem, is better than any financial monolith, and it has more capability to be transparently self-regulated than any government with central banking. From the present onwards, we're going to see more [banks](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/) and [corporations](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-launches-first-creator-led-nft-collection-powered-by-immutable-x) opt for using Ethereum because the social/financial benefits outweigh all risks (be they capital or regulatory). However, there will be [experimentation in reserve currencies/treasuries](https://olympusdao.medium.com/?p=d8db3052fca5) that will naturally outcompete such ventures. This is the future of France.  


Here's really where things get tricky. Because the current bull season is focused on DAO formation and development (building on NFT summer), my guess is that we're going to see a lot of competitive pressure get exerted on SMBs. Sure, it may not look like this at the moment because the missions of a majority of DAOs do not extend past the ecosystem (I'm referring, of course, to many missions that relate directly to NFT releases and DeFi protocols). However, there are DAOs that [are acquiring properties](https://twitter.com/CityDao/status/1442247714729861121) &amp; others that are forming subsidiary structures (like LLCs and C-Corps to begin with). Take the operating system that is Ethereum, the fiscal advantage of DeFi rails, and the social playbooks that are DAOs and it is only a matter of time until all common goods and services are produced by networks that can outperform monolithic structures. In an academic sense, I am confident we are demonstrating the merits of [Elinor Ostrom's  work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution), as well as addressing the theory of [transaction cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost) economic in the process. We should celebrate the accomplishments of community leaders and contributors as we stand on their shoulders to continue building the digital ""Eighth Wonder of the World"".

&amp;#x200B;

But what does all of these mean for the large picture? Well, for one, I think most people on this subreddit would agree that we should move past zero-sum activities like copying NFT drops (and generally saturating social media with exit liquidity marketing) ad nauseaum. The other priority should be to ""defeat Moloch"", in other words taking note of what's already out there so we don't split our capital and incur more costs than necessary.  Are there security concerns in siloing parts of Ethereum or introducing single points of failure? Are concepts like upgradeable proxy contracts potentially catastrophic to the ecosystem? Yes, we need to have these discussions, but additionally, we should battle-test these. It shouldn't be prohibitive to make a redundant protocol, but this sort of trend can also be complemented by coordination protocols for the public good.  Let's not facilitate the process of Ethereum being a victim of its own success by accelerating the formation of incompatible social/capital siloes.

Disclaimer: I realize that I may be drawing assumptions that are inherently flawed, and I may volunteering opinions that many do not agree with. Please comment on why you think I'm wrong; I want to hear what you think."

As a DAO, we're always looking at ways to:

* Promote xDAI as an exceptional EVM sidechain
* Grow our community with quality devs and blockchain enthusiasts
* Prudently experiment with Governance and DeFi innovations that would position our organization as a first-mover with innovative use cases and position ourselves as collective thought leaders

As it stands, for DAO-specific revenue, we lend out RxDAI to dApps that want to develop and not have to sell their xDAI-blockchained tokens, to remain fully vested in the exciting ecosystem that is xDAI, but we're also going to embrace another community-minded push: free trading on-boarding.

We have people who have expressed an interest in crypto trading, either for fun, education, or as part of their investment asset allocation strategy. At almost 1000 strong, we also have community members well-versed in this space, many who have traded professionally previously or do so to the present day. These trading veterans, as RxDAI holders, have volunteered their time to provide on-boarding tips, answer introductory questions, and provide a hand-holding experience that exists no where else without cost, if one simply joins FTX with the xDAI DAO's affiliate link. All affiliate funds will be distributed to HODLers of RxDAI in the Swapr monthly liquidity pools.

October's staking Pool is up with 25,000 RxDAI actively airdropping.

[RxDAI Swapr Oct &amp; Sept pool. Switch over monthly.](https://preview.redd.it/nnnvl6luovq71.png?width=458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c7c03a678227b6bb85f535374217b39e526246a)

One of our investment partners, who signed-up via our link, has segmented a treasury of 3x tokens held by this DAO including ETCBEAR, BNBBEAR, and many low-cost tokens that are largely trading at exactly their net asset value or better. 

These are largely purchased inexpensively, for fractions of a penny, but the power of 3x compounding, especially if a token dumps, is powerful. A crypto that increases 5% for 30 days will 4x, a 3x token for this same underlying asset will 66x. Why is this important to a risk-averse DAO? These positions can be hedged against on the spot market for 0.88% APR, virtually nothing. The ultimate payoff for this is when an asset moves quite a bit. If a $0.00001 ETCBear goes to $0.01, even if it's hedged on the opposite site, it's earning fees every step of the way as these tokens have large bid/ask spreads. Savvy 3x traders will buy them when they are below NAV and sell them when above. From an affiliate perspective, that $1 investment, which is 100% hedged earned:

* Open maker and taker position fees for 3x and spot positions
* Close maker and taker position fees for 3x and spot positions

Pretty soon, as the hedged position goes all over the place, that $1 in investment will have amassed $3, $30, $300+ in fees, of which $1 has been reverted back to the xDAI DAO from that principal investment.

This is the type of recurring model that:

* Can ignite the DAO to grow with a sustainable profitability and use this to excite a thirst for airdropped RxDAI
* Allows capital put in to be used efficiently to harvest trading fees that come as a result of crypto's characteristic volatility
* Sustains most all crypto influencers and crypto education projects handsomely.

The ultimate, albeit ambitious, goal of this DAO is to enjoy the same price-to-earns tokenization enjoyed by Aave, MakerDAO, and others, which can often surpass 200. That means that $100 in daily revenue, from RxDAI borrow fees, FTX affiliate income, and key dApp partnerships, would yield a DAO worth $3.6MM. In a crypto world where you need to unicorn with a billion dollar valuation to even get firmly into the top 100 crypto projects by market cap, this may sound modest, but growing the right way--incrementally and not hastily--is the way that xDAI, 1Hive, and the ecosystem as a whole have successfully done it: ready-aim-fire rather than fire-aim-ready.

How can I get involved?

* Monthly Airdrops (thoughtfully comment and post)
* If you do have an interest in trading crypto, using vanilla or advanced strategies, message the mods to get connected with someone who knows this ecosystem inside and out to handhold you and prevent you from making mistakes that are common getting going, like putting in a market order when you really wanted a limit. Look for a dedicated Discord later this month.
* If you're an experienced trader, you can just use the FTX affiliate link.

What are the top yield farming protocols?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/pzds5f/how_does_yield_farming_works_what_are_the_top/,KOMPWND,1,2021-10-02 02:15:40,2,/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/pzds5f/how_does_yield_farming_works_what_are_the_top/,DISCUSSION," 

Yield farming, also known as yield or liquidity harvesting, involves lending cryptocurrency. 

In return, you get interest and sometimes fees, but they're less significant than the practice of supplementing interest with handouts of units of a new cryptocurrency. 

The real payoff comes if that coin appreciates rapidly.

Here are the top 5 yield farming protocols you can invest in right now.

Aave - The best part about this protocol is that its coin is growing, so it’s good to invest in right now.

Uniswap - Recently Uniswap has registered the most number of transactions in amount as Defi TVL crossed $180 Billion.

Then there is 

Compound - It’s a Defi protocol that has been hosting various lending pools and provides an opportunity to earn interest on various cryptocurrencies.

Kompwnd - Kompwnd offers 5 different ways to earn money. But yield farming is one of the best ways to earn, as it is less risky and you don’t have to do anything. Just sit back and relax and your investment will grow.

MakerDAO - It is an unbiased price-stable currency that you control. More than 400 apps and services have integrated Dai.

Isn’t that amazing?"

It seems decentralize exchange like Uniswap exist because of arbitrage opportunities. Beside Uniswap other decentralize protocol such as Makerdao also encourages arbitrage.  

I’ve never dip my toes into arbitrage opportunities, however lately, I’ve been thinking about exploring it and try to write some arbitrage bots. My concern is do traders really make money through arbitrage opportunity? since most of the time Ethereum gas fee is high and one have to be quick enough to successfully execute the trade.  

Should I expect passive income through arbitrage opportunities?  Any insight from the expert arbitrage traders would be helpful. Thanks."

To wit: Visa unveiled a plan to make central bank digital currencies interoperable, with itself, naturally, at the center of new global monetary superhighway. Societe Generale, the French banking giant, announced it’s going to borrow 20M Dai on MakerDAO, a pretty bold move even for an institution known for avant-garde finance. And the prolific Brady Dale plumbed Twitter’s move to let its 206M users use NFTs as profile pics, a surprising tack given Jack Dorsey’s sniffy ‘tude toward non-Bitcoin crypto.

Maker may be about to blow 💨,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q0xcsv/maker_may_be_about_to_blow/,d_d0g,1,2021-10-04 11:26:17,40,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q0xcsv/maker_may_be_about_to_blow/,PROJECT-UPDATE,"I’ve been learning a bit more about all this crypto nonsense from you geniuses here, although I admittedly still don’t know shit about fuck.

After deciding I need to move from low-cost moonshots to high-quality coins, I discovered Maker (MKR). It’s a governance token built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin.

Recently MKR has made headlines by striking a potential deal that’ll likely be the largest step towards institutional adoption of DeFi to date.

[Source](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/)

It has a 1m max supply, although it’s designed to create more in the instance of an unexpected shortage. This can be confusing, but it’s design *should* prevent this from being necessary. It’s more of a safeguard, if you will.

MKR is one of the biggest contributors to the DeFi industry and over 2% of Ethereum supply is locked up in MKR. 

The DAI stablecoin is unique in that it’s decentralized, and although tied to the US dollar, it’s backed by crypto and not fiat. There are multiple advantages and unique characteristics of DAI but it’s soft-pegged and has issues slipping a few cents above or below the dollar. You can see why this would be troublesome for large transaction. This is being worked on.

Every holder of MKR is granted authority to vote on changes to the MKR protocol, which also includes management of DAI. MKR is currently priced at $2,481.66 per token with a market cap of $2,460,811,822.21.

I hope you enjoyed my shill/pump/awareness post. I also hope it helps some of you decide to look beyond moonshots and see there’s not only monetary value to be had elsewhere, but also good projects to invest in that will create a better world for our children.

Feel free to correct me or add anything you feel is important I missed in the comments. Here’s to your successful journey in crypto 🍻"

Most recently he did about a week ago in a long form post he put out:
https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html
Basically, he states that coins don't always work for governance and that the holders of a governance token shouldn't always have a say in certain things. This is mainly because MakerDAO, which started out as a stablecoin backed by DAI, is now toying with the idea of having their hodlers vote to make a loan to a company to build a solar power plant and use this loan to generate income. Yes, that could work out, but a lot of people are upset that this puts DAI at risk for possible regulation. Most didn't sign up for this when they started at MakerDAO. DAI is now at risk of having issues with regulation since it is now backed by a decent amount of centralized collateral. DAI actually may end up using some RAI to make itself more decentralized. But RAI and DAI are still somewhat competitors.

Stablecoin regulation is coming, RAI is the going to have massive adoption once this happens. Every DeFi protocol + Big brain like Vitalik knows this is the case. This is why if you have been paying attention to DeFi, you can see every large protocol is now trying to incentivize RAI in some way. The DeFi people know that if stablecoins get rugged, the whole space could collapse. RAI is important for the resilience of the crypto space. Lots of moves being made by the protocol and team in the past month and a half. FLX is still down in price from when Vitalik first admitted he held the token, back in May. It didn't get much of a run since the entire market crashed literally a day or two after he said this."

How to actually DYOR about DeFi and where to begin,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q2ml16/how_to_actually_dyor_about_defi_and_where_to_begin/,Beechbone22,8,2021-10-06 23:17:10,28,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q2ml16/how_to_actually_dyor_about_defi_and_where_to_begin/,DISCUSSION,"There was a post about how you can't really DYOR and determine if a crypto asset has actual value or utility and I intended to post a comment there but it got longer ans I thought it was better to just post this. The world of DeFi is pretty much endless and there are new projects popping up every day, but I've noticed that most people are quite DeFi illiterate, even about the basics. If you are a degen yield chaser zoomer bridging to a new chain every week and always chasing the next liquidity incentive program, shitcoin farm or flavor of the week chain, this isn't for you. This is for the people stuck in 2017, and people holding AAVE on their CEX account with 0 on chain transactions.


Many people can't actually research and understand protocols because they don't understand where it fits in the puzzle. Before you can do your own research you should learn about the current DeFi landscape such as dominant money markets on different L1s, different DEXes and the niches they fill, liquidity incentive programs, different yield aggregators and DEX aggregators, insurance protocols, synthetics, collateralized debt positions, liquidity pools and other DeFi primitives . Learn about them and then go and actually use them. See what the UX is like. The same goes for NFT platforms or different L1s, nothing teaches you about crypto and DeFi faster than actually using it. Otherwise you won't have a clue about what a particular protocol or L1 brings to the table. For example, if you aren't familiar with Compound, AAVE, Maker and other money market / synthetic stable platforms, you shouldn't expect to understand the value proposition behind Liquity's interest rate or the efficiency of its liquidation mechanism. Just understanding what you're investing in isn't enough anymore. You should thoroughly understand the current crypto landscape and compare your investment in relation to competitors that are trying to fill a similar niche. I see hundreds of posts and comments shilling scalable and inexpensive L1's because ""it's very scalable and solves the trilemma"" without actually having a single on chain transaction using that particular L1 or any of the dApps in its ecosystem. Don't invest in something you don't use unless it's Bitcoin, because honestly who the fuck actually makes more than a handful of Bitcoin transactions a year? But it's still Bitcoin.


Just to make it clear, this is not a guide explaining the current DeFi landscape, it's a guide about how to go about researching it and it should serve as a starting point for your research. Go and actually learn about these, read blog posts, watch videos, read whitepapers or even better, use them.


If you're looking for a place to start, first of all, you should probably learn about bluechip DeFi protocols on Ethereum. These are:


Uniswap: The most dominant decentralised exchange on Ethereum. V2 had the standard constant product Automated Market Maker that was forked a million times and subjected to vampire attacks on Eth and other EVM compstible chains. V3 has a novel approach to AMM's (that has once again been replicated by other protocols), where liquidity is concentrated on a limited range set by the user and swap fees are structured in different tiers. V3 is much more capitally efficient for LPs and also more efficient for the users.

Curve: Another decentralised exchange. Capitally efficient liquidity pools for different assets pegged to the same asset or different derivatives of the same underlying asset, allowing LPs exposure to yield bearing pools without impermanent loss. Examples are swaps between different stablecoins, synthetic tokens and base tokens, liquid staked ETH and regular old ETH. They also have new pools for volatile assets such as the atricrypto pool. Also very multi chain friendly, they have already expanded to multiple EVM compatible side chains including Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche as well as ETH L2's such as Arbitrum. This is also true for a couple other platforms. AAVE and Sushiswap are also famously multi chain friendly with AAVE having recently launched on Avalanche in addition to Polygon. Sushiswap is on every EVM compatible side chain under the sun but support Sushi incentives only on a couple of them.

Sushiswap: Yet another decentralised exchange. It started as a fork of Uniswap V2 with a vampire attack prior to the launch of UNI token. After some troubled times, it has now become one of the multi chain DeFi bluechips. Sushi team works faster than almost any other DeFi team I've seen. Sushi is no longer just an AMM, they also do isolated lending on borrowing via money markets (Kashi), flash loans, an IDO launchpad and they have an upcoming AMM (Trident) which caters to different niches filled by Uniswap V3 (concentrated liquidity), Curve (stable asset swaps) and Balancer (customizable multi asset pools). 

Balancer: Also a DEX. Liquidity pools with a custom number of assets and a custom ratio between them. It opens new avenues for LPs who are looking to diversify their DeFi holdings while also functioning as a standard AMM.

Note: You don't have to use these protocols individually, there are DEX aggregators like Paraswap and 1Inch that pool liquidity from all these different sources and automatically route your orders through the liquidity pools with the best price, ensuring you buy low and sell high.

Compound: A money market and the protocol that kicked off DeFi summer and yield farming as we know it. Also nototiously suffered from a bug very recently that allowed millions of dollars worth of COMP tokens to be minted and distributed essentially for free. You can lend crypto assets to earn interest and borrow against your crypto via collateralized debt positions, achieving greater capital efficiency on holdings.

AAVE: Another money market like Compound where you can borrow and lend crypto. Currently winning the multi chain money market race IMO. There are also differences with the allowed collateral, collateral ratio at which liquidation occurs, differences in UX, etc. 

MakerDAO: Issuer of DAI, which is a synthetic stable asset minted using other cryptoassets as collateral, and pegged to the U.S. Dollar. It used to be a much more decentralized option, but since USDC became available as collateral, more than 60% of the collateral used to mint DAI has become USDC, which is a custodial, centralized stablecoin issued by Circle. That means an existential threat to USDC is an existential threat to DAI and thus Maker. However unlikely that is, it's still additional risk introduced by a centralized system on top of the smart contract risk posed naturally by DeFi.

Yearn: ""The yield engine of DeFi"". Is managing different collateralized debt positions, claiming liquidity incentive rewards and reinvesting them, chasing higher yields and optimizing debt ratios, LP positions too much of a hassle or too expensive? Yearn is a yield optimizers envisioned to address these concerns without spending gas. It invests the asset you deposit and automatically harvests, compounds and if necessary switches strategies if a higher yield is possible and takes a cut of the profits. This happens in the background without the need for user intervention. Convex is another notable competitor whose TVL has skyrocketed recently, they can also be considered one of the dominant yield aggregators on Ethereum. Both have a highly intertwined and symbiotic relationship with Curve and they both create a lot of the demand for CRV due to its staking mechanisn and they also provide a lot of the TVL for Curve. The yields aren't as degen as other yield aggregators on side chains and alternative L1s, but it's a battle tested protocol running on a battle tested network, offering much better yields than CeFi.

Synthetix: Like it says on the tin, synthetics. Synthetic stocks, crypto assets, commodities, minted using the platform's native token as collateral.

Maybe Bancor? as it has decent value proposition in limiting IL exposure.


Remember that a successful protocol's token doesn't necessarily make a good investment. The native tokens of the dApps mentioned above have vastly different tokenomics, revenue models and rights for holders. For example, UNI is purely a governance token. The only way to price it is speculatively and it depends on how much speculative premium the market is willing to pay for governance rights. The token's price performance doesn't necessarily have to correlate with the success of the protocol. But SUSHI, for example, when staked as xSUSHI, entitles holders to part of the revenue generated by Sushi AMM pools and other Sushi products along with the LPs themselves. The token is also distributed as an incentive to liquidity providers. This means that the market automatically prices the token with the revenue / volume generated by the protocol as staking APY increases if Sushiswap volume increases relative to token price. If the trading volume of the DEX goes up, it naturally drags the price of the token up. Assets like CRV have even fancier tokenomics and staking mechanisms which involve different voting escrow periods for staked tokens and differing liquidity reward multipliers for different amounts of CRV staked. You should always keep these in mind when considering native tokens of protocols as investments.


This list is by no means a complete one but understanding how each of these dApps work will give you a basic understanding of DeFi primitives and how newer protocols and L1s ""fit in"". There are also more innovative products that don't fit in under the above protocols. There are insurance protocols, tokenized real world assets, tokenized future yield and self repaying loans and a million other applications people haven't even thought of yet. Most of these applications leverage DeFi composability and are a good example of ""money legos"" that DeFi brings to the table.


If you want to understand the ecosystems of different L1s, go to defillama.com, and sort protocols by TVL while filtering for different L1s. Explore them, try then out and follow the narrative. Follow where the liquidity is flowing.

Read whitepapers, understand the tokenomics. Twitter posts or Telegram groups aren't actual sources but they can lead you in the right direction. Certain Discord ervers do contain a lot of insightful discussions and research. This sub is probably one of the worst sources of ""alpha"". It's fine to shoot the shit but don't actually take advice from Reddit. People who know what they're talking about very rarely make Reddit posts on this sub about it, though certain niche subreddits may be helpful. Discord servers of even small projects are usually decently active and most devs I've spoken to are surprisingly responsive. Talk to the devs and ask questions directly to them if possible and make sure you understand where a particular asset derives its value from. Don't be afraid to dive into the nitty gritty of it and get technical. Is it a pure governance token, does it have cashflow rights, is there something funkier going on? These are important considerations. Audits aren't everything but they're nice to have.

Also, as a side note if you're planning on using DeFi on cheaper EVM compatible chains (because ETH can obviously be prohibitively expensive for smaller holders). I highly recommend Anyswap as a cross chain bridge for stablecoins and ETH. It's a decent way to quickly move your liquidity around without too many steps and too many fees between side chains and ETH L2s. Xpollinate, Celer C bridge, etc. fulfil a similar purpose so you might want to shop around."

Addressing deleveraging spiral?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defiblockchain/comments/q3qy9z/addressing_deleveraging_spiral/,thereforetl,1,2021-10-08 13:09:48,4,/r/defiblockchain/comments/q3qy9z/addressing_deleveraging_spiral/,Question,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01304.pdf

Since Defichain is taking inspiration from MakerDao’s loans, how will we deter deleveraging spirals when correlated collateral (dBTC, dETH, DFI) drastically drop in value? This paper states that there is no stable price region for over collateralized non custodial stable-coins unless the collateral is a submartingale. A submartingale is the process such that something’s expected future value is greater than or equal to the current price. Therefore, deleveraging spirals is a risk when the price of DFI and correlated cryptocurrency collateral is not expected to go up. MakerDao addresses this issue by allowing USDC to be used as collateral. This provides protection against deleveraging spirals, but sacrifices decentralization and introduces exogenous counterparty risk. 

This paper proposes two possible solutions:
1. Introduce uncorrelated assets as collateral like USDC. 
2. Increase speculator demand. People must continue to bid up DFI. 

They also suggest introducing a pool to buffer against deleveraging—this is detailed in the Discussion section of the paper. 

In my opinion Defichain is not at risk for the same exact deleveraging spiral that MakerDao’s DAI experienced in March 2020 because Defichain doesn’t have keeper bots to liquidate and it doesn’t seem like we’ll be able to liquidate for free. 

What is everyone’s opinion how we should address this?"

I have done some research and found a few coins but it’s really hard to find reliable information about these projects. 

One of the projects I found was MahaDAO. It’s a project based out of India and it’s on the polygon network. Upon going through their website and other information It seems to be a MakerDOA version but only that instead of DAI stable coin they have a inflation resistant stable coin called ARTH. ARTH’s value is basically 5percent Bitcoin x 80 percent fait x 15 percent some-other asset. Prospects wise it looks good because they have staking, and other returns. And if MakerDAO is any indication of value then MahaDAO could Atleast be 1/4 of makers value. It’s really early stage. They pretty much launched in jan 2021. 

But the Reddit page threw me off. There is just this one guy posting and the posts really look like shilling to me. More digging is needed. 

It’s incredibly hard to find good projects still in the budding phase to invest and make a decent amount of profit. One reason for that is the number of nee coins and tokens popping up. 

3-5 years ago there were like 1000 coins and it was hard finding projects then itself. Now there are over 10000 projects and a lot more defunct ones which we will never know about."

I've connected multiple  DDs written on what could be a sleeping giant.

Take your time and enjoy the read. Sources at the end.

# What is ERG? A hint at fair tokenomics

    Price at time of writing:  $10,4
    Market cap at time of writing as per CMC:  $335m
    Would-be price as a current top 10 (doge cap of 32b): $1.120,00

Ergois a is a GPU mineable cryptocurrency coin (not token) based on the Proof of Work Autolykos v2 consensus algorithm. Ergo has its own network and blockchain. **Ergo did not hold any ICO in the launch and the genesis block started fairly without any VC funding**. Ergo first went live on Waves and was mineable as the Ergo First Year Token (EFYT).

There were **no pre-mined coins reserved for the Ergo Foundation**. Ergo’s ecosystem is funded through a distribution model that designates  10% of the mining rewards to the Ergo Treasury until the end of 2nd year (of the mainnet launch). From this point onwards, the Treasury allocation will be halved every month for 6 months, afterwhich the Treasury will cease to receive any further allotment from the protocol. At the end of the distribution schedule, the **Treasury funds represent only 4.37% of the total ERG supply**. This model helps to build full decentralization.

The **total coin supply is hard-capped at 97 million ERGs** with an emission schedule of 8 years. This timetable, which is contrary to Bitcoin’s never-ending emission schedule, might seem very brief. However, Bitcoin is programmed to distribute 75% of its supply during the first 8 years, so Ergo’s emission design is not too far-off from Bitcoin’s. Rather than develop a protocol that continually mints coins as rewards for building the blockchain, Ergo has adopted a new and novel incentive for miners in the form of Storage Rent.

The **ERG coin is the base layer currency for building and using smart contracts**. 

Every type of transaction such as NFT minting, smart contract deployment, and swaps will essentially be signed with ERGs. The circulation of coins therefore will be boosted even with other ecosystems choosing to use the Ergo Blockchain. With more DeFi services such as cross-chain DEX and oracle pools, the future sustainability of Ergo tokenomics will be secured.

Let's find out the bull case for erg!

# The Road to Top 10 Cryptocurrency

If you are like me you understand that the move-fast-and-break-things approach that plagues the cryptocurrency ecosystem is detrimental to long term sustainability. The basis for my strong belief in [Ergo](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/ergo) and [Cardano](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/cardano) comes from their approach to code implementation: **research twice, implement once**.

Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardanop, once said he believes Ergo to be a [top 10 cryptocurrency ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9wpPiWuJNk)project. The community surrounding Ergo have been hanging on to that statement ever since. Today we hash out perspectives as to why that is possible and why a multi-billion dollar Ergo might be right around the corner.

## The Ethereum Miners Perspective

It's no surprise that the implications of [EIP-1559](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783) to the [Ethereum](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/ethereum) ecosystem unearthed controversy and disdain within its community. So what is EIP-1559?

An overly simplistic explanation of EIP-1559: its the restructuring of Ethereum's gas-management and monetary system to improve the UX by introducing the BASEFEE (BF) mechanism. The BF mechanism is at the base-layer which removes third-party price suggestions, and is based off the utilization of the Ethereum network.

These BF's do not go to the miners. If you want to pay for a quicker transaction you can tip the miners similar to CashApp or Venmo ‘Instant Transfer’ utility. The BF's are burned and therefore create deflation.

This disincentivizes miners to participate in the ecosystem because they are less profitable which effectively prices out GPU miners for ASIC miners, falling closer and closer to centralization. This will drive a number of miners to projects that will protect its interest on the protocol level and bring that project considerable growth.

Ergo is well positioned to attract these miners with [Autolykos v2](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/autolykos-v-2-details/480), a PoW algorithm built by Ergo that implements progressive memory-hard computation which make it ASIC resistant.

In June when EIP-1559 passes this will provide a home for non-industry miners who have been essentially priced out of Ethereum's mining mechanism. That’s not to say industry-grade miners wont also have a home here as well, because they too will be out of a job once [Ethereum 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/) comes and transitions to PoS. 

What is better than having a strong project to mine with a bright future ahead to run your business on?

# The Consensus Perspective

It is fundamentally true that above all other consensus mechanisms, [Proof-of-Work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work) is the most rigorously well-tested and studied. Its also true that PoW can enable centralization by super-efficient or pooled mining resources, but Ergo has preemptively solved these issues with Autolykos ([learn more in the forum](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/autolykos-v-2-details/480)).

Ergo will also have on-chain voting that can address issues such as [energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/) as network usage grows.

As an aside, this isn't to say that a [Proof-of-Stake](https://www.coindesk.com/proof-of-stake) mechanism is inferior to PoW, or even superior.

For instance, a PoS mechanism is open to [Byzantine attacks](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained) from distributed systems and malicious coordination between validators because coins are inextricably linked to network security.

[Cardano](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/cardano) has solved these issues with [Ouroboros](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/), but there is still the issue of network siphoning when financial products from DeFi protocols begin offering more attractive instruments than the inflation rate from staking rewards.

The point here is mainly that all consensus protocols can be improved upon, and just as Cardano has done with PoS, Ergo is doing with PoW.

It is beneficial to recognize that PoW and PoS is not a zero-sum game. They are both growing on non-linear trajectories rather than having superiority over each other. One could look at Autolykos as a superior PoW model to Bitcoin, just as one could look at Ouroboros as a superior PoS model to PeerCoin.

In the end, it's wise to invest in both trajectories — and we believe Ergo is doing a superior job than most in the PoW space.

## The Scripting Perspective

To understand how transactions are handled under the hood of Ergo we must take a brief peek under the hoods of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## BitcoinScript

Bitcoin uses what is called [BitcoinScript](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/what-is-bitcoin-script/). BitcoinScript is a stack-based scripting language that works in FILO (first-in-last-out) which means when transactions occur the necessary scripts stack on top of each other and execute from top to bottom.

The person who initiated the transaction needs to prove that certain statements in the transaction are true for the transaction to execute. This means validation happens on-chain, *i.e.* by each full node in the network.

BitcoinScript does not allow for the notion of state, which means there is no knowledge of the current global state of transactions, instead they reference previous transactions.

For example, when a user wants to know their wallets account balance, the wallet doesn't have full knowledge of the state of the blockchain. Instead, it follows the linked transactions all the way through the blockchain and adds up all the unspent transaction outputs (UtxO) and displays it to the user.

In essence, it *only* has the state of those linked transactions.

## Solidity

Ethereum uses a smart contract language of its own design called [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/). Solidity is an object-oriented language with a stack-based execution environment that executes on chain. But, unlike Bitcoin, also allows for Turing-completeness.

That means a Solidity smart contract can solve any algorithm or problem but with one caveat, **it gives no guarantees regarding how long it will take or how much memory it will use**.

How do they prevent bad actors from writing malicious programs that eat up network space? Create a pay wall in the form of gas fees. This decision, without thinking far into the future, gives us the really high gas fees we are experiencing now (some reaching as high as a single $ETH, currently valued at $2,380).

I can hear you now, ""*Wait, so you're saying gas fees aren't inextricably linked to validating transactions on a blockchain?""*

Yep, that's what I'm saying — crazy right?

## ErgoScript

Now, what if there was a way to combine first principles from Ethereum and Bitcoin in a way that allowed Turing-complete smart contracts, notion of global state, *and* no gas fees?

Enter, [ErgoScript](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf).

A scripting language that is robust enough to support things like loops, recursion and DoS prevention, ErgoScript is proven to be Turing-complete compatible while also using the UtxO model like Bitcoin.

Now, I say Turing-complete *compatible* because the scripting language is complex enough to allow for programs to be overlaid on top of those scripts in a Turing-complete way.

This means we can now estimate with accuracy the script complexities themselves before execution, eliminating the need for gas fees. Yes, **no gas fees**.

ErgoScript will also allow for the implementation of another novel and intuitive design concept: extended unspent transaction output, or EUtxO. [EUtxO](https://files.zotero.net/eyJleHBpcmVzIjoxNjE4NDIwODg3LCJoYXNoIjoiYTVhYmY4NjdiY2E2YzdkNTNjODkwNWNmZDZhYmM5MjAiLCJjb250ZW50VHlwZSI6ImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uXC9wZGYiLCJjaGFyc2V0IjoiIiwiZmlsZW5hbWUiOiJDaGFrcmF2YXJ0eSBldCBhbC4gLSAyMDIwIC0gVGhlIEV4dGVuZGVkIFVUWE8gTW9kZWwucGRmIn0%3D/da09c4a41d131fca5f59fdf1b5a7e77b1eef2a9c1b00e2cdf99199baa7d09989/Chakravarty%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20The%20Extended%20UTXO%20Model.pdf) provides the solution for BitcoinScript's lack of global state awareness. This means at any point a smart contract or user can access the latest global state of the blockchain without the memory-hardness of Ethereum’s accounting model.

## The DeFi Perspective

The decentralized finance perspective requires some in-depth research into the stablecoin and DEX landscape as a whole, so while this section may be lengthy, bare with me. It is important to build a foundational understanding of the space to better understand Ergo's unique position in DeFi.

We break this section into 2 main pillars:

1. StableCoins &amp; the AgeUSD Protocol
2. Decentralized Exchanges &amp; Automated Market Makers

## StableCoins

Perhaps surprisingly, the introduction of [stablecoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp) into crypto brought a modicum of distrust in investor sentiment, which largely influenced its sidelining during the [2017 ICO boom](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/initial-coin-offering-explained-ethereum-ico).

Speculators and investors alike cycled out of [altcoins](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/altcoins) and into Ethereum, Bitcoin and cash, some never to return again. As [regulations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/12/20/stable-coin-regulation-with-a-focus-on-the-stableact/?sh=6d6794d33e5a) and sentiment shifted in favor toward the big stablecoin protocols like Tether (formerly RealCoin) and USDC, the option to sell your profits into a stablecoin and earn a yield became useful.

It's my prediction that this current bull-run will not see the exodus to cash much like we did in 2017 but a shift to stay within the crypto ecosystem via stablecoins.

As it stands, the current stablecoin environment is broken into 4 pillars:

1. Off-chain-collateralized
2. On-chain-collateralized
3. Un-collateralized
4. Hybrid

To understand the nuances, its helpful to get some real-world examples of each:

## Off-Chain Collateralized

Tether ($USDT) is an example an off-chain collateralized stablecoin as it is pegged to the dollar deposited in central banks.

The un-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin narrative is building momentum as its counterparts have notable flaws. Off-chain fiat collateralized stablecoins are counter-intuitive to the ethos that underpins the crypto industry, yet they currently dominate.

They are also subject to centralization, counter-party risks, and regulatory constraints which was tangibly evident in the latest round of [regulation bouts between the SEC](https://medium.com/coinmonks/tether-settles-with-sec-john-mcafee-indicted-for-crypto-pump-17066483266b) and Tether.

## On-Chain Collateralized

MakerDAO ($DAI) is an example of an on-chain-collateralized stablecoin as it is backed by deposits of other cryptocurrencies.

On-chain-collateralized stablecoins also have major flaws which stem from the volatility of the crypto markets. This volatility can cause events much like [Black Thursday](https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6), a massive liquidation event in the MakerDAO protocol due to the black swan liquidity crisis caused by Covid-19.

Absolutely colossal amounts of ETH were liquidated from MakerDAO vaults with ZERO auction-bids (*i.e.* free ETH due to network congestion), oracle price discrepancy, and the sharp Ethereum sell-off. The amount of ETH gamed from MakerDAO from ‘keepers’ who took advantage of the volatility in a non-competitive auction is equal to $130 million dollars with today's current ETH prices.

Uncollateralized stablecoins are typically smart contracts on the blockchain and therefore require an oracle to feed data to the smart contract to govern the algorithms, which leaves them open to manipulation.

## Un-collateralized

NuBits ($NBT) is an example of an un-collateralized stablecoin as its price is stabilized via [algorithms](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stability-elasticity-and-reflexivity-a-deep-dive-into-algorithmic-stablecoins/) that respond to price volatility.

In the interest of brevity, let's simply say these are mainly experimental.

## Hybrid

[AgeUSD protocol](https://github.com/Emurgo/age-usd) is an example of a hybrid stablecoin that is algorithmically stabilized *and* collateralized on-chain (*i.e.* crypto-backed).

But, before we discover how the novel AgeUSD protocol works I would like to preface that AgeUSD is not a solution to all the above problems. But, using sound mathematics instead of dynamic transaction handling, AgeUSD aims to provide a higher assurance alternative than existing counterparts.

With that said, we believe it's a serious contender in the pursuit of true stablecoins in the cryptocurrency space. Because of that, we look deeper into what it has to offer and why its uniquely positioned to work well on the Ergo blockchain.

## AgeUSD Protocol

AgeUSD takes a hybrid approach in a design model that focuses on key concepts from traditional finance and legal compliance. Remember, Ergo aims to be a platform for financial smart contract applications, it is in their best interest to develop their suite of products in a legally compliant way.

AgeUSD’s hybrid model is also the first of its kind with two pillars from which the protocol stands on; the stablecoin itself (SigmaUSD) and the reserve coin (SigmaRSV).

## SigmaUSD

SigmaUSD is the first and only algorithmic stablecoin to run on the EUTxO model.

SigmaUSD distinguishes itself from other crypto-backed stable coins like MakerDAO by not implementing collateralized-debt positions (CDPs). These CDPs leave MarkerDAO users susceptible to untimely forced-liquidations from unstable price thresholds that are vulnerable to blockchain congestion.

So how does AgeUSD work differently?

Let’s say a user wants to purchase [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/) with their ERG token (this will work the same way with [ADA](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/ada) as well, when supported). They would send their ERG to a smart contract and the smart contract would use an oracle to determine the exchange-rate from your ERG to SigmaUSD. As the smart contract is sending out the SigmaUSD stablecoin to users, it is simultaneously building up a reserve of ERG.

How do price fluctuations in ERG affect the reserves in the contract when users who sell their SigmaUSD and get their ERG back?

First, it would be correct to assume that if the price of ERG went *up* after you sent them to the smart contract, you would receive less ERG back when you exchange them back for ERG. You would also be correct to assume that if the price of ERG went *down* after you sent them to the smart contract, you would receive more ERG.

But, wouldn't that mean the reserves would be subject to shortage? Yes, but the novelty of the protocol lies in the introduction of SigmaRSV, an incentivized alternative in which a user on the ERG blockchain can choose variability over stability by providing liquidity to the reserves of the SigmaUSD contract.

## SigmaRSV

A user will be able to purchase SigmaRSV with their ERG token (this will also work the same way with ADA, when supported). By purchasing SigmaRSV the user is sending their ERG to the SigmaRSV smart contract and an oracle determines the exchange-rate from your ERG to SigmaRSV token.

The SigmaRSV smart contract will then link the dollar value of the ERG tokens within the contract to the SigmaUSD smart contract and allow the equivalent SigmaUSD to be minted for users of the SigmaUSD contract.

This creates an interesting dynamic where holders of SigRSV who provide liquidity to the SigmaUSD reserves will benefit *in opposition* to SigmaUSD users when ERG price fluctuates. Put more plainly, when [ERG token](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/erg) prices rise a SigmaRSV holder benefits, whereas a SigmaUSD holder does not — and vice versa. Another incentive for SigmaRSV holders is that they will receive rewards from transaction fees within the AgeUSD protocol.

## Stability vs. Variability

For a more concrete example, if Alice enters into SigmaUSD with $100 dollars worth of ERG and mints the exchange-rate of SigmaUSD – as close to $1 dollar as possible – and Bob enters into SigmaRSV with $100 dollars worth of ERG and mints the exchange-rate of SigmaRSV and the price of the $ERG token then goes up, the following will happen:

1. Alice, who wants to sell her SigmaUSD for ERG, will use the SigmaUSD she previously minted – hypothetically $100 dollars worth – and purchase the ERG token at a higher price, therefore receiving less ERG.
2. Now there is more ERG in the reserves because Alice could not afford to purchase the same amount of ERG she originally minted SigmaUSD for.
3. The SigmaUSD smart contract holding the ERG that Alice could not afford to buyback is now called by the SigmaRSV contract holding the ERG exchanged for SigmaRSV by Bob when Bob wants to sell his minted SigmaRSV.
4. By diluting the supply of the ERG he deposited to the contract he can purchase more ERG with the same minted SigmaRSV with a net gain. This works in the opposite way if prices drop.

This novel dynamic provides an ecosystem of stability and variability through game-theory, math, and incentives. This disables susceptibility to blockchain congestion which consequently nullifies the ability to force-liquidate liquidity providers (LPs) with zero competition.

The AgeUSD protocol is one of the most long-term sustainable approaches I have come across to date, but only if the ERG token has reached its full market potential and is less prone to market volatility. I suspect this will come simultaneously with the maturation of the crypto market as a whole.

## Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)

The introduction of [automated market makers ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm)(AMM) has brought the use of decentralized exchanges (DEX) to the forefront of the crypto industry and has been the catalyst for the recent [decentralized finance](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) (DeFi) movement.

An AMM is an algorithm that allows participants to partake in trading and swapping cryptocurrencies in a trustless environment. This is done by participants providing liquidity to liquidity pools in a trading pair like ETH/USDT, with algorithms in smart contracts acting as the buyer for exchanges to be made.

This replaces the need for orderbook-based exchanges where a market maker orders buy and sell orders based off price and outside influence.

&amp;#x200B;

An AMM has the advantage of providing liquidity to fragmented markets and illiquid assets as long as there are liquidity providers. The disadvantage is when there aren't liquidity providers, [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) and [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) from arbitragers pose significant threat to both exchange users and liquidity providers.

Also, because most DEX’s like Uniswap, 1inch, and Bancor run on Ethereum (and as we discussed earlier, due to Ethereum’s design approach, are subject to the massive fees that come with it) small traders are priced out. Large traders are also prone to high fees from slippage as well.

Order-book based DEX’s are way too prone to manipulation like [wash trading](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/wash-trading/), order book front-running, and pump-and-dumps because they cannot be regulated like centralized exchanges.

With that being said, order book based DEX’s do thrive if the market is liquid enough because transaction fees are low compared to AMM’s, regardless of the blockchain it is run on.

Both AMM and order book DEX’s suffer from ‘rug pulls’ (when bad actors launch a project for early investors and drain the funds from the smart contract) from [ICO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp)’s and [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering)’s.

## ErgoDEX

[ErgoDEX](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-dex) is another testament to the power of the EUtxO model as it will allow both AMM *and* order-book based exchanges using liquidity pools.

This can't be done with the account-model or the barebones UtxO model as there is no notion of state across blocks. This will allow ErgoDEX to utilize the advantages of both models, and because of its design architecture will benefit from very low fees as gas is not intrinsic to computation in Ergo.

ErgoDEX will also support seamless atomic swaps (swapping tokens across blockchains), without the use of [wrapped assets](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-wrapped-tokens), gateways or trust-based bridges.

If that wasn't enough, the DEX will also support buyback orders to reduce exposure and risk for ICO/IDO investors. This approach allows investors to set block-times representing the amount of funds the token issuer can utilize in a given period and allowing investors to buyback their investment if they are unsatisfied.

This is another novel development from Ergo.

## DeFi Summary

All of these facets — stablecoin protocols, AMMs and DEX offerings — position Ergo to be radically equipped to solve many of the current DeFi pains currently plaguing the crypto space.

## The Oracle Perspective

As it stands the current market for oracles has been largely cornered by [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), a cryptocurrency project that blossomed from the 2017 ICO boom. Chainlink captured the first-mover advantage by introducing the ability to bring data outside of the blockchain to be utilized in a variety of ways via a smart contract and sits at a massive valuation of $13.4 billion dollars at the time of writing.

It's important to note that the founder of Ergo, [Alex Cherpunoy](https://thedailychain.com/ergo-with-founder-alex-chepurnoy/), helped develop Chainlink with Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis when the project was still called smartcontract.com.

Before that, Cherpunoy was creating the frameworks for DEX’s and tokenized assets before Vitalik Buterin even came out with the Ethereum [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/5/ethereum-whitepaper). It goes without saying that Cherpunoy is one of the most experienced developers in the entire blockchain industry and is more than capable of understanding the importance of oracles to decentralized finance.

Chainlink set the standard for oracles in blockchain but over time has highlighted many issues within the oracle space. Currently, oracles can be considered private entities that provide data for blockchain users in a trusted manner – which does not satisfy the argument for decentralized design. This framework of trust in data-feeding oracles has led to doubt of data reliability both in terms of accuracy and posting schedule.

## Oracle Pools

The partnership between Ergo and [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/) finds it too important that oracles not rely on centralized sponsorship and instead be designed to bolster public participation. Within the oracle pool framework, unlike existing oracle providers, all data handling happens on-chain. This means that data is not paid for using a separate utility token like Chainlink, but rather the blockchain’s native token which provides simpler economic incentives.

The way this happens is by utilizing the UTXO model in which an oracle pool, which has multiple oracle providers within, will post their data inside of a UTXO to a smart contract that aggregates all the oracle providers data.

The smart contract will average all the data points and produce a UTXO with the final datapoint and post it to the blockchain for anybody to use for the cost of a transaction fee. This is separate than traditional “pay-to-play” oracle provider models. It also opens the door for economic incentive as data providers within an oracle pool have a pledge to the pool that can be taxed if that data provider provides bad data or fails to provide any data. This model allows for so much more flexibility than existing oracle providers by enabling governance, strict posting-schedule via an epoch-based program, and democratized data finality.

This novel mechanism is the gateway for oracle providers to produce cheap off-chain data that will actually enable traditional financial smart contracts to be written in a cost effective way, allowing traditional financial companies to be more profitable.

## Summary: Code Twice, Implement Once

Much like Cardano, Ergo has spent the past few years with their head's down researching and developing the most elaborate and beautiful foundation for a smart contract platform in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

With developers like Robert Kornacki and Alex Cherpunoy at the helm — building a framework that will support a full suite of novel financial smart-contract products for the traditional world, both retail and enterprise alike — Ergo is finally stepping out from their dimly lit coding rooms and into the mainstream.

With the core development having mostly been finished, the cries from loyal Ergo investors for marketing and exposure is now being answered. Now that you know just how revolutionary the technology behind Ergo is, and the problems it solves, prepare yourself for its eventual entrance into the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

## 

## Ergo Ecosystem

**Sigmaverse:** [sigmaverse.io](http://sigmaverse.io/) is the decentralized applications hub of the Ergo Ecosystem.

**Oracle Pools:** Oracles are the messengers of blockchain networks. They connect off-chain and on-chain data and create the backbone of DeFi systems. Ergo has an UTXO based approach to oracles with [oracle pools](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-27-chainlink-oracles-vs-ergo-oracle-pools/) that will be cheaper and easier to access for decentralized information.

**SigUSD:** [Ergo’s algorithmic stable coin](https://sigmausd.io/#/) application is based on the AgeUSD protocol. Smart contracts secure SigUSD’s peg to the US dollar by backing it with SigRSV reserve coins.

**ErgoMixer:** UTXO based systems have strong privacy features and [ErgoMixer](https://github.com/ergoMixer/ergoMixBack) is a tool for people who want to protect their digital anonymity.

**Ergo Auction House:** Ergo’s NFT marketplace can be accessed at [ergoauctions.org](http://ergoauctions.org/). Users can trade visual and audio NFTs easily with a non-custodial wallet.

**ErgoUtils:** Community made multi-purpose tool [ergoutils.org](http://ergoutils.org/) is where users can mint NFTs, create custom tokens and use mixer-hops for privacy needs.

**Zero-Knowledge Treasury:** Ergo’s [zero-knowledge vaults](https://github.com/anon-real/DistributedSigsServer) are for mutual expenditure and multi-signature wallets; it’s a decentralized on-chain version of a collective bank, or an organization.

**ErgoNFTs**: A community made NFT display application where you can [check](https://ergonfts.org/) your own NFTs.

**NIPoPoWs**: Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work provide side-chains with light clients and enable cross-chain computations. Ergo.Meta, which is a cookbook for sidechains, will be soon published by Kushti.

## Wallets that are endorsed by Ergo:

[Ergo Full Node Wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node)

[Yoroi Web Wallet](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)

[Android Wallet](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-29-ergo-for-android-released/) (a mobile wallet on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ergoplatform.android))

## Exchanges - where to buy

ERG is currently listed on gate.io, coinex, bitcoin.com, waves.exchange, swop.fi, biki TradeOgre, HotBit, and KuCoin. ErgoDex will be launching very soon and the Ergo team is continuing to work on additional listings with other exchanges.

"I'm Rune Christensen, co-founder of MakerDAO and former CEO of the Maker Foundation. Ask me anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/q60iif/im_rune_christensen_cofounder_of_makerdao_and/,Rune4444,1,2021-10-12 01:06:53,99,/r/MakerDAO/comments/q60iif/im_rune_christensen_cofounder_of_makerdao_and/,NaN,"Hello everyone, I'm Rune and used to be the number 1 shitposter and full time community manager on this subreddit back maaany years ago when it was the main place for long form discussion and decision making in the Maker community.

I recently left the Maker Foundation after it fulfilled its mission and began the last stage of complete dissolution, and following that I posted the Case for Clean Money on the Maker Forum, which is my take on the path the Maker Community should take going forward to stay true to its original values while charging ahead at the forefront of DeFi and bring the wonders of this movement to the mainstream.

You can check out the (very, very long) post here: [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684)

You can also listen to this (very, very long) podcast on bankless where I go into deep detail about both the Clean Money case as well as other recent and relevant topics. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1880RYS9f2Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1880RYS9f2Y)

The overarching idea is split into three parts:

1. First of all I believe MakerDAO needs a clear vision that can turn it into a purpose-driven DAO and help the community to set aside their differences and instead just collaborate to produce results. There is no better or more suitable purpose for a world currency, than trying to fix the catastrophic damage the financial system is right now doing to itself. DeFi and especially a decentralized stablecoin is the perfect coordination tool to help humanity try to overcome this self-destructive tendency caused by excessive short term thinking. This is not just a charity case, I believe this is also the most self-interested and profitable path for the Maker community and MKR holders to take, as it will provide the greatest amount of attention and branding amongst regular people in the real world (tesla is a good example of how well this can work in practice), political resilience (as climate is increasingly becoming the number 1 political issue in many countries), but also the massive changes that will happen to the world because of climate change are undeniable, and being able to tap into Climate Alpha which will determine which assets will be valuable in the future, and which ones will become stranded, is critical in order to create a currency that will hold up and even thrive, when the consequences of climate change finally cause the dominoes to begin to fall for real.
2. To really tap into the value and potential of the Clean Money vision, I propose a new set of very aggressive tokenomics upgrades, including issuing a lot of MKR and using it for growth, such as providing profitable yield farming to ETH vault users where the DAO distributes MKR, but gets even more cash income in return that can then power the tokenomics and benefits of holding MKR. The other key aspect is to provide very attractive direct benefits to long term MKR holders through a system called the Sagittarius Engine that will enable MKR holders to lock up their MKR and either use it as collateral for loans at 0%, or some other benefit such as high APR direct cash payments. The goal is to encourage MKR holders to lock up their MKR for the long term, and in doing so push them over the edge to begin to become more vocal and actively involved community members that can help control and be a check on the governance bureaucracy. We can use aggressive tokenomics to target some ambitious goals, such as getting 10% of the entire ETH supply locked as collateral in Maker, and get 50% of the entire MKR supply locked up long term in maker governance and be highly active community members that help regulate and secure the system and its bureaucracy. Overall I believe this will massively increase the value for current MKR holders today, including myself, especially if we combine it convincingly with the Clean Money vision as this will allow for a massive influx of a new generation of community members that are inspired by the vision, and financially locked for the long term through the tokenomics system. I think we can aim to 100x the number of active community participants and voters that are just regular MKR holders and not in core units or getting paid by the protocol in some special way. Only with such high numbers of regular MKR holders working together and with aligned incentives can we achieve the last goal.
3. An overhaul of the Governance processes and mechanisms that builds on top of what already exists, but improves it and makes it more transparent and efficient. I think on this subreddit we often see a lot of frustration with the lack of transparency around the budgets going to the core units - as a regular MKR holders it often feels like it's just a black hole sucking up value with providing any sort of benefit in return. In reality there is a huge amount of value being created, especially now as the Core Units have started to really hit their stride - but there is no denying that it absolutely critical that MKR holders are in charge. Maker Governance needs to be by MKR holders, for MKR holders, and while we need to increase the resources and budgets that are provided to Core Units a lot more, this needs to be done in the context of systematically ensuring that all work that is done is clearly providing a positive ROI, and this is communicated clearly, and transparently up front before any work is done, with professionals following up and helping the community to continuously assess whether the work that is being done is actually providing tangible value, so the community can cut off projects that aren't delivering, and redirect value to the core units that are providing the best possible return.

My goal with coming back here to this subreddit is that I hope it can once again become a vibrant and central place for deep and detailed Maker Governance and community discussions, and help act as a place where regular MKR holders can coordinate to monitor the performance of the governance bureaucracy, and mobilize to take combined action when there are things that can be improved.  


So to get things started I just want to signal that I will be a lot more active here, and then answer any questions you might have about the topics above, or anything else related to maker or some of the ongoing decisions that are happening in Governance right now."

# How MakerDAO can Leverage Decentralized Notifications

MakerDAO is a decentralized protocol that lets users generate Dai against a variety of crypto assets locked in a specialized smart contract called Vault. The project was built with a long-term goal of unleashing the full potential of DeFi by bringing innovative financial tools to the ecosystem.

For Maker, it all started with the vision to one day truly decentralize the protocol. And in July, Rune Christensen, Maker Foundation CEO, announced that MakerDAO had achieved complete decentralization.

To achieve this, the protocol has a two-tier voting system in place. In the first tier, a poll is created on the governance portal to establish a consensus among the community members. The second tier entails a process where an executive poll is created for community members to vote on technical changes proposed to the protocol.

In this context, all the community members need to keep a constant watch on the governance portal or social channels to be informed whenever a new poll is created. Failure to do so might result in missed voting chances and overall less community participation.

By enabling decentralized push notification for the community through EPNS, Maker Governance participants will be able to more easily stay informed of governance-related activities.

# What Does the Collaboration Warrant?

By partnering with the MakerDAO Development and UX (DUX) Core Unit, we aim to build a proper communication medium between the network and users. This will reduce users’ dependency on third-party media and ensure that they receive timely polling and governance updates. This, in turn, will reduce friction and ensure that all users participate in the network governance. Users can subscribe to receive notifications whenever:

* A new poll is created
* A new executive proposal is created
* A poll ends
* An executive proposal ends
* An executive proposal is passed

As MakerDAO continues working towards revolutionizing DeFi, we are pleased to be partnering with them in an effort to improve the network’s communication with its users. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the Maker protocol.

By Alan Wunsche, CEO TokenFunder

  
“The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” - William Gibson

  


  
Welcome to the 2020’s — the Digital Asset Decade.

  
We’re about to experience a decade of unprecedented financial transformation and wealth creation, driven by powerful new technologies and regulatory reforms the likes of which we haven’t seen since federal securities laws were created as part of the New Deal after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

  
Over the past decade, a shiney new home for the financial capital markets (“markets”) has been imagined, designed, and is getting ready for investors all over the world to move in. The new market is a bold financial innovation and its architects are financial technologists who stand on the shoulders of the internet pioneers who created the free movement of information and the mathematicians who invented cryptography. The new markets’ foundations and structure have been beta tested for the last few years and we’re close to setting a move-in date, sometime in the 20's.

  
The important feature is that all investors will be invited to benefit from this fintech innovation in the decade ahead.

  
Why the change?

  
By most accounts, our legacy financial markets and their stabilizing regulatory architecture have served us well for the past century. Following the crash of 1929, new securities distribution and trading rules of the 1930’s provided necessary investor protections for the investing public. The rules also created something we now know as “public markets”, and we think of “publicly-traded” companies as being mostly exchange traded and with more liquidity than what we historically have called “private markets”.(what’s the difference?). (note: adding to our label confusion, the public sector has traditionally meant “the business of the government”; the private sector has traditionally described all other companies and private citizens; and the private-public partnerships PPPs)

  
But now, after nearly a century of economic and technological development, the periodic structural renovations to these markets have been showing their age. For a variety of good reasons and in the spirit of investor protections, much of the “public” has been limited from participating in the private markets in favour of accredited investors (Regulatory side note: SEC Proposes to Update Accredited Investor Definition to Increase Access to Investments), making the tensions of wealth concentration and relative inequalities between public and private markets more evident and urgent. (see also : The Private-Market Investing Revolution, McKinsey&amp;Company)

  
Today, an innovative combination of technologies makes it possible to drive more liquidity to the “private” markets and unlock what we’ve thought of as less liquid markets. We’re embarking on a decade of financial market transformation that will remove the legacy distinctions between “public” and “private” markets, creating opportunities for new wealth generation for everyone.

  
By 2030, private capital markets will be public once again.

  
“The technology industry is the place where wealth gets originated and then gets spread out but increasingly the Wall Street financiers are coming to Silicon Valley to invest in companies before they get to Wall Street. By the time a company goes public, you can pretty much bet that anybody who had any connections, who had any appetite, who had any capability, got a bite at it. So if you’re buying a tech company when it goes public you are literally last in line. Not to say you can’t make money but the odds are way down because this fruit has been picked over many many many times.” Naval Ravikant

  
Using our legacy terms, “private markets” have not been accessible enough to the middle class public. That’s about to change.

  
Ethereum’s smart contracts made digital assets — also known as crypto-assets due to their cryptographic foundation— possible and easy. Once an Ethereum standard (known as ERC-20) was defined for what a crypto-asset smart contract program should contain, there was no stopping the imagination. These assets were not limited to being a new form of money, as that was too limiting. Not only could anything of value be represented as a smart contract (and these programmable digital assets would become known generically as “tokens”) on a globally available blockchain, but other smart contracts could facilitate the autonomous exchange of these tokens amongst users.

  
With the ERC-20 standard in place, projects around the world sprung up to launch Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”), often with little more than white papers and smart contracts that could autonomously accept a user’s cryptocurrency and exchange it for a project token that might have some future project value.

  
There was no broker or stock exchange involved in ICOs — it was permissionless and direct investing that generated what were often described as protocol tokens of their specfic projects. There also weren’t any investor protections yet “crypto-friendly” jurisdictions opened their arms to ICOs. Although it was clear that most ICO’s would be deemed unregistered (illegal) issuance of financial securities (stocks or bonds that represent rights of ownership or creditorship and are often traded in secondary markets) this signaled the future of global blockchain-enabled investing. (Note: Ethereum launched as a decentralized protocol from Switzerland and its native currency, Ether, has subsequently not been deemed a security.)

  
The Netscape Moment for capital raising and investing had arrived:

  
The public blockchain became a digital asset settlement mechanism and it became obvious that this technology could be the backbone to replace legacy exchanges with an always-on, secure, auditable, next generation trading exchange.

  
Once projects started launching their tradable, liquid project tokens from countries outside of the traditionally regulated securities, it was clear that blockchain technology was on a collision course with legacy financial markets and securities regulators.

  
In fact, securities regulators around the world soon realized that:

  
“Tokenization is the process of digitally representing an asset, or ownership of an asset. A token represents an asset or ownership of an asset. Such assets can be currencies, commodities or securities or properties.” IOSCO 2019 Report

  
2018–2019: Initial Token Offerings and Security Token Offerings

  
Companies with a unique blend of capital markets vision and technology expertise such as Canadian-based TokenFunder realized that there could be a regulatory-compliant opportunity to help private companies leverage digital assets without creating a new platform cryptocurrency. TokenFunder’s team envisioned representing legal financial securities such as stocks and bonds as digital assets, and so worked closely with newly formed innovation-friendly regulatory sandboxes such as the OSC LaunchPad and the Canadian Securities Administrators Regulatory Sandbox.

  
In 2018, with regulatory exemptions, TokenFunder launched Canada’s first initial token offering on a public blockchain. Rather than creating a cryptocurrency, TokenFunder issued a ground-breaking security token with future rights outlined in an Offering Memorandum. All categories of investors were invited to participate.

  
In 2019, TokenFunder subsequently established TokenGX as Canada’s first security token exempt market dealer. Then in the fall of 2019, TokenGX became the first Canadian company approved by the OSC to build a blockchain-powered secondary trading exchange for the security tokens of future private issuers on the platform.

  
It was now clear that new digital asset technologies, launched with appropriate investor protections in mind and regulatory, could make private market securities very efficiently tradable, peer-to-peer.

  
Under the right conditions, private markets could finally be as liquid as legacy public markets.

  
2020’s Outlook: Decentralized Finance Matures

  
Looking forward to how tokenization will impact the markets in the 20's, imagine transposing the original bitcoin vision onto financial securities with a version for capital markets such as:

  
“a purely peer-to-peer version of financial markets would allow securities to be traded directly by one party with another without going through a stock exchange.”

  
The core technologies actually exist today, and early implementations go by the names of 0x, Loopring, Uniswap. They’re called “decentralized exchange” technologies under the umbrella term of “decentralized finance” (DeFI). DeFi has its own early innovators such as MakerDAO, Compound, Argent, and TokenSets, with more being invented monthly.

  
Decentralized exchanges are rapidly evolving and although many are currently focused on unregulated cryptocurrencies, a very small number of companies are pioneering this technology to the regulated capital markets.

  
In Canada, for example, after extensive platform development, TokenGX was approved by the Ontario Securities Commission to operate what will soon be launched as “FreedomX”, a next-generation regulatory-compliant hybrid securities trading platform with the best practices of Know-Your-Client and Know-Your-Product responsibilities of a broker-dealer to issue securities and govern a secondary trading marketplace.

  


  
TokenFunder/TokenGX’s innovative model achieves the radical efficiency, security and scale by combining the non-custodial distribution of the purchased securities directly to an investor’s digital account with a peer-to-peer trading platform to empower all investors to buy, sell and settle securities using smart contracts without any involvement of the platform. Being non-custodial means the platform never has the investors’ keys, so the exchange smart contracts only respond to the investors’ digital signatures to execute their trading instructions. Both platform components respect the KYC process that investors complete during onboarding. The result — a very efficient low cost platform that can scale using the global reach of a public blockchain.

  
Before digital assets, investors used to be forced to sign and store share subscription PDF’s to invest in private market securities, and the infrastructure required various custodians, transfer agents, and centrally managed settlement databases. And, since it made more economic sense for larger investments, this kind of investing used to be limited to wealthy, accredited investors.

  
Now that next generation platforms like FreedomX (powered by [TokenFunder.com](https://TokenFunder.com))  can digitize the financial securities like stocks and bonds into legally binding, tradable tokens, the overall infrastructure cost burden will be greatly reduced and investing in the private markets will be possible for everyone, even with smaller funds.

  
This will be the real dawn of democratized investing.

  
For issuers that use end-to-end platforms such as [TokenFunder.com](https://TokenFunder.com)  to offer their shares and other securities, they’ll be able to access real-time cap-tables and communicate company updates for their investors right on the platform. If issuers wish to distribute dividends their investors, it’s as straightforward as sending the dividends directly to the investors’ digital account, or offer dividend reinvestment plans with new security tokens issued without any intervention. These issuer services will be offered as straightforward subscription services.

  
In the 20’s, this investing model will be applied to all markets and assets classes including alternative investments. Real commercial property such as buildings could be tokenized and be easily owned by millions. Tokenized portions of residential homes could be held in digital asset accounts and subsequently traded when liquidity is desired.

  
It’s easy to imagine that by 2030 any asset of any value will be digitized and legally tradable in global digital asset marketplaces, secured by blockchain technology. The model will have fewer intermediaries and be over 90% more efficient.

  
And finally, beyond capital itself, imagine the ultimate loyalty program in which retailers give ownership in the form of digital assets directly to their customers’ digital asset account as a loyalty benefit. We can expect that Employee Stock Ownership Programs will be a viable template for Customer Share Ownership Programs… designed for rewards and retention.

  
The 20’s will be the Netscape Moment for capital markets, as digital assets empower a new wave of innovation in finance and trade.

  
Conclusion

  
With a digital asset architecture in place, we look ahead at the 2020’s and see some clear signals:

  
Efficient digital asset infrastructure has the potential to finally democratized investing and solve some of the current inequality problems.Peer-to-peer trading of digital assets will unlock liquidity of traditionally less liquid markets.Legacy distinctions between public and private capital markets will become meaningless. In fact, every company will have the opportunity to be “publicly-traded”.The regulatory challenges of moving to digital asset trading are solvable and forward-thinking securities regulators are addressing them. Where liquidity is desired for digital assets, we already have the financial and non-financial information disclosure frameworks in place.

  
Like the introduction of the internet of information before them, digital assets are a once-in-a-generation invention. They’re here and it’s an exciting time to imagine the future of capital formation and financial markets in the 21st century.

“The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” - William Gibson

  


  
Welcome to the 2020’s — the Digital Asset Decade.

  
We’re about to experience a decade of unprecedented financial transformation and wealth creation, driven by powerful new technologies and regulatory reforms the likes of which we haven’t seen since federal securities laws were created as part of the New Deal after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

  
Over the past decade, a shiney new home for the financial capital markets (“markets”) has been imagined, designed, and is getting ready for investors all over the world to move in. The new market is a bold financial innovation and its architects are financial technologists who stand on the shoulders of the internet pioneers who created the free movement of information and the mathematicians who invented cryptography. The new markets’ foundations and structure have been beta tested for the last few years and we’re close to setting a move-in date, sometime in the 20's.

  
The important feature is that all investors will be invited to benefit from this fintech innovation in the decade ahead.

  
Why the change?

  
By most accounts, our legacy financial markets and their stabilizing regulatory architecture have served us well for the past century. Following the crash of 1929, new securities distribution and trading rules of the 1930’s provided necessary investor protections for the investing public. The rules also created something we now know as “public markets”, and we think of “publicly-traded” companies as being mostly exchange traded and with more liquidity than what we historically have called “private markets”.(what’s the difference?). (note: adding to our label confusion, the public sector has traditionally meant “the business of the government”; the private sector has traditionally described all other companies and private citizens; and the private-public partnerships PPPs)

  
But now, after nearly a century of economic and technological development, the periodic structural renovations to these markets have been showing their age. For a variety of good reasons and in the spirit of investor protections, much of the “public” has been limited from participating in the private markets in favour of accredited investors (Regulatory side note: SEC Proposes to Update Accredited Investor Definition to Increase Access to Investments), making the tensions of wealth concentration and relative inequalities between public and private markets more evident and urgent. (see also : The Private-Market Investing Revolution, McKinsey&amp;Company)

  
Today, an innovative combination of technologies makes it possible to drive more liquidity to the “private” markets and unlock what we’ve thought of as less liquid markets. We’re embarking on a decade of financial market transformation that will remove the legacy distinctions between “public” and “private” markets, creating opportunities for new wealth generation for everyone.

  
By 2030, private capital markets will be public once again.

  
“The technology industry is the place where wealth gets originated and then gets spread out but increasingly the Wall Street financiers are coming to Silicon Valley to invest in companies before they get to Wall Street. By the time a company goes public, you can pretty much bet that anybody who had any connections, who had any appetite, who had any capability, got a bite at it. So if you’re buying a tech company when it goes public you are literally last in line. Not to say you can’t make money but the odds are way down because this fruit has been picked over many many many times.” Naval Ravikant

  
Using our legacy terms, “private markets” have not been accessible enough to the middle class public. That’s about to change.

  
Ethereum’s smart contracts made digital assets — also known as crypto-assets due to their cryptographic foundation— possible and easy. Once an Ethereum standard (known as ERC-20) was defined for what a crypto-asset smart contract program should contain, there was no stopping the imagination. These assets were not limited to being a new form of money, as that was too limiting. Not only could anything of value be represented as a smart contract (and these programmable digital assets would become known generically as “tokens”) on a globally available blockchain, but other smart contracts could facilitate the autonomous exchange of these tokens amongst users.

  
With the ERC-20 standard in place, projects around the world sprung up to launch Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”), often with little more than white papers and smart contracts that could autonomously accept a user’s cryptocurrency and exchange it for a project token that might have some future project value.

  
There was no broker or stock exchange involved in ICOs — it was permissionless and direct investing that generated what were often described as protocol tokens of their specfic projects. There also weren’t any investor protections yet “crypto-friendly” jurisdictions opened their arms to ICOs. Although it was clear that most ICO’s would be deemed unregistered (illegal) issuance of financial securities (stocks or bonds that represent rights of ownership or creditorship and are often traded in secondary markets) this signaled the future of global blockchain-enabled investing. (Note: Ethereum launched as a decentralized protocol from Switzerland and its native currency, Ether, has subsequently not been deemed a security.)

  
The Netscape Moment for capital raising and investing had arrived:

  
The public blockchain became a digital asset settlement mechanism and it became obvious that this technology could be the backbone to replace legacy exchanges with an always-on, secure, auditable, next generation trading exchange.

  
Once projects started launching their tradable, liquid project tokens from countries outside of the traditionally regulated securities, it was clear that blockchain technology was on a collision course with legacy financial markets and securities regulators.

  
In fact, securities regulators around the world soon realized that:

  
“Tokenization is the process of digitally representing an asset, or ownership of an asset. A token represents an asset or ownership of an asset. Such assets can be currencies, commodities or securities or properties.” IOSCO 2019 Report

  
2018–2019: Initial Token Offerings and Security Token Offerings

  
Companies with a unique blend of capital markets vision and technology expertise such as Canadian-based TokenFunder realized that there could be a regulatory-compliant opportunity to help private companies leverage digital assets without creating a new platform cryptocurrency. TokenFunder’s team envisioned representing legal financial securities such as stocks and bonds as digital assets, and so worked closely with newly formed innovation-friendly regulatory sandboxes such as the OSC LaunchPad and the Canadian Securities Administrators Regulatory Sandbox.

  
In 2018, with regulatory exemptions, TokenFunder launched Canada’s first initial token offering on a public blockchain. Rather than creating a cryptocurrency, TokenFunder issued a ground-breaking security token with future rights outlined in an Offering Memorandum. All categories of investors were invited to participate.

  
In 2019, TokenFunder subsequently established TokenGX as Canada’s first security token exempt market dealer. Then in the fall of 2019, TokenGX became the first Canadian company approved by the OSC to build a blockchain-powered secondary trading exchange for the security tokens of future private issuers on the platform.

  
It was now clear that new digital asset technologies, launched with appropriate investor protections in mind and regulatory, could make private market securities very efficiently tradable, peer-to-peer.

  
Under the right conditions, private markets could finally be as liquid as legacy public markets.

  
2020’s Outlook: Decentralized Finance Matures

  
Looking forward to how tokenization will impact the markets in the 20's, imagine transposing the original bitcoin vision onto financial securities with a version for capital markets such as:

  
“a purely peer-to-peer version of financial markets would allow securities to be traded directly by one party with another without going through a stock exchange.”

  
The core technologies actually exist today, and early implementations go by the names of 0x, Loopring, Uniswap. They’re called “decentralized exchange” technologies under the umbrella term of “decentralized finance” (DeFI). DeFi has its own early innovators such as MakerDAO, Compound, Argent, and TokenSets, with more being invented monthly.

  
Decentralized exchanges are rapidly evolving and although many are currently focused on unregulated cryptocurrencies, a very small number of companies are pioneering this technology to the regulated capital markets.

  
In Canada, for example, after extensive platform development, TokenGX was approved by the Ontario Securities Commission to operate what will soon be launched as “FreedomX”, a next-generation regulatory-compliant hybrid securities trading platform with the best practices of Know-Your-Client and Know-Your-Product responsibilities of a broker-dealer to issue securities and govern a secondary trading marketplace.

  


  
TokenFunder/TokenGX’s innovative model achieves the radical efficiency, security and scale by combining the non-custodial distribution of the purchased securities directly to an investor’s digital account with a peer-to-peer trading platform to empower all investors to buy, sell and settle securities using smart contracts without any involvement of the platform. Being non-custodial means the platform never has the investors’ keys, so the exchange smart contracts only respond to the investors’ digital signatures to execute their trading instructions. Both platform components respect the KYC process that investors complete during onboarding. The result — a very efficient low cost platform that can scale using the global reach of a public blockchain.

  
Before digital assets, investors used to be forced to sign and store share subscription PDF’s to invest in private market securities, and the infrastructure required various custodians, transfer agents, and centrally managed settlement databases. And, since it made more economic sense for larger investments, this kind of investing used to be limited to wealthy, accredited investors.

  
Now that next generation platforms like FreedomX (powered by [TokenFunder.com](https://TokenFunder.com))  can digitize the financial securities like stocks and bonds into legally binding, tradable tokens, the overall infrastructure cost burden will be greatly reduced and investing in the private markets will be possible for everyone, even with smaller funds.

  
This will be the real dawn of democratized investing.

  
For issuers that use end-to-end platforms such as [TokenFunder.com](https://TokenFunder.com)  to offer their shares and other securities, they’ll be able to access real-time cap-tables and communicate company updates for their investors right on the platform. If issuers wish to distribute dividends their investors, it’s as straightforward as sending the dividends directly to the investors’ digital account, or offer dividend reinvestment plans with new security tokens issued without any intervention. These issuer services will be offered as straightforward subscription services.

  
In the 20’s, this investing model will be applied to all markets and assets classes including alternative investments. Real commercial property such as buildings could be tokenized and be easily owned by millions. Tokenized portions of residential homes could be held in digital asset accounts and subsequently traded when liquidity is desired.

  
It’s easy to imagine that by 2030 any asset of any value will be digitized and legally tradable in global digital asset marketplaces, secured by blockchain technology. The model will have fewer intermediaries and be over 90% more efficient.

  
And finally, beyond capital itself, imagine the ultimate loyalty program in which retailers give ownership in the form of digital assets directly to their customers’ digital asset account as a loyalty benefit. We can expect that Employee Stock Ownership Programs will be a viable template for Customer Share Ownership Programs… designed for rewards and retention.

  
The 20’s will be the Netscape Moment for capital markets, as digital assets empower a new wave of innovation in finance and trade.

  
Conclusion

  
With a digital asset architecture in place, we look ahead at the 2020’s and see some clear signals:

  
Efficient digital asset infrastructure has the potential to finally democratized investing and solve some of the current inequality problems.Peer-to-peer trading of digital assets will unlock liquidity of traditionally less liquid markets.Legacy distinctions between public and private capital markets will become meaningless. In fact, every company will have the opportunity to be “publicly-traded”.The regulatory challenges of moving to digital asset trading are solvable and forward-thinking securities regulators are addressing them. Where liquidity is desired for digital assets, we already have the financial and non-financial information disclosure frameworks in place.

  
Like the introduction of the internet of information before them, digital assets are a once-in-a-generation invention. They’re here and it’s an exciting time to imagine the future of capital formation and financial markets in the 21st century.

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

What is Flare FLR Spark Songbird SGB Network Finance in a nutshell smart contracts NFTs - use cases - earn free rewards coins passive income,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/qao4rm/what_is_flare_flr_spark_songbird_sgb_network/,samsimon123,1,2021-10-18 22:46:26,0,/r/FlareNetworks/comments/qao4rm/what_is_flare_flr_spark_songbird_sgb_network/,NaN,"Flare direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs. Songbird is open systems and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. It's super cheap fees (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Use cases: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl is game changer and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty."

DeFi has actually expanded to use brand-new support to a large range of capitalists as traditional financial investment offerings do not look appealing. The introduction of the coronavirus pandemic positioned a substantial concern on the international economic climate. Based on this circumstance, reserve banks around the globe established incredibly low-interest prices to relieve off the stress.

"Swarm and its ""Bzzaar"" Bonding Curve",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethswarm/comments/qc4pa9/swarm_and_its_bzzaar_bonding_curve/,ethswarm,1,2021-10-21 00:24:09,4,/r/ethswarm/comments/qc4pa9/swarm_and_its_bzzaar_bonding_curve/,NaN,"A comprehensive description of the insights of the single faucet of BZZ Token, explained in detail.

https://preview.redd.it/yjh2x01brmu71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ab4434bbfd51fa449dc7cdedcba8b5b7295e430

Live since June, [*Bzzaar*](https://bzz.exchange/), an exchange platform launched as a means to buy and sell BZZ, takes a unique approach to kickstarting a new token economy. Unlike typical buy and sell platforms, Bzzaar doesn’t rely on traditional market makers for users to exchange BZZ but rather makes use of a *bonding curve* to instantaneously complete transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fhdy3ruermu71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb22d77fc4dfedde2a271f17a76007ea94496500

New projects can easily call the contracts to their own interfaces allowing the creation of a front-end modal to hold the exchange. With this, projects that require BZZ can provide their users with an exchange interface that calls the Bzzaar’s contract functions. **The bonding curve belongs to the community and serves to fuel all and any project created on Swarm.**

### What Is A Bonding Curve?

A bonding curve is a mathematical function in the form of y=f(x) that determines the price of a single token, depending on the number of tokens currently in existence, or the market supply. The key difference is that with a traditional exchange platform market makers are required to provide liquidity to the market, whereas a bonding curve takes over the role of providing liquidity, negating the need for market makers.

&gt;ELI5 — Bonding curves are smart contracts that can mint or burn tokens according to a previously determined equation. The equation is a graphable curve that defines the relationship between the token’s price and its supply — where the price of a token increases with supply.

Let’s elaborate on this. On a traditional exchange, market makers use the available pricing data of users wanting to buy and sell tokens, actively adjusting the price so that token purchases and sales can happen instantaneously. Users can set buy and sell orders to ensure that transactions only occur when a token reaches a certain price, and unfortunately, this may never occur.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1. A traditional market maker exchange platform](https://preview.redd.it/qdacj5dirmu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd14014324a1807c7a1c986e1ddc5292911609f)

With the Bzzaar’s bonding curve, new tokens are minted when purchased by users and burned when sold to the exchange. This creates an autonomously fluctuating exchange where the price is actively adjusting. As users buy tokens, the price of the next token increases, and only decreases when users sell tokens back to the bonding curve. Since the bonding curve equation is known, token prices are predictable and are dependent on the market supply at any given moment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2. How a bonding curve determines token prices](https://preview.redd.it/qqypbc4nrmu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b95e39126b2cc4259e80d03a2d5892c2b7b0f108)

### A Summary Of The Benefit Of Bonding Curves

Besides the speed at which purchases and sales take place, a bonding curve has a few other benefits:

* **Resilience to manipulation:** The Token’s value is far more resilient to outside influences attempting to manipulate its price, such as pump and dump schemes. This is because the bonding curve protects users from panic selling by ensuring every token is sold at a predictable price.
* **No third-party market makers:** Since the price of each token is predetermined by the bonding curve, there is no need for any market makers. The bonding curve itself acts as an automated market maker.
* **Immediately reacts to demand:** Since the bonding curve can mint and burn tokens, the price of a token is immediately adjusted to its demand.

**Fair distribution:** Bonding curves have no validators, negating the need for additional tokens to be minted as validator rewards. This leads to no inflation rate or inflation scheduled. Node operators are rewarded from the existing token pool for providing bandwidth and storage to the ecosystem.

### Using a Bonding Curve

Now that we have discussed what a bonding curve is, let’s look at how you, as a user, can interact with the bonding curve. The most basic calculation we can make using the bonding curve is calculating the most cost of one token at the current token supply. All we have to do is substitute the current token supply value in for x (or s) in the equation

However, users will rarely want to purchase a single token, and calculating the individual cost of each token they want to purchase can become tedious. Let’s look at an example where a user wants to buy b amount of tokens when the current token supply is at a;

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3.The area under a curve](https://preview.redd.it/8aa7o8ysrmu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122a6c2ecfe0fc6c178ed6b1a65eaeda3e195dee)

We know that if we add the value of each value for token supply from a to a+b together, we can calculate the area under a curve. This is impractical for large purchases; an easier method is to use calculus. In calculus, the area under a curve is determined by taking the integral of your function.

For example, our function (not the actual price function of bzzaar) takes the form of:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xzabectzrmu71.png?width=103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e45428ad36416325cb80959e223f0598bbbf094

The integral of our function will then be:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/29ac6bt2smu71.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c200454ff3744a22146fd290491e9931053922c2

Where y is the total cost of purchasing b amount of tokens.

The same technique can be used to help users calculate how much they would receive when selling b amount tokens back to the bonding curve:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgtbuxh5smu71.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=212c47e3b52d70dde0a8976567b23682ef44119b

### How Bzzaar’s Bonding Curve Works

The Bzzaar maintains its own mathematical function to determine the price of a single BZZ token. To understand how the bonding curve function works, we must first discuss chunks.

All data uploaded to Swarm is automatically split into chunks and stored across several Bee nodes, where it is hashed. A *chunk* is the canonical unit of storage in Swarm and consists of a maximum of 4 kilobytes of data. In order to upload data, users will need to buy batches of *postage stamps.* Each chunk requires a postage stamp, as each stamp attaches a value of BZZ to the chunk. Stamp batches are created in buckets with a depth of 16. Swarm’s entire address space is divided into 216(65,536) different buckets.

Unlike most other ECR-20 tokens, Swarm uses 16 decimal places. This was done to ensure calculations in the bonding curve contract are gas-efficient while maintaining a human-friendly nominal scale of 1100, and 1 on the atomic scale. As a result, in a situation where every BZZ token is sold to the bonding curve, the price of the very first BZZ token minted will be 0.01 DAI.

Now we can take a closer look at the bonding curve equation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tbykc7v9smu71.png?width=228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49963e279c94fc9c4d663279eea177af1ab7b821

Where *p* is the price of a single BZZ token, *s* is the current supply of BZZ, accurate to 16 decimal places, and *c* is a fixed constant of 6.25×1023.

The integral of p is:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2kdtx33csmu71.png?width=248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856134665c089e997bb4cb54242b2135be86bc00

A large amount of initial collateral was required to activate the bonding curve. Through initial token sales, and minting additional tokens after the fact, **a total of 66,208,125 BZZ tokens was sold to generate a total collateral of US$ 3,364,662.** With the amount of collateral generated and token sold, the launch price of a BZZ on the Bzzaar was 1.92 DAI. To prove the supply of BZZ at 1.92 DAI, we can simply substitute 66,208,125 for s in the bonding curve equation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1nafhj3fsmu71.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ab852e97ab840d531d06e5753b7b3651d5a762

### Maximum Supply

There is a hardcoded theoretical maximum supply of 125 million BZZ tokens. The high polynomial order of the bonding curve makes it highly unlikely that this theoretical maximum will ever be achieved due to the associated costs. To illustrate these costs, we can set a circulating supply amount to a theoretical value of 120 million BZZ, or 96% of the maximum supply.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x0h2xwgismu71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ad2f36229717543ec596069867554e1d9abf7d

This shows us that the 120th million BZZ token minted would cost 687 million DAI.

We can visualise the high polynomial order of taking several values for the maximum supply, and how each value affects the market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

### Bonding Curve Emergency Shutdown

The bonding curve is self-sustaining and does not require any external input to function . However, there are three critical situations in which an emergency shutdown may get triggered:

1. A critical or exploitable bug is discovered in the bonding curve contract;
2. MakerDAO discovers a critical bug or is shut down for any reason; and
3. DAI loses its peg to the USD.

The decision to trigger an emergency currently belongs to the Swarm Foundation.

"MIT Bitcoin core developers and researchers apply for and receive $50,000 grant from The Graph Foundation, a community-governed organization for the The Graph (ticker: GRT), a widely-adopted decentralized indexing protocol",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd5ue3/mit_bitcoin_core_developers_and_researchers_apply/,graph_marine,1,2021-10-22 09:03:53,15,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd5ue3/mit_bitcoin_core_developers_and_researchers_apply/,MARKETS,"**Background:**

The Graph is an incentivized indexing protocol for the entirety of Web 3.0. To describe what this means, let's say you were opening a bookstore. You have two options: you can either stack all of the books randomly on the shelves for customers to search through manually, or you can organize the books in several different ways (alphabetical order, by topic, by author, by genre, etc.)

Before The Graph, Ethereum and other blockchain networks were sort of like the first example - just an unorganized blob of random data. The Graph's protocol enables users from around the world to organize (index) data on blockchains and makes it easier for developers to retrieve such data. Prior to this innovative solution to unorganized ""big data"" on-chain, developers had to organize all on-chain data manually before creating their decentralized applications (dapps). This would take months-years to complete, in addition to significant developer energy/resources. Multicoin Capital, an early investor in many prominent blockchain networks and dapps such as Solana, describes The Graph's ability to scale reads and writes on-chain as [one of the most, if not the most, powerful tools in the blockchain developer stack](https://multicoin.capital/2021/07/30/scaling-reads-and-writes/). Kyle Samani, the founder of Multicoin, says The Graph is [probably the most requested piece of infra(structure) in the Solana ecosystem](https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1433276276714975232?s=20).

Now, using The Graph, on-chain data is significantly easier to access and retrieve, which allows developers to allocate more of their time creating dapps rather than wasting it on building the database that the dapps require to function. This is why there was a ""big boom"" of dapps (mainly DeFi apps) in 2019, right after The Graph launched its protocol. Examples are vast and include Uniswap, Sushiswap, Aave, Pancakeswap, Synthetix, Compound, MakerDAO, USDC, iExec, PoolTogether, Audius, Dodo, Ren, 1Hive, Gnosis, Tether, wBTC, wETH, EIP-721 and EIP-1155 standards (all NFTs and NFT applications), Kleros, Arweave, Kyber, the list goes on (there are more than 22,000 subgraphs).

At this point in time, The Graph is processing over 1 billion queries **per day** across 24 different supported blockchain networks including, but not limited to, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and more. If The Graph were to stop working, the dapps running on these networks would cease functioning. 

**The Graph Foundation Wave 3 Grant &amp; MIT's Bitcoin Core Developer Group**

As the title states, MIT Bitcoin Core Developers applied for and received a $50,000 grant from The Graph Foundation, which is a community-governed organization that helps to maintain and govern the decentralized indexing protocol, [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) (ticker: [GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)).

At this point in time, I am not sure exactly what they intend to use the grant money for. However, there has been much speculation surrounding this topic and I am going to briefly partake in this speculation with this thread. 

&gt;Source 2: [The Graph Foundation allocates over $1.5M in Grants, Ecosystem &amp; Dev Support in Wave 3](https://thegraph.com/blog/wave-three-funding)  
&gt;  
&gt;Source 2: [MIT's Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/bitcoin-security-initiative)

Back in February, 2021, The Graph announced that they ultimately [intend to index Bitcoin's main network](https://thegraph.com/blog/multiblockchain-support). What this means is that they would take all of the unorganized big data on Bitcoin's network and reorganize it into easier-to-read subsections of the Bitcoin network. 

Think about it, if a developer wanted to create a decentralized application using Bitcoin's network (such as a decentralized exchange centered around Bitcoin) right now, it would take months-years to sort through the 10 years worth of data on the Bitcoin network. Plus, Bitcoin doesn't even have smart contract capabilities on its native network (though with The Graph, subgraphs dedicated to Bitcoin could be used to build smart contracts with Bitcoin data, bit I digress). The Graph takes all of this data and makes it organized and easily readable so that any developer who creates a dapp can simply design a subgraph within The Graph's network and build a Bitcoin dapp using this subgraph.

Once The Graph indexes the Bitcoin network, I predict we will see a huge boom in developer interest in Bitcoin dapps and thus in the development of dapps centered around the Bitcoin ecosystem. This will lead to immense innovation using Bitcoin and its native network and overall increased activity in the cryptocurrency space. It also goes to show how powerful the infrastructure of The Graph protocol is.

Songbird is open systems, and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. The fees are super cheap (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty."

Sets of influencers, including PewDiePie, along with their supporters are banned from Facebook and Google metaverses in response to regulators’ request creating massive community backlash strengthening the exodus to community-owned public metaverses.  
**April 3, 2026** Catalyzed by Paradigm, a16z and Pantera complete a merger into a bigger-than-life VC DAO, in less than 10 years the VC industry is turned into a set of large, competing and interweaved DAOs and DAO\\\^2’s. Intelligently designed applications of retroactive financing, quadratic/linear funding and voting lead to a massive democratization of access to the VC landscape. Innovation is progressively open-source. Funding is progressively quadratic. The vestings are progressively posteriori and merit-based.  
**May 9, 2026** The deployment of the first Facebook and Google metaverse engine praised by the traditional media to be censorship-resistant and truly decentralized. As expected, the crypto-nation responds with the wave of scepticism.  
**May 6, 2026** The basic universal income to people comes as both, the special fees imposed by some of the major DAOs as well as L2POOL fractions.  
**July 5, 2026** The first land-based NFT DAO-led communities begin to appear, counties and territories across the Caribbean and South American coutries begin migrating their governance structures over to DAOs and distributing citizen NFTs based on land ownership with their domains of governance. Puerto Rico and Chile are leading this massive social experiment.  
**October 11, 2026** Algorithm NFTzation wave hits the AI industry. Ever more sophisticated algorithms running on ever-growing datasets stored and encrypted on decentralized storage platforms marks the beginning of the third NFT hype cycle.  
**May 8, 2027** Intensification of DAO2DAO interactions, the emergence of DAO\\\^2, DAO of DAOs, more sophisticated governance mechanisms for more heterogeneous community contributions.

**September 10, 2027** The first cross-chain metaverse merger with over $1,000,000,000,000 dollars total TVL merged into the combined DAO pools.  
**March 3, 2028** Humanity reaches the complexity frontier. Major DeFi megastructures (incl. AMCUG, Aave-MakerDAO-Curv-Uniswap-Galactica) become too complex for anyone to be able to reliably predict their behavior at any given point in time as the on-chain capital managed by self-governing AI-supercharged algorithms adapt their behaviour faster than the best AI algos can build trees anticipating the t+1 distributions. The first self-curing cascading wave of liquidations that has resulted in trillions of wealth redistributed across market participants within a matter of minutes.  
**March 5, 2028** Major DAOs begin forking Facebook and Google metaverse engines and deploying alpha versions of completely decentralized metaverses free from mega-corporation control and influence. Hardware remains an issue. For now.  
**March 8, 2028** Bitcoin, given its liquidity and having a clear correlation with the energy prices, becomes the native hedge currency for the largest metaverses against the spikes in the cost of their infrastructures.  
**October 23, 2028** A DAO-managed NFT collection of 6ed527c5783de7971468e099151db5825caa5bf4 eclipses, in estimated value, the combined worth of physical art pieces.  
**November 32, 2029** First merger of a major metaverse with one of Equinix's subsidiary ventures, the company owning the underlying physical infrastructure to vertically integrate the project’s tokenomics.  
**2030’s** The emergence of dark DAOs, the true all-mighty transnational entities. The national borders and jurisdictions as well as entire regulatory regimes become less relevant than the DAO tokenomics rules of larger metaverses, the dark DAOs. The precedent is believed to be established when a US court ruling is overrun by a neonxDAO voting and there happen to be no effective means of cohersion at the disposal of the US DOJ machine.

Digital economy flourishes while the foundations of the TradFi global financial system shutter yet again.

**February 10, 2032** Continued random spikes in COVID superspreader events eventually brings the sports industry to a grinding halt as they begin converting to a purely online eSports-metaverse industry as the growing fear of infection and disease permeates popular consciousness.  
**January 7, 2033** The demise of FEDcoin: the network rescue of half of the underlying value of Tether after regulators seize control of the fiat funds. The start of a slow decline of CBDCs. USDC and other centralized major stables begin to fade in relevance as well.

**June 16 2022**, Intel and Facebook team-up to deploy billions in R&amp;D of hardware infrastructure capable of maintaining the high-load requirements of public metaverses  
**June 27, 2022** The exodus of 51% of the global TVL away from private corporate metaverses ('the facistverses') and pseudo-DAOs to those built and run by larger communities of decentralized Layer-1 networks. Ethereum being among the leaders in accommodating this intensifying flow.  
**December 6, 2022** Spurred on by the rise of work-from-home and the rising decentralized workspace, 2 major companies; Uber and AirBnB, have begun researching DAO history and partnered with industry think tanks, such as Curve Labs, PrimeDAO, Block Science and Ethereum Foundation to begin exploring the possibilities of migrating their companies to a pure DAO structure.  
**January 13, 2023** 66c49e33cf0f407d0b9033bf317cd4fffc6701b6 has undergone the first-of-a-kind reverse IDO of a publicly traded company by buying back the entire float of it’s equity, tokenizing the debt and issuing utility tokens back to the community of most active users effectively becoming a DAO and delisting itself from a public stock exchange.

**September 17, 2023** Altcoin apocalypse ensues as a result of a large uncurated market meltdown caused by a major S&amp;P correction and cascading liquidations spilling from TradFi to crypto and DeFi. The increasing interconnectedness of TradFi and DeFi cannot be understated any longer.  
**April 13,2024** AirBnB starts renting out metaverse space for ads and collaborative work.  
**August 28, 2024** The first successful inter-DAO hostile acquisition occurs. A decentralized lending protocol with the bulk of traffic coming from sub-saharan Africa, DAFAx was forked by the community of ghostDAO, fueled with the gDAO native token giving massive LM rewards in the massively capitalized gDAO for restaking the entirety of the collateral into its new lending contracts. Eventually ghostDAO managed to completely pull liquidity out of DAFAx, slowly wiping out the second DAO’s entire token value.  
**November 5, 2024** Marking the massive new lead in the evolution of human organizations, the DAO frontier has taken a massive step forward with a DAO-2-Business (D2B) acquisition of 19419163c8274dba12e48548257c10250e863b69 with subsequent tokenization of its products and services.

"Ethereum L2 Scaling is Here, You Don't Need to Wait For ETH2",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvm2i/ethereum_l2_scaling_is_here_you_dont_need_to_wait/,SuggestedName90,1,2021-10-23 10:07:19,51,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvm2i/ethereum_l2_scaling_is_here_you_dont_need_to_wait/,REMINDER,"Ethereum Scaling is always a contentious issue, but I believe it's often brought up mainly to discredit Ethereum rather than highlight a problem. At 49 gwei gas right now I wanted to bring up some ideas and mention the various scaling solutions Ethereum has. Check out [https://l2fees.info/](https://l2fees.info/) for information on the exact costs once you bridge over.

True L2s

**Optimistic Rollups**  
Optimistic Rollups are a scaling technology that relies on people disproving transactions rather than proving this. Thanks to this and tx batching as well as some off chain processing transactions become much cheaper and the chain only has to spend time fully processing contested transactions.

  
Arbitrum is the main implementation of Optimistic Rollups, at roughly $15 per coin to move on, and less for ETH, its a great option to move your coins over to. Platforms like Sushiswap, Uniswap, Aave, CREAM, and others have already moved over so if you want to start farming your sick yield farming gains you can hop on over right now and do everything you would want to do on Ethereum Mainnet but cheaper.  


Optimism, believe it not, does Optimistic Rollups. Its already supported by Chainlink, Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound. You can do everything to your hearts desire here with fees that work out to less than Arbitrum\* (fees not comparable as speeds are throttled during beta)  


**ZkSnarks**  
Zksnarks is math. It uses math to scale things, there are like 6 University papers you can read if you are really interested, but I am not going to throw math here that neither of us understand and call it an explanation. Obligatory Zero Knowledge Proof to cover buzzwords  


Zksync is the main implementation of this technology, and while they haven't seen as much adoption as others their fees are dirt cheap, they are battle-tested at this point and proven to be secure. They are bit harder to code for though, so make sure to petition your favorite platforms to move over! ZkSnarks are amazing and deserve more attention.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Commit Chains**  
Chains that are full standalone chains that submit checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet. They don't benefit from Ethereum's security but can also have their own benefits of high throughput and compatbility.  


Polygon, its just Polygon. Pretty much everything has a Polygon deployment from 88mph to Aave to Sushiswap to even native protocols like Quickswap.  


Tl;Dr - Don't wait for ETH2! Make the L2 Jump today and start yield farming and decentralizing finance. Take this post as the kick to get you to actually log into that website, click the ""move to l2"" button, pay $30, and enjoy a whole new world!

Crypto 101.

**Removiendo ruido**

En primer lugar, vale la pena dimensionar (sin desestimar), los ruidos que normalmente rodean al sistema tanto de manera positiva como negativa.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Volatilidad:** Si bien los activos digitales tienen una volatilidad superior a la de activos de riesgo tradicionales como acciones, lo cierto es que un comparativo más justo sería con la volatilidad asociada a las valuaciones de empresas de Venture Capital, en donde la gran mayoría de las inversiones terminan con un valor de cero, pero un pequeño porcentaje termina por tener valuaciones que compensan las pérdidas del resto. A pesar de este comportamiento, históricamente ha sido una buena alternativa (aunque limitada a inversionistas de alto nivel) el invertir en VC. Por lo anterior, volatilidad por si sola no es un factor para desestimar el valor que puede tener crypto como inversión.

https://preview.redd.it/q2l2mmq0d4v71.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8939ecae5caa913d7c549d4a4bcc6fadba6c22f0

 *Cerca del 30% de las inversiones terminan con pérdida, un 28% con ganancias muy ligeras, pero un 8% se multiplica por 7 veces, compensando el comportamiento del resto.*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Especulación:** La combinación que surge del desconocimiento de individuos con un background financiero como yo, provoca que terminemos magnificando las características técnicas de programación que no entendemos. Al mismo tiempo, el desconocimiento de los programadores en aspectos financieros/económicos, provoca que magnifiquen o simplifiquen soluciones a problemas del aspecto de gobernanza, política monetaria o de distribución. ¿Qué tan válido es entonces desdeñar un activo porque tiene un grado de especulación en su valor? No mucho. Quienes invierten en el S&amp;P 500 no conocen el proceso de selección, rebalanceo y criterios de inclusión en el índice y no por eso es una mala elección invertir en el. La gran mayoría desconoce cómo funciona el programa de compras de activos de la FED y no por eso dejan de tener dinero fiduciario. *En la mayoría de las inversiones existe un grado de especulación, en cryptos es mayor en este punto, pero eso por sí solo no cambia el valor subyacente de los desarrollos.*
* **Uso para fines criminales:** ¿El bitcoin se usa para transacciones ilegales? Sí, aunque es mínimo ese uso. ¿Es ese el principal medio? No. Dólar y efectivo de cualquier denominación sigue siendo la ruta preferida para transacciones ilegales y eso no le resta valor al dólar. Adicionalmente, quienes tienen los recursos y capacidades de incurrir en esquemas de ilegalidad tienen recursos mucho más convenientes que una tecnología naciente.
* **Abuso de bancos centrales hace más atractivo el crypto:** Parcialmente cierto, sin embargo totalmente erróneo el pensar que bancos centrales han tenido efecto neto negativo en la sociedad. Papel de política monetaria en el último siglo ha sido decisivo para tener recesiones cada vez menos severas y cada vez más espaciadas. Bancos centrales siguen teniendo un papel fundamental en la economía y no pueden ser sustituidos por el sistema crypto, al menos no sin dejarnos en una posición más vulnerable que la actual.
* **Escasez asegura el valor de activos como bitcoin:** No, escasez por si sola no da valor a un activo. Mejor ejemplo de esto es que hay elementos como el plutonio, entre muchos otros, que son más escasos que el oro, y no por eso cumplen con la misma función de reserva de valor. Combinación de factores (que detallaré más adelante), son los que en conjunto deciden si un factor es apto o no para mantener su valor en el tiempo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Diferencia entre activos digitales**

Con el fin de poder asignar a cada uno dentro de la cubeta que les corresponde dentro de un portafolio es necesario primero distinguir las características y diferencias entre los distintos activos digitales que existen actualmente.

* **Activos reserva de valor:** Como su nombre lo dice, su función es la de mantener el poder adquisitivo de manera absoluta y relativa a través del tiempo. Principal exponente en el segmento crypto es bitcoin, mientras que en activos tradicionales es el oro, aunque han existido o existen, otro tipo de activos como el arte, tierra o incluso hasta whisky que han sido utilizados con ese propósito  
¿Qué se requiere para que un activo pueda ser una eficiente reserva de valor?  
Comparemos en este punto al bitcoin vs el oro:  
\- Dificil de confiscar: Bitcoin superior al oro.  
\- Confidencialidad: Bitcoin y oro pueden ser confidenciales.  
\- Fácil de transportar: Bitcoin es más fácil de transportar que el oro.  
\- Fácil de adquirir: Bitcoin y oro son ambos fáciles de adquirir.  
\- Fácil de transferir: Bitcoin es menos complicado de transferir.  
\- Escasez: Ambos tienen una oferta finita.  
\- Volatilidad: Oro es menos volátil que el oro.  
\- Historial: Oro cuenta con mayor historial que bitcoin.  

* **Smart contract toke**ns: su función consiste en proveer la plataforma, así como la certeza y confianza entre dos partes sin necesidad de terceros involucrados. Principales exponentes son Ethereum, ADA, Solana, Polkadot, entre otros. También conocidos como Layer 1 debido a que es encima de estas plataformas donde se construyen las diferentes alternativas de aplicaciones para usuarios.  
¿Qué atributos se busca en este tipo de activos? Rapidez de transacciones, descentralización, costos bajos de transacción Y escalabilidad.
* **Stable coins:** Tienen como propósito proveer los beneficios que tiene una cryptomoneda (confidencialidad, costos de transacción, rapidez, etc), sin la volatilidad asociada a las cryptomonedas tradicionales. A cambio de esto el upside es nulo o está acotado pues su valor depende del valor de las garantías subyacentes que sirven para proveer de estabilidad a las monedas. Principales exponentes son Tether, USDC, MakerDAO, etc.
* **Utility tokens:** Tokens que representan la participación en un protocolo (layer 2) encargado de proveer de alguna función o servicio al sistema crypto, por ejemplo, protocolos encargados de recopilar información del mundo real hacia la blockchain (oráculos) o también protocolos encargados de almacenar la información generada por algún usuario o empresa. Principales: Chainlink, Filecoin, Iota, etc.
* **Exchange tokens:** Tokens que representan la participación en las plataformas en donde los diferentes crypto activos se intercambian unos con otros. Son el equivalente a la bolsa de valores, solo que en lugar de tradear acciones se tradean pares de tokens. Principales: Uniswap, Sushiswap, Serum, etc,
* **NFTs:** Activos digitales irrepetibles (dentro de la blockchain), no fungibles y con la capacidad de generar prueba de propiedad a sus usuarios. Principales: CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Axie, Crypto Kitties.

 **Diferencias entre protocolos**

De igual manera, es necesario conocer los diferentes protocolos de comprobación en el ecosistema, así como el origen de la trinidad imposible en crypto: descentralización, escala y seguridad en donde puedes tener 2 pero siempre sacrificando uno de esos tres atributos.

* **Proof of work:** De los primeros protocolos y bajo el cual opera bitcoin. Consiste en que mineros de la red deben de llegar a un consenso tras haber realizado una comprobación de transacciones del ledger (libro contable) de la blockchain, así como de una prueba matemática que compruebe que han realizado el trabajo (de ahí su nombre). Ventaja de este protocolo es que ofrece descentralización, ya que existen numerosos nodos de mineros realizando la tarea, además de que ofrece seguridad, al ser necesaria la comprobación de más del 51% de los mineros para que una transacción se lleve a cabo.  
Desventaja del protocolo es que es demasiado lento y consume demasiada energía, al ser necesaria la participación de una mayoría para aprobar la transacción.
* **Proof of stake:** Protocolo hacia el cual está por transitar Ethereum. A diferencia de proof of work, en donde todos los mineros realizan la comprobación. En proof of stake cada minero coloca una “garantía”. Posteriormente el protocolo elige un minero que es quien realiza la comprobación. En caso de que el minero actué incorrectamente, su garantía (stake) se le retira, por lo que siempre está incentivado a hacer una comprobación honesta.  
Ventaja de este protocolo consiste en que al ser menos mineros los que realizan la comprobación, esta se hace de una manera más rápida y con un menor consumo de energía, siendo un protocolo más viable para servicios transaccionales.  
Desventaja del protocolo consiste en que seguridad vs proof of work es menor al ser menos comprobadores, además de que la centralización pudiese irse hacia comprobadores con mayor staking disponible para ser elegidos.
* **Proof of History:** Protocolo popularizado por Solana. Guarda similitudes con protocolos anteriores, diferencia radica en que cada transacción va acompañada por un distintivo que varía dependiendo del momento en que se hizo. Al ser el tiempo un elemento inalterable, facilita la revisión de la cadena de transacciones pues el time stamp generado hace imposible que la cadena pueda cambiarse en el tiempo presente sin generar un código distinto al generado en el pasado.  
Ventaja de este protocolo consiste en que es incluso más rápido y barato que el proof of stake, por lo que su aplicación en transferencias de montos más pequeños o de consumo (ejemplo: NFTs) se vuelve mucho más factible.  
Desventaja es que el nivel de complejidad y características necesarias para ser un minero dentro de este protocolo es mucho mayor, por lo que la concentración tiende a acrecentarse en quienes tienen acceso y conocimiento para minar bajo estas características.

**Potencial de bitcoin**

A través de la historia han existido diferentes maneras de mantener el valor por medio de activos, y lo que es considerado “dinero” evoluciona a través del tiempo. Como mencioné anteriormente, bitcoin guarda similitudes con las del oro, al ser un activo escaso, fácil de transportar y difícil de confiscar (considerando que eres dueño de tu wallet, características que lo hacen especialmente atractivos para ciudadanos de países con restricciones de capital (China) y con políticas monetarias fallidas (Argentina).

https://preview.redd.it/acc5uw09d4v71.png?width=449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=180aec420ffaa6c8e0527da0b14cedb8672918a2

Adicionalmente, a pesar de su relativamente corta historia, bitcoin cuenta con la ventaja, ahora adquirida, de haber sobrevivido a una crisis, y de al mismo tiempo haber mostrado sus características diversificadoras dentro de un portafolio tradicional. Es decir, bitcoin dentro de un portafolio ha probado brindar retornos no correlacionados con aquellos de los activos tradicionales.  

https://preview.redd.it/hpzyi21cd4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be24363071e3fbaefb263f20379ea88c964a5822

Habiendo dicho lo anterior, no creo que bitcoin se convierta en una moneda de cambio, ni en un sistema que pueda dar la infraestructura al sistema financiero, ambas algunas de las tesis comúnmente mencionadas por los bitcoin maximalists. La razón de esto es la ya mencionada lentitud en transacciones y volatilidad de corto plazo que la acompañan. Por el otro lado, es altamente probable que termine por ocupar el lugar que el oro tradicionalmente ha ocupado en generaciones anteriores al compartir principales características y ofrecer un elemento de practicidad tecnológica.

Ya que hemos delimitado su uso, es como podemos llegar al menos a una aproximación de los rangos en los que bitcoin pudiese moverse en caso de cumplirse dicha tesis.

Considerando que mercado de oro tiene un valor aproximado de 10.9 trillones de dólares, podemos comenzar a sensibilizar el valor de bitcoin de acuerdo al nivel de participación de mercado que pueda tomar del oro. Por ejemplo, suponiendo que llegase a tomar un 10% de ese mercado el valor total de bitcoin sería de 1 trillón de dólares. Si dividimos ese trillón de dólares en el total de bitcoins que se emitirán (21 millones), llegamos a un valor total de 47 mil dólares por bitcoin. O visto de una manera inversa, si tomamos el precio actual de bitcoin de 62 mil dólares, encontraríamos que su valor total (terminal), sería de 1.3 trillones de dólares, que dividido entre los 10.9 trillones de dólares del valor de oro arrojaría que el precio actual supone que el bitcoin desplazará el 11.9% del oro físico en circulación.

Mi perspectiva: no me sorprendería ver a Bitcoin tomando mucho más del market share del oro debido a cambios en las preferencias generacionales de inversionistas (hoy es más común que un millenial compre bitcoin a que compre monedas de oro), así como por el FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) de los inversionistas institucionales, por lo que, en el largo plazo no me sorprendería verla duplicar de nuevo su valor, con sus ajustes extremos de costumbre. Sin embargo, la época en que bitcoin hizo ricos a unos cuantos ciertamente ya pasó, pues el que un activo duplique o inclusive triplique su valor no hace a nadie rico.

**Smart Contract Platforms: Ethereum**

Contrario a bitcoin, que únicamente funge como reserva de valor, Ethereum ofrece una combinación de reserva de valor (ultra sound money), al mismo tiempo que ofrece el potencial de convertirse en el ecosistema del sistema financiero global por medio del desarrollo del DeFi (descentralized finance). Por otro lado, a diferencia de bitcoin, cuyo valor depende de la credibilidad que el consenso le da como reserva de valor, Ethereum basa su valor en flujos reales que pueden cuantificarse como con cualquier otra empresa tradicional.

Al ser una plataforma que provee de certeza a los contratos en ella depositados, Ethereum colecta las comisiones (gas fees) correspondientes a esta función, siendo así que es más cercana a un banco que a una moneda o commodity. Muestra de esto son los 2 billones de ingresos que ha logrado durante el último año.

https://preview.redd.it/l17qewoid4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e5a3c15530ac6602dc4cbc51d98837f6bb49171

Adicionalmente, tras una mejora impuesta durante el verano pasado (EIP 1559), Ethereum cuenta con una política monetaria de emisión negativa. Es decir, las comisiones cobradas son hasta cierto punto eliminadas de la blockchain, resultando con esto que el número de Ethereums disponibles inclusive pudiese disminuir con el tiempo, y por consecuencia incrementar el valor de los mismos, similar a una recompra de acciones.

Es ahí de donde viene su atributo de “ultra sound money” ya que si a bitcoin se le considera reserva de valor por tener un número fijo y preestablecido de unidades, en el caso de ethereum esta característica se exponencia al tener un número incluso decreciente de monedas.

https://preview.redd.it/35jc8srld4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0168be71d12c8869779c82ca84ea74ef82a984c7

Una vez entendido este concepto es como es posible asignarle un valor a Ethereum y para este punto no pretenderé descubrir el hilo negro, sino basarme en el modelo realizado por Justin Drake respecto a distintos escenarios de quema de Ethereums ([adjunto liga del spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9cGxGY3_t7m4MEIpjKWtRcA2zRajywaxMCZYqbF9eI/edit#gid=0)).

Con esto podemos observar un valor esperado de Ethereum de entre 3 mil dólares, hasta 130 mil dólares sin la prima monetaria o de hasta 2.1 millones considerando la prima monetaria obtenida por el ultra sound money. Considerando que el precio de Ethereum ronda en este momento los 4 mil dólares es que podemos ver como el upside potencial es mucho más atractivo que en bitcoin. Adicionalmente, durante el siguiente año protocolo migrara de proof-of-work a proof-of-stake (explicados anteriormente), por lo que problemas que actualmente enfrenta la red, como lo son los altísimos costos de transacción, debiesen de ser mitigados y por ende su adopción debiese acelerarse aún  más.

*Utilicé ethereum para el ejemplo de Smart Contract Platforms, sin embargo pueden utilizarse mismos criterios, ajustados a las características de cada proyecto, para analizar otras plataformas como Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, entre otras.*

**DAOs (Descentralized Autonomous Organizations)**

Ahora que entendemos el papel de las crypto reservas de valor (Bitcoin), así como el de las plataformas de contratos inteligentes, podemos explorar el concepto que en mi opinión es el verdaderamente revolucionario del sistema: las DAOS, Organizaciones Descentralizadas Autónomas.

Las DAOs son protocolos que representan una organización transparante, controlada por sus miembros, y no influenciada por un sistema de gobernanza centralizado. Este tipo de organizaciones son montadas en las plataformas de contratos inteligentes como Ethereum y proveen una función específica mediante la cual brindan valor al ecosistema, recompensando al mismo tiempo a sus usuarios.

Ejemplo: Uniswap, plataforma de intercambio de compra/venta/intercambio de distintos tokens en el ecosistema. Contrario a una empresa tradicional en la que existen accionistas que son dueños de la misma, en uniswap los dueños son los usuarios de la plataforma, siendo que esta propiedad se da por medio de los tokens de Uniswap (UNI). Similar a las acciones de una empresa, una DAO distribuye Tokens a sus usuarios que representan un derecho sobre la gobernanza del protocolo. Valor de este token proviene del potencial que existe en que en un punto Uniswap decida distribuir las comisiones cobradas por la plataforma a los dueños de los tokens de UNI.

&amp;#x200B;

**¿Qué hace tan revolucionario a un sistema de tokens vs un sistema de acciones?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Intereses se encuentran alienados desde el día 1:** Al ser los usuarios, los dueños del sistema, no tiene sentido para ellos implementar cambios a favor de la rentabilidad pero con una merma en el servicio, y lo mismo sucede en el caso contrario, no pueden mejorar el servicio al punto en el que el protocolo ya no es rentable pues ellos también se verían afectados.
* **Concentración de la riqueza disminuye significativamente:** En  una empresa tradicional, fundadores o inversionistas iniciales concentran una gran proporción de la riqueza creada por una empresa, es por eso que personajes como Bezos, Zuckerberg o Musk pueden llegar a ser las personas más ricas del mundo. ¿Por qué no pasa esto con la tokenización de las empresas? Un protocolo exitoso es aquel con el mayor grado de descentralización, esto debido a que se evita el problema que existe con las empresas tecnológicas actuales, donde un pequeño grupo decide el rumbo de las mismas. Con la tokenización de las organizaciones usuarios abandonarían en automático un servicio en donde solo una persona o grupo controla el ecosistema, por lo que concentración de riqueza termina por desaparecer.
* **Acceso a proyectos de Venture Capital:** Hasta hace poco, el acceso a empresas tecnológicas nacientes estaba limitado a inversionistas con altas sumas de dinero, con la capacidad de encontrar estas empresas y ejecutar sus inversiones de una manera escalable. Tokenización de las empresas abre la opción para que inversionistas de mucho menor tamaño puedan participar en el potencial ofrecido por empresas de reciente creación.

**¿Cómo es posible analizar el valor de una DAO?**

De la misma manera en que se valua una empresa, considerando los flujos que tiene la empresa, y es aquí donde se muere por completo el argumento de que todas las cryptos son puramente especulación. Al igual que cualquier otra empresa, las DAOs generan ingresos y utilidades que pueden servir de guía para determinar el precio de sus tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iuvy36ord4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b47832468b6d681eef55e1dff405a443f3a080

Es aquí donde podemos separar aquellos proyectos claramente sobrevaluados, de aquellos que ofrecen incluso valuaciones inferiores a los de mercados públicos.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mi Allocation a crypto activos**

A pesar de que no hay un marco teórico probado a través de diferentes ciclos, que pueda dar una guía relativamente confiable respecto al porcentaje correcto a asignar a estos activos, *yo en lo personal tengo un porcentaje de 15% de activos crypto en mi portafolio global.*

Este 15% se deriva de un enfoque tradicional en el que típicamente, un allocation de 5% a commodities como el oro u otros activos alternativos, provee de suficiente valor y diversificación a un portafolio de activos tradicionales. Es de ahí que un 5% de mi portafolio se encuentra en bitcoin.

El 10% adicional de ese 15% se encuentra en tokens de smart contract platforms, así como en DAOs de layer 2, ambas explicadas anteriormente. El 10% proviene del hecho de que ese tipo de activos no son ni monedas, ni commodities, sino empresas como cualquier otra, con ingresos, utilidades y tasas de crecimiento. Por lo que en mi opinión, es razonable considerarlos como inversiones equivalentes a las de Venture Capital o Private Equity, que de igual manera, históricamente, en portafolios de high net worth individuals, han probado brindar valor.

El 10% históricamente ha venido del hecho de que son activos asimétricos, en los que en el peor de los casos su valor puede caer un 50% o hasta un 100%, sin embargo, perder un 10% de tu portafolio realmente no representa gran cosa en el contexto de un mal año en mercados desarrollados como el S&amp;P 500. Por otro lado, en caso de tener un retorno positivo, el potencial a la alza no está topado, siendo así que un 10% se puede convertir en un retorno de 2x o 3x, beneficiando significativamente el perfil de retorno, sin haber puesto en peligro el patrimonio total.

&amp;#x200B;

**¿Qué cryptos tengo en mi portafolio y por qué?**

* Bitcoin: Reserva de valor
* Ethereum: Plataforma ganadora (muy probablemente) de contratos inteligentes en el sistema financiero.
* Solana: No un ethereum killer, pero sí probablemente el protocolo que termine siendo utilizado para transacciones de menor costo y mayor rapidez (NFTs, Videojuegos, consumo básico).
* Uniswap/Serum: Equivalentes a la bolsa de valores (en este caso de tokens), del sistema Ethereum/Solana. Debiesen de ser agnósticas al desarrollo de las distintas DAOs dado que su valor reside en que trading de tokens incremente.
* Chainlink: Oráculo con mayores aplicaciones en la vida práctica, al ser el encargado de proveer de datos del mundo real al sistema crypto.
* UMA: Mejor protocolo para creación de instrumentos derivados en crypto.
* Maple: Único ICO (Initial Coin Offering) en el que he participado. Proyecto ambicioso de convertirse en el banco de empresas dentro del sistema crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**¿Qué podría salir mal?**

Igual que en cualquier otro activo sin un respaldo físico, valor de estos proyectos podrían desaparecer si confianza en ellos desaparece y con ello desaparece su uso. Valor de rescate en todos sería de CERO, dado que solo viven en la red.

Adicionalmente, regulación pudiese ser especialmente dura con DAOs, con el peligro que tienen de ser consideradas como acciones y con esto ser sujetas al mismo nivel de escritunio de una empresa tradicional.

Finalmente, existen retos de carácter tecnológico que mi limitada capacidad tecnológica no termina por dimensionar, como lo es el papel de la computación cuántica en la seguridad de los protocolos, así como los nulos controles de “fat fingers” (errores humanos) que existen en general en el sistema y que en la mayoría de las ocasiones no pueden reestablecerse.

What is GARD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoGARD/comments/qeagm6/what_is_gard/,AlgoGARDian,1,2021-10-24 02:26:48,4,/r/AlgoGARD/comments/qeagm6/what_is_gard/,NaN,"GARD is an algorithmic stable token that not only solves the problems created by tokens such as TerraLuna and MakerDao, but also is backed up by a collateralized debt position that will safely pay its borrowers interest instead of charging them.

We have created the first truly decentralized dollar. GARD is an algorithmic stable token that is backed by Algorand's blockchain and uses Algos as collateral. We incentivize reserve providers by paying them network rewards and giving them liquidity from their locked tokens. We incentivize use of GARD because of the almost zero transaction fees, decentralization, and stability. Finally, thanks to the unique tokenomics and structure of lending afforded by GARD's protocol our borrowers are paying themselves and get an extra return on their investment.

Our solution is distinctive in a few key ways: blockchain, collateralized debt position structure, and the collateral. First and foremost by building our product on Algorand we are utilizing the only blockchain to solve the crypto trilemma (scalability, security, and decentralization).  Second, the way we have structured the CDP positions is so that our borrowers are not only incentivized to mint GARD, but also to keep their positions open because they will have more spend per $ they have locked up in the soon to be launched Algorand governance structure. Finally, because our CDP positions will be backed up by Algos and not some token we have made up ourselves, users are less likely to fall victim to events like those that transpired to Mark Cuban's Titan coin."

**TLDR**:

There is a use case for Alchemix users to borrow stablecoins from their collateral. However, the comparison to MakerDAO in the example might not be a good comparison because they serve a different function for their respective protocols.

In MakerDAO, $USDC deposits are used as a backstop to prevent $DAI stablecoin from being unpegged — rather than to actually borrow $DAI. In the case of Alchemix, deposits serve as collateral for users to borrow a loan that is being rewarded with yields. They sell a completely different value proposition. For now, it appears that Alchemix has no close competitors that compete for their market share. However, it would need to greatly increase utility for its stablecoin $alUSD and its governance token $ALCX for the protocol to truly shine.

&amp;#x200B;

 

# What Is Alchemix?

Alchemix calls itself a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform. You receive yield from the collateral capital. To understand how Alchemix works, check [out](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/ep-51-understanding-alcx-alchemix) our detailed analysis. In this article, we focus on comparing stablecoins that are backed by stablecoins.

# Question: Why Use A Stablecoin To Back A Stablecoin?

Why would anyone deposit a stablecoin ($DAI) to borrow less stablecoin ($alUSD)? We compare some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Alchemix protocol below and compare it with Maker.

### Strengths

* No kind of stability fees (as compared to MakerDAO)
* No kind of liquidation fees
* Yields are generated from collateral automatically
* Simple and easy to use (not as complicated)

### Weaknesses

* Opportunity cost of collateral
* $alUSD, the stablecoin does not have much utility for it to gain traction
* $ALCX tokens currently have no utility other than governance
* Much more centralised compared to other protocols

We note that the main value proposition that Alchemix brings for its users is that a loan will repay itself over time. In general, users pay less fees and do not have to worry about being liquidated from their collateral. Traditionally, users of $DAI deposit their stablecoin in a lending protocol such as Compound or Aave and earn interest. With Alchemix, they can expand their capital base to either leverage on their positions or finance a self-repaying loan.

# Comparison: Alchemix vs Maker

&gt;Which protocol mints a token using the same token of value? Why?

To put things into perspective, we compare Alchemix to a similar form of protocol. This protocol should also accept asset as collateral to mint another asset of the exact same value. Both assets should remain on the same blockchain system. BTC and wBTC do not count because BTC exists on the Bitcoin blockchain network while wBTC exists on the Ethereum blockchain network.

With that in mind, we have Maker and Alchemix.

* Alchemix uses $DAI to mint $alUSD"

**TLDR**:

There is a use case for Alchemix users to borrow stablecoins from their collateral. However, the comparison to MakerDAO in the example might not be a good comparison because they serve a different function for their respective protocols.

In MakerDAO, $USDC deposits are used as a backstop to prevent $DAI stablecoin from being unpegged — rather than to actually borrow $DAI. In the case of Alchemix, deposits serve as collateral for users to borrow a loan that is being rewarded with yields. They sell a completely different value proposition. For now, it appears that Alchemix has no close competitors that compete for their market share. However, it would need to greatly increase utility for its stablecoin $alUSD and its governance token $ALCX for the protocol to truly shine.

# What Is Alchemix?

Alchemix calls itself a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform. You receive yield from the collateral capital. To understand how Alchemix works, check [out](https://economicsdesign.substack.com/p/ep-51-understanding-alcx-alchemix) our detailed analysis. In this article, we focus on comparing stablecoins that are backed by stablecoins.

# Question: Why Use A Stablecoin To Back A Stablecoin?

Why would anyone deposit a stablecoin ($DAI) to borrow less stablecoin ($alUSD)? We compare some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Alchemix protocol below and compare it with Maker.

### Strengths

* No kind of stability fees (as compared to MakerDAO)
* No kind of liquidation fees
* Yields are generated from collateral automatically
* Simple and easy to use (not as complicated)

### Weaknesses

* Opportunity cost of collateral
* $alUSD, the stablecoin does not have much utility for it to gain traction
* $ALCX tokens currently have no utility other than governance
* Much more centralised compared to other protocols

We note that the main value proposition that Alchemix brings for its users is that a loan will repay itself over time. In general, users pay less fees and do not have to worry about being liquidated from their collateral. Traditionally, users of $DAI deposit their stablecoin in a lending protocol such as Compound or Aave and earn interest. With Alchemix, they can expand their capital base to either leverage on their positions or finance a self-repaying loan.

# Comparison: Alchemix vs Maker

&gt;Which protocol mints a token using the same token of value? Why?

To put things into perspective, we compare Alchemix to a similar form of protocol. This protocol should also accept asset as collateral to mint another asset of the exact same value. Both assets should remain on the same blockchain system. BTC and wBTC do not count because BTC exists on the Bitcoin blockchain network while wBTC exists on the Ethereum blockchain network.

With that in mind, we have Maker and Alchemix.

* Maker uses $USDC to mint $DAI
* Alchemix uses $DAI to mint $alUSD"

We note that the main value proposition that Alchemix brings for its users is that a loan will repay itself over time. In general, users pay less fees and do not have to worry about being liquidated from their collateral. Traditionally, users of $DAI deposit their stablecoin in a lending protocol such as Compound or Aave and earn interest. With Alchemix, they can expand their capital base to either leverage on their positions or finance a self-repaying loan.

# Comparison: Alchemix vs Maker

&gt;Which protocol mints a token using the same token of value? Why?

To put things into perspective, we compare Alchemix to a similar form of protocol. This protocol should also accept asset as collateral to mint another asset of the exact same value. Both assets should remain on the same blockchain system. BTC and wBTC do not count because BTC exists on the Bitcoin blockchain network while wBTC exists on the Ethereum blockchain network.With that in mind, we have Maker and Alchemix.

* Maker uses $USDC to mint $DAI
* Alchemix uses $DAI to mint $alUSD"

At the time of writing, there’s $135.4 billion in stablecoins but the top five collectively represent 94.40% of that total. While the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap increased by 2% over the last 30 days, the stablecoin DAI issued by the Makerdao protocol expanded by 22%.



Tether and Circle’s USD Coin Rule the Roost
Stablecoins are very popular these days and it’s safe to say that these dollar-pegged tokens are not going anywhere any time soon. For instance, at the time of writing, there’s around $29.2 billion in global trade volume dedicated to bitcoin (BTC) trades only.

Currently, the stablecoin tether (USDT) commands 61.46% of all the BTC trades according to cryptocompare.com data. Below the U.S. dollar is the stablecoin BUSD, a stablecoin curated on the Binance Smart Chain as BUSD commands 5.29% of all BTC trades today.

BUSD is, in fact, the only stablecoin in the top five that did not see its market cap inflate. The largest stablecoin market cap today is tether (USDT) which commands a valuation of $71 billion at the time of writing, according to market aggregation sites like Coingecko’s “Top Stablecoins by Market Cap.”

Tether’s transparency web page that shows Tether’s current balances says there’s approximately $70,578,488,377 worth of USDT. With close to a $71 billion increase, USDT has grown by 2% during the trailing 30 days.

The second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle and the Centre Consortium, usd coin (USDC), has swelled by 8.9% this month. Presently, USDC has a market valuation of around $32.8 billion which is around 46.19% or close to half the size of USDT’s market cap.

Tether’s global trade volume is much higher than USDC’s at $52,791,455,644 while USDC’s is around $1,936,810,797. USDC is paired with USDT and BUSD and according to cryptocompare.com data, they are the top two trading pairs with USDC.

#The 3rd, 4th, 5th Stablecoin Contenders
While the stablecoin that stems from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, busd (BUSD) is the third-largest cap, it has not increased during the last month. BUSD holds a valuation of about $12.9 billion at the time of writing and $3.4 billion in global trade volume. BUSD is swapped on 98 different exchanges according to today’s data and it’s ranked 18th out of 9,957 crypto assets.

The algorithmic decentralized finance (defi) stablecoin issued by the Makerdao project, dai (DAI), has seen the most growth this past month gaining 22.7%. While the third-largest stablecoin BUSD has a market cap of around $12.9 billion, DAI’s market cap is $7.4 billion today."

So, to make the argument for why Badger is a viable investment, let's have a look at Maker, which has a circulating supply of about 1 million. Badger has 10 million circulating supply and 20 million maximum supply and is worth about $27 per (time of posting). Badger's market cap is several times lower than Maker despite operating on Bitcoin, which is arguably more mainstream than ETH. Overall, this puts Badger in a position for it to have insane growth."

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

EntroFi Announced Partnership with dForce to Power Real-world Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EntroFi/comments/qga241/entrofi_announced_partnership_with_dforce_to/,EntroFi,1,2021-10-27 00:21:47,0,/r/u_EntroFi/comments/qga241/entrofi_announced_partnership_with_dforce_to/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

Following [Uprets](https://www.uprets.io/#/home), Hashingbot and Ninghua Supply Chain Management, we are delighted to announce our first inter-protocol collaboration with dForce, an integrated and interoperable DeFi protocol matrix covering lending (global liquidity pool, yield markets), assets (stablecoin, synthetic asset, etc.), and trading (liquidity aggregator, AMM).

In the auspice of this new partnership, EntroFi will gain access to the USX’s credit line from dForce, and therefore significantly enhances our capabilities to meet various liquidity demands generated by all the recent collaboration with asset originators as well as more SMEs and financial institutions in near future.

Such inter-protocol partnership also allows dForce to use EntroFi as a portal to connect with borrowers in various forms and facilitate easy execution for RWA deals.

DeFi has enjoyed its most robust growth since last summer, with global TVL soared from 13.69 billion USD in November 2020 up to an estimate of 82 billion USD by the end of September this year; however, such tremendous achievement is still dwarfed by size of traditional real-world assets (real estate, stock, gold, bond etc), which is measured in hundreds of trillion USD. Therefore, we believe the key to break the bottleneck of DeFi growth is to extend its offering beyond cryptocurrency and into the broader scope of RWA (real-world assets).

Major DeFi platforms such as MakerDAO are already onboarding RWA originators into their ecosystem, and it is evident that more RWAs will soon be originated onto blockchains through tokenization, enabling SMEs and individuals who have been neglected by traditional financial intermediaries to access capitals with more transparency as well as efficiency, while allowing DeFi users to generate solid returns un-correlated to crypto volatility.

This partnership with dForce marks the first attempt by EntroFi to secure liquidities from a major DeFi platform. As more real-world institutions and corporates seek to incorporate DeFi into their financing strategies, EntroFi will continuously work with other institutional partners to connect RWA loans and borrowers globally.

**About dForce**

dForce is an integrated and interoperable DeFi protocol matrix, featuring pool-based lending (global liquidity pool), native stablecoin (USX and EUX) and synthetic assets (like xTSLA, xAAPL, xAMZN etc), and trading (aggregator and AMM). By October 2021, dForce is among the top 5 protocol operates on Arbitrum in term of TVL.

dForce is backed by several world-class investors including CMBI (China Merchant Bank International), Multicoin Capital, and Huobi Capital. It is the world’s first open finance project powered by a leading commercial bank.

**About EntroFi**

EntroFi is an innovative DeFi lending platform designed to significantly improve the efficiency of financial infrastructure by bridging DeFi capitals directly with loan borrowers who use real world assets or native NFTs as collaterals. In specific, it is a two-way portal that pools and channels DeFi liquidity to SMEs and individuals who have been neglected or marginalized by traditional financial intermediaries, while on the other hand, brings a variety of real-world collateral assets (account receivables, real estates, pledges of equity, manufacturing &amp; logistic equipment) as well as existing native NFTs (Metaverse properties, artifacts etc.) to DeFi protocols by converting them into a new type of financial NFTs.

The stablecoin scare is coming again. And it infuriates me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qgd8c4/the_stablecoin_scare_is_coming_again_and_it/,LukesVeryGood,1,2021-10-27 02:46:52,9,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qgd8c4/the_stablecoin_scare_is_coming_again_and_it/,DISCUSSION,"*The text was written as an answer to a post over at* /r/MakerDAO*. OP asked what security measures maker should take against the pending ""SEC crack down"" on stablecoins. We should all relax and think before we act.*  
*Todays scaremonger is Bloomberg Crypto:* [*https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1452964460918890501*](https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1452964460918890501) 

I feel this is overhyped and the ""crack down"" slang is lurid and missleading.

The fact: Stablecoins, as well as DeFi, is regulatory-wise uncharted territory. This can be a problem for authorities (think money laundring prosecution) as well as customers (i.e. lack of stability due to lack of reserves).

It is not per se illegal to operate in uncharted territory. If something is not clearly prohibited by law, then it's allowed. The legal basis for that in most democracies is ""Economic Freedom"".

Practical example: Henry Ford did nothing illegal when he started manufacturing his cars, even tough there was almost no car regulation in the law at that time.

There are rules that prevent a govt agency to ""crack down"" on businesses out of the blue. ""Crack downs"" are for players that violated laws.

What HAS and IS going to happen before a ""crack down"" is even on the table:

1. Somewhen next week a Treasury Report will outline the alignment of responsibilities between the treasury and the SEC.
2. Then the respective authorities will establish a set of regulations for participants in the crypto market. I.e. how stablecoins have to be backed and how this backing is to be reported. (I guess Tether will have to create a more exact spreadsheet than now :-) )
3. This regulations will be established with a grace period (that's a legal requirement). This grace period might be short in some cases (i.e. reporting) but can be years long for other issues (like raise of reseve requirements).
4. If the grace period expires and a company does not fully fulfill the regulatory, they get an extended grace period and maybe a fine.
5. If a company behaves malicious or does intentionally not follow regulatories THEN a crack down will happen.

By now we're at least a six to 12 month away from the important deadlines in step 4. And no stablecoin issuer has so far objected to being regulated. Furthermore the absence of the SEC only indicated a lack of federal regulation in the US. In reality most stablecoins already operate under some regulation, either by US states or foreign-to-the-US countries.  
For example FINMA in Switzerland put their first crypto regulatories in 2018, so did Singapore. USDT was ""working with"" NY attorney general.

And regarding USDC: Also consider that there is only an absence of CRYPTO regulatories. Circle plans to go public. Doing so they have to follow regulatories involving reporting and transparency. This already does a lot to prevent them from overdeclaring reserves.

There's a chance that Bloomberg Crypto knows something we dont, but then they should bring the news so we can trade it. Otherwise stop being so annoyingly sensational.

**TLDR**: There is no legal basis for a ""crack down"" as there are no regulatories regarding stablecoins. Bloomberg Crypto is maybe baiting, maybe scaring the market in hope it will move."

Maker/MakerDAO protokoll összefoglaló (DeFi),https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qhpnjv/makermakerdao_protokoll_összefoglaló_defi/,pongvin,1,2021-10-28 23:33:06,0,/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qhpnjv/makermakerdao_protokoll_összefoglaló_defi/,👆 Ajánló,"# Bevezetés

A [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/) jelenleg a [második](https://defipulse.com/) legnagyobb DeFi protokoll a teljes lekötött érték alapján, az Aave után. 2014 -ben indult az Ethereum blockchain-en, és azóta az egyik legfontosabb elemét képezi a DeFi ökoszisztémának - néhányan a Maker-t a DeFi központi jegybankjának kezdték el hívni, szerintem nem alaptalanul. Ezt az összefoglalót annak az apropóján írom, hogy kb egy hónapja az egyik nagy francia bank [felvette a kapcsolatot](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605) a Maker-el, hogy hitelezzen neki Dai kölcsönt egy letéteményért cserébe. Az eset azért fontos, mert ennek a kimenetele megmutatja a világnak, hogy együtt tud e működni egy tradicionális pénzintézet egy decentralizált autonóm szervezettel (DAO), ami nem egy elismert jogi személy sehol.

# A Maker működése

**A Dai token**

A Maker feladata a **Dai** dollárkövető stablecoin kibocsátása. A Dai egy token, aminek az a speciális tulajdonsága, hogy nagyon szorosan követi az usa dollár árfolyamát: kvázi bármikor, bárhol be lehet váltani 1 Dai-t ≈ 1 USD ekvivalens másik cryptora (vagy igazi dollárra egy exchange-en). A legfontosabb kérdés természetesen, és egyben a protokoll legfontosabb eleme, hogy **miért és mitől** tartja az árfolyamát a Dai: miért nem emelkedett ≈$1.05 felé vagy süllyedt ≈$0.97 alá a Dai sok sok év óta.

A USDC stablecoin dollárkövető magatartását könnyű megérteni: egy Circle nevű tradicionális intézmény vállalja, hogy bármikor be lehet váltani nála 1 USDC-t 1 igazi USD-ért. A Dai mögött viszont nincs intézmény és nincs ilyen ígéret.

**A Dai életciklusa**

Dai-t bárki ""nyomtattathat"" magának egy OCDP (over-collateralized debt position) létrehozása által, amit Vaultnak neveznek. Nagy vonalakban az történik, hogy leköthet az ember valamilyen blockchainen található értéket (például ETH, USDC, WrappedBTC, vagy ez a security token amit a Societe-Generale ajánlott fel a bevezetésben) a Vaultba, és a letétemény **igazi usa dollárban számított** ellenértéke alapján kérhet ""kölcsönt"" Dai formában. A letétemény a collateral, a debt position a Dai kölcsön, a ""over-"" előtag pedig azt jelenti, hogy a letéteménynek mindig többet kell érnie igazi usa dollárban valahány százalékkal, mint ahány *darab* dai lett kölcsönvéve. **Minden** Dai token így születik, és akkor semmisül meg, amikor az ember visszafizeti a kölcsönt, **egy stability fee-nek nevezett kamattal együtt** (felszabadítva ezzel a letétet). A stability fee-ről lesz még szó.

Példa: Tegyük fel hogy 1 ETH most 100 igazi USD-t ér. Ezt az ETH-et leköthetem egy Maker Vaultba, és cserébe maximum 80 darab Dai-t ""nyomtattathatok"" magamnak a Makerrel (vagy kevesebbet). A letét értéke tehát igazi USD-ben számolva mindig több, mint a letét ellen felvett Dai tokenek *számossága*. 

**A dollárkövetés első pillére: árfolyam arbitrage**

Az 1 ETH amit a példában lekötöttem, egészen addig hozzáférhetetlen marad, ameddig vissza nem fizetem a Maker-nek a 80 darab Dai-t amit felvettem (plusz a stability fee kamatot). Az első pillére a Dai dollárkövető magatartásának ebből ered. Mivel a letétemény USD értékéből számítódik az, hogy *hány darab* Dai hozható létre vele és *hány darabot* kell visszafizetni, ezért hogyha változik a Dai USD-ben számolt árfolyama, akkor megéri venni, vagy még kölcsön kérni és eladni Dai-t. **Példa**: Ugyan úgy 1 ETH-et kötöttem le és 80 Dai-t vettem fel ellene, de ma hirtelen 1.5 igazi USD-t ér a Dai. Ez nekem marha jó, mert eladhatom a 80 Dai-t 120 igazi USD-ért, vehetek belőle még 120 USD-nyi ETH-et, amit leköthetek még plusz 96 Dai -ért, amit megint csak eladhatok 144 igazi USD-ért, amiből megint vehetek ETH-et. És így tovább, egészen addig, amíg a Dai nyomtatással le nem nyomtam az árfolyamát - a profitom meg egy rakás ingyen ETH.

Mi történik viszont, hogyha a Dai/USD árfolyama csökken, például 0.50 USD-re? Tegyük fel most egy pillanatra, hogy bízunk abban, hogy a Dai/USD árfolyam valamikor a jövőben vissza fog térni 1Dai≈1USD-re. Ez most egyelőre egy feltételezés, ahhoz hogy biztosabbak legyünk ebben, látnunk kell a többi pillért, de most menjünk így. Ebben az esetben nekem megéri USD-ért vásárolni Dai-t, mert összesen 40 USD-ért vissza tudom fizetni a 80 Dai-t amit felvettem az 1 ETH ért cserébe, **úgy, hogy megmarad a 80 Dai amit eredetileg felvettem.** Tehát ha visszaáll a jövőben az árfolyam 1Dai≈1USD-re, maradt nálam 80 Dai, -40USD (a piacon vásárolt Dai értéke) és *nulla adósság* a Maker felé: tehát össz 40USD-nyi profit. Ezt annyiszor csinálom meg, ahányszor megéri. Mivel minden ciklusban vásárolok Dai-t a piacról, emelem az árfolyamát, szóval egy idő után eléri a 1Dai≈1USD-t.

Ennek a kettő arbitrage lehetőségnek (és a Vault használók által működtetett arbitrage botok működésének) a hatása az elsődleges védvonal, hogy az árfolyam ritkán és kicsit tér el a 1Dai≈1USD-től.

**A dollárkövetés második pillére: Vault liquidation (Vault felszámolási eljárás)**

Mi történik abban az esetben, hogyha a letétemény értéke csökken, és már nem elegendő ahhoz, hogy fedezze az ellene felvett Dai-t? A példában, tegyük fel hogy 1 ETH 100 USD-t ért tegnap, 80 Dai-t fel is vettem rá, viszont mára 90 USD-re csökkent az ETH. Ezen az árfolyamon max 72 Dai-t tudnék felvenni, de 80-at vettem fel tegnap, tehát a letéteményem nem elegendő a kölcsönöm fedezésére a mai nap. A Maker megengedi, hogy a fedezetlen Vaultokat (OCDP-ket) *akárki* kivásárolhatja amikor csak akarja. Valaki meglátja, hogy fedezetlen a Vaultom, mert 80 Dai-val tartozok, de 72 lenne a max. Leegyszerűsítve, ez a valaki kivásárolhat engem úgy, hogy visszafizeti a 80 Dai kölcsönt a protokollnak a nevemben, és cserébe megkapja az 1 ETH-et ami a letétem volt. Neki ez megéri, mert gyakorlatilag 80 Dai-ért kapott 1 ETH-et, holott 1 ETH 90 Dai=90USD-t ér ma. 10 USD-nyi profit neki, -10 USD-nyi veszteség nekem (megmaradt a 80 Dai-m, de elvesztettem 90 USD-nyi ETH -et). A gyakorlatban kicsit bonyolultabb a deficiteljárás, valójában aukcióra bocsáttatik a fedezet és nem feltétlen az egész fedezetet veszti el a Vault tulajdonosa, de nagy vonalakban így megy. Ezeket a deficites Vaultokat vadászó embereket/botokat Keeper-eknek nevezi a Maker lingo, és az ő tevékenységük miatt a Maker protokoll összességében mindig túlfedezett, tehát mindig több értékű letétemény van a vaultokban mint amennyi Dai van forgalomban összesen. 

A Keeper-ek hozzájárulnak a Dai árfolyamának a stabilizálásához, mert valahonnan meg kell szerezniük a Dai-t, hogy kivásárolhassák a letéteményeket. Az első pillérben felvázolt 2 arbitrage lehetőség alapján eldöntik, hogy nyomtatnak e maguk, vagy inkább a piacon vásárolnak, vagy tökmindegy.

**A dollárkövetés harmadik pillére: Dai Savigs Rate (DRS)**

Van egy modulja a Maker-nek, amibe le lehet kötni Dai tokeneket, ahol kamatoznak. Fontos hangsúlyozni, hogy ez a modul kizárólag ennyit csinál, az ide lekötött Dai-t nem veheti kölcsön más, csak ülnek benne a tokenek és kamatoznak. Például beletehetek 100 Dai-t, és ha most épp 3% az éves kamat, egy év múlva kb 103 Dai-t tudok majd kivenni onnan. Előtte is kivehetem bármikor, vagy tehetek még be, másodpercenként íródik jóvá a kamat.

Vegyük észre, hogy a DRS egy *költség* a protokollnak, hiszen a kamatnak valahonnan jönnie kell (mert ugye mindenki többet vehet ki mint amennyit betett). Az extra Dai amit így kivehetnek az emberek nem a semmiből születik, hanem abból jön, amennyi extra kamatot kell visszafizetniük a Vault tulajdonosoknak az OCDP használatáért: a már említett **stability fee** egy része megy ide (de sose nagyobb mint a stability fee).

Ez a modul felfogható egy jegybanki alapkamat rendszernek, mert hasonló hatásokat ér el. A MakerDAO közösség határozza meg a mindenkori DRS alapkamatot, MKR Governance Tokenekkel szavazás alapján (erről lesz még szó a negyedik pillérben).

Az DRS alapkamat emelése vagy csökkentése befolyásolja a Dai kívánatosságát: minél nagyobb a DRS, annál jobban megéri Dai-t szerezni és lekötni a DRS-be. Minél alacsonyabb, annál kevésbé kívánatos Dai-t tartogatni DRS-ben, szóval érdemesebb elhasználni (e.g. eladni). Hogyha a a Dai árfolyama 1 USD alá esik, akkor a DRS megnövelésével kívánatosabb lesz Dai-t tartani a DRS-ben, ami Dai vásárláshoz vezet, emelve az árfolyamot (nyomtatni nem érdemes azért hogy lekösse az ember a DRS-be, hiszen a stability fee mindig nagyobb mint a DRS%). Ha 1 USD felé emelkedik a Dai, akkor a DRS % csökkentésével több Dai fog visszakerülni forgalomba ahogy kiveszik az emberek, csökkentve az árfolyamát.

**A dollárkövetés negyedik pillére: MKR Governance Token és a végső vásárló (buyer of last resort)**

A MKR tokennek elsődleges szerepe a Maker protokoll kormányzásával összefüggő szavazások lehetővé tétele. Akinek van MKR tokenje, szavazhat protokoll módosításokra vagy fejlesztésekre. A decentralizált kormányzásba nem mennék bele részletesen, csak abba, hogy miért éri meg helyesen kormányoznia a protokollt a MKR tokennel rendelkezőknek, és hogy kapcsolódik ez a Dai stabilitásához.  

Előfordulhat olyan eset, amikor túl hirtelen túl sokat esnek a letétemények, és a Keeper-eknek nem éri már meg teljesen felszámolni a deficites Vaultokat. Például: 1 ETH tegnap 100 USD volt és 80 Dai-t vettem fel ellene, de ma 50 USD-re esett az ETH. Az önkéntes Keeper nem fogja elvállalni, hogy veszteségesen kivásároljon engem, hiszem 80 Dai-t kéne befizetnie ahhoz hogy megkapja az 50 USD-nyi ETH-et, ez 30 USD veszteséget jelentene neki. A Keepernek viszont van lehetősége részben kivásárolni engem: 45 Dai-t befizet és megkapja cserébe az 1 ETH-et. Ebben az esetben a Maker rendszerben -35 Dai deficit keletkezett: a Keeper kivásárolta az OCDP-t, viszont csak 45 Dai folyt be, holott 80 volt az adósság.

A Dai deficitet sürgősen nulláznia kell a protokollnak, különben veszélyben van a Dai árfolyama (több Dai van forgalomban, mint amennyi lehetne). A deficit nullázásához a protokoll automatikusan elárverez új MKR-t 35 Dai-ért. Kvázi azt jelenti ki a protokoll publikusan, hogy kap az első jelentkező 1 új MKR-t 35 Dai-ért. Ha nem veszi meg senki, emeli 2 MKR-re és így tovább, ameddig nincs vásárló. A 35 Dai a vásárláskor megsemmisül (hogy fedezze a protokoll deficitet), a vásárló pedig gazdagabb lett 2 MKR tokennel amivel szavazhat.

# Végszó

A számok amiket használtam a posztban nem feltétlen valódiak, de a példa kedvéért egyszerűek, hogy szemléltessék a mechanizmusokat.

A MakerDAO kormányzásáról és a MKR token tulajdonosokról, valamint az aukciókról sok infot kihagytam, a System Surplus rendszert pedig nem is említettem. A protokoll maga szerintem egyetemi kurzus nagyságú, hogyha az egészet részletesen át akarja látni az ember. Vélhetően továbbra is a DeFi egyik meghatározó komponense marad."

Launched in November 2019, DAI (DAI) is the “new and improved” version of SAI (Single-Collateral DAI) and is an Ethereum-based stablecoin. DAI is developed and managed by the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO (decentralized autonomous organization) via a software protocol rendering it completely decentralized.

The launch of DAI brings the total number of cryptoassets available on Oobit to 43."

&gt; (1)  CryptoPunks are NOT bought and sold on the Opensea [market]. The CryptoPunks contract (anno 2017) predates the ethereum token standards #721/1155 and therefore is NOT compatible with the Opensea [market].
&gt; CryptoPunks are bought and sold exclusively 
&gt; on larvalabs site (the creators of the punks). 
&gt; This is why wrapped crypto punks exist. 
&gt; Note. Larva labs site has no [extra] fee [ontop of the standard ""gas"" transaction fee] 
&gt;
&gt; (2) Contract functions can make many calls 
&gt; and operations packed into one transaction
&gt; that a normal person cannot do. 
&gt; The contract took a 500+ million loan in $DAI
&gt; [- the MakerDAO stable coin -], deposited $DAI in
&gt;  compound/dYdX and borrowed $ETH, 
&gt; bought the contract owners punk with said $ETH. 
&gt; Then used the $ETH and repaid the loan. 
&gt; 
&gt; Note:  The flash loan here was 
&gt; from MakerDAOs flash mint module, which currently has no fee. 
&gt;
&gt; TL;DR - Borrow 500+ million, buy your own punk, 
&gt; repay 500+ million. No extra fees except 0.2 $ETH in ""gas"" transaction fees ( about $US 900).
&gt;
&gt; Here is the transaction (tx)  btw - &lt;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x92488a00dfa0746c300c66a716e6cc11ba9c0f9d40d8c58e792cc7fcebf432d0&gt;
