Hey all! I am a member of the Secret Network community, and I want to share some news related to the $SEFI governance token that launched today! $SEFI will focus on governance of [SecretSwap](https://scrt.network/blog/secretswap-is-live-on-mainnet), the first cross-chain, front-running resistant decentralized exchange, which launched on mainnet in February.

$SEFI is a Secret Finance governance token like $UNI for Uniswap and $SUSHI for Sushiswap that will unlock all kinds of yield farming opportunities within the Secret Network ecosystem. Full details can be found in the blog post I’d like to share here: ([SEFI is Live on Mainnet! - Secret Network](https://scrt.network/blog/sefi-is-live-on-mainnet))

The following groups are eligible to claim their $SEFI today: SCRT Stakers, LP’s to SecretSwap pre-genesis, SecretBridgde Users (selected groups).  Learn more about $SEFI distribution here([LINK](https://scrt.network/blog/sefi-governance-token-for-secret-defi))"

What is the point of Compound anyway?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mhdvdk/what_is_the_point_of_compound_anyway/,Draqqonfly,1,2021-04-01 03:36:55,7,/r/Compound/comments/mhdvdk/what_is_the_point_of_compound_anyway/,NaN,"First of all - I'm newbie in this topic so please be forgiving ;p 

Could someone explain to me what is the point of Compound protocol? It's supposed to work as a lending/borrowing platform for cryptos. Alright. AFAIK, in order to borrow some crypto, you have to place into the system some other crypto that has at least the same value, as collateral. That's to prevent the situation when someone borrows crypto and doesn't return it. Ok, but then what is the point of borrowing anyway? Borrowing in ""real life"" occurs when person A doesn't have money, needs the money, so he borrows it from person B and promises him to return it at a later date with some additional interest. Person B (the banks usually) has the power and right to punish Person A if he doesn't fulfill his promise. In Defi, this system cannot work because there are no promises. You have to put in collateral first, in order to borrow. But then. why borrow if you already have the equivalent amount of value in other crypto? Why not to just swpa the cryptos on some exchange?"

What happens to the protocol if asset prices fall very fast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mitmnf/what_happens_to_the_protocol_if_asset_prices_fall/,alsonotjohnmalkovich,1,2021-04-03 05:05:04,9,/r/Compound/comments/mitmnf/what_happens_to_the_protocol_if_asset_prices_fall/,Question,"Here's a scenario:

1. Some bad news, bug, or whatever (humor me) causes a panic sale of a large chunk of the crypto market, and lots of buyers cancel their orders
2. The market price of the collateral falls and triggers the sale of the collateral at an 8% discount. At this point the value of the collateral is still above the value of assets lent.
3. The price is still falling very fast, only a few arbitrageurs grab the discount because the arbitrage is uncertain, or the protocol isn't moving fast enough
4. The market value of the collateral is now under the value of assets lent. The protocol is still offering a discount. At some point when prices stabilize arbitrageurs will return a portion of the lent assets to the protocol, and that portion will be smaller than the deposits.

Questions:

1. Did I get this right? Am I missing something? Theoretically, is there in fact an asset price decline speed fast enough that could trigger this scenario?
2. Is that plausible in the least? Are we talking Black Swan territory or ""you're more likely to get hit by an asteroid"" territory?
3. How does Compound determine the price of an asset? E.g. how does it know how much USDC an ETH is worth?

I've been looking for an in-depth explanation of the protocol but couldn't find one that goes into that level of detail. If you have something to recommend please do!

Thank you :)"

I will also receive 14.11% COMP on the amount I borrowed as a distribution.

Recently I got back into airdrop hunting and came across [FaucetCrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/1074770) and checked it out since SFMoney seems to be a scam and I'm upset cause I had much time invested in the project and it seems it was for nothing. Discovering [FaucetCrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/1074770) I learned that the Claims on there are very simple, not click baiting, no redirecting, instant credit, and daily withdrawals with your pick of 20 coins!

Just say its alot faster then these Airdrops.."

**What is Student Coin**  
The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**

  In a nutshell?
  

  This brings consumer protection to Crypto and Crypto to every PoS-Terminal.
  

  To every supermarket. To every store.
  

  This is the missing bridge to the real world, the last puzzle piece to mainstream electronic payment adoption.

  Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583
  enabling crypto payments in standard terminals.""
  

  This is not financial advice, do your own research if you like the project, but check out this very interesting white paper:
  https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf
  

  To me this looks like an unknown hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance.
  With a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and the potential to explode when this hits the exchanges (July 2021).
  

  The ICO was originally scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases in only 9 days.
  

  Very important additional aspect for my investment decision: only 100 Million tokens total supply.
  

  Compare to 1 Billion DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion XRP !
  

  Best part? Nobody really heard of it yet.
  

  And still at only $0.74 right now"

How would the USDT supply and borrow rates develop in case of Tether insolvency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mqq59e/how_would_the_usdt_supply_and_borrow_rates/,torkildj,1,2021-04-14 21:05:10,3,/r/Compound/comments/mqq59e/how_would_the_usdt_supply_and_borrow_rates/,Question,"I am thinking about taking a USDT loan to do some yield farming, there are some good arbitrage possibilities. I am trying to gauge the risks in the case of a Tether insolvency event. When it is clear that Tether cannot maintain the peg to the dollar, obviously people would lose faith in USDT, which will send the value of the USDT token gradually towards zero. How would this effect the supply and borrow rates on the Compound platform? Intuitively, people won't want to supply USDT if the value goes down, so the supply yield would go up, and consequently also the borrow rates. I am right in my reasoning, or are there some other aspects that I am overlooking, perhaps some oracle/algorithmic logic that I am not aware of in the protocol."

**How it works the ICO**  
The ICO started in first days of April and started and $0,20 and each new phase price it’s going up till be listed on Uniswap for $1,20 on July    12. At this moment we are in phase 56 with the price at $0,75 and it  will continue till phase 100. If there is any token remaining on 30 June  they will be burned.

**How i can pay?**  
In  my case I choose to pay using Litecoin with Coinbase Wallet. It was the  lower fees I found to pay using Crypto. The other possibilities  it’s  to use Visa or Mastercard or even Bank Transfer.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

  In a nutshell?
  

  This brings consumer protection to Crypto and Crypto to every PoS-Terminal.
  

  To every supermarket. To every shop and to every store.
  

  This is the missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to everyday mainstream electronic payment adoption.
  
 
  ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum,
  Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583
  enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""
  

  This is not financial advice, do your own research if you like the project, but check out this very interesting white paper:
  https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf
  

  To me this looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance
  in a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and with the potential to explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).
  

  The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱
  

  Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to BUY:
  

  Only 100 Million tokens total supply – still at only $0.75 each right NOW !
  

  Compare to 1 Billion DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion XRP !
  

  Best part?
  

  Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet"

I have recently sent some ETH funds from my Exodus to CoinBase Pro trading account. Checking Etherscan I’ve realised it didn’t go directly but there was some detour. At some point, a wallet in between sent COMP token to an unidentified wallet (CoinBase custody I suppose). My question is, does CoinBase use COMP somehow to channel user’s ETH tokens? If so, why? I’m new and keen to learn. I’ve read that it’s a lending platform so far."

Between myself and 2 friends we own close to 200 comp and none of us plan on selling anytime soon and possibly will be holding for years. We've been discussing about future potential of the top defi projects and obviously comp and aave are the ones atm.

So comp's circulating supply is only 5.1m atm and total supply is 10m, which is close to half of btc's total supply. It also more and more comp tokens are being held/staked and so forth instead of being traded recently . Also I would think comp has just as many intuitional investors keeping their eye on this project as btc tbh. this platform could turn into something insanely huge in the near future. Compound and similar top defi platforms seem to be the next logical step in evolution for finance loans/staking and so on and I would imagine the big players will want their piece of the pie sooner than later.

Price wise, I've heard price predictions here and there and discussed with friends of a $1500-$2000 comp in the upcoming 1-2 months and maybe $5000+ towards the end of the bull run this year considering the potential growth of this platform and the total 3bill market cap. Also do you believe like some others that compound could hit 50k-60k+ next bull run? Call me overly excited for this project :)

Now, I need some cash because of financial difficulties and tried to get them out (and eventually convert to USD). Every time I do though it appears that the network fees (Eth gas fees?) is higher than the actual amount I have as collateral and therefore they cannot be taken out.

Is this for real. Gas fees of &gt;200$ for a transaction? Is trad baking now for plebs and crypto for zillionaires?

I  bring to you here some details of the Merchant Token ICO, i found this  project here on reddit and it was still on phase 26, and now it's  already on phase 61.

ICO  started at 1st April and its scheduled till the end on June, but  already sold out 61 phases of 100 in only 15 days! They will also  announce in their Twitter the first big partnership in next days.

$COMP token distribution,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mt14d2/comp_token_distribution/,DecentBlock_Ali,1,2021-04-18 07:00:56,5,/r/Compound/comments/mt14d2/comp_token_distribution/,NaN,"Hi,

I'd like to understand how COMP tokens are distributed; I read this piece that stated:

""The distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI…), proportional to the interest being accrued in the market; ""

[https://medium.com/compound-finance/expanding-compound-governance-ce13fcd4fe36](https://medium.com/compound-finance/expanding-compound-governance-ce13fcd4fe36)

&amp;#x200B;

How is this interest being measure? at first I thought it was APY ? but then it seems like tokens with least APY are earning the most?

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

we currently work on a uni project to create a decentralized NGO based on donations with a clear focus on the 17 sustainability goals of the UN. Donations are received through customers of e-commerce platforms that offer customers to increase the price of a product and become sustainable. By donating, customers receive voting rights and can decide via a crowd voting platform to which sustainability project they want to allocate funds from the treasury.

Could someone please provide us with help, cause we are struggling with the voting/governance token, whether to burn after voting or let them free-floating. 

Thanks a lot for reaching out!"

One thing I'm still struggling to understand is what interest rate I'm actually earning on a loan. I understand that the supply APY rate is constantly updating - does that mean it updates over the lifetime of my loan or do I lock in a rate at the time that I supply the loan? For example, if I initiate a loan of 100 USDT at a time when Compound says the APY is 4.0%, do I lock in that 4.0% and definitely earn 4 USDT at the end of the year? Or if the rate later fluctuates I could end up earning more or less than 4 USDT?"

&gt; *Goodbye, /r/compound.*

&gt; I'm done wading through coinbase referral spam. Mods are apparently doing nothing to fix the underlying issue.

&gt; Usually I think making a big deal about unsubscribing from a subreddit is kind of lame, but I felt like I needed to express my disappointment, since I like the product and like the community, I just can't keep dealing with the spam.

5 months ago it was Coinbase referral spam, now it's ""Student Coin ICO"" spam, whatever that is. It's gunking up my feed. Let's get Automod on this!

[According to /u/Compound_Team they do not own this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/jtok9j/goodbye_rcompound/gcfe1rv/), so I humbly ask the current owner /u/dotcomedy if they are up to the task of fixing this spam issue, or alternatively if they would be open to adding the Compound Team as mods. (If the Compound Team would be willing to moderate the sub or appoint mods to moderate the sub, that is).

But wait, my Tesla doesn't the space to move furniture, and I love my Tesla a lot and I don't want to sell it... Idea: instead, I loan my Tesla to somebody else for the time being, and in exchange I rent a U-Haul truck to move my furniture. Now I can move my furniture to Nevada, and I didn't have to sell my Tesla!

#### In a Nutshell?

This brings crypto to every PoS-Terminal and consumer protection to crypto via smart contracts. 🤝

The missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to everyday mainstream electronic payment adoption:

&gt; ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

To me this looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and with the potential to explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Only 100 **Million** tokens total supply – still at only **$0.85** each right **NOW** !

Compare this to 1 **Billion** DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion Ripple and check their current prices.

💎 **The best part?**

Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet! ☝

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

Merchant Token (MTO) can be stored in all wallets supporting ERC20 tokens.

**ICO Phases**

The price on ICO phases is going up $0.01 for each new phase reached, and the amount of each phase size is going to increase to provide strong resistance and not allow price going down when listed on exchanges. The tokens that are not selled up to 30 June will be burned.

Phase 1 to 22 - $100,000 each phase | Phase 23 to 52 - $250,000 each phase | Phase 53 to 94 - $500,000 each phase | Phase 94 to 99 - $1,000,000 each phase | Phase 100 - $1.704.503"

Today I would like to ask you guys to have a vote so we can integrate COMP in Orion Protocol. Another of my favorite projects around wherein they are already trading in BSC and ETH. They are an aggregator but you do not need to do KYC nor connect your wallet with your account logins. It is a DEX with a touch of a CEX-feel like platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently also, I have seen them get integrated with different platforms like Avalanche, Injective Protocol and other DEFI protocols. For me, it is time for COMP as well to get added. You may vote with me here: [https://www.orionprotocol.io/vote](https://www.orionprotocol.io/vote) You may also want to buy some $ORN tokens because the staking is coming soon. Better get some by buying some Orion here: [https://trade.orionprotocol.io/](https://trade.orionprotocol.io/)

Orion has  37 tradable assets on the terminal, resulting in 652 tradable pairs and they are still adding more as days passes by! So once the other plugins, decentralized brokerages and B2B transactions, we will be bigger in volume."

#### In a Nutshell?

This brings crypto to every POS terminal and consumer protection to crypto via smart contracts. 🤝

The missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to mainstream electronic payment adoption:

&gt; ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

💎 https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

To me this looks like an exclusive and undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (POS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) with the potential to go parabolic and explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Limited to only 100 **million** tokens total supply – still at only $0.85 each right **NOW** !

Compare this to 1 **billion** DOT, 2 **billion** Filecoin, 45 **billion** ADA, 100 **billion** Ripple and check their current prices.

Some people on twitter already see it at $15 and even $100 in the future. 🤷‍♂️

**The best part?**

Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet! ☝

Please stay friendly. This post is supposed to show people, who don't have a regular income a way to grab some crypto for free. This page (obviously) won't get you rich. It's supposed to give you a start without a risk of loosing money.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa](https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa)

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base

The value of each borrowed asset coin increases/decreases respectively with the value of each collateral asset coin. This account should never be insolvent right?

HIPS Payment Group Ltd. is a provider of innovative and cost-effective e-commerce and mobile payment solutions.

Merchant Token (MTO) can be stored in all wallets supporting ERC20 tokens.

**ICO Phases**

The price on ICO phases is going up $0.01 for each new phase reached, and the amount of each phase size is going to increase to provide strong resistance and not allow price going down when listed on exchanges. The tokens that are not selled up to 30 June will be burned.

Compound Experience - Start to Finish,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mz7u1x/compound_experience_start_to_finish/,foose45,1,2021-04-27 04:58:02,2,/r/Compound/comments/mz7u1x/compound_experience_start_to_finish/,NaN,"Hello, I've literally never posted on Reddit before so I hope this is appropriate but I wanted to share my Compound experience as a ""supplier"" in case that was helpful to anyone. 

I started with $1k trying to earn the Coinbase promotion in November 2020. I transferred that USDC to the Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase added $3 USDC, .0186 ETH, and .1038 COMP ($10 reward then worth $65 now!)  as the rewards and to cover transfer costs. Basically I was net cashflow neutral. I left that alone until February 2021 when both APY and gas fees were climbing. I transferred another $2k and paid .02659009 ETH to add to the pool. 2.5 months later I pulled everything out, possibly to explore other defi projects.

The supplied balance had grown to $3,059.88 and the APY has really fluctuated between 3-14%. I also earned .08797966 COMP. To close the contract I had to pay .00942222 ETH and to get the COMP I paid an additional .0096908 ETH, then a final $5.37 to transfer the USDC out of my wallet. With the rewards/interest/etc. I made $80.65 on the total $3k investment with all crypto converted to current prices. Basically fees ate all the ""interest"" and the rewards were my only profit. Obviously I could have left the funds for longer but the APY has been low so I wanted to look around. I agree with the general sentiment that the fees are only justified by larger transactions and there's not a lot of transparency or certainty with regards to what you're paying with these projects so I hope this helps someone.

TL:DR  
USDC $3,000 + $3 reward - 11.90 fees + 68.76 interest =&gt; 3,059.88 USDC  
ETH +.0186 reward - .05873701 fees =&gt; -99.21 at 2,467 ETH/USD  
COMP +.0108 reward + .089797966 =&gt; +119.98 at 625 COMP/USD  
Net gain $80.65 (including $113.83 in rewards)"
how to “cheaply” claim COMP using Etherscan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mz8t48/how_to_cheaply_claim_comp_using_etherscan/,silvester2ish,1,2021-04-27 05:41:09,1,/r/Compound/comments/mz8t48/how_to_cheaply_claim_comp_using_etherscan/,NaN,"[https://www.comp.xyz/t/insane-fees-to-collect-compound-distributions/593](https://www.comp.xyz/t/insane-fees-to-collect-compound-distributions/593)

The “claim” function attempts to withdraw COMP earned from every market – it’s not very efficient. You can use it when gas prices are low, or if you’re feeling skills in smart contracts, call function 20 (claim) via [Etherscan 41](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b#writeProxyContract) with your address and the cToken’s address - this is a “cheap” way to collect the COMP.

Can someone explain where to find:

\- holder (address)

\- cTokens (address\[\])

I checked some Etherscan transaction and I can't find it."

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

Capital gains/losses for cTokens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n01vs4/capital_gainslosses_for_ctokens/,dr_rokstar,1,2021-04-28 07:44:38,6,/r/Compound/comments/n01vs4/capital_gainslosses_for_ctokens/,NaN,"Everyone's favorite topic, I know.

It's my understanding that supplying and withdrawing tokens is a taxable event since cryptocurrencies are being exchanged.  If there's a price movement in the token that was supplied, then capital gains (or loss) will be generated when the token is withdrawn from Compound.  E.g. a supply of 1,000 BAT @ $0.32 followed by a withdraw of 1,000 BAT @ $0.40 results in $80 of capital gains.  Not great, but you'd have to pay taxes on those gains anyway when you eventually sold the BAT.

Now consider the situation where you borrowed and later repaid those 1,000 BAT.  You'll still owe $80 in capital gains at the end, but there's no BAT left to sell.

Is my understanding correct?  It's unfortunate that the cToken transactions are considered taxable events and not just a bookkeeping method used by the protocol."
old SAI borrow fucking me up - hard to get out of,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n02nsc/old_sai_borrow_fucking_me_up_hard_to_get_out_of/,seblt,1,2021-04-28 08:27:23,4,/r/Compound/comments/n02nsc/old_sai_borrow_fucking_me_up_hard_to_get_out_of/,NaN,"So I originally borrowed 625 SAI in late 2019 which resulted to 625 USD. Since then I didn't pay back the loan which results now, due to the price movement of SAI and SAI being pegged to ETH's price, to over 9k USD which I have to pay back in SAI to get my collateral (ETH) back out of the loan contract. Pretty fucked up, but okay. (Any work around?)

Okay, now I have to get the amount of SAI and this is where the next problem appears - liquidity. Uniswap is the only platform on where I can get SAI, but since there isn't enough SAI around I'd have to pay a premium of over 45% price difference, meaning 45% more ETH than the equivalent amount SAI is actually worth. Any way around that either?

If all of the above is true, and there is no way for me to solve this, I'm completeley fucked.

Thanks for help."

I invested on this project in the start of this month on  phase 5 and i got impressed how quick the ICO is going, currently it's   on phase 76 of 100 and the ICO that was schedule for end at 30 June   probably will end much earlier them expected! The current price is $0.95  and it will be listed for $1.20 on Uniswap when the ICO is over.  Check   the whitepapper on the website and i hope you like it!
