Max out 403(b) or invest else where?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lw5obq/max_out_403b_or_invest_else_where/,adamfuradam,1,2021-03-03 00:14:11,16,/r/personalfinance/comments/lw5obq/max_out_403b_or_invest_else_where/,Retirement,"I’m 40 yo with 100K in a traditional IRA that I do not contribute to and 100K in a 403(b) account. I contribute the minimum required (roth) to my 403(b) and receive a match (pretax) which equal to about 12% of my pretax income. I contribute to a HSA too (2% pretax). I will be debt-free in May with the exception of my mortgage and I need some advice on saving for retirement. Is it better to increase the roth 403(b) contribution to the IRS maximum? This will required an additional $1000  post tax and put me at 20% of the pretax income going into retirement. This account is managed by TIAA and is doing OK I guess as the curve is trending up (not a finance guy here). Or are there better things I could do with the $1000 like a back door roth or something. I do prefer a hands off approach as much as possible. Any advice or critiques on the current state of affairs are much welcome. Thank you! 

P.S.  My heart says take the additional 1000 per month and put 500 towards a backdoor roth and another 500 towards the mortgage. But my gut says increase your roth 403(b) contribution by an additional 1K a month and forget about it. That way you will learn to live within your means of what you take home."

**Rakuten**, japanska kompanija za elektronsku trgovinu i  maloprodaju putem interneta, sada omogućava korisnicima Rakuten  Wallet-a da koriste crypto u svakodnevnim transakcijama.

Prema saopštenju objavljenom prošle srede, korisnici Rakuten Pay usluga  će moći da dopunjuju svoje račune Bitcoin-om ($BTC), Bitcoin Cash-om  ($BCH) i Ethereum-om ($ETH).Rakuten Pay je aplikacija za mobilno plaćanje koja je podržane od velikog broja malih i srednjih maloprodajnih lanaca.

 Još 2019. godine Rakuten je omogućio potrošačima da svoje Rakuten Group Loyalty poene menjaju za kriptovalute.

Sada sprovode dublju integraciju spajajući Rakuten Wallet, Rakuten Cash  (Rakutenov servis za e-novac) i Rakuten Pay kako bi podržali korišćenje  kripta za plaćanje u maloprodajnim lancima kao što su McDonald’s, Seiyu  i FamilyMart.

Neće biti provizije za konverziju između fiata, e-novca i kripta, iako  postoji minimalni iznos potrošnje od ¥1000 (oko $9.40) i mesečna gornja  granica id ¥100k (oko $940)

Da bi koristili integraciju, korisnici će morati da budu Rakuten Member  i moraju imati otvoreni trading account koji je povezan sa Rakuten  Wallet-om.

 Kompanija takođe nudi mali bonus u vidu Rakuten poena kako bi podstakla članove da koriste ovu uslugu.

$DOGE-u je sada moguće pristupiti i putem 1800 bankomata širom SAD-a.

Coinflip, vodeći svetski operator Bitcoin automata, najavio je podršku  za $DOGE od prvog marta, a izvršni direktor i suosnivač kompanije,  Daniel Polotsky, pripisao je taj potez “nedavnoj popularnosti i nedavnom  masovnom usvajanju” $DOGE-a.

Coinflip je zabeležio astronomski porast u potražnji tokom poslednjih  12 meseci, sa prihodom više nego utrostručenim u odnosu na prošlu  godinu, jer je kompanije povećala broj svojih automata sa 441 na  približno 1800 od januara 2020.

Bankomati su postavljeni u 45 od 50 država SAD-a.

Njihovi bankomati takođe podržavaju $BTC, $ETH, $BNB, $DASH, $LTC, $LINK, $USDC, $XLM.

Welcome Alpha5 team to the Hoo Community!

https://preview.redd.it/5nsgu1l07sk61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d562aec2c69bda2eecac4d2f9c27759d835ee38

**Q1: Hi kenny, Could you introduce you and your team?**

Kenny: I am the Head of Business Development APAC of Alpha5. Been in crypto since early 2017. Previously headed bd for CoinFLEX, and previous to that helped build Coinsuper. From the traditional finance world — former Stock Broker with Morgan Stanley. And played poker professionally for many years. Graduated from UC Berkeley.

**Profile:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenny-shih%F0%9F%8E%AF-72a3bb/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenny-shih%F0%9F%8E%AF-72a3bb/)

Kenny: Our Alpha5 tech / development team is mostly based in India — hailing from the most prestigious universities of India. Some are former derivatives traders themselves with experience trading interest-rate arb strategies on the CME. They’re the thought leaders behind the Implied Matching Engine (modeled after the CME) on Alpha5.

**See:** [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%2234879704%22%5D&amp;origin=COMPANY\_PAGE\_CANNED\_SEARCH&amp;page=1](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%2234879704%22%5D&amp;origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;page=1)

**Q2: Can you bring brief introduction of Alpha5 for Hoo members?**

Kenny: Alpha5 is an advanced crypto derivatives exchange. Our differentiator is one can trade the “Entire Futures Curve’’ — powered by Implied Orderbook technology. The aim is to be the “Offshore Alternative to the CME”, catered to the institutional / sophisticated trading audience.

Over $1b traded since inception (live late Sept 2020), with very strong growth in active users &amp; median trade size. Jan 2021 saw our first days over $35m+ in trade.  


Backed by lead investor Polychain, as well as other notable investors: FBG Capital, SNZ, Altonomy, CMT Digital, Lvna Capital, ONEMAX ,CDI,etc.

**Q3: What makes Alpha5 different from other derivative exchanges?**

Kenny: Most of the incumbents — existing derivative exchanges — that came before us are in some form “copy+paste perpetual swap” and list any/all every token imaginable. If we wanted to follow this saturated model, it would’ve just taken 1–2 months to build, but there would be nothing unique about that (these exchanges already exist).

Positioning ourselves as different / cutting-edge, building an exchange with SPREAD MARKETS &amp; fully implied “in + out” orderbooks took some real significant time (more than 6+ months).

Spread Markets allow traders to exchange two legs (two different contracts) with 1 click, simultaneous actions: Long 1 leg, Short 1 leg. And by default always the ‘same size’ for all legs. This removes what we call “LEGGING RISK”, which can happen manually or even algorithmically when you have mismatched legs. This execution is a big headache and pain point for trading firms — thus we are serving a real need / filling a void in the marketplace.

We’re focused on BTC &amp; ETH — as we believe more and more fresh institutional entrants will start with just BTC &amp; ETH. We currently do not plan to list any/all altcoins and protocols. We aim to be the largest platform for BTC &amp; ETH Spread Markets — building out the interest rate curve — which will be the backbone of the underlying assets.

**Q4: Why are SPREAD MARKETS important?**

Kenny: Seasoned professional traders trade spreads (as opposed to just the outrights) because there is more control in variance / trading results.

**Q5: What is A5T?**

A5T is the native exchange token of Alpha5. It has a unique buy-back program that grows with the exchange. We have the standard buy+burn mechanisms customary to exchange tokens, however, see the innovative Insurance Fund commitment we added:

“20% of all monthly Alpha5 revenue is used to buy &amp; burn A5T supply OR placed into Insurance Fund. Also, up to 2% of all circulating A5T is subject to monthly buy &amp; burn at value = Insurance Fund / Total Supply.”

Assuming the Insurance Funds of exchanges grow in value (this is generally the case, but no guarantee), this presents quite a unique opportunity.

**Tokenomics of A5T**

**Q6: How does Trade-driven Mining work?**

Kenny: From March 1 onwards for 16 months (see Emissions Schedule), 60% of the A5T supply (30m A5T) will be trade-mined. The first 30 days is 88,888 A5T issued per day — distributed pro-rata to how much taker fees were paid on that day on Alpha5.

Yesterday was Day 1, these distributions are FREE and come in the form of “locked” A5T to the Alpha5 users. However, there is a cost to “unlock” the distributions of A5T. Every $5000 USDT of taker volume unlocks one A5T. Assuming taker fees ranging from 3.5 bps to 4.5 bps ([https://www.alpha5.io/site/Fees/](https://www.alpha5.io/site/Fees/)), the minimum projected price/cost to fully unlock one A5T is $1.75+. The equation being &lt;Alpha5 Taker Fee \* $5000&gt;.

**Q7: What’s the product roadmap for Alpha5**

Kenny: Aside from our main offering of Spreads for BTC &amp; ETH, we have many innovative ideas for products/features in the pipeline. We just released a feature called “Block Auction”: it’s a dark-pool style auction format, one hides their size &amp; intention, set at every 15 minutes and when time elapses — everyone gets matched at Marked Prices (any/all partial orders or not matched orders gets canceled). It’s FIFO format, thus if you place an order of interest earlier in a cycle, you are more likely to get matched. This is a FREE trading product.

We’ve had really amazing traction on this product, including over $25m trade the first two days of launch — and a record $17m trade in one day through it — again for FREE.

***UPDATE 18.01.2021****: Four more liquidity pairs have been added to the 2nd FL reward program, please read below*.

After the launch of the Freeliquid Protocol on 21.12.2020, a total value of more than $400,000 in liquidity pool tokens has been deposited in Freeliquid Borrow, issuing around 150,000 of USDFL stablecoins during the first few days only. The developer team of Freeliquid is thankful to all new users for trusting our platform and being the early supporters of the Freeliquid Protocol.

We would like to announce the next two reward programs that will start on 31.12.2020, 00:00 UTC. The 2nd and the 3rd programs will both have 850,000 FL tokens distributed over a course of months, which amounts to 85% of the future total supply. They are by far the largest and most impactful reward programs of Freeliquid. Thus, we would like to encourage users to take this opportunity and support our platform by participating in the next distribution programs!

This article begins with a general information about Freeliquid, since we assume that many readers are new to the project. A detailed description of the 2nd and the 3rd reward programs will be given in the second part of the text.

## What is Freeliquid?

The [Freeliquid Protocol](https://freeliquid.io/) is a new decentralized lending platform that has been launched on 21.12.2020. The main advantage of the Freeliquid Protocol is that it allows to lock liquidity pools from platforms like Uniswap as collateral.

For more information about Freeliquid Borrow, please read our [recent Medium article](https://freeliquid.medium.com/freeliquid-borrow-tutorial-b0216ad78f10) and watch our [video](https://vimeo.com/493096918) about opening a Vault. At the moment, Freeliquid supports only Uniswap liquidity pool tokens that consist of following pairs: USDT-USDC, USDT-DAI, USDC-DAI, USDT-USDN. The developer team is currently working on adding the support for further collaterals and platforms, for example, for locked pools from [Curve Finance](https://www.curve.fi/)."
Conclusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Freeliquid/comments/lx3aah/conclusion/,wedimo,1,2021-03-04 04:17:30,0,/r/Freeliquid/comments/lx3aah/conclusion/,NaN,"Freeliquid has been developed with a major aim to make liquidity pools work as a source of additional funds for its owners. As of December 2020, there are [around 1.5 billion of total USD value locked in liquidity pools on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/) alone. Despite their holders enjoy earning fees, the funds in liquidity pools are frozen and can not be used for other purposes. Even if pools remain at the approximately same value in USD (as with stablecoin pairs), no platform so far has been accepting them as security for providing loans — until now.

With the launch of Freeliquid, liquidity providers receive an instrument that enables them to turn liquidity pools into a source of funds, allowing to re-invest the original assets multiple times.

The developer team has a lot of things planned for further growth of Freeliquid, including more collateral types and support of pools from other platforms like Curve Finance. As always, we will only propose those changes to the community governance and carefully implement them only if the vote succeeds.

We welcome everyone to join Freeliquid and enjoy the early users rewards. For any questions and suggestions, please feel free to contact us and our community via the links provided below."

Let us not forget that Freeliquid is governed by the community of FL token holders — many changes to the Protocol parameters can be implemented only after a successful voting.

However, in this roadmap the developer team would like to share its vision on the major project milestones that the Protocol could achieve as a whole. Some of these changes require community voting, some not. But we believe that implementing most of them will have a profound beneficial impact on our platform and its further growth.

Anyway, let us get to the point! Below we present you the roadmap for Q1-Q2 2021 with a detailed explanation for each proposal.

&amp;#x200B;

# Planned for Q1 2021

**Governance platform launch**

* Finalizing and testing the governance platform at vote.freeliquid.io
* Conducting first votes, if necessary

Current status: Platform successfully launched on January 15, 2021. First vote proposed and finished on January 18, 2021.

Setting up the voting platform has been one of our first priorities right from the start. FL, being a governance token, should be used straight away for its main purpose — voting participation. The governance platform will also enable to implement changes to the Protocol, which can be suggested in the first weeks after the launch already.

**Waves Protocol integration**

* Forming a mutual partnership between Waves and Freeliquid
* Listing FL and USDFL on the [Waves.exchange](https://waves.exchange/)
* FL and USDFL liquidity pairs on [swop.fi](https://swop.fi/)

Current status: Finalizing, ETA February 2021.

Despite Waves and Neutrino Protocols have already achieved a lot in the last years, we believe that there is much more potential for their growth. We have been watching their projects closely, offering USDN support in Freeliquid Borrow from the day one. Waves blockchain offers low fees, quick transactions, and impressive solutions like DeFo or efficient token migration from Ethereum.

We thus propose to target a partnership with Waves Protocol, which will include listing Freeliquid tokens on Waves Exchange and Swop Finance (both running on Waves blockchain), among other things.

**Curves Protocol integration**

* Support of Curve LP tokens as collateral in Freeliquid Borrow

Current status: In progress, testing.

With more than $3B of total value locked (TVL) as of 30.01.2021, Curve Finance reigns as one of the largest players in the decentralized finance space. The protocol enables low slippages for token conversions and high APYs for liquidity providers.

Since a large share of Curve’s TVL is contained in stablecoin pools, adding a direct support for its LP tokens is a very logical step to do for Freeliquid. Curve’s liquidity providers can benefit from taking a loan on Freeliquid, while our own users might try moving their pools to Curve Finance and enjoy the high passive income it offers."

My name is Michael Gord. I’m a serial entrepreneur and investor focused on blockchains technology and digital assets mainstream and I’m the managing director of the XDB Foundation, which is focused on making blockchains mainstream by building out the DigitalBits consumer digital asset ecosystem. I have been focused on digital assets since around 2012 and was one of the earliest digital asset adopters in Canada. Over the past 10 years, I first built the largest collegiate network in Canada, expanded that network globally with the Blockchain Education Network where I helped to host some of the largest global student hackathons and activations ever, graduated and built the largest blockchain advisory firm in Canada with clients like TD Bank and global governments, was then the first blockchain  company in Canada to secure a JV with a broker dealer, worked with over two dozen digital asset networks (several that have become unicorns) and executed on the largest blockchain M&amp;A in Canada to launch the GDA Group, which has grown into an ecosystem of companies and funds focused across the blockchain capital markets industry and that compete globally. All of this was done without raising any external capital from investors. I am participating in this capacity within the DigitalBits ecosystem because I believe that Branded Currencies and Branded Stablecoins represent the most likely way for digital currencies to be used everyday by a mainstream audience. 

1.JR: In the blockchain Industry there are 3 core issues: security, scalability and interoperability, which will bring competitive advantages to blockchain projects. So, how does DigitalBits Project solve these problems? 

Michael Gord: - Regarding security the DigitalBits blockchain will soon be audited by expert security auditors, but the code is also open sourced which means that there will be thousands of eyeballs reviewing the code and making changes as the network grows. - Regarding scalability, DigitalBits was built to be enterprise grade and to integrate seamlessly into the backend of consumer applications that already have large numbers of users. Additionally, the DigitalBits Consensus Protocol allows quorums to operate and process transactions in parallel, allowing the network to maintain high performance and security as it scales. - Regarding interoperability, now that the Mainnet 2.0 upgrade is live, we are exploring developing integrations with other leading blockchains, as well as wrapping XDB onto other blockchains so that it can be usable in other ecosystems. Additionally, the DigitalBits blockchain allows for easy asset issuance, where any on-chain entities can act as anchors. This includes the issuance of other tokens, allowing them to interact with DigitalBits users and applications. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.JR: What are the major achievements that the DigitalBits Project has accomplished to date? What milestones are planned in the upcoming months/years? 

Michael Gord: Since launching the XDB Foundation in June 2020, the DigitalBits ecosystem has undergone significant growth. - We were among initial entrants to the World Stablecoin Association (WSA), joining other notable stablecoin projects such as Ren, BRZ and Stably. We also entered the WSA as the leading proponent of branded stablecoins, and presented the case for branded stablecoins at the first ever World Stablecoin Summit. The XDB Foundation continues to work closely with the WSA and its members to further this emerging asset category. Notably, the DigitalBits blockchain will see its first set of stablecoins, such as ZUSD and USDS, on-chain later this year.  - The XDB Ambassador Program was launched, allowing DigitalBits community members to assume heightened roles within the DigitalBits ecosystem. In parallel, we’ve also witnessed the emergence of several regional channels, fostering the DigitalBits conversation worldwide and in various conversations. - DigitalBits has had a strong presence at Global Family Office events. These events have historically played host to more conservative organizations, more focused on wealth preservation as opposed to rapid wealth accumulation. However, I’ve observed in recent time, as the new generation comes into its own, that there is an increasing interest in emerging technologies, such as blockchain and digital assets. As these organizations begin to explore blockchain technology further, this could open some massive floodgates that will play a significant role in establishing the viability of cryptocurrencies. - At the Blockchain Futurist Conference, we announced the addition of Stably to the DigitalBits ecosystem, bringing a white label stablecoin platform to the DigitalBits blockchain network. - Welcomed several institutional supporters to the DigitalBits ecosystem, including Alpha Sigma Capital, 12 Peers Capital Markets, in addition to others not yet announced. - Last week we unveiled the DigitalBits Mainnet 2.0 upgrade. DigitalBits github repos are now publicly accessible, where developers are now free to jump in and begin building their own solutions, including branded stablecoins, consumer digital assets, etc. - XDB was also listed on new exchanges including Bitmart, Biki - with Biki notably launching support for ZUSD as well as the first instance of the XDB/ZUSD trading pair. This month I’m excited to announce that we have an upcoming major exchange listing, so stay tuned. - Secure Digital Markets also announced their institutional support for ZUSD, opening that door for future branded currencies released on DigitalBits. - Zytara, a fintech company launched by DigitalBits founder Al Burgio, has already achieved significant success since coming out of stealth in December of last year. They have announced plans for their digital banking platform and payments network. In partnership with Prime Trust, Zytara also launched the Zytara dollar, ZUSD, on the Ethereum network, and later this year, DigitalBits mainnet. Zytara has also engaged in partnerships with significant esports organization Dignitas, as well as i2c Inc, a global processing platform that has already amassed a number of accolades within both the traditional and blockchain spheres. Notably, they have worked with Crypto.com, NetCents, Wirex, and Apto Payments - the technology provider for the Coinbase Visa Card. In the short term the XDB Foundation plans to: - Announce needle moving partnerships that will bring significant adoption to the DigitalBits blockchain, demonstrate our ability to enter verticals other than gaming, and open up a new enterprise pipeline. - We have three product launches this month that will significantly increase the functionality and user experience of the DigitalBits blockchain as well as demonstrate our ability to build and release world class products. For example, I’m excited to announce that this week we will launch xdbportal.com that will provide users with another way to access the DigitalBits blockchain! Through the XDB Portal, developers will have access to various functionality that is available with the DigitalBits blockchain network including the ability to create tokens, the ability to access multi hop technology and the ability to access and use the onchain DEX - Connect DigitalBits with global developer communities such as the Kerala Blockchain Academy, introduce a DigitalBits Grant program and online educational programs - Connect with a venture capital / private equity company to build a fund focused on investing into products built using DigitalBits technology - Launch multiple DigitalBits mainnet token giveaway contests which will be announced in the coming days - A more detailed roadmap for Luna to Mars will be released at the beginning of next quarter. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. JR:How do you plan to tap into the major Asian market for gaming? How has Biki been received? I know a lot of people were mocking it at first but it seems to have pretty decent volume. What are the plans of reaching the Dubai audience? I know you plan on moving there full time. 

Michael Gord: Asia-Pacific is an absolutely integral component to the global gaming market - of which it accounts for approximately 50%. There are a number of esports collaborations set in the pipeline, many of which we are expecting to be received well within the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the wider gaming community. This will be bolstered by a number of activations that will not only increase exposure and awareness for blockchain technology, but allow users to engage directly with the technology. The listing of XDB and ZUSD by Biki was a strategic move in entering the Asia-Pacific markets, given that they are based in Singapore, as well as the first instance of an exchange listing that trading pair, which is something we want to see replicated with future listings. Biki is a well respected global exchange that now services more than 3 million users.With regards to Dubai, I plan to once again return to Dubai to speak at the upcoming Ritossa Family Office event. Similarly, there are several larger investors who I met in Dubai that have participated in DigitalBits already and have begun to open up their networks. In addition, GDA Capital is officially expanding to Dubai with a couple key hires in the region.Also not planning to be anywhere full time but Dubai is a good base for the short term at least! 

&amp;#x200B;

4.JR: How is DigitalBits doing in terms of funding to be able to keep up the development of the product and introduce new partnerships for years to come? 

Michael Gord: First off, DigitalBits is an open-source project. As such, it is reliant on a community of contributors. Many of these contributors are very well capitalized, such as organizations like GDA Capital and Zytara.The XDB Foundation also plans to launch a DigitalBits Grant Program to encourage development and use of the blockchain and we are going to continue to invest in growing the wider community who are leveraging the DigitalBits blockchain for unique use-cases. Regarding the partnership plan and pipeline - as any open source project, our objective is to grow the ecosystem and community, and get it to a point that it is fully autonomous, where we are just one of several contributors. Our go-to-market strategy is to partner with the leading organizations in their respective industries and we expect that as the rest of the market sees what these leading organizations are introducing, that we will have a large amount of inbound requests to have similar models done for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

5.JR: DeFi is one of the hottest topics in the blockchain space right now. Can you share your opinion about DeFi with us? Do you think that DeFi will disrupt the existing financial system? What is DigitalBits approach towards the DeFi sector? 

Michael Gord: DeFi has already begun to disrupt the financial system. Financial intermediaries have long played a critical role in our society - they made up for the lack of trust between entities which has allowed for increasingly complex financial relationships.Blockchain technology, and through it DeFi, have begun the journey of providing these same services in trustless environments and by doing so, we significantly reduce the cost and time it takes to offer these services, as well as the barriers to entry. Bank accounts, credit scores are no longer prerequisites, it’s now become a matter of having an internet connection. And this doesn’t mean that a bunch of people with bad credit are coming in to use defi, there are more than 2 billion unbanked people around the world, many of these individuals hold prominent roles within their communities, hold very high credit with their peers etc. What defi has done is allowed them access where they didn’t have it before, and plugged them into a global ecosystem.it is my expectation that Ethereum’s entire DeFi ecosystem including exchanges, lending platforms, yield farming, can and will eventually be built out on DigitalBits. Also through branded stablecoins, organizations will be able to offer financial services in a decentralized manner without the exorbitant collateral requirements we see today. This may be done through consideration of additional information, such as consumer buying behaviour, associated with an account via branded stablecoins.

&amp;#x200B;

6.JR: Ok the next question is we have many new investors joing cryptocurrency and they do struggle in looking for a great projects with solid fundermental. Does the DigitalBits team have a training and guidance system for newcomers to cryptocurrency? How do you attract and reach them? 

Michael Gord: Yes, it has been disclosed that we are currently upgrading both the XDB Foundation and DigitalBits website to include much more information on the scope of the ecosystem. We are also building developer and technical architecture training programs so that developers can learn to build on the DigitalBits blockchain. We have a lot of experience with this, for example, introducing developer curriculums in partnership with the Kerala Blockchain Academy in India. The approach we have taken at the XDB Foundation, is first and foremost, to create a technology stack that is able to provide huge amounts of value, and secondly, to present it in a way that allows the most amount of people to benefit from it. We want the complexities of working with the blockchain to be abstracted out so that we can focus on mainstream adoption.Regarding fundamentals, XDB presents an interesting case for analysts to model out what amount of the supply will be held by enterprises to use the technology, and how the available supply might react considering user growth, transaction volumes / gas fees, and new asset issuances. 

&amp;#x200B;

7.JR: Are you just targeting the gaming industry or do you have other markets you want to conquer in the near term? 

Michael Gord: Yes, we have engaged with organizations in industries other than esports. Similar to our approach with esports, we have targeted organizations that are positioned at the top of their respective industries - their use of DigitalBits, branded stablecoins etc. would demonstrate the utility of the technology, and is likely to act as catalysts to adoption.As for the gaming &amp; esports industry, pursuing this space has proven to be highly strategic. The COVID-19 pandemic brought on an unprecedented series of events, economies were turned on their heads across the globe. Retail and professional sports were both hit extremely hard. At the same time, given the inherently borderless nature of esports, the industry was able to pivot extremely well, and actually grew by some metrics during the pandemic, where at the same time, some professional sports experienced upwards of 50% drops in viewership - the US Open Finals notably experienced a 56% drop.Struggling economies, coupled with the meteoric rise in esports, made it an obvious choice as an insertion point. Tack on the fact that global brands are increasingly viewing esports as a viable medium for marketing, the approach really does come full circle. We expect to see a large amount of innovation within consumer digital assets originate from developments within the esports and gaming sector.

&amp;#x200B;

 8.JR: Will XDB integrating NFTs into their protocol? 

Michael Gord: On our current trajectory, asset tokenization will become increasingly more pervasive - this includes unique digital assets, NFTs. Although it’s not an immediate action item on the DigitalBits roadmap, the GDA Group has a joint venture, Metaverse Group, which focuses on NFT real estate, and is about to introduce the Rare Store. Rare Store will introduce NFT collectibles, featuring famous musicians, athletes, influencers etc. The goal is that Rare Store be blockchain agnostic and that these assets flow freely between ecosystems. So, as NFTs capabilities are built into the DigitalBits Project, I expect that we should be able to drive some immediate traffic through our existing NFT operations, as well as attract other projects that feel they can benefit from the DigitalBits technology stack and ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

9.JR: I know you mentioned the aim is to have 1 billion users by 2030, but how many users are projected for 2022, and by 2025? 

Michael Gord: The game plan is to create one of the worlds largest blockchain ecosystems, ultimately scaling to billions of users. It’s projected that by 2023 there will be over 3 billion gamers worldwide, so esports and gaming is highly strategic. Gaming provides a very unique opportunity in that it is inherently global, the world of gaming connects people from several different geographies, and in doing so, people from different backgrounds, professions, etc., this includes a portion of the 2 billion unbanked people worldwide. Zytara and their ZUSD are not only leveraging the global gaming market as a strategic way to enter the household, but there is also an intersection between the gaming market and the unbanked. In many areas, there are additional barriers or deterrents to having a bank account besides having insufficient capital, such as the banks are so far away it doesn’t make sense to have an account. Now any gamer will be able to simply and cheaply have access to a USD pegged asset, which is very desirable in unbanked communities. Building this directly into the gaming experience will promote financial inclusion and  literacy within the users gaming experience.The onboarding of esports and gaming organizations can potentially bring massive amounts of users into the blockchain space. Initially, these users will be introduced to the technology through specific activations and promotions - for example, #SevenDaysofZytara, the recent joint promotion held by Dignitas and Zytara, but ultimately the goal is to have them using applications that leverage the DigitalBits blockchain. The Zytara app is a prime example of this. JR: AMAZING !! ..Sounds like this year we going to see the real adoption inorder to get those projected numbers. Michael Gord I expect the curve to be exponential but yes we should see some increasing adoption 

&amp;#x200B;

10.JR: How is the Foundation planning to attract developers onto the network? (a) for developing solutions on the network and (b) for governing the code itself? 

Michael Gord: A) The DigitalBits Grant Program incentivizes developers and builders to complete tasks that add value to the DigitalBits ecosystem. We will also host hackathons, case competitions, and startup competitions that provide opportunities for individuals to showcase their talents and leverage the DigitalBits technology stack for their own unique use-cases. We will be introducing programs such as the Top XDB Exec, Top XDB Dev, Top XDB Startup, among other competitions in future quarters. We will also be building online educational content and tutorials, a DigitalBits developer MOOC and developer bootcamp that we can introduce in existing blockchain developer training programs such as the Kerala Blockchain Academy. B) The Foundation’s goal is to provide technology and an ecosystem that is conducive to and fosters innovation. Builders and developers are free to use the technology in whichever way they can conceive. Regarding validation, we have already seen public commitments from organizations such as Zytara &amp; Stably to also support the blockchain as a node. I expect more enterprises to also come forward with public support in a similar capacity. 

&amp;#x200B;

11.JR: Trust is very important in business. So, what makes investors, customers and users feel safe when working with DigitalBits? And how will you get the trust of many users that have negative thoughts about Blockchain and DeFi? 

Michael Gord: A lack of trust generally comes from fear of uncertainty. DigitalBits is already at the center of a burgeoning ecosystem that includes investors, enterprises, and infrastructure providers with global reach. It is known by the market that Zytara, which is also very well funded with a large existing ecosystem of users and a significant moat in the market as far as licensing and technology development, is also building on DigitalBits and that the Zytara Dollar (ZUSD) and USDS will be on DigitalBits in Q2.  Al Burgio, the founder of the DigitalBits project as well as the CEO of Zytara, is a serial entrepreneur who has raised over 70M for his last company Console Connect. In my career, I have also worked with a large number of digital assets, several of which have achieved unicorn valuations, and this is the only project that I have taken a role in this capacity. We are certainly all at the table here to accomplish something big. 

&amp;#x200B;

12.JR: Marketing is an essential element of every project, so everyone knows the potential that a project can generate. What is your strategy to attract new users and investors and maintain it in the long term? 

Michael Gord: I believe DigitalBits will be very sticky in the marketplace because enterprises who leverage DigitalBits technology will do so seamlessly into the backend of their existing consumer platforms that already have adoption. DigitalBits will be able to leverage the massive network efforts of these organizations driving significant adoption quickly to the ecosystem. In addition, through the existing relationships of the Zytara and the XDB Foundation team, I expect to onboard world famous influencers to participate in and drive mass awareness for the DigitalBits network. 

&amp;#x200B;

13.JR: How does the team perceive retail investors DigitalBits token holders? Where do you see value in ‘us’ and what could we do to support your work most effectively? 

Michael Gord: The goal of the XDB Foundation is to support the creation of one of the largest blockchain ecosystems in the world. Also, that users experience the most possible utility when using the DigitalBits network, and feel that there is benefit to operating within the DigitalBits ecosystem as they send value globally, participate in decentralized finance, tokenize assets, etc. There are a number of avenues to support the project and the DigitalBits ecosystem. First and foremost, if you hold XDB, you are already supporting the DigitalBits ecosystem and congrats on being an early adopter! If community members want to get more involved we have an active XDB Ambassador Program that has been launched to showcase and connect emerging community leaders. The XDB Ambassadors contribute in a number of different ways, including content creation, group moderation, community leadership etc., and perks such as exclusive meetings with the team. My goal for the XDB Ambassador Program is for the ambassadors to develop global networks through the XDB ecosystem that can become priceless in terms of long term value and opportunity.XDB Liquidity Reward Program - the XDB Foundation is currently rewarding LP’s of the XDB/ETH and XDB/ZUSD pairings on Uniswap. These are in addition to the rewards Uniswap already distributes. You can find more information about this program on our Medium. Use XDB! Accept it. Spend it. Use it between your friends/family/peers!Create content, participate in the discussion and the upcoming DigitalBits Mainnet token giveaway contests. This is how we as a global crypto community develop ideas, identify use-cases, decide how to implement solutions and determine where we can create value etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

14.JR: Can you list the outstanding features of DigitalBits that you think are the strengths that will help DigitalBits succeed? In the future, will the DigitalBits token have more utility?

Michael Gord Technology: Fast, low-cost payments. We are seeing the issues with the Ethereum blockchain being slow and costly to use. From day 1, speed and high throughput were amongst the key focuses for DigitalBits to be able to enable a frictionless user experience. The multi-hop DEX creates a flexible trading environment, allowing assets to flow freely between network participants. Users are able to hold value in assets of choice, only swapping out at point-of-sale. In-app integration allows DigitalBits to optimize application backend infrastructure, complimenting as opposed to combating consumer learned behaviour. Market Size:  We are looking forward to showcasing the capabilities of the DigitalBits blockchain through the world of esports, where payments have become an increasing point of friction for organizations and users alike. Solutions such as ZUSD that leverage the DigitalBits blockchain look to be a game changing addition to payments and value transfer. Through the esports industry, there is also the opportunity for mainstream brand engagement. Esports is also not the only industry that we are engaged in. Team experience. Regarding utility - the XDB token acts as fuel for the DigitalBits network, and is required to conduct operations on-chain. The digitalbits token will ultimately serve to power a diverse number of use-cases as it is leveraged for account initiations and payments. We are always open to exploring new use-cases of the token, and how it could be used within the network, but outside of its core functions this will more so be up to the users. Integrating DigitalBits into platforms that can implement things like lending, farming, staking etc., will be up to the creativity of those building on the network."

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I'll turn the call over to Pierce.

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin the call by acknowledging that our employees and our customers recently endured some of the coldest and most extreme weather ever seen in our service areas. Due to the intensity and the duration of this winter storm, we experienced unforeseeable and unprecedented circumstances in our Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas jurisdictions. We saw the coldest day recorded in over a century in Oklahoma City. Some of our largest cities experienced rolling electric brownouts and countless water main breaks. In Texas, grocery store shelves were bare and long lines formed at gas stations.

&amp;#x200B;

For seven long days, our employees worked through these adverse conditions, some experiencing their own personal challenges, and collectively, with our customers' help, we kept the gas flowing to meet the most basic needs of our customers, keeping them warm. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for our employees' teamwork, resiliency and responsiveness as we dealt with this historic winter storm.

&amp;#x200B;

On today's call, we will cover some of the challenges that we faced and how we're managing the recovery and impact to our customers. We will also discuss our 2020 results and 2021 guidance. You will hear how our culture and our core values led us through this recent event.

&amp;#x200B;

So Sid, I'll turn the call over to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert S. McAnnally -- Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, Pierce. As you just heard, last week, our team faced an unprecedented weather event. On the coldest day, February 16, we experienced low temperatures between six and minus 16 degrees Fahrenheit in our largest metro areas, with employees working in wind chills as low as 25 degrees below zero. In Oklahoma, we experienced the coldest day since 1899. For context, average February lows normally range between 25 and 45 degrees in our largest metro areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Our more than 3,600 employees responded to the challenge, remaining focused on our primary goals, providing natural gas service and prioritizing human needs and safety, commitments that were supported by orders from our regulators in all three states. Since ONE Gas was founded in 2014, the company is focused on improving the resilience of our system. We have successfully completed 19 projects that provided new transmission supply points and 81 projects that provided interconnects to reinforce our system, all focused on improving reliability and in anticipation of events that might challenge our ability to serve our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

As the weather developed, our system models were updated to identify those areas that would need additional reinforcement under worst-case forecasts. Engineering was engaged to identify opportunities to enhance pressures across the system, locating additional supply points for mobile compressed natural gas trailers and designing 18 overland projects that could provide additional supply to lower pressure systems in the short term. Our supply chain personnel provided materials and the construction teams safely executed each of the 18 projects in just a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that roads might become impassable, we deployed pressure and measurement technicians to critical locations across each state in advance. Customer service orders were adjusted to build response capacity, and work shifts changed to meet the anticipated increase in emergency calls from customers. Call centers prepared scripts so that we would be able to share updated information with customers who contacted us. The communications team proactively released conservation and gas safety messaging to all available outlets.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, a series of news releases and videos were provided to local media outlets to prepare our customers across all three states. The government affairs and community relations teams remained in constant contact with key stakeholders, including governmental officials, regulatory officials and emergency response agencies throughout the duration of the event. Our commercial team was simultaneously working with large industrial transport customers, advising that gas supply and system issues were possible and that they should begin voluntary reductions to prepare their facilities for critical flow only.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this information, customers have the opportunity to stage down their operations in a way that protected their assets and protected the overall system pressure to help prevent widespread outages. Over the weekend, with a focus on protecting health and safety, we issued formal curtailment notices to large volume commercial and transport customers across all three states. Throughout the following week, we consistently coordinated with customers to manage gas volumes.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take this opportunity to thank those large volume customers who, through these curtailments, allowed us to maintain pressures and stabilize the system to protect the health and safety of customers across our territory. These reductions, in addition to the volume saved through conservation by our residential and commercial customers, were meaningful to our ability to withstand the unexpected supply constraints that we experienced. Despite these efforts, the duration of sub-freezing temperatures led to continuously increasing natural gas use at the same time that supply was constrained.

&amp;#x200B;

By February 15, freeze-offs of many wellheads severely restricted the production of natural gas when demand was at its highest. The combination of increased demand and upstream supply issues led to natural gas market prices never seen before. On February 18, the spot price for natural gas in Oklahoma rose to over $1,200 per Mcf. For comparison, the average natural gas industrial price in February last year was $3.54 per Mcf. As electric utilities instituted load shedding plans by executing brownouts, we remodeled our system to consider the impact of highly variable pressures created by the cycling of electric outages with a concentration in Oklahoma and Texas.

&amp;#x200B;

We also extended our normal damage prevention measures and added patrols to watch our critical infrastructure in order to minimize any potential negative impacts by third parties, including water utilities as they began to experience water main breaks in numerous cities. By February 19, it was clear that our system would withstand the storm without significant outages. As soon as possible, and as gas supply showed a sustained increase, we began working with our large customers to increase volumes starting over the weekend and into the first part of this week. We've returned service to all large customers and to those subject to storm-related curtailments.

&amp;#x200B;

For the entirety of the event, we lost service to approximately 900 of our 2.2 million customers across three states, in most cases for less than 24 hours. This performance was the result of many elements coming together: The system improvement since 2014, the dedication of employees across our company who went the extra mile to maintain gas service, the goodwill of customers who conserved serve their usage and the work of our field operations team, who, in the most challenging conditions, worked tirelessly to ensure that our system continued to provide natural gas to our residential customers and critical care facilities. And now, I'll turn it over to Caron.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the financial impact of the winter weather event, let's close the loop on 2020. Yesterday, we announced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $3.68 for the full year. These results also were in line with our revised 2020 guidance range, which was EPS of $3.66 to $3.70. Our capital expenditures and asset removal costs for the year were $512 million, also in line with our expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, the ONE Gas Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.58 per share, an increase of $0.04 or 7.4% compared with the previous dividend of $0.54 per share. We're happy to address any questions you may for 2020 but given the number of questions we've already received about the winter weather event, let's turn to that. As we shared in the 8-K we issued Monday, the unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for natural gas costs in our jurisdictions resulted in aggregated gas purchases for the month of February of approximately $2.2 billion, multiples higher than what we would expect for a normal February and in excess of our then available liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Our purchased gas costs are recoverable through the tariffs in each state where we operate. We have the authority to defer the extraordinary costs associated with this winter weather event, including natural gas purchases and costs related to the procurement and transportation of gas supply in Texas and Kansas, and we expect to receive similar authority in Oklahoma. The period over which we will recover these deferred costs will be determined in future regulatory proceedings. Payments for February's natural gas purchases are generally due on March 25. We have obtained a $2.5 billion two-year term loan to provide us the additional liquidity we need to meet these obligations.

&amp;#x200B;

With that financing, as of February 24, we had access to approximately $3.1 billion in total liquidity, including $2.5 billion in commitments under the new term loan and approximately $595 million available under our existing credit facilities and cash on hand. Our existing credit facilities include a $250 million 364-day revolver, which expires on April 4. We're working with our lead bank to upsize our $700 million revolver upon expiration of the 364-day facility. The new term loan and our existing credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity until we have clarity regarding how and over what period these deferred costs will be recovered before we determine how best to refinance the term loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Subsequent to our entering into the term loan, on February 23, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured rating to A3 from A2 and S&amp;P downgraded us to BBB+ from A. Both downgraded our commercial paper to Tier two from Tier one and revised the outlook for the ratings to negative from stable. Our credit facilities and the term loan include a provision to adjust pricing in the event of a change in our ratings. Although our cost of borrowing will increase slightly, we are confident these investment-grade ratings will continue to allow us to access the capital markets on terms that will support our current and planned level of operations. Last month, we announced our 2021 financial guidance, including net income of $198 million to $210 million, earnings per diluted share of $3.68 to $3.92 and capital investments of $540 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the weather event, the fundamentals of our business haven't changed. As evidence of the confidence we have in our business outlook and commercial and operational capabilities, we are affirming our guidance ranges for 2021. We are not withdrawing our five-year growth outlook. However, we recognize that the financial impact of the recent weather event has introduced a greater degree of potential variability to our longer-range forecast.

&amp;#x200B;

Once we have regulatory clarity on the recovery period for the deferred costs, we can assess any impacts to our five-year growth outlook. Since our separation from ONEOK in 2014, we have provided annual forecast for a range of financial metrics, which we have generally attained or exceeded. We have also demonstrated an ability to consistently extend our long-range growth outlook via focused, cost-conscious investments primarily geared toward safety, system integrity and reliability. Our systems resiliency in the face of historic stresses this month is a testament to those investments, the hard work of our teams and the cooperation of our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Our focus has not changed nor has our ability to source and execute commercial opportunities. The forecasting challenges I note stem entirely from the timing of recovery of the cost we incurred from this isolated weather event. As has been our hallmark since day one, we will remain transparent with you and provide updates as information is forthcoming. We're having productive discussions with our regulators and others regarding the regulatory orders for deferral of the extraordinary cost of the weather event and the potential for securitizing the obligation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll turn it over to Curtis to update you on the latest. Curtis?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, Caron, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a brief overview of current storm-related regulatory and legislative activity and then give an update on our commercial and other regulatory activities. As Caron described, both the Kansas Corporation Commission and the Railroad Commission of Texas issued emergency orders authorizing all state utilities to defer costs incurred as a result of the winter storm. This includes the costs related to procuring and transporting natural gas supplies, all other costs necessary to ensure stability and reliability of our gas system and related financing costs.

&amp;#x200B;

We have also filed a motion with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to seek comparable regulatory accounting deferrals. The hearing before an administrative law judge occurred yesterday and at the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ recommended approval of an interim order that was supported by the company, commission staff and the Attorney General's office. The recommendation will next be considered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.

&amp;#x200B;

As Caron mentioned earlier, our government relations and rates and regulatory staff have been working with our state governments and regulatory commissions to develop legislation related to securitization of the regulatory assets to help lessen the impact to our customers. While early in the process, we are hopeful of finding a legislative solution whereby utilities affected by the winter storm will be able to issue securitized bonds to finance the cost of responding to the winter storm. Rate payers will benefit from the lower cost of securitized debt and the utilities will benefit from a credit positive financing vehicle, which will also benefit rate payers in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

Now switching to our normal regulatory activity. In November, Kansas Gas Service received approval for a $7.5 million increase related to its gas system reliability surcharge filing with new rates taking effect in December. As a reminder, this was the first filing with a full year of capital spending since the revised GSRS statute became effective. The new rates resulted in a $0.77 monthly increase to residential customers' bill below the statutory limit of $0.80 per month. In August, Kansas Gas Service submitted an application to the KCC to reduce its base rates by approximately $4.9 million to reflect the elimination of Kansas state income taxes for utilities.

&amp;#x200B;

In December, the KCC approved the reduction, effective January 1, 2021, which is not expected to have a material impact on net income as the reduction in revenues will be offset by a reduction in income tax expense. This month, Texas Gas Service made a gas reliability infrastructure program filing for all customers in the Central Gulf Service Area, requesting a $10.7 million increase to be effective in the third quarter 2021. And as a reminder, in Oklahoma, we are required under our tariff to file a full rate case on or before June 30 this year, which will be based on calendar 2020 test year.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to a summary of our 2020 commercial activities. While residential, commercial and industrial sales volumes were lower than 2019 due to the warmer-than-normal weather, net margin from residential sales was up 4% year-over-year and commercial and industrial margins were relatively flat. In spite of COVID, transport sales volumes and net margin remained consistent with the prior year. Capital spending related to growth, which includes extending service to reach new customers, was up 13% from 2019 to $144 million. An increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base.

&amp;#x200B;

During the year, we connected 26,400 new customers compared with 22,300 in 2019. While average customer counts for the fourth quarter and full year were skewed slightly higher due to the suspension of disconnects, we were able to set more meters last year than any previous year in our history. Our market development team also secured 28,000 future meter additions that will be set as builders and developers complete projects. Going into 2021, we see this trend continuing. In our recent financial guidance, we announced 2021 capital investments are expected to be approximately $540 million, with nearly 30% of that for customer growth, which equates to a 20% increase over 2020 growth capex.

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I'll turn it back to Pierce for concluding remarks.

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Sid, Caron and Curtis, I want to thank you for the leadership that you've shown and how we've navigated this extraordinary event. As I reflect on this winter storm, two words come to my mind about our company: Safety and resiliency. From the initial onset of the severe weather event, our employees demonstrated their commitment to our primary responsibility as a natural gas distribution company by taking care of the people in their dwellings and critical care facilities. What I have witnessed the past 14 days is people coming together, working collaboratively for the safety of our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to express my appreciation to our employees, customers and communities. What we have accomplished together in the last two weeks is unprecedented. I'm proud of how our company stood strong in the face of diversity. I'm extremely pleased with the incredible work completed in such a short period of time. We plan for crisis, we run drills. But when they occur, we see how the strength of our core values really play out. What is extraordinary is we've experienced back-to-back 100-year events between a pandemic and this latest winter storm. Both of these events overlapped in the month of February.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to recognize the ONE Gas employees and give each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress, resolve in the most severe conditions and poise in the face of uncertainty. Our response to this event is a testimony to the culture of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for joining this morning. And operator, we're now ready for questions.

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning, Richard.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, and I appreciate all the opening remarks here, but I was just curious if you can provide a little bit more detail on your discussions with regulators and policymakers on the time line for recovery of fuel costs and financing costs. Any early expectations on what the amortization period could look like? And what's your confidence level that these costs will be fully replaced in light of the customer billing impact?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Richard, this is Curtis. We're very early in that process. As you heard in my remarks, the commissions in Kansas and in Texas have issued their orders and we're working through the process in Oklahoma to get a similar order to address exactly the questions you're asking. In each case, the first step will be actually filing the final gas costs once those are known. And until we complete balancing and final pricing and invoicing in March, we won't even have those numbers yet to begin that process. So once all that's complete, we'll file with the commissions as well as a recommendation as to how to approach collection of those costs and the time frame in which to do so. So it'd really be premature to comment or try to speculate on what those periods may be.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. Yes, that makes a sense. I recognize it's early here. And then just separately on the legislative front, you mentioned securitization. I guess, can you provide a breakdown or, at least, broadly on the fuel cost per jurisdiction? And what bill need to be passed in each state? And what's the kind of time frame for that?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So there's not any actual statutes in place today, and there have just been, since the storm, preliminary discussions about opportunities to look at legislation like that. Historically, you've seen that in different parts of the country, primarily related to electric utilities as they've dealt with different storm costs. There hasn't been that I'm aware of situations that would apply to gas utility similar to that until this most recent event. So, I guess, I would characterize it as early in the process but those conversations have been very positive to date. And we just have to let those processes continue to work through the normal systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Got it. That's helpful. And then just last one for me. Can you remind us if short-term debt is excluded from your regulatory cap structure in each of your jurisdictions? And could that be a potential solution to just roll forward that term loan once it comes due in each...

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Richard, in our current rate making, it is our long-term debt and equity that is our cap structure. In each of these orders, the two that are in place and the one in Oklahoma that I mentioned, the carrying cost directly related to those gas costs and other related costs to ensure supply are contemplated. So it's not just the cost, but it's also the direct carrying costs related to those. So I think that's a really good way to isolate the actual cost of the event to record that through our normal gas cost or a regulatory asset longer term. And then the financing to do that is all part of that same recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I think that's a pretty good approach to doing that. It will work well in each of the states. If there is the opportunity to have securitized securities issued later, I think that makes it even more clear as to how those would be recovered, and that's a really good solution. In that way, from a long-term perspective, it doesn't necessarily change how you're capitalizing the company because the point Caron made, our core business is intact and there's not a lot of drastic changes that would need to be made. So it wouldn't really be appropriate to totally change that in the longer term.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

All right, excellent. That's, that's all I had. Thanks for all the color today.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah Akers with Wells Fargo.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, good morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, good morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Can you talk a little bit about your hedging program for gas, whether hedging practices are approved by the commissions and whether hedges were even effective during the cold spike?

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

This is Caron. So yes, our hedging programs are part of our gas supply plans that we present to the commissions every year. The call options that we use for our hedges are settled on first of month index. So they were not effective in providing much mitigation for this weather event because most of the prices that we experienced is a result of gas daily pricing and prices in the spot market.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. And then shifting to the rating agencies. Given the credit rating outlooks are negative, can you just share how some of the conversations with the rating agencies are going and what they need to see to gain confidence in the regulatory contacts here?

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I really can't talk about the conversations we have with the agencies. But what I will tell you is I think it's quite apparent that the extent -- the dollar value of these deferred costs are -- is meaningful. And it would be reasonable for someone who's evaluating our creditworthiness to want to understand how those costs are going to be financed in the long-term before making any final decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

And given the sense that the commissions are cognizant of that, is there some urgency there to provide clarity and then maintain the financial integrity of the utilities?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah, this is Curtis. And what I would say is that the reactions that we've seen from the commissions, Texas and Kansas very quickly issuing emergency orders for how to deal with these and very quickly, going through the normal process, but on an expedited basis in Oklahoma, shows you that their willingness to work with the utilities to address the impact that this could have long term -- longer-term on customers. So I think we'll be able to work through in each state a reasonable approach to collecting these costs in over an appropriate time frame considering all the parties involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Great, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. \[Operator Instructions\] Our next question comes from Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the comprehensive overview in the prepared remarks. My first question is really, you mentioned asset securitization. I know people ask the question a different way. But when you talk to credit agency and mention that scenario, is that part of their evaluations that maybe could change their view versus what happened last year -- last week with the downgrade?

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning Aga. It's Caron. I'm not going to speak for the agencies, but I would tell you, just as Curtis described, we think securitization would be a very positive development and a good way to finance this long-term obligation that would benefit our customers. So I would assume that it would be a positive development, but that will be up to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any sense what percent of that $2.2 billion could be actually recovered immediately with the bills in March? I know you said that you still are trying to get the numbers from meters, but can you provide any sense, is it 10%, 15%, actually, you can recover immediately or any sense on that?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Aga, this is Curtis again. And the way gas costs get set, they get set in advance of the month based upon the prior month's actual gas purchases, updating for our total unrecovered gas costs to that point in time. So the gas costs in February would be our previously unrecovered gas cost, plus January purchases, and that sets an average rate that gets applied to February bills. And you can keep rolling that forward. So the earliest that this would impact any customer, assuming that there was no regulatory action would be the filing that we would do at the end of March that would incorporate unrecovered gas costs through February, plus February purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

And that new rate would be applied to April bills. So that would be the earliest that you would see any of these costs start to affect the average gas cost that we bill to customers. But again, we've already got the orders to defer these extraordinary costs in Kansas and in Texas, and we're expecting to get that in Oklahoma as well. And then following up once we have the actual numbers, we'll work through with the commissions to determine the appropriate recovery periods.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

And how do you think the attitude toward natural gas could change post these extreme winter weather events, like do you think we'll see more energy choice legislation passed sooner? Or have you heard any change in attitude toward natural gas toward the peak heating days?

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Aga, this is Pierce. I think what you're going to see is everyone taking a step back and looking at this extraordinary event and just doing a post incident analysis, just like we do on just any other extraordinary event. So I think that's going to be done by the regulators. I think it's going to be done by our state officials. It's certainly going to be done by the company. And I think it's a little too early to tell, but I would say what I've seen out of this is just the importance of natural gas because the magnitude of the energy that was needed was certainly bore out when you look at the amount of energy that was supplied through the natural gas distribution companies.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as what happened on the electric side, I think you're just going to have to go back and look at all the different energy sources and see what exactly happened on that side of the business. But I do think there's going to be some discussion about it and some analysis and I'm sure through that, there's going to be improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho Securities.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabe Moreen -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, good morning everyone. I know a lot of my questions have been asked at this point, but I just wanted to ask whether in your conversations thus far with regulators, if there's any chatter or talk about, I guess, investigating what happened on the gas spot market and justifying the prudence of the gas cost or investigating some of the players upstream to see sort of what happened here. So I'm just wondering if those conversations kind of are extending to those topics?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Gabe, when you say our regulators, I assume you're meaning the commissions, and there's not been conversations with the commissions about that. And just as a reminder, as you know, that we are -- we purchase gas on behalf of our customers and whatever the cost is that we pay for the gas, that passes straight through to the customer. There's no markup on that. And when we're securing our supply, we're doing that with third parties, and we're going out into the market to try to find multiple sources from which to secure that supply so that we can get -- make sure that we're getting a market price for that supply.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're talking about other regulators, we haven't had direct conversations about the topic you're highlighting. It wouldn't be a surprise for that to come out of as a normal course that they would look at that because it was such an extraordinary change in the prices in a very quick amount of time. And as you also say, we have to go through our normal prudency review, which we do every year on the gas cost. So that process will run in its normal course as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

And Gabe, this is Pierce. The only thing that I would add to that is I'm pretty certain that there will be an analysis on what was the true shortage on the supply side, what was the freeze-offs from the wellheads that didn't get into the system. And then a look on the other end, which is based on these temperatures, what was the true demand. And comparing that delta, I think is going to be very important to understanding why prices went to the levels that they did in comparison to past events and past spreads that were -- the difference between the supply and the demand. So I'm relatively certain that there will be many companies and many people that are interested in doing that analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabe Moreen -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Understood. And just maybe as a follow-up, I mean, having access to more gas storage have helped significantly here, I'm just wondering if that's sort of part of the future conversation. I know there was a question earlier about hedging, but whether contracting or trying to rate base or build your own gas storage?

&amp;#x200B;

Robert S. McAnnally -- Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Gabe, it's Sid McAnally. That kind of follows what Pierce's point was earlier. We'll definitely be looking at the gas supply plan. As you heard earlier, our gas supply plans are presented to our regulators for review and the work that was done to execute that plan went on unabated, although the price curve was volatile. So we'll look at, does it make sense to change our storage profile as we look at any other opportunities that we have to better respond to events like this.

Stephen D'Ambrisi -- Granite Lane -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the things that was in the prepared remarks. You mentioned higher variability around the long-term CAGR, but I was just wondering if you're able to defer financing costs into a regulatory asset. I guess, what is driving that potential greater variability. Is it bill pressure crowding out capex? Or can you just talk about what you're, I guess, potentially concerned about?"

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I'll turn the call over to Pierce.

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin the call by acknowledging that our employees and our customers recently endured some of the coldest and most extreme weather ever seen in our service areas. Due to the intensity and the duration of this winter storm, we experienced unforeseeable and unprecedented circumstances in our Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas jurisdictions. We saw the coldest day recorded in over a century in Oklahoma City. Some of our largest cities experienced rolling electric brownouts and countless water main breaks. In Texas, grocery store shelves were bare and long lines formed at gas stations.

&amp;#x200B;

For seven long days, our employees worked through these adverse conditions, some experiencing their own personal challenges, and collectively, with our customers' help, we kept the gas flowing to meet the most basic needs of our customers, keeping them warm. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for our employees' teamwork, resiliency and responsiveness as we dealt with this historic winter storm.

&amp;#x200B;

On today's call, we will cover some of the challenges that we faced and how we're managing the recovery and impact to our customers. We will also discuss our 2020 results and 2021 guidance. You will hear how our culture and our core values led us through this recent event.

&amp;#x200B;

So Sid, I'll turn the call over to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert S. McAnnally -- Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, Pierce. As you just heard, last week, our team faced an unprecedented weather event. On the coldest day, February 16, we experienced low temperatures between six and minus 16 degrees Fahrenheit in our largest metro areas, with employees working in wind chills as low as 25 degrees below zero. In Oklahoma, we experienced the coldest day since 1899. For context, average February lows normally range between 25 and 45 degrees in our largest metro areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Our more than 3,600 employees responded to the challenge, remaining focused on our primary goals, providing natural gas service and prioritizing human needs and safety, commitments that were supported by orders from our regulators in all three states. Since ONE Gas was founded in 2014, the company is focused on improving the resilience of our system. We have successfully completed 19 projects that provided new transmission supply points and 81 projects that provided interconnects to reinforce our system, all focused on improving reliability and in anticipation of events that might challenge our ability to serve our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

As the weather developed, our system models were updated to identify those areas that would need additional reinforcement under worst-case forecasts. Engineering was engaged to identify opportunities to enhance pressures across the system, locating additional supply points for mobile compressed natural gas trailers and designing 18 overland projects that could provide additional supply to lower pressure systems in the short term. Our supply chain personnel provided materials and the construction teams safely executed each of the 18 projects in just a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that roads might become impassable, we deployed pressure and measurement technicians to critical locations across each state in advance. Customer service orders were adjusted to build response capacity, and work shifts changed to meet the anticipated increase in emergency calls from customers. Call centers prepared scripts so that we would be able to share updated information with customers who contacted us. The communications team proactively released conservation and gas safety messaging to all available outlets.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, a series of news releases and videos were provided to local media outlets to prepare our customers across all three states. The government affairs and community relations teams remained in constant contact with key stakeholders, including governmental officials, regulatory officials and emergency response agencies throughout the duration of the event. Our commercial team was simultaneously working with large industrial transport customers, advising that gas supply and system issues were possible and that they should begin voluntary reductions to prepare their facilities for critical flow only.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this information, customers have the opportunity to stage down their operations in a way that protected their assets and protected the overall system pressure to help prevent widespread outages. Over the weekend, with a focus on protecting health and safety, we issued formal curtailment notices to large volume commercial and transport customers across all three states. Throughout the following week, we consistently coordinated with customers to manage gas volumes.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take this opportunity to thank those large volume customers who, through these curtailments, allowed us to maintain pressures and stabilize the system to protect the health and safety of customers across our territory. These reductions, in addition to the volume saved through conservation by our residential and commercial customers, were meaningful to our ability to withstand the unexpected supply constraints that we experienced. Despite these efforts, the duration of sub-freezing temperatures led to continuously increasing natural gas use at the same time that supply was constrained.

&amp;#x200B;

By February 15, freeze-offs of many wellheads severely restricted the production of natural gas when demand was at its highest. The combination of increased demand and upstream supply issues led to natural gas market prices never seen before. On February 18, the spot price for natural gas in Oklahoma rose to over $1,200 per Mcf. For comparison, the average natural gas industrial price in February last year was $3.54 per Mcf. As electric utilities instituted load shedding plans by executing brownouts, we remodeled our system to consider the impact of highly variable pressures created by the cycling of electric outages with a concentration in Oklahoma and Texas.

&amp;#x200B;

We also extended our normal damage prevention measures and added patrols to watch our critical infrastructure in order to minimize any potential negative impacts by third parties, including water utilities as they began to experience water main breaks in numerous cities. By February 19, it was clear that our system would withstand the storm without significant outages. As soon as possible, and as gas supply showed a sustained increase, we began working with our large customers to increase volumes starting over the weekend and into the first part of this week. We've returned service to all large customers and to those subject to storm-related curtailments.

&amp;#x200B;

For the entirety of the event, we lost service to approximately 900 of our 2.2 million customers across three states, in most cases for less than 24 hours. This performance was the result of many elements coming together: The system improvement since 2014, the dedication of employees across our company who went the extra mile to maintain gas service, the goodwill of customers who conserved serve their usage and the work of our field operations team, who, in the most challenging conditions, worked tirelessly to ensure that our system continued to provide natural gas to our residential customers and critical care facilities. And now, I'll turn it over to Caron.

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the financial impact of the winter weather event, let's close the loop on 2020. Yesterday, we announced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $3.68 for the full year. These results also were in line with our revised 2020 guidance range, which was EPS of $3.66 to $3.70. Our capital expenditures and asset removal costs for the year were $512 million, also in line with our expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, the ONE Gas Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.58 per share, an increase of $0.04 or 7.4% compared with the previous dividend of $0.54 per share. We're happy to address any questions you may for 2020 but given the number of questions we've already received about the winter weather event, let's turn to that. As we shared in the 8-K we issued Monday, the unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for natural gas costs in our jurisdictions resulted in aggregated gas purchases for the month of February of approximately $2.2 billion, multiples higher than what we would expect for a normal February and in excess of our then available liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Our purchased gas costs are recoverable through the tariffs in each state where we operate. We have the authority to defer the extraordinary costs associated with this winter weather event, including natural gas purchases and costs related to the procurement and transportation of gas supply in Texas and Kansas, and we expect to receive similar authority in Oklahoma. The period over which we will recover these deferred costs will be determined in future regulatory proceedings. Payments for February's natural gas purchases are generally due on March 25. We have obtained a $2.5 billion two-year term loan to provide us the additional liquidity we need to meet these obligations.

&amp;#x200B;

With that financing, as of February 24, we had access to approximately $3.1 billion in total liquidity, including $2.5 billion in commitments under the new term loan and approximately $595 million available under our existing credit facilities and cash on hand. Our existing credit facilities include a $250 million 364-day revolver, which expires on April 4. We're working with our lead bank to upsize our $700 million revolver upon expiration of the 364-day facility. The new term loan and our existing credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity until we have clarity regarding how and over what period these deferred costs will be recovered before we determine how best to refinance the term loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Subsequent to our entering into the term loan, on February 23, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured rating to A3 from A2 and S&amp;P downgraded us to BBB+ from A. Both downgraded our commercial paper to Tier two from Tier one and revised the outlook for the ratings to negative from stable. Our credit facilities and the term loan include a provision to adjust pricing in the event of a change in our ratings. Although our cost of borrowing will increase slightly, we are confident these investment-grade ratings will continue to allow us to access the capital markets on terms that will support our current and planned level of operations. Last month, we announced our 2021 financial guidance, including net income of $198 million to $210 million, earnings per diluted share of $3.68 to $3.92 and capital investments of $540 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the weather event, the fundamentals of our business haven't changed. As evidence of the confidence we have in our business outlook and commercial and operational capabilities, we are affirming our guidance ranges for 2021. We are not withdrawing our five-year growth outlook. However, we recognize that the financial impact of the recent weather event has introduced a greater degree of potential variability to our longer-range forecast.

&amp;#x200B;

Once we have regulatory clarity on the recovery period for the deferred costs, we can assess any impacts to our five-year growth outlook. Since our separation from ONEOK in 2014, we have provided annual forecast for a range of financial metrics, which we have generally attained or exceeded. We have also demonstrated an ability to consistently extend our long-range growth outlook via focused, cost-conscious investments primarily geared toward safety, system integrity and reliability. Our systems resiliency in the face of historic stresses this month is a testament to those investments, the hard work of our teams and the cooperation of our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Our focus has not changed nor has our ability to source and execute commercial opportunities. The forecasting challenges I note stem entirely from the timing of recovery of the cost we incurred from this isolated weather event. As has been our hallmark since day one, we will remain transparent with you and provide updates as information is forthcoming. We're having productive discussions with our regulators and others regarding the regulatory orders for deferral of the extraordinary cost of the weather event and the potential for securitizing the obligation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll turn it over to Curtis to update you on the latest. Curtis?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, Caron, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing a brief overview of current storm-related regulatory and legislative activity and then give an update on our commercial and other regulatory activities. As Caron described, both the Kansas Corporation Commission and the Railroad Commission of Texas issued emergency orders authorizing all state utilities to defer costs incurred as a result of the winter storm. This includes the costs related to procuring and transporting natural gas supplies, all other costs necessary to ensure stability and reliability of our gas system and related financing costs.

&amp;#x200B;

We have also filed a motion with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to seek comparable regulatory accounting deferrals. The hearing before an administrative law judge occurred yesterday and at the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ recommended approval of an interim order that was supported by the company, commission staff and the Attorney General's office. The recommendation will next be considered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.

&amp;#x200B;

As Caron mentioned earlier, our government relations and rates and regulatory staff have been working with our state governments and regulatory commissions to develop legislation related to securitization of the regulatory assets to help lessen the impact to our customers. While early in the process, we are hopeful of finding a legislative solution whereby utilities affected by the winter storm will be able to issue securitized bonds to finance the cost of responding to the winter storm. Rate payers will benefit from the lower cost of securitized debt and the utilities will benefit from a credit positive financing vehicle, which will also benefit rate payers in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

Now switching to our normal regulatory activity. In November, Kansas Gas Service received approval for a $7.5 million increase related to its gas system reliability surcharge filing with new rates taking effect in December. As a reminder, this was the first filing with a full year of capital spending since the revised GSRS statute became effective. The new rates resulted in a $0.77 monthly increase to residential customers' bill below the statutory limit of $0.80 per month. In August, Kansas Gas Service submitted an application to the KCC to reduce its base rates by approximately $4.9 million to reflect the elimination of Kansas state income taxes for utilities.

&amp;#x200B;

In December, the KCC approved the reduction, effective January 1, 2021, which is not expected to have a material impact on net income as the reduction in revenues will be offset by a reduction in income tax expense. This month, Texas Gas Service made a gas reliability infrastructure program filing for all customers in the Central Gulf Service Area, requesting a $10.7 million increase to be effective in the third quarter 2021. And as a reminder, in Oklahoma, we are required under our tariff to file a full rate case on or before June 30 this year, which will be based on calendar 2020 test year.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to a summary of our 2020 commercial activities. While residential, commercial and industrial sales volumes were lower than 2019 due to the warmer-than-normal weather, net margin from residential sales was up 4% year-over-year and commercial and industrial margins were relatively flat. In spite of COVID, transport sales volumes and net margin remained consistent with the prior year. Capital spending related to growth, which includes extending service to reach new customers, was up 13% from 2019 to $144 million. An increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base.

&amp;#x200B;

During the year, we connected 26,400 new customers compared with 22,300 in 2019. While average customer counts for the fourth quarter and full year were skewed slightly higher due to the suspension of disconnects, we were able to set more meters last year than any previous year in our history. Our market development team also secured 28,000 future meter additions that will be set as builders and developers complete projects. Going into 2021, we see this trend continuing. In our recent financial guidance, we announced 2021 capital investments are expected to be approximately $540 million, with nearly 30% of that for customer growth, which equates to a 20% increase over 2020 growth capex.

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I'll turn it back to Pierce for concluding remarks.

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Sid, Caron and Curtis, I want to thank you for the leadership that you've shown and how we've navigated this extraordinary event. As I reflect on this winter storm, two words come to my mind about our company: Safety and resiliency. From the initial onset of the severe weather event, our employees demonstrated their commitment to our primary responsibility as a natural gas distribution company by taking care of the people in their dwellings and critical care facilities. What I have witnessed the past 14 days is people coming together, working collaboratively for the safety of our customers.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to express my appreciation to our employees, customers and communities. What we have accomplished together in the last two weeks is unprecedented. I'm proud of how our company stood strong in the face of diversity. I'm extremely pleased with the incredible work completed in such a short period of time. We plan for crisis, we run drills. But when they occur, we see how the strength of our core values really play out. What is extraordinary is we've experienced back-to-back 100-year events between a pandemic and this latest winter storm. Both of these events overlapped in the month of February.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to recognize the ONE Gas employees and give each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress, resolve in the most severe conditions and poise in the face of uncertainty. Our response to this event is a testimony to the culture of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning, Richard.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, and I appreciate all the opening remarks here, but I was just curious if you can provide a little bit more detail on your discussions with regulators and policymakers on the time line for recovery of fuel costs and financing costs. Any early expectations on what the amortization period could look like? And what's your confidence level that these costs will be fully replaced in light of the customer billing impact?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Richard, this is Curtis. We're very early in that process. As you heard in my remarks, the commissions in Kansas and in Texas have issued their orders and we're working through the process in Oklahoma to get a similar order to address exactly the questions you're asking. In each case, the first step will be actually filing the final gas costs once those are known. And until we complete balancing and final pricing and invoicing in March, we won't even have those numbers yet to begin that process. So once all that's complete, we'll file with the commissions as well as a recommendation as to how to approach collection of those costs and the time frame in which to do so. So it'd really be premature to comment or try to speculate on what those periods may be.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. Yes, that makes a sense. I recognize it's early here. And then just separately on the legislative front, you mentioned securitization. I guess, can you provide a breakdown or, at least, broadly on the fuel cost per jurisdiction? And what bill need to be passed in each state? And what's the kind of time frame for that?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So there's not any actual statutes in place today, and there have just been, since the storm, preliminary discussions about opportunities to look at legislation like that. Historically, you've seen that in different parts of the country, primarily related to electric utilities as they've dealt with different storm costs. There hasn't been that I'm aware of situations that would apply to gas utility similar to that until this most recent event. So, I guess, I would characterize it as early in the process but those conversations have been very positive to date. And we just have to let those processes continue to work through the normal systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Got it. That's helpful. And then just last one for me. Can you remind us if short-term debt is excluded from your regulatory cap structure in each of your jurisdictions? And could that be a potential solution to just roll forward that term loan once it comes due in each...

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Richard, in our current rate making, it is our long-term debt and equity that is our cap structure. In each of these orders, the two that are in place and the one in Oklahoma that I mentioned, the carrying cost directly related to those gas costs and other related costs to ensure supply are contemplated. So it's not just the cost, but it's also the direct carrying costs related to those. So I think that's a really good way to isolate the actual cost of the event to record that through our normal gas cost or a regulatory asset longer term. And then the financing to do that is all part of that same recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I think that's a pretty good approach to doing that. It will work well in each of the states. If there is the opportunity to have securitized securities issued later, I think that makes it even more clear as to how those would be recovered, and that's a really good solution. In that way, from a long-term perspective, it doesn't necessarily change how you're capitalizing the company because the point Caron made, our core business is intact and there's not a lot of drastic changes that would need to be made. So it wouldn't really be appropriate to totally change that in the longer term.

&amp;#x200B;

Richard Ciciarelli -- Bank of America -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

All right, excellent. That's, that's all I had. Thanks for all the color today.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. Welcome

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah Akers with Wells Fargo.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, good morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, good morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Can you talk a little bit about your hedging program for gas, whether hedging practices are approved by the commissions and whether hedges were even effective during the cold spike?

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

This is Caron. So yes, our hedging programs are part of our gas supply plans that we present to the commissions every year. The call options that we use for our hedges are settled on first of month index. So they were not effective in providing much mitigation for this weather event because most of the prices that we experienced is a result of gas daily pricing and prices in the spot market.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. And then shifting to the rating agencies. Given the credit rating outlooks are negative, can you just share how some of the conversations with the rating agencies are going and what they need to see to gain confidence in the regulatory contacts here?

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I really can't talk about the conversations we have with the agencies. But what I will tell you is I think it's quite apparent that the extent -- the dollar value of these deferred costs are -- is meaningful. And it would be reasonable for someone who's evaluating our creditworthiness to want to understand how those costs are going to be financed in the long-term before making any final decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

And given the sense that the commissions are cognizant of that, is there some urgency there to provide clarity and then maintain the financial integrity of the utilities?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah, this is Curtis. And what I would say is that the reactions that we've seen from the commissions, Texas and Kansas very quickly issuing emergency orders for how to deal with these and very quickly, going through the normal process, but on an expedited basis in Oklahoma, shows you that their willingness to work with the utilities to address the impact that this could have long term -- longer-term on customers. So I think we'll be able to work through in each state a reasonable approach to collecting these costs in over an appropriate time frame considering all the parties involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah Akers -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Great, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, Sarah.

Operator

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. \[Operator Instructions\] Our next question comes from Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the comprehensive overview in the prepared remarks. My first question is really, you mentioned asset securitization. I know people ask the question a different way. But when you talk to credit agency and mention that scenario, is that part of their evaluations that maybe could change their view versus what happened last year -- last week with the downgrade?

&amp;#x200B;

Caron A. Lawhorn -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning Aga. It's Caron. I'm not going to speak for the agencies, but I would tell you, just as Curtis described, we think securitization would be a very positive development and a good way to finance this long-term obligation that would benefit our customers. So I would assume that it would be a positive development, but that will be up to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any sense what percent of that $2.2 billion could be actually recovered immediately with the bills in March? I know you said that you still are trying to get the numbers from meters, but can you provide any sense, is it 10%, 15%, actually, you can recover immediately or any sense on that?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Aga, this is Curtis again. And the way gas costs get set, they get set in advance of the month based upon the prior month's actual gas purchases, updating for our total unrecovered gas costs to that point in time. So the gas costs in February would be our previously unrecovered gas cost, plus January purchases, and that sets an average rate that gets applied to February bills. And you can keep rolling that forward. So the earliest that this would impact any customer, assuming that there was no regulatory action would be the filing that we would do at the end of March that would incorporate unrecovered gas costs through February, plus February purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

And that new rate would be applied to April bills. So that would be the earliest that you would see any of these costs start to affect the average gas cost that we bill to customers. But again, we've already got the orders to defer these extraordinary costs in Kansas and in Texas, and we're expecting to get that in Oklahoma as well. And then following up once we have the actual numbers, we'll work through with the commissions to determine the appropriate recovery periods.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

And how do you think the attitude toward natural gas could change post these extreme winter weather events, like do you think we'll see more energy choice legislation passed sooner? Or have you heard any change in attitude toward natural gas toward the peak heating days?

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Aga, this is Pierce. I think what you're going to see is everyone taking a step back and looking at this extraordinary event and just doing a post incident analysis, just like we do on just any other extraordinary event. So I think that's going to be done by the regulators. I think it's going to be done by our state officials. It's certainly going to be done by the company. And I think it's a little too early to tell, but I would say what I've seen out of this is just the importance of natural gas because the magnitude of the energy that was needed was certainly bore out when you look at the amount of energy that was supplied through the natural gas distribution companies.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as what happened on the electric side, I think you're just going to have to go back and look at all the different energy sources and see what exactly happened on that side of the business. But I do think there's going to be some discussion about it and some analysis and I'm sure through that, there's going to be improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

Aga Zmigrodzka -- UBS -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho Securities.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabe Moreen -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, good morning everyone. I know a lot of my questions have been asked at this point, but I just wanted to ask whether in your conversations thus far with regulators, if there's any chatter or talk about, I guess, investigating what happened on the gas spot market and justifying the prudence of the gas cost or investigating some of the players upstream to see sort of what happened here. So I'm just wondering if those conversations kind of are extending to those topics?

&amp;#x200B;

Curtis L. Dinan -- Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer

&amp;#x200B;

So Gabe, when you say our regulators, I assume you're meaning the commissions, and there's not been conversations with the commissions about that. And just as a reminder, as you know, that we are -- we purchase gas on behalf of our customers and whatever the cost is that we pay for the gas, that passes straight through to the customer. There's no markup on that. And when we're securing our supply, we're doing that with third parties, and we're going out into the market to try to find multiple sources from which to secure that supply so that we can get -- make sure that we're getting a market price for that supply.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're talking about other regulators, we haven't had direct conversations about the topic you're highlighting. It wouldn't be a surprise for that to come out of as a normal course that they would look at that because it was such an extraordinary change in the prices in a very quick amount of time. And as you also say, we have to go through our normal prudency review, which we do every year on the gas cost. So that process will run in its normal course as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Pierce H. Norton II -- President and Chief Executive Officer

&amp;#x200B;

And Gabe, this is Pierce. The only thing that I would add to that is I'm pretty certain that there will be an analysis on what was the true shortage on the supply side, what was the freeze-offs from the wellheads that didn't get into the system. And then a look on the other end, which is based on these temperatures, what was the true demand. And comparing that delta, I think is going to be very important to understanding why prices went to the levels that they did in comparison to past events and past spreads that were -- the difference between the supply and the demand. So I'm relatively certain that there will be many companies and many people that are interested in doing that analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabe Moreen -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

&amp;#x200B;

Understood. And just maybe as a follow-up, I mean, having access to more gas storage have helped significantly here, I'm just wondering if that's sort of part of the future conversation. I know there was a question earlier about hedging, but whether contracting or trying to rate base or build your own gas storage?

&amp;#x200B;

Robert S. McAnnally -- Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer

&amp;#x200B;

Gabe, it's Sid McAnally. That kind of follows what Pierce's point was earlier. We'll definitely be looking at the gas supply plan. As you heard earlier, our gas supply plans are presented to our regulators for review and the work that was done to execute that plan went on unabated, although the price curve was volatile. So we'll look at, does it make sense to change our storage profile as we look at any other opportunities that we have to better respond to events like this.

Hi guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the things that was in the prepared remarks. You mentioned higher variability around the long-term CAGR, but I was just wondering if you're able to defer financing costs into a regulatory asset. I guess, what is driving that potential greater variability. Is it bill pressure crowding out capex? Or can you just talk about what you're, I guess, potentially concerned about?"

I’m also really nervous though. Was wondering if anyone could answer some questions I have.

1. How selective are the most-selective clubs? I know FS and IAG are said to be a couple of the most selective clubs with BAC just behind, but I’m just wondering to what extent this is true? Also, are students expected to be very knowledgeable in business/finance when applying to these? Not sure how much I’ll know during my first semester. 

2. Do majority of kids want to go into IB? I’ve obviously considered IB, but I’m also interested in say, corporate finance, and I’m just wondering if this is also a common path for Stern students, and if Stern is even considered “worth it” if not planning to go into IB. (not that this would change my decision on attending but I’m curious)

3. Is the Stern curve really that bad??? Is it “easy” to maintain a 3.7+ if you put in the work despite the curve being an obstacle?

4. Did you know exactly what you were doing the first day of your freshman year? It seems like so many kids in these Facebook groups know exactly what job they want, what they will do to get it, etc. and it’s obviously a little overwhelming. I plan to major in business with concentrations in finance and statistics because this is what interests me, but I don’t have any specific plan in mind, let alone any practical experience that can be used to develop a plan for my future lol. 


It’d be great if someone could offer any advice/tips regarding these things. thanks!! :)"

However- after some research, I've decided that I'm buying coins that have an actual use or solve a problem that I can see having REAL world results in the near future. At first you think all crypto is the same, and then you realize that one is built for smart contracts (which can revolutionize traditional finance, from loans to mortgages). Another one is built to have no fees between transfers. Another one is made to index blockchains, kinda like Google does for the internet. Another one?

And this is without taking derivatives into account 💰

Today there are over 300 exchanges on the market, which can be divided into **2 types**:

## 1️⃣ Centralized Exchange (CEX)

**CEX** is an exchange that is managed from a single center. Control over exchange operations, security of funds, service is the responsibility of the exchange administration.

*Examples of CEX: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.*

**Benefits:**  
\- Fiat access  
\- Extensive trading functionality  
\- Liquidity

**Disadvantages:**  
\- No access to private keys  
\- Security risk  
\- Price manipulation (bots, etc.)  
\- KYC (identity verification procedure)

❗️  When you keep funds on the exchange, they become the property of the exchange until you withdraw them to your wallet.

## 2️⃣ Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

**DEX** is a decentralized platform built on distributed ledger technology and powered by smart contracts.

*DEX examples: Uniswap, Curve Finance, SushiSwap*

**Benefits:**  
\- Anonymity  
\- Private keys in the hands of the owner  
\- Ability to quickly add coins for exchange  
\- No KYC  
\- Nobody can block your account

**Disadvantages:**  
\- Limited set of functions (pending)  
\- Liquidity is lower than on CEX (Uniswap solves this problem with a liquidity ratio of $4.39 billion)  
\- Difficulty for beginners compared to CEX  
\- Fiat is not supported

The FORSAGE community encourages partners to be wary of centralized exchanges. And the statistics confirm this: hackers stole $300.1 million at the rate of 2020 from exchanges last year ❌

If you have any questions about the operation, reputation or security of exchanges, then don’t hesitate to ask the FORSAGE support service 👊🏻

I am a current junior undergrad, and I have an actuarial internship that begins in June.  Between now and then, I want to make sure I am doing whatever I can both to maximize my preparedness for the work that I will be doing this summer and to ensure that my resumé can be as strong as possible for application to full-time positions next year.  The way that I see it, there are two main areas in which I can work to strengthen my skillset and candidacy for positions:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Exams: I currently have two exams passed (P and FM), and I am contemplating sitting for Exam IFM in July.  I have a very strong math background, as I am a math major, but I do not have as much experience with business or finance, as I have not really had coursework (other than studying for FM) or work experience that pertains to those areas.  Could I prepare for the exam on this timeline, on top of a full courseload and, ultimately, internship responsibilities?  Through the end of May at least, I don't particularly want to spend more than about 2.5 hours per day on preparation per day, though I would be willing to do more one the exam gets closer.
2. Technical Skills:  As it stands now, I would say that I have ""intermediate"" skills in Excel, Python, and R (though I know that the last two are not as relevant to entry-level actuarial), and I think that my employer has an honest assessment of what I do and do not know how to do going into the internship.  However, I am wondering if it might be good to put some energy into familiarizing myself with VBA, SAS, and/or SQL, as I am likely a bit ""behind the curve"" with these.  However, might it be reasonable to assume that I might be able to pick these up ""on the job?""    I would again place the same ""2.5 hour/day"" constraint on my ability to invest time in these activities, as I did above.

Given this information, which, if either, of these pursuits do folks here think that I should focus on?"

[Ray Dalio’s Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield &amp; 10 Year Yield](https://preview.redd.it/l2f5buijubm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f36007c98a80568d8e10210ceb35112f83520f7f)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.** 

[10-Year Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/pjospxbpubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23e515781e1fde96e73ea04d8292ed985710d0ee)

Why did the 10-year yield **🚀 🌝**?

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

Why does the economy reopening = inflation?

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - MV = PQ, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/85liuqosubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e2ae9811e158cdf5cfb18124ac36a1964b2ffbf)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/00rnrx4uubm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d15729986ceccc14e0022cc7090b5e5077819d5c)

By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

*Processing img ft66nwfwubm61...*

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

What did JPowell say?

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/cspz6f1evbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cbfbe0bb4e6133d03e2ef6f506d64adb61432b)

[Fed Funds Rate](https://preview.redd.it/aujgi1jevbm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78424f8f64d996a8557d22da8ea84c5cc9cb1299)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for this chapter is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

***TLDR; Stonks only go  📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield &amp; 10 Year Yield](https://preview.redd.it/l2f5buijubm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f36007c98a80568d8e10210ceb35112f83520f7f)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now).

So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

[Ray Dalio’s Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhrkwu/a_smooth_brained_guide_to_ray_dalios_thesis/)

**What is the 10-year US treasury and why is the yield so important?**

The 10 year treasury is an IOU sold by the US government when it needs to borrow money, promising to pay it back in 10 years with regular interest payment in the meantime. They auction off these bonds to the highest bidder, and the price that these bonds get sold off at determines the yield of these bonds. In finance, US bonds are considered to be a risk-free asset, since it’s the safest possible investment anyone can make (at least in theory). Because of this, the 10 year US bond yield is considered to be the “risk free rate” for any long-term investments and acts as gravity towards any other riskier investments.

**Why does the 10-year affect the price of every other asset?**

As a rule of thumb, the riskier an asset is, the higher return (or yield) that asset will need to provide. For things like bonds, are pretty straight-forward - it’s the yield, or effective interest rate that bond provides. For things like equities (stocks), it’s a bit more complicated. As a hand-wavy approach, a lot of people use Earnings, so let’s go with that. % return demanded by investors = earnings / price, meaning price is inversely proportional to % return, or **if % return demanded 📈 price 📉** **and vice versa**.

This is how the treasury yields affect the price of literally everything else (except GME), from real estate to SPY. Suppose that JPow decided overnight that he changed his mind and managed to pump up the 10-year rate to 10%, which is where it was at for most of the 1980s. Compared to SPY, which is maybe giving you a return of 2.5% (based on the current PE ratio of 40), any 🦍 with more than two brain cells can figure out the better deal. So everyone sells their SPY and loads up on treasuries until SPY drops enough (i.e. falls 75%) to at very least match the return of the 10-year, and likely even more due to the increased risk and volatility (risk premium).

&amp;#x200B;

[S&amp;P 500 Earnings Yield vs. 10Y Treasury Yield](https://preview.redd.it/f7l7k2juqcm61.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5219d3117e75631efc1f89889f96fb8793dbb130)

There’s several other mechanisms that this rate affects various asset prices as well

1. Housing prices - For the same reasons, a rise in the 10-year = a rise in mortgage rates. So if the prime mortgage rate doubles from 3% (today) to 6%, to buy the same $250K house, a 30-year mortgage will go from a $1000 monthly payment to a $1500 monthly payment, which might be more than what people looking at $250K houses can afford. This would thus cause a decline in housing prices until the people who would’ve previously bought those houses can afford it again.
2. Stock buybacks - A low 10-year = low corporate bond yields = incentivizes businesses to take on the cheap debt, even if they don’t need it. What do they do with that excess capital? Usually, stock buybacks or dividend payments, which drives up their own stock prices - something executives are especially incentivized to do since their compensation is usually tied to stock price performance. What happens when the 10-year and corporate bond interest rates go back up? Those companies who took on a bunch of debt probably won’t refinance their bonds when they expire, and will need to divert their resources from dividend and stock buybacks to paying down their debt, possibly even issuing more shares to raise capital to pay it back, lowering their stock price.
3. Leverage - Treasury rates set the bar for the lowest interest rates someone can borrow at, including hedge funds to borrow cash to buy stocks on margin. To dumb it down, if a hedge fund finds some combination of trades that yield a 5% return with low risk and can borrow from their broker at 2%, they could lever up 10x (theyre not subject to the 2x leverage limit retail investors have) and get a 50% return while paying 20% in interest. What happens when treasury rates go up, causing their interest rates they pay to their brokerage go up? They sell those holdings, and since most funds are net-bullish on the market, this usually means a mass sell-off in the stock market.

**How the Fed controls the 10-year yield**

The Fed’s official mission is to

1. Ensure price stability, this usually means that they target a 2% inflation rate
2. Try to achieve “full employment”, which is basically the lowest unemployment rate that's practically achievable

They achieve this through two mechanisms.

1. The Fed Funds Rate - This is what they use during normal times. This is basically the interest rates the banks within the Federal Reserve System lends to each other overnight, which they can set a ceiling and floor to by establishing a rate that any bank can borrow or lend the Fed at any time
2. Quantitative Easing / Tightening - This is an unconventional tool they usually resort to once the Fed Funds Rate reaches zero (for Easing) to further stimulate the economy to further pump liquidity by directly buying Treasuries / government bonds, and sometimes other assets like Mortgage Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds.

It’s pretty obvious from above how the Fed can affect the 10-year note, especially with quantitative easing, where they might directly buy it, causing the price to decrease from an increased demand and reducing the yield as a result.

**What Happened Last Week**

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/6jf845eyqcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fedb9bc370aabc91a61d646a92c727a7af85268b)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***🚀 🌝****?*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.​

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/xq06xb62rcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df5e0dac578200ea080a19ac6ea15668f654cff8)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/nr0aw865rcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ddda8ff13e7ec59d0cfb7af48269055bf501fd4)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

&amp;#x200B;

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/d2fwbnj6rcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f539d25b46ec18137ccfda02a888df4ec3ff7b7)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, centered around 2018](https://preview.redd.it/q5sch5nkrcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6fd64791d780a7aea9bec6202e3f565881aac14)

[Fed Funds Rate around 2018](https://preview.redd.it/wk5ckb1lrcm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62653d7d216fa4ae5e1277c82b83396b3f917d31)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

So what happened with the 10-year yield last week? It **🚀 🌝**, which for reasons mentioned above, means that everything else **📉.**

[10Y Treasury Yield, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/luroj2b79hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ad89ea67d4e86e555d39008d51d5cdc8fa8ec0d)

*Why did the 10-year yield* ***🚀 🌝***\*?\*

Basically, there was a lot of speculation recently that we might see inflation as the economy opens up.

*Why does the economy reopening = inflation?*

There’s this macroeconomic theory called the Quantity Theory of Money - ***MV = PQ***, where M is the quantity of Money in the system, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the GDP. A rise in P = inflation.

In this equation, the key variable is the velocity of money, which is the speed at which money circulates in an economy, or in other words, how fast consumers will spend a dollar once they earn it. Interestingly enough, ever since the 2000s, and especially after the 2008 recession, velocity of money has been steadily declining, mostly due to rising income inequality as richer people tend to spend money less quickly than poorer people who might be living paycheck to paycheck. However, when COVID hit, it really 📉 fast.​

[Velocity of M2 Money](https://preview.redd.it/j7mi0ed99hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d61275d0dc17bfbd82e6a16c3dc7beb1751a0e)

So with Q (GDP) and M (Money Supply) being equal, this would generally mean P going down as well, or in other words, deflation - the Fed’s worst nightmare. How do central banks combat this? By increasing M proportionally to the decrease in V.

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/hdg62w7b9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78de5d86fb81951af79939159662a0a442dc28dc)

*By what mechanism does the Fed increase M?*

Using the two mechanisms described above. Right when COVID hit, they immediately dropped the Fed Funds Rate to 0. They quickly realized that wasn’t enough, and started buying government and corporate bonds on-mass until they were confident it would prevent deflation. This has the side-effect of decreasing the 10-year yield, and making all other assets go up. If you look closely, though you’ll see that they really turned off the printing press after the summer.

So, what happens when the economy opens back up? V goes up, maybe back to normal. So the Fed has two options according to the Quantity Theory of Money

1. Let M (money supply) stay where it is. This means that P will go up, or in other words, inflation
2. Prevent inflation by decreasing M. This will have the opposite effect of what was described above, and sending the 10-year yields 📈 and all asset prices **📉**

[Fed Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/h9buyb8g9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33fe1010414625a0fa585b18d144d4a396ec86ee)

*What did JPowell say?*

He basically confirmed what everyone was thinking - **inflation is coming**. However, he did say that he was comfortable letting inflation go above its 2% target until jobs recover and the Fed achieves its second mandate - full employment.

*Why did what he say cause yields to go up regardless?*

Basically, people were expecting him to announce that he was going to turn the money printer back on and increase the number of treasury purchases to force the 10-year yield back down. He did not do that, which indicates that he’s changing his stance to actually try to be careful to not overheat the economy, and that he might actually be worried about inflation since he went against what the entire market assumed he would do, and priced in to do.

At very least, this means that we probably shouldn’t be counting on the Fed’s money printer continuously driving up asset prices anytime soon. In the medium term, if inflation does get bad enough, it shows at least some willingness from the Fed that they may actually intervene and decrease the money supply - causing everything else to crash alongside it. Will it happen? Well that depends on how bad this inflation gets, and how bad the Fed is willing to stand by and watch it happen until they do something.

**Why I am a 🌈🐻 in the medium term**

The re-opening might force the Fed to do something that they haven’t done in a very long time - quantitative tightening.

If you look closely at these charts, you can put yourself in the shoes of the Fed and see why stonks only went 📈 in the past decade.

* The 2008 recession caused a permanent decline in velocity of money that has never actually really recovered - likely due to the increased income inequality that never reversed since then
* Decreased velocity of money = decreased P, or deflation, in the long term with all things equal
* To avoid this, the Fed drops the Fed Funds rate to 0, followed by quantitative easing on treasuries, dropping their yield as well, to increase the money supply to keep the inflation rate near their target
* Since velocity of money never really recovered, they just left the money they pumped in and the low interest rates they set at the 2008 recession there and barely touched it until 2017, where they slowly raised it until they abruptly stopped in 2018 - we’ll get to what happened when they did that in a bit
* With all this extra liquidity in the system keeping the 10-year low, when the economy did eventually recover from the 2008 recession, all asset prices, including the stock market and real estate prices **🚀 🌝** for virtually every year - except for 2018 - we’ll also get to that in a bit

**What Happened in 2018?**

[SPY, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/efjhgufw9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e99c92f0e9f22bf26f2f8bf17e9c740021b6c27)

[Fed Funds Rate, near 2018](https://preview.redd.it/woz6w4ww9hm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e539f1f4ef0ea0a96a90e0c59dd766b603087ff1)

Throughout 2017, but especially in 2018, the Fed finally decided to slowly start increasing the Fed Funds rate back up from basically 0%, almost 10 years after the 2008 recession; the first quantitative tightening we’ve since then. So, what happened in 2018? First, the [yield curve inverted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-us-bond-yield-curve-has-inverted-heres-what-it-means.html) (meaning the 10 year yield fell below the 3 month yield), possibly the most reliable forward indicator of an oncoming recession - in the past 50 years, every recession has happened within 2 years of a yield curve inversion, and every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession within 2 years except for one false positive. This is usually a signal of lack of confidence in investors in asset prices, which in turn caused the stock market to crash, leading to one of the only &gt;1% decline year in the S&amp;P500 since 2009.

So my thesis for is that in the next few years, one of the following must happen

* Velocity of Money never recovers to pre-COVID levels. TBH this is probably the best case scenario for the stock market, but is probably REALLY bad for the economy. The only way for this to really happen is we remain in a K-shaped recovery, where we continue to have high-unemployment for lower paying jobs and high income inequality
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, the Fed either continues quantitative easing or does not do quantitative tightening. This will eventually lead to inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target. JPowell has shown so far that although he would accept this temporarily without doing any action but left the door open for quantitative tightening if he sees sustained over-inflation, which is possible (and imo likely) given the amount of money pumped into the economy over the year + how much the velocity of money dropped last year.
* Velocity of Money recovers to near pre-COVID levels, and the Fed decides to do some sort of quantitative tightening in the medium term after seeing sustained over-inflation. If this happens, we will find out how much of the last decade’s stock market gains were from real productivity increases, and how much of it was from the Fed’s monetary policy.

*What do I think? Short term, anything can happen so no I'm not buying SPY puts again. I am, however, not going long on anything outside of a 6 month time frame. Why? Ask yourself this - what do you really think has been the primary driver of the stock market's rise over the past decade: Fundamental economic growth? Or is it the Fed's money printing. Now, ask yourself, how long can that driver keep going for? The money printer was on overdrive the past few months to compensate for COVID; how long could this last until we see inflation and it forces JPowell to turn off the printer?*

***TLDR; Stonks only go 📈 if you have the Fed on your side. If the Fed ever decides (or needs to) changes sides, bulls r fucked***

**Why GME 🚀 🌝 when everything else 📉**

Not really related to the thesis, and [I briefly talked about this a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/), but it seems to be what everyone talks about nowadays so I guess I’ll talk about this too. I’m sure some of y’all have noticed that every time every other stock goes down, GME usually 📈 and vice versa, and especially wrinkly brained ape [did the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/) and found a statistically significant inverse correlation between GME and the rest of the stock market. Why is that? Well, in short

1. Virtually nobody buying GME now is doing so because of earnings yield / they did a DCF on the company and thought that it was undervalued at $50 based on future cash flows, so the 10-year yield increasing is meaningless to them
2. Institutions / Hedge Funds that are on the other side of the trade need to de-gross their books whenever the stock market goes down. In short, some hedge funds tend to take an insane amount of leverage (eg. the mean gross leverage of a hedge fund is around 8x right now). They can do this because their “net exposure”, which is their long exposure - short exposure is much lower, and isn’t as risky because they are “hedged” vs. market conditions. Gross exposure, on the other hand, is the total value of long and short positions they hold. So, if they sell off a long position, they need to sell a short position if they’ve levered up in this way, and vice versa. It’s pretty well known that hedge funds love big tech stocks and like shorting AMC and GME. So, if they exit out of their tech / growth longs to reduce their gross leverage, they’ll also need to cover their GME shorts as well.

I like to think I have a lot going for me. I have an amazing and interesting job that I get excited about, and I am wildly successful at what I do. I work out 3-4 days a week, eat well, and have always been very attractive (and confident, if you couldn't tell). I also have not properly dated anyone since high school. In college, I'd 'see' someone for an extended period, but I was in the habit of dating seniors that would graduate and leave, so I have not had much experience progressing through the stages of, and building a relationship. 

Well, the city I moved to leans young, but most of the men here are in finance and/or give off overgrown frat boy vibe. Not really my style. I like ambitious, articulate, and sexy men that know what they want. 
Well, about 4 months ago, I thought I found someone I could be with. He was smart, creative, successful, attractive, funny, all the things I was looking for. He had just moved to the city. We talked and saw each other for about a month before he started ghosting me, and then eventually admitted that he found someone else. I was pretty shocked, because until then it seemed like things were going well, but apparently it wasn't enough to get him off the apps. 
A few weeks ago here we go again. I match with a gorgeous, ambitious, intelligent man, who just moved to the city. His job threw a curve ball at him, saying he will be doing his training a state over for the first month. We were texting constantly before that news, so he came over the night he moved into his apartment before leaving to start training, and we had some pretty fantastic sex, a good connection, etc. We have continued to chat very frequently, both initiating the conversation pretty equally and with general enthusiasm. I even drove down to spend the night with him this weekend on his business trip (less than a couple hours). 
You see, before we even met, he said he is looking to explore his sexuality, as he has been so busy up till this point in life that he hasn't had the flexibility to do so. He has some fantasies that I cannot satisfy myself (milf, threesome, etc.). At the beginning, I told him I'm looking for a partner, so he knows my priorities.  
Now that he is officially moving here, I am worried he is going to fall subject to the ""don't settle, something better is coming"" dating mentality in my city, and similarly ghost me to pursue the vast but vane dating market here. 
How do I show that I am willing to be flexible with his exploration, but I still want him for myself? 
In my past, I've always prepared to lose the person, so I wasn't worried about keeping them hooked, now, it's biting me in the ass. 

TL;DR: I, a catch, caught myself a catch. The catch is, there are many fish in the sea, and those fish, ain't me."

Haven’t really been keeping up with WSB lately due to all the meme hype, so hopefully this isn’t repetitive of anything people have said lately. As you know, FOMC is coming up this week on the 16th and 17th. More than likely, we will hear the policy changes, or the lack thereof, on the 17th. I've did a quick browse and saw a few things explaining FOMC/YCC/SLR and potentially devastating effects, but I did not find anything regarding how to profit each of the 4 scenarios. Most seemed like doomsday posts, but I'm here to tell you, no matter the outcome of the FOMC, you can profit obesely. Not fat profits. *Obese profits.*

**I’ve explained below the 4 different scenarios and outcomes of the FOMC and what to play in regards to those outcomes. If you don’t want to read this, I’ll put a TLDR cheat sheet at the bottom.**

My final paragraph includes GME and AMC for those of you who bear so much sexual aggression to those stocks that society should not allow you to be out in public due to the *safety of others.*

If you haven’t kept up with everything regarding treasuries and the SLR policy, I’ll try and fill you in without you having to know the finance technicals and what not. This is not a doomsday post so don’t throw a tantrum when I mention bubbles which beginsssss *now* -&gt; Right now we currently are in every bubble possible, but certain ones are more important to keep going instead of other ones (to save face). J Pow has been kicking the can further and further to hold off the inevitable, ultimately making things worse each time he does it. There’s a few different types of bubbles: market (housing in this case), commodity, stock market, credit bubble, economy bubble. Asset inflation is very profitable for the wealthy, and for those who know how to use it to their advantage, which is why Wall Street wants the economy and stock market to overheat. On the other hand, asset inflation destroys those who cannot afford assets, as they won't be able to buy a home, a car, or invest, because that inflation seeps into necessities, leaving them no money to invest and get ahead. Which is why the wealth gap rapidly expanded during covid to levels unseen since the lead up to the 1929 crash.

**Types of Bubbles:**

**Commodities** 

Moon during inflation (lumber, oil, coffee, copper, sugar, etc). Most likely won’t see this crash until later on. Because this is the final stage of inflation before prices begin to inflate groceries which is a big influence on CPI. Things like sugar and coffee beans increase the price of groceries that include those ingredients. 
The Federal Reserve goes off the CPI when reporting inflation, and even changes the rules when they publish them, to keep CPI down. We’ve been locked up, so the massive money injections are found in assets, such as the housing market, commodities, and the stock market. All this asset inflation will eventually spill over to CPI, and when that happens, the Fed will increase their rates, popping everything. The trickle begins to grow into a pour the more the economy opens up.

**Housing bubble**

Residential real estate in this case, although commercial are on the rise (they took a massive hit when covid hit unlike residential because WFH/Stimmys/Low mortgage rates, while offices and commercial buildings closed down).  Commercial real estate isn’t a bubble yet, but since prices were historically low, and real estate inflation is building fast, i believe these will rise the fastest (VNQ is very lucrative, it also just closed above major resistance Friday). Most likely won’t let this crash until end of summer or during the fall.

**Stock market** 

Very clear and everybody knows it, but it’s not about if, it’s about when. Unlikely they’ll let it fail right now. Most likely won’t crash until end of summer or during the fall. A crash of the stock market would mean people panicking about their life savings, and saving their money, rather than spend it in the reopening of the economy.

**Credit Bubble** 

QE, low fed rates, stimulus, credit forbearance, student loan forbearance, rent forbearance, etc all built the credit bubble. Probably won’t let this fall because it’ll be mayhem, and will lead to the pop of all the other bubbles. Although, the rent moratorium ending March 31st might exacerbate the credit bubble, paired with no more stimulus forecasted in the future.

**Economic bubble**

Related to the concept of market bubbles is the idea of a general economic boom. A boom implies that the economy expands at an unsustainably fast rate, leading to inflation (e.g. aggregate demand grows faster than productive capacity). Ultimately an economic boom usually proves unsustainable. There may be a strong link between market bubbles and an economic boom. For example, a house price bubble may cause rising wealth and confidence leading to higher consumer spending and economic growth. In turn, the higher economic growth feeds the housing boom. Clearly they won’t let this pop right now because we’re finally reopening. Even though reopening will exacerbate it immensely.


So as you can see, we’re in quite a pickle. A lot comes down to FOMC.


**Things to watch at FOMC:**

**Yield Curve Control**

Increases our debt tremendously adding to inflation. Lowers yields on treasuries that have been mooning lately, as they vastly increase the amount of bonds they buy to decrease the yield. We’re already doing this somewhat, as the Fed spends $120b a month on bonds.

**Supplementary Leverage Ratio** 

When covid first caused havoc, the Federal Reserve eased the leverage rules for large banks by exempting certain investments from their leverage calculations. If that sentence sounds like pig Latin to you don’t worry it doesn’t matter if you understand it, what matters is how to make money off the policy extension/ending. The banks were able to exempt any holdings in U.S. Treasury debt or deposits at the Fed from their calculations of the supplementary leverage ratio. It was supposed to end March 31st. Everybody thought that was the plan. J Pow even said a few months back they have no plans of extending it. But then the yields began to rise and fast. 

Recently, J Pow shocked the public by hinting they might extend the SLR, or potentially make it permanent. They can’t afford to do YCC (they might anyways because they have a trend of positive short term outlook at the cost of long term growth), so if they get rid of SLR without YCC, more than likely every bubble pops. Not extending SLR means that every bank potentially sells off over a trillion dollars in treasuries, skyrocketing the yields, causing a huge tech sell off, and more than likely bringing the entire market with it, popping the stock market bubble. Mortgage rates move with the 10 year treasury, so mortgage rates skyrocket, popping the housing bubble. A popped housing bubble, will pop the credit bubble. And so on. Eventually sending us into a catastrophe worse than the covid recession (if you want to call that a recession), and potentially worse than the Great Depression. Higher yields means that the debt the Federal Reserve has put themselves in, becomes more costly, and the Federal Reserve and the United States government will become bankrupt and default on the debts we owe to foreign countries. However, lots of people on Capitol Hill are begging the Federal Reserve to not extend it, because SLR is one of the most important regulations for Wall Street to not take advantage of the average Joe, and was implemented after the 2008 crisis. The relaxed SLR covid policy is the reason why the wealth gap grew to levels unseen since 1929 (right before the Great Depression) during Covid.

Rather than fearing inflation and moving to cash (which is dumb as hell if there’s inflation on the rise, because your money becomes less valuable by the minute), use it to your advantage.

**4 scenarios and how to play them:**

**YCC implemented, and SLR is extended**

Play REIT ETFs (i have calls on VNQ expiring Friday that i bought at close last Friday). I might sell before the FOMC. The combo of both of these means inflation dramatically goes up, while yields will become incredibly suppressed, keeping real estate prices inflating, and mortgage rates low. Can also begin playing speculative technology again. I’d be cautious tho. Because there’s a chance people start selling bonds faster than YCC and SLR can support it. Collapsing the whole bond system, wiping 80%+ off of Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan predicted a minimum crash of 20% if the 10 year treasury yield hits 2.00%.

**YCC not implemented, but SLR is extended**

Yields might continue to rise, but not as fast as if YCC and SLR were both off the table. Probably could diversify with commodities and REIT. This one will be the least volatile and markets will probably continue to rise for a bit but slowly. This is the current state we’re in. Yields are still dramatically rising, but not as fast as they would with SLR being shot down. I’d play blue chips and value stocks IMO as well. If yields continue to rise, I’d begin shorting QQQ with puts, because once the 10 year hits 2.00%, there will be at least a 20% correction on the Nasdaq. I’d start buying puts around the 1.85% yield mark.

**YCC not implemented, and SLR is not extended**

Hold on to your seat belts. Yields are going through the absolute roof. Buy puts on TLT and make a fortune. Out of all the profit calculations on options I’ve ever done in history, this one is by far the most lucrative in terms of potential. Yields rise as bonds sell off. The lack of YCC and SLR will cause a massive sell of on bonds and potentially cause a gamma squeeze downwards. I’m talking 10k worth of puts being worth tens of millions in a months time.

**YCC implemented, and SLR not extended**

Massive increase in inflation, yields will probably go down. Commodities play. Don’t buy precious metals, because they’re not based off anything anymore. And they’re heavily manipulated. Buy ITB puts (home construction) and calls on commodity ETFs. Lumber will continue to skyrocket to the point that home builders will have to charge insane prices due to supply cost, leading to dramatically less demand. It’s currently forming a head and shoulders on the 1 month chart. Also the moratorium ends March 31st as well, leading to foreclosures. This will increase the supply of available homes on the market, thus, even less demand for home builders.

I personally believe the market wide crash will not happen until the economy is fully up and running, leading to a severe overheating of the economy. This is will cause the federal reserve to finally increase their rates once the CPI is finally hit hard. This is the catalyst for popping the mother of all bubbles. Might happen at the June FOMC, but more than likely it’ll be at the July, September, or November one. I think the highest probability is the September FOMC. Build up that capital by playing the policies to your advantage until then. Once you’ve built up enormous capital, you can buy puts on the SPY and ride around in your private jet safely while the country is up in flames.

In short, **do not place your bets in terms of the market**. Place your bets on the **feds policies** and **how those policies affect the overall markets**, and more importantly, the **subcategories** of the markets. Watch the ventriloquist (Fed), not the puppet (markets). Individual stocks are subject to manipulation, but ETFs are harder, as it’s harder and riskier to manipulate all the stocks in the industry. Which is why I do options on ETFs, rather than individual stocks. Just watch out for dividend risk. Many platforms don’t inform you that you have to pay dividends of those contracts to the contract seller, and those costs aren’t included in the contract costs. A 3% dividend might not seem like a lot, but remember, each contract is equivalent to 100 shares.

Hopefully this helps y’all. There’s money to be made in every market. When one market goes down, another one rises. If you can’t find it, keep looking. If there’s an off chance of literally no bull market (highly unlikely), flip the chart upside down and your calls now become puts.

AMC/GME will probably be profitable this week, but there WILL be a rug pull. Smart money vs dumb money ultimately comes down to the risk/reward ratio. Dumb money focuses more on the reward side, while smart money is focuses on the risk side. Set stop losses and realistic price targets (realistic for GameStop, as I believe it can multiply in price multiple times this week. Clearly, thinking Apple will multiply in price this week would be very unrealistic). Hedge funds are buying in as well. They see dumb money flooding the system and can profit off of it. Watch the volume in real time. Short and rapid volume rises means retail investors, large instantaneous leaps means institutions are buying. When they sell, the price squeezes downwards, as stop losses get triggered.

**TLDR;**

YCC implemented, SLR extended: calls on REIT ETFs (VNQ)

YCC implemented, SLR not extended: ITB puts (home construction etf), calls on commodities 

YCC not implemented, SLR extended: stonks go sideways, diversify with calls on REIT and commodities (not precious metals) (lumber/sugar/coffee/copper)

YCC not implemented, SLR not extended: yields moon/potential market crash. Buy puts on TLT (20 year bond prices crater and fast)

If you want to make big money fast, print/make a cheat sheet of those 4 TLDR plays while watching the FOMC live. Set up your trade drafts in different tabs so all you have to do is click a button and beat the herd. If they announce one of the policies first, you can close out half of the plays, leaving only two tabs. I suspect we’ll do YCC not implemented and SLR extended, as it’ll slow the rise in yields, and also not cause massive volatility. Markets will be calm and the Federal Reserve lives to see another day.

One ^more thing^:

There is a potential for a market crash during quad witching hour, regardless of the outcome of FOMC. Wall Street might doing a massive rotation from growth to value. This could plummet the value of growth stocks very quickly, setting off stop losses. If this happens, people could panic sell and it could snowball, bringing down the entire market with it. I don't believe there is a big chance of that, but there is a chance. I think it'll stabilize after a few trading days, but I thought I'd throw that out there.

If I'm wrong or misinformed about anything in the post, please comment below. Or if you have some tips on some plays regarding one of the 4 scenarios, let me know. *Let's make these tendies.*

And last but not least, the obligatory:

Morning Prepper,https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/m5j6dw/morning_prepper/,upbstock,1,2021-03-15 20:03:06,1,/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/m5j6dw/morning_prepper/,NaN,"Most valuable startup

Digital payments giant Stripe (STRIP) is raising $600M in new funding at a $95B valuation, making it the most valuable startup in the U.S. It's nearly triple the $36B valuation Stripe secured last April, when it raised another $600M from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Investors in this round include Allianz, Fidelity and Baillie Gifford, as well as the sovereign wealth fund of Ireland, which is the home country of Stripe founders John and Patrick Collison.

Backdrop: Stripe was founded in 2010 by the two Irish siblings (their net worth jumped to $11.4B each with the latest valuation). The company's software, which competes with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ), is used by businesses to accept online payments and has been a big beneficiary of the e-commerce boom accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. Customers include Amazon (AMZN), Instacart (ICART), Salesforce (CRM) and Lyft (LYFT).

Stripe is ""highly capital efficient"" and didn't really need the money in spite of the fundraising, CFO Dhivya Suryadevara declared. ""I view this as a bit more opportunistic,"" she said in an interview on Sunday. ""It will just sit on the balance sheet,"" added Mike Moritz, partner at Sequoia and a Stripe board member, emphasizing that the money will be used as a ""a rainy day fund."" Some of the capital will also be invested in Stripe's European operations and its dual headquarters in Dublin.

Outlook: While Stripe isn't focusing on an initial public offering right now, both Suryadevara and Moritz said the company will continue to seek out acquisitions. In December, the company branched out to offer checking accounts to businesses through e-commerce providers, inking partnerships with banks including Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C).

Could a ban happen in the U.S.?

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit a record high of $60,000 on Saturday, nearly doubling in value this year, as the Beeple NFT sale continued to draw attention to the cryptocurrency, as well as more institutional investment. Prices then pulled back 7% to the $56,000 level on reports that India would propose a law banning cryptos, giving holders of the virtual assets up to six months to liquidate. The bill, one of the world's strictest policies against cryptocurrencies, would criminalize everything from possession, issuance and mining to trading and transferring crypto assets.

Why is India doing this? It's not the first nation to take action against Bitcoin, with similar bans or restrictions seen in countries like China, Pakistan, Russia, Bolivia, North Macedonia and Morocco. There are concerns that Bitcoin's decentralized system will make it more complicated for central banks to create their own CBDCs (central bank digital currencies), as well as worries that cryptos could be used to finance illicit activities. CBDCs are a promising tool that will allow central banks to have real-time data about their economies, offering the ability to track money flows, spending and savings data and what sectors are suffering or doing well. Leaving privacy concerns aside, a central bank could be more informed on monetary policy when armed with that information, while the government could possibly link future stimulus payments, universal basic income or fiscal policy to CBDCs.

Many Americans are unaware that it was illegal to own gold from 1934 to 1974, though the prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964. A U.S. citizen couldn't own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins, as the federal government and banks shored up their financial soundness. Turning to cryptos, the Secret Service and the IRS have already worked with Coinbase (COIN) and exchanges to hold private crypto wallet keys, while the US Marshals Service has seized and auctioned many a Bitcoin. What would happen if the U.S. government or Fed felt threatened by the rise of decentralized banking? What if it interfered with their plan for CBDCs?

Go deeper: Bringing forth a Bitcoin ban could be legally difficult for the U.S. government, but even if would go through, enforcing the ban would be the harder part of the equation. Unless the government would exert strict control over the internet, individuals could download Bitcoin wallet software, run a node and complete transactions. That may render the currency out the realm of widespread adoption, but could also increase its demand for the exact same reason. Over the last decade, Bitcoin has also made inroads into the U.S. financial system, where it is treated as a commodity, so a ban could face other barriers like stymieing innovation and closing down institutions overseeing billions of dollars in crypto assets.

What's next for stocks?

Futures contracts linked to the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are all starting the week up 0.4% as the debate over whether a $1.9T stimulus bill will prompt a serious pickup in inflation continues to play out in the markets. Bond yields are turning lower for now, with the 10-year Treasury yield down 2 bps to 1.61%, suggesting a positive start to the week for equities, especially the hard-hit tech sector. A wide rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. is also helping stoke a bullish sentiment.

Analyst talk: ""Most market participants and policy-makers have been surprised by the speed of the recovery. On our estimates, the U.S. economy will reach pre-COVID-19 output levels by the current quarter,"" said Chetan Ahya, global head of economics at Morgan Stanley in New York. ""Fiscal policy is doing much more than fill the output hole. Transfers to households have already exceeded the income lost in the recession. As reopening gathers pace, the labor market is poised for a sharp rebound.""

Past estimates suggest part of the coming $1,400 in direct stimulus payments could find its way into the stock market, though this time around, it is joined with some concerns. Rising inflation expectations could persuade the Fed to signal it will start raising rates sooner when it announces its latest economic projections at the end of FOMC meeting on Wednesday.

More commentary: ""Following the fiscal stimulus packages it is inevitable that Fed GDP forecasts will be revised up, and some FOMC members might think rates will have to move higher sooner than they anticipated last December,"" wrote economists at ANZ. ""The Fed is aiming for higher inflation which means higher interest rates. I think the market has misread the Fed in thinking about yield curve control,"" added Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist for Mizuho Securities.

SPACs catch attention of short sellers

One of the hottest growth areas on Wall Street, special purpose acquisition companies, is becoming a target for short sellers, WSJ reports. In fact, the dollar value of bearish bets against shares of SPACs has more than tripled to about $2.7B from $724M at the start of the year, according to data from S3 Partners.

Some examples: Social Finance (SOFI) is a popular target, with 19% of its outstanding SPAC (NYSE:IPOE) shares sold short, while short interest in Churchill Capital Corp. IV (NYSE:CCIV), a SPAC that is merging with EV startup Lucid Motors, more than doubled in March to about 5%. Others are wagering against companies after they combine with SPACs, like Muddy Waters's bet against XL Fleet (NYSE:XL). Shares of Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) also stumbled 17% on Friday after Hindenburg Research released a report saying the EV startup misled investors on its orders and production.

""These are all momentum stocks, and a lot of people want to short them,"" said Matthew Tuttle, whose firm recently launched ""The SPAC and New Issue ETF (NYSE:SPCX),"" the first actively managed ETF that gives investors direct exposure to a broad portfolio of SPACs.

Go deeper: The dangers of shorting were made clear in recent months when retail traders organized on social media to push up stocks like GameStop (GME) (the movement also apparently attracted institutional interest). Continued strong investor demand for SPACs could catch short sellers in a similar squeeze. Shorting can also be risky because SPAC shares have a price floor of $10 and they are prone to sharp price moves. (134 comments)

AstraZeneca vaccine scare

Concerns are growing over a coronavirus vaccine from AstraZeneca (AZN), which was once anticipated to be a mainstay of protection for much of the globe. The jab, developed with the University of Oxford, does not need to be kept at ultra-low temperatures and costs about $4 a dose, compared to the $20 per dose from Pfizer (PFE) and $33 for Moderna's shot (MRNA). But controversy has erupted as more countries limit AstraZeneca's use and scientists warn of the need for governments to tread carefully.

What happened? Over the weekend, the Netherlands joined a growing list of about a dozen countries, including Italy, Ireland, Denmark and Norway, moving to suspend the shot over concerns about possible side effects. While regulators said there was no indication of any direct link with the vaccine, reports of serious blood clotting triggered suspensions stretching as far as Thailand, though some have already resumed its usage.

AstraZeneca is defending its vaccine, saying in a statement that more than 17M doses have been administered in Europe and the U.K., with no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia. So far across EU and Britain, there have been 15 events of DVT and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those given the vaccine, based on the number of cases registered as of March 8, lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population.

Quote: ""You have to be very careful because it's also sending a message that there could be something very wrong with the vaccine when in fact, it's very unlikely that there is,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, a former World Health Organization adviser on vaccine safety. ""We're doing massive mass vaccination campaigns and people get sick all the time. We can't panic every time it happens. But we also need to take all precaution. And it's a hard balance.""

 03/15/2021 Morning Forecast -Markets are implying a move of 1.35%+/-(up/down) on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have realized a move of 1.09%+/-(up/down). The difference between what market makers are implying and what has been realized has tightened. The spread decreased to 387 (21.51-17.64) basis points. The put/call gamma imbalance is skewed towards short-dated calls on dip buying. However, a tightening spread decreases left-tail risk and the potential for delayed upside spikes in realized volatility. Realized volatility has increased recently above 17. Bond market volatility is spilling over into other asset classes. This is favorable for wider and larger moves up or down on the index. However,  economic growth upgrades and rising inflation expectations without rising inflation or economic growth are pushing up real yields, which is creating equity long-duration valuation conflicts and raising discount rates. The S&amp;P is expected to move close to 1.72% up/down this week, which means the S&amp;P could rise 11% to 13% above its 200 DAY Moving average (3,494.41.) The S&amp;P bounced last week off its 50-day moving average (3,840.70.) Full Year S&amp;P Earnings are expected to total 174 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P at 22x's earnings, which equates to an earnings yield of 4.5% &amp; an inflation-adjusted real earnings yield of 2.5%

Forecasters are rushing to up-grade nominal and real growth expectations for the full year in 2021. For the 1st quarter of 2021 current estimates of nominal growth are 300 Billion and a Real Economic output of 130 Billion. Full Year Economic Output estimates have increased following the passage of stimulus. The median forecast was anticipating close to 1.2 Trillion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 800 Billion Dollars in real economic output for 2021. Major fiscal stimulus is positioning the US to capture more than 1/3 of Global Economic Output in 2021. Economists continue to place the highest expectation for growth in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. Investment Banking Professionals are forecasting nominal growth of 400 Billion and real output of 240 Billion for the 2nd Quarter. This is a substantial amount of spending on Goods &amp; Services, which may fail to materialize if there are any delays in Covid vaccinations or roll-outs.  Under these assumptions, we would need 50 to 60 Billion dollars of spending on Personal Consumption Expenditures in the months of April, May, and June. I think these estimates are optimistic and I continue to rely on more conservative estimates. I think we could see nominal growth in 2nd Quarter of 325B to 350B. Real Output is likely between 180B to 210B. There is a strong possibility the $1,400 stimulus checks increase consumption similar to economic data in January 2021, which recorded a 257 Billion Dollar gain in Personal Consumption Expenditure. It is also equally likely to engender significantly higher personal savings rates. We may temporarily eclipse the 20% savings rate experienced early in 2020. I may upgrade my forecast following additional data releases(edited)

The February non-farm payroll report was strong and robust. However, the trend has been weak Non-Farm Payrolls growth and elevated numbers of Americans receiving some form of unemployment assistance, which indicates large swaths of slack in the labor market. Private Forecast is anticipating payroll growth between 270k and 500k per month, which equates to 3.2 Million &amp; 6.0 Million additions to full-year US payrolls. This key economic indicator is likely to pressure growth in the 1st half of 2021. However, the recent agreement on 1.9 Trillion in deficit spending is a significant tailwind to nominal growth in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This assumes virus cases come down substantially by April/May and pandemic flare-ups lessen. Government Stimulus Checks total 380 Billion Dollars, which represents a little less than 1/5 (20%) of the total bill. States &amp; Local Governments will receive much-needed stimulus totaling 350 Billion Dollars. This has led some market observers to anticipate economic overheating, which is favorable for upside risk in inflation. I believe these fears are statistically unfounded. The recent increase in nominal Treasury yields and 5yr Break-Evens on TIPs (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) towards 2.51% is transitory and likely reflecting recent increases in energy prices and base effects

https://preview.redd.it/empr2u5y87n61.png?width=542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23e0d4ac97b47ee57672fec7d8c1800b7f95dede

 Following the passage of stimulus larger fiscal dissavings increases capital inflows to finance VERY large TWIN DEFICITS, which should put upward pressure on the US Dollar &amp; downward pressure on Corporate &amp; Government Bond Yields. Potentially weaker inflation data than consensus estimates should allow real yields to remain negative. Dollar appreciation dampens import/commodity-driven inflation and should lessen temporary transitory base effects. Inflationistah and inflation fear-mongers engaging in scare tactics are likely to be proven wrong. However, inflation base effects are expected to be lead to short-term transitory spikes in headline inflation data from March/April/and May. The impact on Core PCE is expected to be limited. Market Expectations are split, but I expect the Federal Reserve will look through these spikes.

 Political risks have diminished in the 1st quarter due to reconciliation, but it has increased in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, which may pose risk to much-needed Investment spending (infrastructure, human capital, &amp; research development), so I view it in the medium term as tilted to the upside due to potential gridlock. However, there is the possibility for another round of reconciliation in the 2022 budget combined with the removal of the Filibuster Rules in the Senate. This could pave the way for easier passage of additional INVESTMENT lead spending, which is much needed to raise the US Long Term Potential Growth Rate. Although, due to political isolation this increases the potential for Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorism.

 Vaccine distribution priced into Q3 2021, but distribution obstacles have increased and efficacy for herd immunity will be closely watched. Redefining herd immunity may become the norm, so instead of a fully vaccinated population of 90%. We may accept a different goal post for ""full vaccination"" perhaps it drops between 70% to 75%(?) Details are currently unknown. The market is currently pricing in an additional 1.72% move +/- (up/down) by March 19th. This is a quadruple witching week. The S&amp;P 500 could potentially trade as high as 4,008.60 and as low as 3,874.20 by March 19th. The VIX is expected to move 7.02%(points), the VIX is currently 21.51. The VIX price range is 23.02 to 20.09. The Skew Index is EXTREMELY elevated, which indicates market participants are paying up for catastrophic protection (2 sigma event). Stocks continue to offer investors the highest real returns. The nominal yield on equities is 4.5%, while the nominal yield on 10yr Treasury is 1.60%. Real yields on all tenors of government bonds at the shorter end and belly of the curve are decisively negative, but real yields at longer tenors above 20 years have moved into positive territory. Real yields on US Equities remain strongly positive.\*\*Disclaimer with Realized Volatility rising above 12 there is a larger risk of systematic highly leveraged short vol strategies like Equity Vol Targeting, Trend Following, and Risk Parity positioned for a selloff and reduction in market exposure. The potential for a MUCH larger DELAYED sell off 4% to 5% is coming. The Mar/Apr VIX contracts at 21 &amp; 25 are fairly priced. Passage of fiscal stimulus should juice the start of a new long-term economic cycle, which favors a continued fall in realized volatility. - I am temporarily moving against a large rise in implied or realized volatility, However, I have been wrong before, but sell-offs will give investors great opportunities to buy the dip 

 Traders should focus on cyclical sectors, which tend to outperform at the start of new economic cycles. For example being long Financial, Industrials, Metals, Mining, Oil/Gas, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology."

Despite being at its inception, with currently more than $40 billion in total value locked (TVL) \[1\], there exist already plenty of opportunities for you to make your idle crypto tokens do the hard work for you to earn some interest. Some of the strategies offer a high risk-reward ratio, whereas some are rather safer. Many people do not know where to start with DeFi because the term itself is a buzzword (e.g., similar to the term BigData) with ambiguous meanings that get people easily lost. DeFi encapsulates various decentralized financial services whose functionality is immutable and persisted on (Ethereum) blockchain, which simply means these services are *accessible to anyone under the same rules and conditions*, which is a huge difference from traditional financial (tradFi) services. DeFi offers various strategies and this extensive guide should outline and uncover the most common earning strategies -- including advantages and disadvantages -- in the Ethereum ecosystem. The strategies proceed from the more mainstream and community-approved ones to more advanced ones, concluding with inspiring platforms and trends.

**1 STAKING**

This is not DeFi per se, but to make the list complete, I will start with this, as ETH 2.0 staking is the *most important strategy* that can not only grant you passive income but also helps *keep the network decentralized and safe*. Also, the rewards compared to traditional finance are very appealing.

**1.1 ETH 2.0 staking**

    rewards: ~8% APR

There has been written a lot about staking already, for those who are interested to read more, the best start is Etehreum official website \[2\]. Several variants exist (self, validator-as-a-service, stake pools, custody, exchange) each of which suits better for people at different skill levels or involvement.

|\[+\] Ultimate HODL strategy|\[-\] Tokens are locked indefinitely|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|\[-\] Slashing penalties for offline time|

**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**

Tokens: *Aave (LEND \[3\], Synthetix (SNX) \[4\], Sushi \[5\], Curve (CRV) \[6\], Badger \[7\], The Graph (GRT) \[8\], and many others...)*

    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APR

There exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance -- or no activity at all (\~reward distribution tokens).

|\[+\] Earning interest on your favorite coins|\[-\] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme|
|:-|:-|


**2 LENDING**

dApps: *Compound \[9\], Aave\[10\]*

You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.

**2.1 Stablecoin lending**

    rewards: 3–30% APR

You lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets. The reward is around 3-30% APR. Compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).

|\[+\] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|\[+\] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)|
|:-|:-|
|\[+/-\] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||

**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**

    rewards: 0.15–3% APR

Wrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.

|\[+\] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income|
|:-|


**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**

dApps: *uniswap\[11\], sushi\[12\], 1inch\[13\], Loopring\[14\] (L2)*

    rewards: up to 100%´s APR (with rewards)

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio. By locking the assets, you are eligible to earn the fixed fees (around 0.3%) of every trade, proportional to your stake in the liquidity pool. It makes sense to lock assets that you want to hold anyways and in the long-term, e.g., ETH/stablecoin pairs. New pairs are very often incentivized in providing liquidity by offering rewards schemes.

|\[+\] Acquiring a reasonable proportion of the pool that has high trading volume can generate interesting profits|\[-\] Inter-pair token price fluctuations or decline to $0 lead to permanent and impermanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Many liquidity pools are incentivized by token providers or DEXes by additional token rewards that might severely boost the interest|\[-\] Pools with low or no liquidity provide unstable ratios|

**4 YIELD FARMING**

dApps: *yearn\[15\], curve\[6\], badger\[16\], harvest.finance\[17\], alphahomora\[18\] (leveraged farming), and many others...*

    rewards: up to 100%´s APY

In typical staking, lending, or liquidity-providing scenarios, there is no compounding. In other words, you have to claim your rewards manually to earn them and re-stake them to compound your interests.  Some of the farming protocols collect the rewards for you. Yield farming basically removes or socializes the transaction fees to claim the rewards, which means that your earned interest is continuously compounding which increases the APR (to APY) without the need of repeatedly interacting with the smart contract which is expensive. Some aggressive yield farming strategies focus on harvesting both yields AND rewards from various protocols and compound all of them, which can make them very profitable in short term.

|\[+\] Very high rewards (100+% APY is not problem)|\[-\] Some farmed assets cease to exist leaving you with permanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Farming aggregators (e.g., harvest.finance) offer multiple strategies and additionally offer interesting reward tokenomics|\[-\] Many strategies are short term only and are not worth paying high TX fees|

**5 MISCELLANEOUS**

There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.

**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**

dApps: *Syncbonds\[19\], VeryNifty\[20\]*

Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds\[19\] are tradable high reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity pool tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.

With VeryNifty\[20\], you can wrap your NFTS and turn them into vNFTs that earn you interest in the MUSE token. Careful conditions apply that might burn your NTFs. There is a [uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0xc2BdE1A2fA26890c8E6AcB10C91CC6D9c11F4a73/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to stake and generate yields and trade HashMasks.

**b) Synthetic assets**

dApps: *Synthetix \[21\], Mirror\[22\]*

Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of ""synths"" that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes). Ensuring the collateral to back up the synthetic asset pair with stablecoin can earn you good rewards while exposing you to the stock at the same time. The leading projects are Synthetix\[21\] and Mirror.finance\[22\] that uses its Terra UST cross-chain stablecoin.

**c) Future yield tokenization**

dApps: *APwine\[23\], Syncbonds\[19\]*

Imagine you can stake your tokens to gain future yields without locking the tokens and imagine you can sell these interest-bearing tokens INCLUDING its future yield in advance (for some discount, or even premium if you are lucky or smart). Sounds like a Matrix loophole. The markets are so far rather small, but the APwine\[23\] project is worth keeping eye on.

**d) Self-paying loans - alchemix**

dApps: *Alchemix\[24\]*

Alchemix\[24\] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as ""loan to yourself"". The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.

**DISCLAIMER**

To earn interest in most cases does not mean buying the project's native token but using their platform/dApp. 

I am not anyhow related to, paid by, or involved with development in any of the mentioned projects or protocols.

This is the 1st version (16. 3. 2021). I am aware that it is by far not completely exhaustive. If you feel something should be added/removed/changed let me know, I plan to keep it updated. 

This is not financial advice, and I am not responsible for your losses equally as well as I am not participating on your future gains :-)."
NFT tickets the next frontier for NFTs and blockchain in the adoption curve - GET protocol,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/m69rcw/nft_tickets_the_next_frontier_for_nfts_and/,CommercialTouch9,1,2021-03-16 22:03:10,20,/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/m69rcw/nft_tickets_the_next_frontier_for_nfts_and/,Fundamentals,"GET protocol is blockchain ticketing company that has already sold 600k tickets and ticketing companies in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Sout korea use it

Here's my take on why GET protocol's smart and blockchain registered tickets becoming NFT's will revolutionize the ticketing industry.

So what’s a NFT exactly? NFT stands for non fungible token. This is a token that’s unique on the blockchain and not mutually interchangeable. This in contrast to for example Bitcoin where it doesn’t matter which Bitcoin you have (1 BTC = 1 BTC). Every ticket issued by the GET protocol will become a getNFT.

Eventhough GET’s NFT’s will be the most used, bought &amp; traded NFT’s in the crypto space the goal isn’t to ride the hype. Ticketing + NFT = a match made in heaven. And here’s why:

As every ticket on the blockchain will become a NFT and thus unqiue, it will allow non custodial ownership of the ticket asset. This gives many interesting advantages but 2 stand out for me personally: P2P ticket trading &amp; DeFi event financing.

**Benifits of NFT tickets on GET Protocol**  


* **Merging of the primary and secondary market avoiding scalping**
* **Defi event financing** 
* **Attaching extra premium features to tickets for increased fan engagement, an NFT for attending an event, free poster, single or album with the ticket**

This will be the first and only nft ticketing system that will allow ticket trading while at the same time making scalping impossible. Regulators have been struggling for a long time to solve this problem and what seemed impossible to achieve will be made possible by smart contracts! The impact of this will be huge and will change the ticketing space for the better.  
Additionally and not unimportantly it will give the event organizer an extra revenue stream. The money that right now for a large part goes to scalpers (the secondary ticket market is worth $15B) will be tapped into by the event organizers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Event financing**  
Without a doubt one of the most promising and exciting things to look forward to in 2021 is the introduction of decentralized event financing to GET Protocol.  
Event organizers often struggle to get financing for their events. This doesn’t only apply to starting artists, but even to famous stars. The artists need to have a lot of capital in advance as they have to pay for the venues, organisation, upfront while only receiving the money after the show is over. Enter GET’s DeFi solution!

&gt;*The pre-financing of events for event-organizers is not a solution looking for a problem; it’s a widely known and used tool that enables event organizers to make the investments needed to get their shows or festivals off the ground.*  
*In the past we have encountered Event Organizers who select their ticketing partner solely based on the amount of money and loan conditions that they are offered up front.*

Thanks to getNFT tickets you’ll be able to pre-finance events of your choice. You can choose to finance new artists (more risk/more APY) or established kpop stars (less risk/less APY).

This is how it will work:

[https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d](https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d)

*If the concept seems complicated, here’s what you need to understand about GET’s decentralized financing solution:*  
*1.) Event organizers will be able to easily pre-finance their events. (Something they desperately crave.)*  
*2.) Investors will be able to invest in events of their choice, at a risk &amp; reward level that they feel comfortable with.*  
*3.) The $GET token is an integral part of the financing process, as it is required for ‘skin in the game’ from*

The advantage event financing for GET token holders will bring is again twofold:

1. As a GET holder you’ll be able to finance events and share in the profit of the ticket sales. This means that GET will allow you to profit without selling = passive income. An important note is that this is profit without inflation. While other DeFi projects give you returns by increasing the supply (and thus decreasing the value of the token) the returns here will not increase the GET supply, as the returns come from real profit(ticket sales).
2. As the GET token will be an integral part of this process, it will:  
\- increase the buy pressure of the GET token (everyone who wants to participate will need GET)  
\- decrease the supply (everyone who participates will have to locks his GET tokens).

For a deeper insight I recommend the blog below:

***The first decentrally financed event is expected to take place in the first half of 2021.***

**1 STAKING**

This is not DeFi per se, but to make the list complete, I will start with this, as ETH 2.0 staking is the *most important strategy* that can not only grant you passive income but also helps *keep the network decentralized and safe*. Also, the rewards compared to traditional finance are very appealing.

**1.1 ETH 2.0 staking**

    rewards: ~8% APR

There has been written a lot about staking already, for those who are interested to read more, the best start is Etehreum official website \[2\]. Several variants exist (self, validator-as-a-service, stake pools, custody, exchange) each of which suits better for people at different skill levels or involvement.

|\[+\] Ultimate HODL strategy|\[-\] Tokens are locked indefinitely|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|\[-\] Slashing penalties for offline time|

**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**

Tokens: *Aave (LEND \[3\], Synthetix (SNX) \[4\], Sushi \[5\], Curve (CRV) \[6\], Badger \[7\], The Graph (GRT) \[8\], and many others...)*

    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APR

There exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance -- or no activity at all (\~reward distribution tokens).

|\[+\] Earning interest on your favorite coins|\[-\] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme|
|:-|:-|


**2 LENDING**

dApps: *Compound \[9\], Aave\[10\]*

You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.

**2.1 Stablecoin lending**

    rewards: 3–30% APR

You lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets. The reward is around 3-30% APR. Compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).

|\[+\] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|\[+\] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)|
|:-|:-|
|\[+/-\] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||

**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**

    rewards: 0.15–3% APR

Wrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.

|\[+\] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income|
|:-|


**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**

dApps: *uniswap\[11\], sushi\[12\], 1inch\[13\], Loopring\[14\] (L2)*

    rewards: up to 100%´s APR (with rewards)

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio. By locking the assets, you are eligible to earn the fixed fees (around 0.3%) of every trade, proportional to your stake in the liquidity pool. It makes sense to lock assets that you want to hold anyways and in the long-term, e.g., ETH/stablecoin pairs. New pairs are very often incentivized in providing liquidity by offering rewards schemes.

|\[+\] Acquiring a reasonable proportion of the pool that has high trading volume can generate interesting profits|\[-\] Inter-pair token price fluctuations or decline to $0 lead to permanent and impermanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Many liquidity pools are incentivized by token providers or DEXes by additional token rewards that might severely boost the interest|\[-\] Pools with low or no liquidity provide unstable ratios|

**4 YIELD FARMING**

dApps: *yearn\[15\], curve\[6\], badger\[16\], harvest.finance\[17\], alphahomora\[18\] (leveraged farming), and many others...*

    rewards: up to 100%´s APY

In typical staking, lending, or liquidity-providing scenarios, there is no compounding. In other words, you have to claim your rewards manually to earn them and re-stake them to compound your interests.  Some of the farming protocols collect the rewards for you. Yield farming basically removes or socializes the transaction fees to claim the rewards, which means that your earned interest is continuously compounding which increases the APR (to APY) without the need of repeatedly interacting with the smart contract which is expensive. Some aggressive yield farming strategies focus on harvesting both yields AND rewards from various protocols and compound all of them, which can make them very profitable in short term.

|\[+\] Very high rewards (100+% APY is not problem)|\[-\] Some farmed assets cease to exist leaving you with permanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Farming aggregators (e.g., harvest.finance) offer multiple strategies and additionally offer interesting reward tokenomics|\[-\] Many strategies are short term only and are not worth paying high TX fees|

**5 MISCELLANEOUS**

There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.

**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**

dApps: *Syncbonds\[19\], VeryNifty\[20\]*

Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds\[19\] are tradable high reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity pool tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.

With VeryNifty\[20\], you can wrap your NFTS and turn them into vNFTs that earn you interest in the MUSE token. Careful conditions apply that might burn your NTFs. There is a [uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0xc2BdE1A2fA26890c8E6AcB10C91CC6D9c11F4a73/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to stake and generate yields and trade HashMasks.

**b) Synthetic assets**

dApps: *Synthetix \[21\], Mirror\[22\]*

Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of ""synths"" that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes). Ensuring the collateral to back up the synthetic asset pair with stablecoin can earn you good rewards while exposing you to the stock at the same time. The leading projects are Synthetix\[21\] and Mirror.finance\[22\] that uses its Terra UST cross-chain stablecoin.

**c) Future yield tokenization**

dApps: *APwine\[23\], Syncbonds\[19\]*

Imagine you can stake your tokens to gain future yields without locking the tokens and imagine you can sell these interest-bearing tokens INCLUDING its future yield in advance (for some discount, or even premium if you are lucky or smart). Sounds like a Matrix loophole. The markets are so far rather small, but the APwine\[23\] project is worth keeping eye on.

**d) Self-paying loans - alchemix**

dApps: *Alchemix\[24\]*

Alchemix\[24\] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as ""loan to yourself"". The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.

What is Options.Market?

Options.Market will begin life as a fork of a VC-backed anon-project called SirenMarkets.com, which is an open source mainnet, decentralized options trading solution for ERC20 tokens. The potential is to create a fully-composable cryptocurrency options trading solution with embedded liquidity incentives that allows traders to move in and out of the long and short sides of options seamlessly and enables more complex portfolio positions in DeFi than are currently possible. As such, it is a market that will scale with DeFi even as DeFi continues to take ground from traditional finance . In traditional finance, options see $300 trillion of notional volume traded every year.
Why did you decide to do this?
DegenVC is able to effectively front-run VC-backed open source DeFi projects due to its large committed community that want to be first to own project tokens, its track record in delivering alpha, and its massive war chest of dev runway. Our capacity in AMM, DEX and bonding curve innovation and our doxxed team’s vast experience with innovative financial instruments make this fork an obvious choice.

Why do you think it will be successful?

Mainly because of our three-pronged approach:

Launch - the alphadrop / accelerator-vault combo is unstoppable

Improve - we will continue to senior-dev war room the code and solution, improving on it prior to our launch (circa 30 days)

Tokenomics - liquidity providers are the key ecosystem partner. We have allocated 5x rewards to them and will not lock their rewards at all (Siren impose 3 months). Even though we launch later our liquidity providers will actually receive reward tokens sooner.

Our core belief is that the market should be allowed to decide if projects succeed or not. As it is constructed, the markets have very little say in relative success or failure in Siren as a sizeable quantity of tokens have been sold at highly discounted prices. This reminds us all too well of the ICO boom of 2017/2018 - influential and connected investors getting in on projects at deep discounts to the retail market. Indeed - what is different from a normal centralized VC-type transaction? Very little in our analysis.

Where can you improve on the project you fork?

Firstly, we should speak to “why fork”. We fork when we realise we can be at the same developmental life-cycle stage today as a project is by doing so. Absent of the liquidity Siren currently has, this is true. But this is not typically enough. There must be more that we can add. Degen Labs brings the following 3 incremental improvements and ideas:
A key concern in Siren’s technical architecture is this function in the w/b token source code: (https://github.com/sirenmarkets/core/blob/c5c8cb92bea9e7fbf21186723ac1a85168ab444e/contracts/token/SimpleToken.sol#L116), which allows the anon owner of the token contract to self-destruct it. We assume this allows the Siren anon team to shut down and drain the AMM for upgrade or whatever but it amounts to them having the power to delete all tokens and value. This is one of the reasons they have a closed AMM. Their ERC20’s are more like bonds which are short lived and vanish. One less risky solution would be to allow the derivative coins to collapse into simple collateral-backed coins when their time is up (for example, like how SAI went from dollar pegged to having a fixed redeem rate for eth). Then we could list on generic AMMs with all the liquidity advantages. We are looking at writing an adaptor that copes the destruct somehow. Details to follow on Github.

Like most projects with “governance tokens”, governance itself is something deferred in favour of essentially retaining full control “for the time being”. Degen Labs has a mainnet functioning DAO currently used on Behodler, MorgothDAO. This will be utilised for real decentralized governance from the outset.

Siren claims that fees will be distributed to SI token holders. Really? How? It's a SAFT-funded project so what about KYC? Options.Market will send fees to a decentralized liquid vault where people can claim LP tokens at a discounted value but locked for a certain period. This will support the OSM token through buy-pressure and liquidity locking. Once this liquid vault is deployed the Github link will be shared.

What do you expect will happen?

Honestly, this is one for our community and we will be focused on the roll out more than the Uniswap market. If the price is low, it's more opportunity for our community to accumulate in the early stages which we like. Only the Degen community will really understand the potential of a project with just a telegram group and this AMA but that is Degen Labs backed. 

They have been part of the $12MM+ alphadrops over the past six months so they know what is coming. At this point we don’t need a snazzy website to convince them about the idea and its potential. We just need some clear information and a well managed telegram channel. Then we get on with building.

If you are new to Degen VC we would encourage you to read this article that unpacks the data around the alpha we have delivered via alphadrops in six months.

How do you expect to compete with a VC backed project?

There are two sides to this answer. One, competing on the talent side, and two, competing on the resources side. Degen Labs has the talent - this has been demonstrated in Behodler.io and other projects. It also has the resource enough to fund years of development. Our developers are paid well but not fifty millions of dollars like the Siren team - all this money goes to the degen community.

We think that in the token paradigm VCs really just serve the purpose of vetting and are not needed for financing. Also, the way this project has structured its token distribution is to support the token price of VCs bags for as long as possible which will also serve as price discovery for the #degenhorde-backed options.market. This will be useful too.

What are the distribution differences between this structure and the way Siren is set up?

18% of the supply was sold to VCs at $0.40 per token. They have to wait just a year before being able to dump on retail.

10% went to an “incubator” (another VC). 

Only 5% of the supply is being offered to the public via the Balancer LBP. Most tokens sold on the Balancer LBP at the time of writing have sold for over $2 each (5x what the VCs paid). 

Just 6.5% is being offered as liquidity rewards. 

The “initial team” (anons) is keeping 26.5% of tokens worth $10.6 million at VC prices or $53 million at LBP ($2) price. 

The Degen VC approach is radically different:

18% of the supply will be given at ZERO COST to the #degenhorde (DGVC LP) in an #alphadrop

When: March 12th, 2021. 

10% of the supply will go to an accelerator-vault to boost liquidity 

When: March 19th, 2021. 

32.5% will reward liquidity providers (5x rewards of Siren with no lockup) 

All locked for in team.finance 30-days prior to launch of pools.

4.5% will be allocated to community rewards.

35% of the supply will go to Degen VC for project finance and marketing. 

25% in team.finance lock for 30-days. 

0% will go to VCs

-----------------------

Siren Project Assessment
From what we can understand of the published material, the founding team of SIREN has raised millions of dollars for the development and marketing of the ecosystem and yet still retain 26.5% of total token supply on a lock-up vesting period.
This means that they effectively get 2 funding / exit bites: the first one is VC funding to execute their roadmap: pay salaries and pay for dev, marketing and other expenses; the second is the team token allocation that commences unlocking in 1 years’ time - not a dev wallet in the purest sense - and are then sellable into the market. It’s a founder and team equity-kicker on top of a fully-funded execution roadmap. It’s an old-school VC construct shoe-horned into tokenized environment. We wish them well, but we want to make degens wealthy, not VCs. So LFG."
Career advice request - First job after graduation,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/m754hs/career_advice_request_first_job_after_graduation/,97flip,1,2021-03-18 01:04:50,0,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/m754hs/career_advice_request_first_job_after_graduation/,Career Progression,"Dear All, 

This summer I will graduate from a good University. I will then have both a MSc in Finance (current GPA 9+ out of 10) and a LLM in Corporate Law (GPA 8+ out of 10). I have completed 2 internships during my studies (in corporate finance and valuations).

I am trying to decide where I would like to start working after graduation (in main land Europe). I am looking for a position were I can learn alot and build a broad base for the rest of my career in Corporate Finance, M&amp;A or Private Equity. Starting salary is not the most important factor here, but building a network could come in handy later in my career.

At the moment the 3 main options I consider are the following (in random order):

1. Applying for a position at a Corporate Finance (mainly M&amp;A, but also debt advisory and other) boutique with around 10 colleagues. I have already worked as an intern at this firm for 2 years and really enjoyed it. I got a lot of responsibilities (even as an intern) and was able to learn a lot. At this firm I will work on a wide range of projects. The deal size is not enormous. Furthermore, the work-life balance is very nice at the particulair office. 

The possible cons are: i) not a lot of colleagues to learn from, ii) no clear internal learning path, and iii) not a famous firm in my country so maybe limited exit options/lower value for CV. 


2. Applying for a position at a Private Equity House with around 25 people working at the particular office I will be working for. This is the option I am the most unknown with, but I recently got an offer to apply. I will start as an analyst ofcourse. Pros: more colleagues to learn from (I think 25 colleagues is a nice team size) and working on very nice buy-side projects. The fund is very active at the moment. Furthermore, probably better exit options (known name in the market) and growth path inside the company. However: exit options maybe limited compared with next option (3), not sure about this?

Cons: i) maybe less optimal work-life balance, ii) maybe less inspiring work at the start of this job as analyst, iii) other cons?


3. Applying for a M&amp;A traineeship for the advisory branche of a Big 4 accoutancy firm. With this programme you can work at 4 different M&amp;A departments during 2 years (Valuations, Corporate Finance, FDD, Restructuring, etc.).  I was an intern at one of the departments during my studies. The people that work here are likeable and of all ages. The whole M&amp;A practice has over 250 colleagues, and each department has around 40 people. Pros: clear internal growth path and learning curve and working with young, like-minded people. After COVID more social events probably than the other options. Another pro: famous big 4 name, good on CV and for exit options probably (or is Private Equity higher valued on CV at exit?)

Cons: i) you are 1 of many, not really special as employee, ii) if I maybe would like to exit to PE I will probably again start as an analyst and maybe 'lost' 1 or 2 years during this traineeship, and iii) maybe I do not get the most responsiblity, because I will only work for 6 months at the department and there are a lot of people above you (senior, manager, partner, etc.).


What would you advice me and do you have any other pros or cons for these options? Or maybe another option/job I missed here? Thank you in advance! 


TLDR: start working at a Corporate Finance Boutique, Private Equity house or M&amp;A traineeship at big4?"

Our Key Goals
As you can see from our roadmap (available here) we’ve already developed a lot of initial features on the platform, in a short space of time.

But, here are some of our key longer-term goals, the first we have already completed.

Auto-Compounding Yield Farm (The Zoo) ✔️
• An evolution on the first farms and we are utilizing other protocols (Venus Protocol) to generate yield. For more information, see our gitbook
• A portion of profits are used to buyback and burn APE
• The next addition on this will be utilizing PancakeSwap LP’s for higher APR

Charitable NFTs
• We will be releasing NFTs with utility, but the key aspect here is that 50% of the proceeds will be burnt and the other 50% donated to charity
• This will all be done ON-CHAIN so the community will be able to see exactly which charity their funds go to
• For more information, see our “Sanctuary” page

Dual-sided Gambling Engine
• Gambling game engine that will allow players to stake on the “house” side or play against the “house”

APE Investment Fund
• A community-governed investment fund where some of the profits are used to buyback and burn APE

Security
If you’re familiar with BSC Yield Farming, then you’re probably no stranger to scams and rug pulls.

First of all, our contracts are forked from highly reputable and heavily audited projects to give our community the initial peace of mind.

Currently, we are exploring audit options and are in talks with multiple popular auditors to give the community what they want, trust and transparency.

But the primary thing that allowed these rug pulls to happen was the “migrator code” which has been fully REMOVED from the APE Finance smart contracts.

If you’re familiar with BSC Yield Farming, then you’re probably no stranger to scams and rug pulls.

First of all, our contracts are forked from highly reputable and heavily audited projects to give our community the initial peace of mind.

Currently, we are exploring audit options and are in talks with multiple popular auditors to give the community what they want, trust and transparency.

But the primary thing that allowed these rug pulls to happen was the “migrator code” which has been fully REMOVED from the APE Finance smart contracts.

The hot topic in the crypto space currently is chasing the highest yields. But inevitably that has brought in scams and masked ponzi schemes.

But we decided it’s time for change, we want transparency and trust put back into crypto. We want to innovate and push the development boundaries on BSC.

What is APE Finance?

APE finance isn’t just one thing, it’s a transparent platform built for the community.

The platform will be a way for you to generate passive income, manage active investments, donate to charities, or even gamble your money away.

The choice is yours!

Tokenomics

What we are trying to do is create a unique ecosystem that contains a perpetual deflation token to act as the primary currency (APE) alongside a fixed supply asset to be the backbone of the platform (BANANA).

This ensures a price floor can be maintained by utilizing a fundamentally strong burn mechanism, which you can see more details of further below.

APE
Contract address: 0x05e50f47eC38dB5eEEE4beDE36792B5a5C6f3E0a

Chain: Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20)

Supply: Unlimited (emission-based)

Emmisison: 1 APE/block (~28,800 Ape/day)

10% will be sent to the developer’s address for further partnership &amp; development funds.

Chain: Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20)

Supply: 10,000

Emission: 0 BANANA/block

Price

Supply bonded curve pricing. For every banana that is purchased the price will go up. Even for fraction of a banana.

90% of the ape will be burned and 10% will go to the treasury on mint.

Our Key Goals
As you can see from our roadmap (available here) we’ve already developed a lot of initial features on the platform, in a short space of time.

But, here are some of our key longer-term goals, the first we have already completed.

Auto-Compounding Yield Farm (The Zoo) ✔️
• An evolution on the first farms and we are utilizing other protocols (Venus Protocol) to generate yield. For more information, see our gitbook
• A portion of profits are used to buyback and burn APE
• The next addition on this will be utilizing PancakeSwap LP’s for higher APR

Charitable NFTs
• We will be releasing NFTs with utility, but the key aspect here is that 50% of the proceeds will be burnt and the other 50% donated to charity
• This will all be done ON-CHAIN so the community will be able to see exactly which charity their funds go to

Yeah, probably some people still have FUD due to past CDC actions, but I think most of them just never heard about [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), or they've heard, but never bothered to try it out. So I've been thinking, probably besides [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) there are a lot of other cool projects that I've never heard of, and there are good deals I'm mission out right now.

Let's share what everyone's using. Let's skip huge projects like Binance or Coinbase, everyone knows them well, and please remember, that referral links are not allowed by the sub rules.

I'll start with a small list:

1. Revolut. It's popular in Europe, probably less known in the US. It's like a fiat version of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) \- a neat app which allows to exchange currencies at the best possible rates (good for travelling), take loans, buy stocks, buy crypto (not real crypto, you do not have keys and you can't even transfer the coins to the different exchange, but at least it's super easy and is a good introductory app for someone new to crypto).
2. Curve. Probably everyone knows it, but I've learned about it at this sub. It's a card which allows you to aggregate all your other cards inside. It's a good combo with [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) as it allows to use Google Pay / Apple Pay and adds some additional cashback.
3. OSOM Finance. I can bet no one has ever heard about them. It's a poor version of [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), they want to do the same, but do it much worse. But the killer feature they have is Autopilot, it's an ML solution, which takes your bitcoins, distributes it among promising altcoins and rebalances the buckets from time to time in order to maximize the bitcoin gains. It works really well when bitcoin trades sideways. For example, in last 3 months it generated +55% in bitcoin (or +604% in EUR). But it depends on the point of entry. In my case, I really hated Autopilot for long time, I've invested into it in August, just before the rally, and during the rally my investment dipped up to -45%. Nevertheless, currently it recovered completely and I have +17.44%"

15-20% of the circulating supply has now been bought up in the last few days. MP3 haven't started their marketing and I've not seen anything on Reddit about it. That means this is some organic buying and growth.

This is one I am going to bottom drawer for 12 months.  I missed Audius which went from 2c to $3.29 in &lt;12 months so hoping to catch some luck here. Links in the original post above.

This is whole document is a TL;DR on concepts that take years to learn either by practice or by studying. You can only condense a topic so much before important nuances are filtered out. If you can only read 140 characters at a time, it’s fine to break this into bite-sized pieces for yourself, but I’m only serving it, not spoon-feeding it.

Also, this assumes your account has already been flagged PDT (Pattern Day Trader, required account balance of $25k). You don’t have to day trade positions (open and close a position on the same day), but being able to flip in and out of something within a few moments allows you to capitalize on sudden opportunities and greatly reduces your exposure to risk if you decide not to hold overnight. The game is already stacked against you, use caution if you sit at the table without a large enough bankroll.

In order to create an effective hedge (delta, theta, or otherwise) assumes you are keeping up to date with your portfolio and are able to trade at least daily to manage the changes. This isn’t buy and hold. There are ETFs for that which will generate respectable returns instead. **YOU WILL LOSE MONEY.** There will be trades that go against you, you’ll close out of positions early, you’ll let positions stay open too long. Something will happen and **YOU WILL LOSE MONEY**. However, ideally you learn to manage risk effectively enough to A) prevent blowing up your portfolio / declaring bankruptcy and B) can hang around long enough to learn the ropes and actually make some coin.

**Terms:**

*Underlying*: This is the price of stock. TSLA, RKT, DASH, PRPL, USO, etc. Use a ticker of your choice when you see this word.

*Positions*: I use this term to describe a series of contracts on an underlying. A position, may be singular and mean an individual leg in general, or but more specifically relates to the group of contracts, or a position, on an underlying stock that generates net values to be managed through trading contracts related to the underlying stock.

*OTM/ATM/ITM*: Out of the Money, underlying less (greater for put) than strike. At the Money, strike and underlying are equal. In the Money, underlying is greater (less for put) than strike.

*DTE*: Days to expiry. 0DTE means contract expires today. 1DTE means it expires tomorrow, 90DTE means it expires in 90 calendar days.

*IV*: Implied volatility, or the potential change in the price of the underlying. Higher IV means greater chance for large price swings, low IV means low chance for large price swings. Historical Volatility (HV) is important, but is not discussed here.

*OI*: Open Interest, or how many contracts are currently open. There’s always two sides to a contract, so OI alone isn’t necessarily significant, but seeing large OI values could indicate that options on the underlying are actively traded, helping to reduce potential liquidity risks, or the ability to sell for a desired price at a given moment.

*DivEx* – Ex-Dividend Date, the date after which the dividend distribution has already been removed from the price of the underlying.

*Long:* To open a position by buying, which requires a closing selling order. While you can be “short” a stock, or anticipating a decline in the price, by buying puts, opening the position though buying a put would be a “long position”.

*Short:* To open a position by selling, which requires a closing buying order. Similar to above, you can be “long” a stock, or expecting the price to increase, but hold a short position, such as by selling puts.

*Premium:* The value of the contract, made up of the Intrinsic Value and the Extrinsic Value.

*Intrinsic Value:* The difference the strike and the price of the underlying for an ITM contract. If a contract is $5 in-the-money, then it will have approximately $5 of Intrinsic Value.

*Extrinsic Value:* The remaining value of the contract made up of Time Value and Implied Volatility. A contract with high IV and a 90DTE will have a higher extrinsic value than a contract with either a lower IV or closer to expiry. If a contract is out of the money, then the price will only be made up of the Extrinsic Value.

*X-Bagger*: This means a *gain* of at least 100%. A 1-Bagger would mean if you spent $100 to open the trade, you closed it for $200, netting $100 *profit*. So a 10-Bagger would be 1000% *gain*, or spending $100 to open, selling for $1,100 and netting $1,000 in profit (cost to open – cost to close = profit or loss).

**The Greeks**

***Delta (Δ)*** – Change in price of contracts with $1 change in underlying. This is the 1st derivative of the price of the underlying. Delta is impacted by price of the underlying, strike price of the contract, IV, and time to expiry (and technically, interest rate and dividend, but their contribution is miniscule). Of the Greeks, this is the most important. Even “Theta Gang” uses delta to determine their own strategies.

If $TSLA is at $630, and goes up by $1 to $631, then the TSLA 3/26 650C with a delta of .34 will go up by .34 cents (or $34 dollars, if considering the actual value). As the contract moves to ATM, this will usually be near .50 (50%). As it goes deeper ITM, it will approach 1.00 (usually .99 is the most, but point remains). As it goes further OTM, the delta will approach 0.00. Delta can also be a “rough” estimation of the probability that the contract expires OTM vs ITM. A .50 delta means that at the moment, a contract may have a 50% chance of expiring ATM. 

A delta of .01 is equal to 1 share long. A delta of -.01 is equal to 1 share short. If a contract has a delta of .50, then it has the equivalent impact of 50 shares long on an overall position. As delta increases due to a contract being both ITM and near expiry, a .99 delta would be the equivalent of 99 shares, or almost the full lot (100 shares) that each contract represents. For purposes of calculating cumulative delta, if you have 1 contract with a delta of .50, then a position may be hedge by shorting 50 shares. 2 contracts would be 100 shares, 10 contracts would be require 500 shares short to maintain a neutral “0” delta. This is important for determining Net Delta of a position or portfolio, which will be discussed further.

**Gamma (Γ)** – The change in the delta, based on a $1 change in the underlying. This is the 2nd derivative of the price of the underlying.

If TSLA 3/26 650C has a delta of .34, and a gamma of .05, then as TSLA moves from $630 to $631, then the delta will increase by .05 and be .39. This means that if a contract was $1 when TSLA was $630, and became $1.34, then when TSLA hits $632, the contract will gain an additional $.39 of value and become $1.73. Gamma has slope that is defined by the next term, Vega, however unlike delta, which has a range from 0 to 1, gamma tends to peak when the delta is near .5 (50%) and then declines, as the growth in delta approaches 0 or 1.

Gamma plays an important role in determining the next movement of delta. While delta may be near 0, a sudden spike in gamma, caused by the hedging of shares and contracts can cause delta to spike unexpectedly, resulting in a recursive event as contracts in other parts of the option chain similarly experience volatility in their respective gamma and delta values. When gamma spikes, resulting in a higher delta, this can require that shares be bought to offset any delta exposure by market makers. As these shares are purchased, this can create additional buying, and as the price increases, force further buying as strikes higher up the option chain see increasing gamma and delta values. As this continues, a squeeze can occur until volatility stabilizes. Although rare, gamma squeezes do occur, however are nearly impossible to time in any way to capitalize on them as an ongoing strategy. Candidates for these events usually occur near expiry as the delta is already depressed on OTM contracts but with a sufficiently high enough OI that additional hedging may be momentarily required. A sudden large purchase of shares or contracts may force additional shares to be purchased as the delta on a contract or series of contracts move from .0001 (less than 1 share) to .30 (30 shares). Depending on the OI and volume of the strike, this could be enough to momentarily make an OTM contract turn ITM long enough to capitalize on the sudden volatility. In very unique circumstances a complete option chain may go ITM, resulting in the equivalent of a slot machine going full tilt.

***Vega (ν)*** \- Vega is the measured rate at which gamma changes moment to moment based on the price of the underlying. As a contract moves from deep OTM to ATM, the Vega will move from near 0 to a peak before diminishing to near 0, similar to a bell curve. However IV is critical, as a higher IV will cause Vega to begin rising sooner, leading to increasing an impact on the gamma of the contract at this strike and those adjacent. (Also vega isn’t a letter in the Greek alphabet, so “V” is the symbol I suppose)

A thinly traded underlying with wide strikes ($2.50 gaps (10, 12.5, 15), will not see the Vega value increase until the next strike is almost ATM. However very actively traded tickers, like $TSLA (pre-split), with $5 gaps (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000) would see vega impacted much earlier as lower strikes began turning from OTM to ITM. Ultimately, in order to capitalize on vega, finding and underlying with the right IV, strikes, and expiries is crucial.

***Theta (τ)*** – Time decay. Everyone’s favorite bad guy. “Tick tock” is the sound of money when you’re positive theta, and the sound of pain when you’re negative. Easy to mitigate, just takes some understanding of its dynamics.

When you see a Theta value, treat that as the value the contract will lose over the next day. Theta is a near term issue, meaning that only as expiry approaches does theta increase. On a LEAP theta will be nearly 0.0001, meaning the value may decline by a literal penny. On a 1DTE FD, theta will be nearly the entire price of the contract (less the extrinsic value (ITM)). So if a 1DTE TSLA 650C is selling for $7.60 at 3:59pm, then the theta will likely be around 7.59, meaning that the value of that contract will be worth $.01 in 24 hours if it remains OTM.

“Theta gang” and any similar term relates to traders that tend to hold net positive theta positions by selling options, a short position. So as time decay saps away at a call, that decay is turning into profit for the “theta gang”. 

***Rho (ρ)***: Of all the Greeks, this one is perhaps the most neglected, and duly so in a zero-rate environment, but still needs to be mentioned. Rho relates to amount that the contract will change based on a 1% move in the risk-free rate (US 10-year Treasuries, usually). It also represents the impact due to dividends. Rho tends to be positive for long calls and negative for long puts, and larger DTE will generate a higher value, but otherwise, this is usually not considered for trading strategies. Potentially LEAPs may be impacted, should a special dividend be announced, or some sudden upswing in rates, but both events are sufficiently unlikely and the impact relatively negligible.

***Alpha (α)*** Technically not one of “The Greeks”, but it’s still an important metric that determines the difference between your gains and that of the market. If you’re consistently generating negative alpha, you may want to consider just putting everything in an S&amp;P 500 ETF. Nothing to be ashamed of, as at least you’ll generate more growth over time than leaving it in a savings account or consistently losing it. Positive alpha generally means profit/gains.

**Beta (β)**: All jokes aside, this is how closely your portfolio (or a security) tracks the market. If it goes up 1% when the market goes up 1%, Beta is close to 1. If it goes down 1%, Beta is -1. It’s helpful to know this, but not really impactful to this discussion.

Other “Greek” values such as Vanna and Vomma exist, but are outside the scope for this discussion. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))

**Risks:**

*Price Risk*: What happens if the price of the underlying changes? If I’m long a position (net positive delta), what occurs if the price moves against me. If I’m short a position (net negative delta), what happens then?

*Time Risk*: How long can I wait for something to happen? Tick tock, tick tock. Sitting on a negative theta position is uncomfortable. Cushion it with a positive theta offset.

*Volatility Risk*: What happens if there is less trading, or new information is made public? “IV Crush”, or a drop in IV after earnings is a prime example. If you hold long through earnings, unless the contract goes ITM, the value will drop as IV tends to do after important events. What happens if a bunch of memes are made about one and it shoots through the roof? Let’s hope you’re long vol and don’t need to buy any shorts back until IV settles down again.

*Liquidity Risk*: “Can I sell this contract”, and, “Is the Bid/Ask narrow enough to ensure profit?” If the option chain only has a couple dozen contracts being traded, you may have trouble closing the position without accepting a terrible bid/ask. Similarly, if there’s only a few contracts, the IV is probably insufficient and a better trade likely exists.

*Carrying Risk*: What happens if I carry this position overnight or for an extended period? Larger macro events now need to be considered. A short term position, opened on Friday, is exposed to a large unknown over the weekends when markets are closed and exposure cannot be adjusted. It’s a risk that can be hedged with another position or eliminated by closing the trade before 4:00pm.

As I’m typing this, the Suez Canal is blocked. Anyone that rolled their March monthlies to April had no way of knowing that a week later a major event occur with unknown effects yet to ripple through the global economy. While the long term carrying risk of a USO 01/2023 LEAP may be nothing, short term, this may dramatically impact the price, potentially causing margin calls if improperly leveraged.

*Opportunity Risk*: “Is this really the best trade for this time?” Is there any worse feeling that opening a position, only to watch something else you were considering go up? Then you sell out of your current trade and FOMO into the other one, only to watch the new one drill to new depths, while your original trade would have been a 10-bagger. No one can predict the market, but it’s tempting and easy to overtrade. Trade for a purpose, don’t just buy a call and “hope” it goes up. Is there a catalyst? Is something trending? Time is usually not a friend to an option trader, so if you want to just buy something and hope it goes up, there’s better be a reason other than thoughts and prayers.

**Premiums:** **Why ATM doesn’t mean profitable**

If’ you’ve made it this far, hopefully your head doesn’t hurt too much yet. Regardless, there’s this idea that if you go long on a contract, that all you need is for the price of the underlying to hit the strike and money will start printing. While yes, the value of the contract will increase, but you still had to pay to open the position. If theta vampires took their cut over the last 10 days before expiry, you may still be sitting upside down on the position. So before you buy that near-ATM call that’s 90 days out, unless it hits the strike plus the premium, you’re going to lose money. You may think TSLA can hit $1,000 in a year, but if you wanted to buy that call for $130 ($13,000), you’re going to need TSLA to hit $1,130, not just $1,000 by expiry. If it’s sitting at $600 now, that’s not just a 66% gain needed, that’s almost an 88% gain in order to break even.

**Stop Playing Naked:**

I get it, “bets” is in the name of the sub, but there is a time and a place to gamble outright.  “Naked” is when you only take one end of a contract, such as only buying a call without selling one further up the option chain and creating a spread. We live in a zero-commission environment, and even at $.50-$.75 per contract, the only reason to play naked is when you’re playing with house money with zero risk of loss of your own capital. Otherwise, risk management is the strategy that will allow you to generate positive alpha over time, even with the occasional YOLO.

**% is Better than $**

Sure, loss porn in excess of $10k is amazing schadenfreude. And seeing someone nail a lucky scratcher for a cool mil is really great, bless their hearts. But probability is definitely a thing, and statistically we’re more likely to lose money on a position than make money. But if you can minimize the cost of opening a position, you become less reliant on needing every trade to be a massive winner.

For example, I may think that TSLA, currently sitting at $600, can easily get to $650 in the next week (7 days), as we’ve repeatedly seen 10% swings over a couple of days in the past. However, I may not be as confident that it’ll hit $675, so I’ll open a debit call spread. In this scenario, the TSLA $650 expiring next Friday is $36 and the $675 is $24.

Instead of risking $3,600 for the $650 contract alone, I’ll buy the contract for $36, then sell the $675 for $24, requiring only $1,200 to open the open the position. Referring to the earlier point, if I only bought a naked call, then I need TSLA to hit $686 ($650 + $36) to break even. However if I opened a spread, then I’ll be profitable at $662 ($650 + $12).

Let’s say there’s 50% chance TSLA goes up to at least $650 and a 50% chance it goes below $600. If it goes down, I lose $1,200 on the spread or $3,600 on the naked call. If it goes up, I subsequently still need it to hit $662 to be profitable, a little less than 2% above the strike, but still a lower probability of occurring than just hitting $650.

Example:

$550 &lt;- 50% -&gt; $600 &lt;- 50% -&gt; $650+

$600 &lt;- 65% -&gt; $662 &lt;- 35% -&gt; $663+

$600 &lt;- 85% -&gt; $686 &lt;- 15% -&gt; $687+

$600 &lt;- 99% -&gt; $699 &lt;- 1% -&gt; $700+

If I don’t have that spread, sure, my gains could be unlimited, but I still need it to go up 5.5% more from $650 to $686 to just break even. Let’s assume that it closed at $686. While the gain on the spread would be capped at $2,500, netting $1,300 in profit, the naked call closes with a net of $0. The probability of success is higher with a spread hitting $662 than a naked call hitting than hitting $686. In order for the naked call to net the same $1,300 in profit as the spread, you’d need TSLA to close at $699 ($650 + $36 + $13). Oh, and if you don’t get a 14.3% pop ($600 to $686) in the next week, you lose the full $3,600 it cost you for the naked call.

So we all got lucky and TSLA hit $699 and you made $1,300 on your naked call that cost $3,600 to open. That’s a return of 36%, not bad. Meanwhile, on the spread, it cost $1,200 to open and you netted $1,300, so your return was 108% In theory, you could’ve opened 3 spreads, netted $3,900 more easily than working for $1,300 on one naked call.

I hear you saying, yeah, but what if it went to $750? I could net $6,400 ($750 - $686) in profit, but be stuck at $1,300 on the other trade. True. But you could also use the remaining $2,400 ($3,600 vs $1,200) that you didn’t tie up on the naked call to open new positions at $700, $725, or other strikes, once it seems likely that the stock is gonna take off. No one is going to prevent you from opening another trade unless you don’t have the money. And frankly with theta feasting on these near expiry calls, that $700 may have dropped enough that the risk of a naked call is only a couple hundred bucks, instead what it cost a few days earlier.

We can agree that this is gambling, but understanding risk will earn higher rewards over time.

**Black Scholes Merton Is Useful, but with Limits:**

Option pricing models tend to focus on either the binomial model or the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model. While binomial is viewed as rudimentary, it’s helpful to understand as it breaks out the pricing based on discreet moments in time, whereas BSM tends to perform the pricing in a black box that can make it more difficult to understand how the price of an option changes moment to moment. While a view of the price change over time can be useful, most trading decisions don’t require knowledge of the price at the Nth moment in time and require that all other variables remain constant, such as IV. Apart from being able to determine price without considering iterative changes, the benefit of BSM is that the calculations performed help to generate The Greeks. From this, a generally accepted measure of option pricing, you can begin to determine your exposure to delta and theta within a position or portfolio.

However, BSM is dependent upon a normal distribution of probabilities, a bell curve. Unfortunately, reality doesn’t fit neatly into a normal distribution, so while BSM can provide a snapshot of a price, understanding the impact of the price over time is a different exercise. Additionally, while more responsive models exist and measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) are utilized to help understand how unexpected occurrences can impact a portfolio at a given moment, these topics are beyond the level of this discussion and exceeds the necessity of a trader reading this on social media platform.

**Understanding how to Control Portfolio Risk with Delta and Theta**

Still with me? Good, almost done.

So at this point you’ve opened up a bunch of different positions because you read some DD on a subreddit and the post had the requisite number of rocket ship emojis to convince you to mash the “Buy” button and separate you from your hard earned money. However each day, your portfolio gets more and more crimson-colored, and you curse those theta-devils and wish you knew how they do the voodoo that they do so well.

As was mentioned earlier, buying a call or put with create positive or negative delta, respectively. Selling a call will then create negative delta and selling a put will create positive delta. Since delta of a near-ATM contract is close to .50 you might think that buying a put and a call at the same strike will negate any price change and generate alpha. While yes, something would likely expire ITM, you’ll lose money through time decay and premiums.

More specifically, there’s an underlying theory known as Put/Call Parity:

(Call price + PV of Strike\*) = (Put price + Stock price)

*\*For the purposes of this discussion, since it seems the average DTE is 45 days or less, PV (Present Value) is essentially the current strike price.* *Don’t hurt your head trying to discount it based on the risk free rate.* *It may mean something for a LEAP, but with low rates, the discount is still negligible.*

The price of the call and strike should equal the price of the put plus the current stock price. However, the delta of the call might be .80, the delta of the put could be -.19. This is important when hedging as simply buying a call and a put at the same strike does not necessarily give the position a neutral (“0”) delta. Instead, the position will see net $.61 gain (.80 + -.19) with a $1 increase in the underlying versus a -$.61 loss with a $1 decline. So to create a neutral delta position, roughly 4 naked puts would be needed to offset the delta of 1 naked call (.80 / .19 = 4.21). Similarly, one could create a delta neutral position by buying 1 call with a delta of .80 and shorting 80 shares, but unless you are able to negate wash sales, buying and selling shares repeatedly to hedge will negatively impact your returns. Using weekly contracts can permit you to trade sufficiently different securities to avoid many wash sale occurrences. While this delta-neutral position would mitigate losses from a stock moving up or down, the cost would be excessive in terms of premium, and loss due to time decay would make this an almost certain loss unless the price could change enough to offset the premiums of both contracts.

However, as discussed, time and price (strike and stock) are crucial to the delta value. If attempting to hedge, you may have a bullish feeling, anticipating price improvement over the next week, so opening a debit call spread would generate positive delta in the portfolio, generating gains should the price improve. Similarly, opening a put position would create negative delta. Since the put position is serving a purpose of reducing down-side exposure (an insurance policy), theta will sip from the position, unless a spread can be opened to help offset the decay. A balance is needed between the reduction in delta cause by opening a debit put spread to offset net delta in a portfolio, and offsetting theta to prevent loss should the market turn or move sideways. From this point, it becomes vital to understand how a series of spreads with varying strikes and expiries can affect both the net delta and theta. Focusing only on theta could leave you with ITM short positions that cost more to close than you receive when opening. Zoning in only on delta will leave you bleeding out slowly at first then much more rapidly before expiry.

So how do you successfully hedge? Well, like with anything else, being prepared is crucial. Personally, one of my favorite positions is the 2-to-1 long butterfly. A long butterfly is opening a combination of spreads where a call (or put) is bought, two calls are sold at a higher (lower) strike, and another call is purchased at another higher strike (1 – 2 – 1). A short butterfly would be the same thing, but with two long contracts flanked by a short contract at higher and lower strikes. A butterfly can also be considered a combination of two spreads, a debit and a credit spread. The 2-to-1 means that the gap between the first long leg and short leg (the debit spread) has a gap twice as large as the short leg and the second long leg (the credit spread). Reduces the cost to open the position greatly (risk), while also creating a near neutral delta with a slightly negative theta. If the underlying expires just below the short legs, then max profit is hit, but even if it blows through, the second long leg is close enough to lock in a respectable gain, particularly on such a nominal amount to open the position.

If I open a 650/660/665 butterfly and the cost is $2/-$1/$.5 respectively, then it’ll cost me $.50 ($2 + (-$1 x 2) + $.50) to open the position, with a max gain of around $1000 at $659.99, and a minimum gain of around $500 at least if it pushes through $660. Oh and the break even is at $650.50, so going back above, if there was a 50% chance that $650 was hit, getting to $650.50 is like a 49% chance (compared to $662 or $686). And if it doesn’t hit, the loss is $50. Fifty dollars. Not $1,200, not $3,600. 5 $10 bills. I can’t go out for a beer for less than $50. Additionally, the delta of this will be nearly 0, and theta will be only slightly negative up until nearly expiry, and as long as you close your position by 3:59pm on Friday before expiry, you don’t even need to babysit this much.

**Let the Sunshine In**

One of the underlying benefits to managing your positions with an understanding of both delta and theta, is that as the market changes, you can increase or reduce your exposure. Should a bit of good news be announced, the net delta of a position can be “opened up” or increased to permit gains due to upward price movement of the underlying. Should unexpected clouds appear, net delta can be reduced or even made negative to help mitigate risk or capitalize on any market declines.

As much as we’d like to move markets, we're small fish in a huuuuge pond.  The only way we as individual traders can survive is if we’re operating with a similar amount of knowledge. I think there’s a lot of volatility on the horizon, but I’m not sure which way it’s going to go or when it's going to happen. Frankly I’m not too concerned either way, as I tend to keep my positions at relatively low risk. I’m shooting for a steady gain, or at least enough to break even and keep playing. I’m not expecting to hit a home run at each at bat, just trying to get on base.

This is whole post is a TL;DR on concepts that take years to learn either by practice or by studying. You can only condense a topic so much before important nuances are filtered out. If you can only read 140 characters at a time, it’s fine to break this into bite-sized pieces for yourself, but I’m only serving it, not spoon-feeding it.

Also, this assumes your account has already been flagged PDT (Pattern Day Trader, required account balance of $25k). You don’t have to day trade positions (open and close a position on the same day), but being able to flip in and out of something within a few moments allows you to capitalize on sudden opportunities and greatly reduces your exposure to risk if you decide not to hold overnight. The game is already stacked against you, use caution if you sit at the table without a large enough bankroll.

In order to create an effective hedge (delta, theta, or otherwise) assumes you are keeping up to date with your portfolio and are able to trade at least daily to manage the changes. This isn’t buy and hold. There are ETFs for that which will generate respectable returns instead. **YOU WILL LOSE MONEY.** There will be trades that go against you, you’ll close out of positions early, and you’ll let positions stay open too long. Something will happen and **YOU WILL LOSE MONEY**. However, ideally you learn to manage risk effectively enough to A) prevent blowing up your portfolio / declaring bankruptcy and B) can hang around long enough to learn the ropes and actually make some coin.

**Terms:**

*Underlying*: This is the price of stock. TSLA, RKT, DASH, PRPL, USO, etc. Use a ticker of your choice when you see this word.

*Positions*: I use this term to describe a series of contracts on an underlying. A position, may be singular and mean an individual leg in general, or but more specifically relates to the group of contracts, or a position, on an underlying stock that generates net values to be managed through trading contracts.

*OTM/ATM/ITM*: Out of the Money, underlying less (greater for put) than strike. At the Money, strike and underlying are equal. In the Money, underlying is greater (less for put) than strike.

*DTE*: Days to expiry. 0DTE means contract expires today. 1DTE means it expires tomorrow, 90DTE means it expires in 90 calendar days.

*IV*: Implied volatility, or the potential change in the price of the underlying. Higher IV means greater chance for large price swings, low IV means low chance for large price swings. Historical Volatility (HV) is important, but is not discussed here.

*OI*: Open Interest, or how many contracts are currently open. There’s always two sides to a contract, so OI alone isn’t necessarily significant, but seeing large OI values could indicate that options on the underlying are actively traded, helping to reduce potential liquidity risks, or the ability to sell for a desired price at a given moment.

*Long:* To open a position by buying, which requires a closing selling order. While you can be “short” a stock, or anticipating a decline in the price, by buying puts, opening the position though buying a put would be a “long position”.

*Short:* To open a position by selling, which requires a closing buying order. Similar to above, you can be “long” a stock, or expecting the price to increase, but hold a short position, such as by selling puts.

*Premium:* The value of the contract, made up of the Intrinsic Value and the Extrinsic Value.

*Intrinsic Value:* The difference the strike and the price of the underlying for an ITM contract. If a contract is $5 in-the-money, then it will have approximately $5 of Intrinsic Value.

*Extrinsic Value:* The remaining value of the contract made up of Time Value and Implied Volatility. A contract with high IV and a 90DTE will have a higher extrinsic value than a contract with either a lower IV or closer to expiry. If a contract is out of the money, then the price will only be made up of the Extrinsic Value.

*LEAPs*: A contract with a DTE greater than 365 days. Long-term capital gains tax rate, yo!

*X-Bagger*: This means a *gain* of at least 100%. A 1-Bagger would mean if you spent $100 to open the trade, you closed it for $200, netting $100 *profit*. So a 10-Bagger would be 1000% *gain*, or spending $100 to open, selling for $1,100 and netting $1,000 in profit (cost to open – cost to close = profit or loss).

**The Greeks**

***Delta (Δ)*** – Delta is the 1st derivative of the price of the underlying, and represents the rate of change in price of contracts with $1 change in underlying. This value is impacted by price of the underlying, strike price of the contract, IV, and time to expiry (and technically, interest rate and dividend, but their contribution is miniscule). Of the Greeks, Delta is the most important. Even “Theta Gang” uses delta to determine their own strategies.

If $TSLA is at $630, and goes up by $1 to $631, then the TSLA 3/26 650C with a delta of .34 will go up by .34 cents (or $34 dollars, if considering the actual value). As the contract moves to ATM, this will usually be near .50 (50%). As it goes deeper ITM, it will approach 1.00 (usually .99 is the most, but point remains). As it goes further OTM, the delta will approach 0.00. Delta can also be a “rough” estimation of the probability that the contract expires OTM vs ITM. A .50 delta means that at the moment, a contract may have a 50% chance of expiring ATM, but this rarely holds through expiry.

In the context of hedging, a delta of .01 is equal to 1 share long. A delta of -.01 is equal to 1 share short. If a contract has a delta of .50, then it has the equivalent impact of 50 shares long on an overall position. As delta increases due to a contract being both ITM and near expiry, a .99 delta would be the equivalent of 99 shares, or almost the full lot (100 shares) that each contract represents. For purposes of calculating cumulative delta, if you have 1 contract with a delta of .50, then a position may be hedge by shorting 50 shares. 2 contracts would be 100 shares, 10 contracts would be require 500 shares short to maintain a neutral “0” delta. This is important for determining Net Delta of a position or portfolio, which will be discussed further.

**Gamma (Γ)** – The change in the delta, based on a $1 change in the underlying. This is the 2nd derivative of the price of the underlying.

If TSLA 3/26 650C has a delta of .34, and a gamma of .05, then as TSLA moves from $630 to $631, then the delta will increase by .05 and be .39 in the next moment. This means that if a contract was $1 when TSLA was $630, and became $1.34, then when TSLA hits $632, the contract will gain an additional $.05 of value and become $1.39. Gamma has a slope that is defined by the next term, vega, however unlike delta, which has a range from 0 to 1, gamma tends to peak when the delta is near .5 (50%) and then declines, as the growth in delta approaches 0 or 1.

Gamma plays an important role in determining the next movement of delta. While delta may be near 0, a sudden spike in gamma, caused by the hedging of shares and contracts can cause delta to spike unexpectedly, resulting in a recursive event as contracts in other parts of the option chain similarly experience volatility in their respective gamma and delta values. When gamma spikes, resulting in a higher delta, this can require that shares be bought to offset any delta exposure by market makers. As these shares are purchased, this can create additional buying, and as the price increases, force further buying as strikes higher up the option chain see increasing gamma and delta values. As this continues, a squeeze can occur until volatility stabilizes. Although rare, gamma squeezes do occur, however are nearly impossible to time in any way to capitalize on them as an ongoing strategy. Candidates for these events usually occur near expiry as the delta is already depressed on OTM contracts but with a sufficiently high enough OI that additional hedging may be momentarily required. A sudden large purchase of shares or contracts may force additional shares to be purchased as the delta on a contract or series of contracts move from .0001 (less than 1 share) to .30 (30 shares). Depending on the OI and volume of the strike, this could be enough to momentarily make an OTM contract turn ITM long enough to capitalize on the sudden volatility. In very unique circumstances a complete option chain may go ITM, resulting in the equivalent of a slot machine going full tilt.

***Vega (ν)*** \- Vega is the measured rate at which gamma changes moment to moment based on the price of the underlying. As a contract moves from deep OTM to ATM, the Vega will move from near 0 to a peak before diminishing to near 0, similar to a bell curve. However IV is critical, as a higher IV will cause Vega to begin rising sooner, leading to increasing an impact on the gamma of the contract at this strike and those adjacent. (Also vega isn’t a letter in the Greek alphabet, so “V” is the symbol I suppose)

A thinly traded underlying with wide strikes ($2.50 gaps (10, 12.5, 15), will not see the vega value increase significantly until the next strike is almost ATM. However very actively traded tickers, like $TSLA (pre-split), with $5 gaps (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000) would see vega impacted much earlier as lower strikes began turning from OTM to ITM. Ultimately, in order to capitalize on vega, finding and underlying with the right IV, strikes, and expiries is crucial.

***Theta (τ)*** – Time decay. Everyone’s favorite bad guy. “Tick tock” is the sound of money when you’re positive theta, and the sound of pain when you’re negative. Easy to mitigate, just takes some understanding of its dynamics.

When you see a Theta value, treat that as the value the contract will lose over the next day. Theta is a near term issue, meaning that only as expiry approaches does theta increase. On a LEAP theta will be nearly 0.0001, meaning the value may decline by a literal penny. On a 1DTE FD, theta will be nearly the entire price of the contract (less the extrinsic value (ITM)). So if a 1DTE TSLA 650C is selling for $7.60 at 3:59pm, then the theta will likely be around 7.59, meaning that the value of that contract will be worth $.01 in 24 hours if it remains OTM.

“Theta gang” and any similar term relates to traders that tend to hold net positive theta positions by selling options, a short position. So as time decay saps away at a call, that decay is turning into profit for the “theta gang”. 

***Rho (ρ)***: Of all the Greeks, this one is perhaps the most neglected, and duly so in a zero-rate environment, but still needs to be mentioned. Rho relates to amount that the contract will change based on a 1% move in the risk-free rate (US 10-year Treasuries, usually). It also represents the impact due to dividends. Rho tends to be positive for long calls and negative for long puts, and larger DTE will generate a higher value, but otherwise, this is usually not considered for trading strategies. Potentially LEAPs may be impacted, should a special dividend be announced, or some sudden upswing in rates, but both events are sufficiently unlikely and the impact relatively negligible.

***Alpha (α)***:  Technically not one of “The Greeks”, but it’s still an important metric that determines the difference between your gains and that of the market. If you’re consistently generating negative alpha, you may want to consider just putting everything in an S&amp;P 500 ETF. Nothing to be ashamed of, as at least you’ll generate more growth over time than leaving it in a savings account or consistently losing it. Positive alpha generally means profit/gains.

**Beta (β)**: All jokes aside, this is how closely your portfolio (or a security) tracks the market. If it goes up 1% when the market goes up 1%, Beta is close to 1. If it goes down 1%, Beta is -1. It’s helpful to know this, but not really impactful to this discussion.

Other “Greek” values such as Vanna and Vomma exist, but are outside the scope for this discussion. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance))

**Risks:**

*Price Risk*: What happens if the price of the underlying changes? If I’m long a position (net positive delta), what occurs if the price moves against me. If I’m short a position (net negative delta), what happens then?

*Time Risk*: How long can I wait for something to happen? Tick tock, tick tock. Sitting on a negative theta position is uncomfortable. Cushion it with a positive theta offset.

*Volatility Risk*: What happens if there is less trading, or new information is made public? “IV Crush”, or a drop in IV after earnings is a prime example. If you hold long through earnings, unless the contract goes ITM, the value will drop as IV tends to do after important events. What happens if a bunch of memes are made about one and it shoots through the roof? Let’s hope you’re long vol and don’t need to buy any shorts back until IV settles down again.

*Liquidity Risk*: “Can I sell this contract”, and, “Is the Bid/Ask narrow enough to ensure profit?” If the option chain only has a couple dozen contracts being traded, you may have trouble closing the position without accepting a terrible bid/ask. Similarly, if there’s only a few contracts, the IV is probably insufficient and a better trade likely exists.

*Carrying Risk*: What happens if I carry this position overnight or for an extended period? Larger macro events now need to be considered. A short term position, opened on Friday, is exposed to a large unknown over the weekends when markets are closed and exposure cannot be adjusted. It’s a risk that can be hedged with another position or eliminated by closing the trade before 4:00pm.

As I’m typing this, the Suez Canal is blocked. Anyone that rolled their March monthlies to April had no way of knowing that a week later a major event occur with unknown effects yet to ripple through the global economy. While the long term carrying risk of a USO 01/2023 LEAP may be nothing, short term, this may dramatically impact the price, potentially causing margin calls if improperly leveraged.

*Opportunity Risk*: “Is this really the best trade for this time?” Is there any worse feeling that opening a position, only to watch something else you were considering go up? Then you sell out of your current trade and FOMO into the other one, only to watch the new one drill to new depths, while your original trade would have been a 10-bagger. No one can predict the market, but it’s tempting and easy to overtrade. Trade for a purpose, don’t just buy a call and “hope” it goes up. Is there a catalyst? Is something trending? Time is usually not a friend to an option trader, so if you want to just buy something and hope it goes up, there’s better be a reason other than thoughts and prayers.

**Premiums:** **Why ATM doesn’t mean profitable**

If you’ve made it this far, hopefully your head doesn’t hurt too much yet. Regardless, there’s this idea that if you go long on a contract, that all you need is for the price of the underlying to hit the strike and money will start printing. While yes, the value of the contract will increase, but you still had to pay to open the position. If theta vampires took their cut over the last 10 days before expiry, you may still be sitting upside down on the position. So before you buy that near-ATM call that’s 90 days out, unless it hits the strike plus the premium, you’re going to lose money. You may think TSLA can hit $1,000 in a year, but if you wanted to buy that call for $130 ($13,000), you’re going to need TSLA to hit $1,130, not just $1,000 by expiry. If it’s sitting at $600 now, that’s not just a 66% gain needed, that’s almost an 88% gain in order to break even.

**Stop Playing Naked:**

I get it, “bets” is in the name of the sub, but there is a time and a place to gamble outright.  “Naked” is when you only take one end of a contract, such as only buying a call without selling one further up the option chain and creating a spread. We live in a zero-commission environment, and even at $.50-$.75 per contract, the only reason to play naked is when you’re playing with house money with zero risk of loss of your own capital. Otherwise, risk management is the strategy that will allow you to generate positive alpha over time, even with the occasional YOLO.

**% is Better than $**

Sure, loss porn in excess of $10k is amazing schadenfreude. And seeing someone nail a lucky scratcher for a cool mil is really great, bless their hearts. But probability is definitely a thing, and statistically we’re more likely to lose money on a position than make money. But if you can minimize the cost of opening a position, you become less reliant on needing every trade to be a massive winner.

For example, I may think that TSLA, currently sitting at $600, can easily get to $650 in the next week (7 days), as we’ve repeatedly seen 10% swings over a couple of days in the past. However, I may not be as confident that it’ll hit $675, so I’ll open a debit call spread. In this scenario, the TSLA $650 expiring next Friday is $36 and the $675 is $24.

Instead of risking $3,600 for the $650 contract alone, I’ll buy the contract for $36, then sell the $675 for $24, requiring only $1,200 to open the open the position. Referring to the earlier point, if I only bought a naked call, then I need TSLA to hit $686 ($650 + $36) to break even. However if I opened a spread, then I’ll be profitable at $662 ($650 + $12).

Let’s say there’s 50% chance TSLA goes up to at least $650 and a 50% chance it goes below $600. If it goes down, I lose $1,200 on the spread or $3,600 on the naked call. If it goes up, I subsequently still need it to hit $662 to be profitable, a little less than 2% above the strike, but still a lower probability of occurring than just hitting $650.

Example:

$550 &lt;- 50% -&gt; $600 &lt;- 50% -&gt; $650+

$600 &lt;- 65% -&gt; $662 &lt;- 35% -&gt; $663+

$600 &lt;- 85% -&gt; $686 &lt;- 15% -&gt; $687+

$600 &lt;- 99% -&gt; $699 &lt;- 1% -&gt; $700+

If I don’t have that spread, sure, my gains could be unlimited, but I still need it to go up 5.5% more from $650 to $686 to just break even. Let’s assume that it closed at $686. While the gain on the spread would be capped at $2,500, netting $1,300 in profit, the naked call closes with a net of $0. The probability of success is higher with a spread hitting $662 than a naked call hitting than hitting $686. In order for the naked call to net the same $1,300 in profit as the spread, you’d need TSLA to close at $699 ($650 + $36 + $13). Oh, and if you don’t get a 14.3% pop ($600 to $686) in the next week, you lose the full $3,600 it cost you for the naked call.

So we all got lucky and TSLA hit $699 and you made $1,300 on your naked call that cost $3,600 to open. That’s a return of 36%, not bad. Meanwhile, on the spread, it cost $1,200 to open and you netted $1,300, so your return was 108% In theory, you could’ve opened 3 spreads, netted $3,900 more easily than working for $1,300 on one naked call.

I hear you saying, yeah, but what if it went to $750? I could net $6,400 ($750 - $686) in profit, but be stuck at $1,300 on the other trade. True. But you could also use the remaining $2,400 ($3,600 vs $1,200) that you didn’t tie up on the naked call to open new positions at $700, $725, or other strikes, once it seems likely that the stock is going to take off. No one is going to prevent you from opening another trade unless you don’t have the money. And frankly with theta feasting on these near expiry calls, that $700 may have dropped enough that the risk of a naked call is only a couple hundred bucks, instead of what it cost a few days earlier.

We can agree that this is gambling, but understanding risk will earn higher rewards over time.

**Black Scholes Merton Is Useful, but with Limits:**

Option pricing models tend to focus on either the binomial model or the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model. While binomial is viewed as rudimentary, it’s helpful to understand as it breaks out the pricing based on discreet moments in time, whereas BSM tends to perform the pricing in a black box that can make it more difficult to understand how the price of an option changes moment to moment. While a view of the price change over time can be useful, most trading decisions don’t require knowledge of the price at the Nth moment in time and require that all other variables remain constant, such as IV. Apart from being able to determine price without considering iterative changes, the benefit of BSM is that the calculations performed help to generate The Greeks. From this, a generally accepted measure of option pricing, you can begin to determine your exposure to delta and theta within a position or portfolio.

However, BSM is dependent upon a normal distribution of probabilities, a bell curve. Unfortunately, reality doesn’t fit neatly into a normal distribution, so while BSM can provide a snapshot of a price, understanding the impact of the price over time is a different exercise. Additionally, while more responsive models exist and measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) are utilized to help understand how unexpected occurrences can impact a portfolio at a given moment, these topics are beyond the level of this discussion and exceeds the necessity of a trader reading this on a social media platform.

**Understanding how to Control Portfolio Risk with Delta and Theta**

Still with me? Good, almost done.

So at this point you’ve opened up a bunch of different positions because you read some DD on a subreddit and the post had the requisite number of rocket ship emojis to convince you to mash the “Buy” button and separate you from your hard earned money. However each day, your portfolio gets more and more crimson-colored, and you curse those theta-devils and wish you knew how they do the voodoo that they do so well.

As was mentioned earlier, buying a call or put will create positive or negative delta, respectively. Selling a call will then create negative delta and selling a put will create positive delta. Since delta of a near-ATM contract is close to .50 you might think that buying a put and a call at the same strike will negate any price change and generate alpha. While yes, something would likely expire ITM, you’ll lose money overall through time decay and premiums.

More specifically, there’s an underlying theory known as Put/Call Parity:

(Call price + PV of Strike\*) = (Put price + Stock price)

*\*For the purposes of this discussion, since it seems the average DTE is 45 days or less, PV (Present Value) is essentially the current strike price.* *Don’t hurt your head trying to discount it based on the risk free rate.* *It may mean something for a LEAP, but with low rates, the discount is still negligible.*

The price of the call and strike should equal the price of the put plus the current stock price. However, the delta of the call might be .80, the delta of the put could be -.19. This is important when hedging as simply buying a call and a put at the same strike does not necessarily give the position a neutral (“0”) delta. Instead, the position will see net $.61 gain (.80 + -.19) with a $1 increase in the underlying versus a -$.61 loss with a $1 decline. So to create a neutral delta position, roughly 4 naked puts would be needed to offset the delta of 1 naked call (.80 / .19 = 4.21). Similarly, one could create a delta neutral position by buying 1 call with a delta of .80 and shorting 80 shares, but unless you are able to negate wash sales, buying and selling shares repeatedly to hedge will negatively impact your returns. Using weekly contracts can permit you to trade sufficiently different securities to avoid many wash sale occurrences. While this delta-neutral position would mitigate losses from a stock moving up or down, the cost would be excessive in terms of premium, and time decay would make this an almost certain loss unless the price could change enough to offset the premiums of both contracts.

However, as discussed, time and price (strike and stock) are crucial to the delta value. If attempting to hedge, you may have a bullish feeling, anticipating price improvement over the next week, so opening a debit call spread would establish positive delta in the portfolio, generating gains should the price improve. Similarly, opening a long put position would create negative delta. Since the put position is serving a purpose of reducing down-side exposure (an insurance policy), theta will sip from the position, unless a spread can be opened to help offset the decay. A balance is needed between the reduction in delta cause by opening a debit put spread to offset net delta in a portfolio, and offsetting theta to prevent loss should the market turn or move sideways. From this point, it becomes vital to understand how a series of spreads with varying strikes and expiries can affect both the net delta and theta. Focusing only on theta could leave you with ITM short positions that cost more to close than you received when opening. Zoning in only on delta will leave you bleeding out slowly at first then much more rapidly before expiry.

So how do you successfully hedge? Well, like with anything else, being prepared is crucial. Personally, one of my favorite positions is the 2-to-1 long butterfly. A long butterfly is opening a combination of spreads where a call (or put) is bought, two calls are sold at a higher (lower) strike, and another call is purchased at another higher strike (1 – 2 – 1). A short butterfly would be the same thing, but with two long contracts flanked by a short contract at higher and lower strikes. A butterfly can also be considered a combination of a debit spread and a credit spread. The 2-to-1 means that the gap between the first long leg and short leg (the debit spread) has a gap twice as large as the short leg and the second long leg (the credit spread). This strategy reduces the cost to open the position greatly (risk), while also creating a near neutral delta with a slightly negative theta. If the underlying expires just below the short legs, then max profit is hit, but even if it blows through, the second long leg is close enough to lock in a respectable gain, particularly on such a nominal amount to open the position.

If I open a 650/660/665 butterfly and the cost is $2/-$1/$.5 respectively, then it’ll cost me $.50 ($2 + (-$1 x 2) + $.50) to open the position, with a max gain of around $1000 at $659.99, and a minimum gain of around $500 at least if it pushes through $660. Oh and the breakeven is at $650.50, so going back above, if there was a 50% chance that $650 was hit, getting to $650.50 is like a 49% chance (compared to $662 or $686). And if it doesn’t hit, the loss is $50. Fifty dollars. Not $1,200, not $3,600. 5 $10 bills. I can’t go out for a beer for less than $50. Additionally, the delta of this will be nearly 0, and theta will be only slightly negative up until nearly expiry, and as long as you close your position by 3:59pm on Friday before expiry, you don’t even need to babysit this much.

**Let the Sunshine In**

One of the underlying benefits to managing your positions with an understanding of both delta (and its derivatives) and theta, is that as the market changes, you can increase or reduce your exposure. Should a bit of good news be announced, the net delta of a position can be “opened up” or increased to permit gains due to upward price movement of the underlying. Should unexpected clouds appear, net delta can be reduced or even made negative to help mitigate risk or capitalize on any market declines.

As much as we’d like to move markets, we can only really do that if we’re operating with a similar amount of knowledge. I think there’s a lot of volatility on the horizon, but I’m not sure which way or when it’s going to go. Frankly I’m not too concerned either way, as I tend to keep my positions at relatively low risk. I’m shooting for a steady gain, or at least enough to break even and keep playing. I’m not expecting to hit a home run at each at bat, just trying to get on base.

Users on BSC will be able to enjoy Smoothy’s benefits such as a single pool supporting multiple assets, low slippage, and high LP rewards.

**Initial mining and airdrop**

The ongoing initial mining activity on Ethereum (originally expected to end on March 30) will be extended for three weeks and the number SMTY rewards will be doubled from the current total 0.5–1% to **1%-2%**. In the next three weeks, LPs that provide liquidity on Ethereum and BSC will receive conversion fees, slippage fees, deposit interest income and SMTY rewards (this part will be gradually issued after the public offering). In addition, all wallet addresses that participate in exchange transactions on BSC during initial mining have the opportunity to receive airdrops. The more interactions, the greater the chance of airdrops.

**In order to encourage everyone to provide liquidity on BSC, we will give out an additional 0.1% of the total SMTY reward to provide liquidity LP on BSC in the first 7 days.**

At present, the BSC version of Smoothy supports 6 kinds of stablecoins, and the ETH version supports 8 kinds of stablecoins. You can choose to deposit any one or several of the supported stablecoins to provide liquidity. In the future, Smoothy will support more stablecoins.

# Revisiting Smoothy.finance

Smoothy is a novel stablecoin swapping protocol that is capable of supporting 20+ stablecoins in a single pool with low-cost low-slippage swapping and maximum interest earning for LPs. It is not a fork of any existing protocol.

**Features of Smoothy:**

**1 Reduce the gas fee significantly by algorithm optimization**

Even deployed on Ethereum, the gas fee required by stablecoin swap on Smoothy is reduced by 90% compared to Curve’s yPool and mStable after the algorithm optimization. It achieves a lower gas fee without using layer2 and ensures composability.

https://preview.redd.it/mqlros94ipp61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e103a319df246831eac4721092f1739641f41e4

**2 Single pool supporting multiple stablecoins with better liquidity**

Unlike Curve, which supports up to 4 stablecoins in one pool, Smoothy can support multiple stablecoins in one single pool, and can flexibly add/remove any token. Theoretically, Smoothy can accommodate hundreds of different types of stablecoins in one pool (even algorithm stablecoin). This means that Smoothy will not suffer from the fragmented liquidity of multiple pools, enabling better liquidity.

**3 Maximum LP reward**

With reference to the bank’s reserve system, we designed a unique Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm, which dynamically allocates the majority of funds in the underlying interest-earning platform and the rest is reserved to meet daily swap needs. In other words, in addition to governance token earnings, liquidity providers can gain swap fees together with interest earning and lower gas fees.

**4 zero-slippage swapping algorithm**

Smoothy developed a SmoothSwap algorithm that can guarantee 1:1 ratio swap most of the time if the percentage of the token in the pool is lower than soft weights; if not, a swap is still allowed by imposing a penalty fee as slippage.

Best ways to put your BTC into a passive income,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mf0ohx/best_ways_to_put_your_btc_into_a_passive_income/,da_f3nix,1,2021-03-28 20:38:01,57,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mf0ohx/best_ways_to_put_your_btc_into_a_passive_income/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"This article wants to mainly open a discussion about the best CeFi / DeFi solutions to create value from your BTC bag.

BTC is probably the backbone of many portfolios here, hence is no joke when you choose to stop plain hodling into your cold storage and put your crypto at work producing more crypto: if you decided to get away from the *not your keys, not your coin* golden rule you have to put into serious consideration the benefits and risks. That quote is one of the best pieces of advice, but no dogma.

My personal experience, so far, has been with **BlockFi**, which granted me a 6% APY on BTC (tier1, from 0 to 1 BTC [the rates will change from the 1st of April](https://blockfi.com/our-btc-and-eth-rates-are-changing-and-heres-why)). I chose it for the emphasis on security, for being straightforward: no need to lock or to hold a platform coin, and for the possibility of letting me choose the cryptocurrency in which I could receive interest payments (which allowed me to mainly switch from BTC to ETH payouts when the circumstances were favorable or I wanted to rebalance my portfolio).

But this is not a BlockFi post, on the contrary, as I wrote earlier, Tier2 rates have been changed and heavily penalized. Other interesting possibilities I can find in the CeFi environment are **Nexo** (probably the most interesting, we start at 6% at the base loyalty level, but only if you choose to receive payouts in NEXO tokens, otherwise it's 4%), **Celsius** (5,10% if you choose the payout in CEL, otherwise in-kind reward rate is 4,06% APY) and **Crypto.com**, which are recently doing some interesting steps forward, between the 70 Billion CRO burned last month and the mainnet launched 3 days ago, aiming to decentralize the coin. In the latter, the APY can vary from 1,5% to 8,5% depending on the locked period and CRO staking.

On the DeFi side, you'll need to first tokenize your BTC, which will have to be converted in an erc-20 token before dedicating yourself to yield farming. wBTC and renBTC are examples of 1:1 BTC pegged tokens.

Some interesting options in the DeFi environment, can be found on **Curve** where, according to Coinmarketcap, the hBTC-wBTC pool grants a 7,62% APY, payout in CRV, with low impermanent loss: Another option is the **Harvest Finance** wBTC vault, with a lofty APY of 17,91%, payout in FARM and CRV, and still low IL, but at the same time a higher risk profile ( it's worth noticing that this DeFi protocol was hacked last October 2020 with 24M stolen).

This is a very fast overview, coming from my personal experience and research, with the risk/reward ratio to be always kept in mind.

"I may have found a gem - Ellipsis Finance - 5 days old, $43m MCap, tokens currently at $3.55",https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/mf10am/i_may_have_found_a_gem_ellipsis_finance_5_days/,CryptoFiasco,1,2021-03-28 21:00:05,59,/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/mf10am/i_may_have_found_a_gem_ellipsis_finance_5_days/,Moonshot,"**TL;DR:**

It’s a BSC fork of Curve finance (a pool for swapping stable coins that generates yield). It seems legit as far as I can tell. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It’s called Ellipsis and the token is EPS. It’s only about 5 days old, 1.300 holders at time of writing. 

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ellipsis) 

[https://www.ellipsis.finance/](https://www.ellipsis.finance/)  


**Buy EPS here:**

EPS coin is currently worth $3.48, you can buy it on Pancake swap by swapping BNB for it. Just copy the token address or use this link: 

[https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xa7f552078dcc247c2684336020c03648500c6d9f) 

After buying EPS you can Stake and lock it (for three months) here: [https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps](https://www.ellipsis.finance/stakeeps) to earn an insane amount of interest, at the moment it’s around 5% per day (3200% APY). 

**Three ways of staking explained:**

As far as I can tell there are 3 ways to stake it. You can stake EPS-BNB LP tokens (by providing liquidity on pancake swap), you can stake EPS directly or you can Lock and Stake EPS for three months. 

The first and last option seem to currently give you about 5% per day in EPS (plus some 36% APY in BUSD). The difference is that in the first option, your rewards go through a 3 month Vesting period. In option three, the rewards can be claimed fully at any point.   
Your vested EPS rewards can also be claimed at any point but that incurs a 50% fee (which gets distributed to those who locked and staked their EPS).   
The second option (just plain staking of EPS) seems to only give you 36% APY in BUSD as far as I can tell but I'm not entirely sure.  


**Is this legit? My own research results:**

* Project followed and retweeted by Curve, 1inch, Beefy finance
* Devs are anonymous
* Liquidity on Pancake swap is not locked
* Token Sniffer gives no results
* Total amount of liquidity in pools $1,491,372,568.00 and around $14m daily volume

&amp;#x200B;

I did a ""test run"" with a small amount (100 EPS = $350 ) and received about 4 EPS in rewards overnight (\~$14) which I could claim right away, with the tiny BSC gas fees of about $1 (fuck you, Ethereum). 

My favourite strategy is to just Lock and Stake EPS for those incredible daily rewards, also happy to just see where this goes in three months time!   


**Potential:**

I'm not an expert, but here's some comparisons: Ellipsis has currently about 1,300 holders and Curve has almost 30,000 . Curve's marketcap is currently around $800 M, so if this project were to match Curve (which I guess is unlikely, but possible) that would mean a 20x from where we are now.   


**Disclaimer:**

This is not financial advice, you should always do your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. I currently hold about 300 EPS.

"Apes, We $RIDE at Dawn",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/mfcedj/apes_we_ride_at_dawn/,Hobarik,0,2021-03-29 07:10:21,55,/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/mfcedj/apes_we_ride_at_dawn/,DD,"**PART 1: Introduction**

For many of you, this is likely not the first time you have heard of [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/). Polarizing opinions are plentiful, with the zealous believers on one end and the scrooge-esque bears on the other. And in the midst of all this, Hindenburg Research, literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling”, comes in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real and he isn’t bringing you any tendies this year or any more after that. And what blows my mind is the amount of people essentially responding with “you’re right daddy Burg, I was a dummy for believing in Santa, we all deserve coal” as if speculators are the shills all of a sudden and short sellers are the ones investing in the future of the human race or something. Gimme a break. If 5 dudes you’ve never met posting a long paper on the internet about stocks is enough to convince you smooth-brains that any stock is a flat-out fraud, then you shouldn’t even need to read anything I wrote. You should be out right now buying 1000 shares with the weekly allowance your wife's boyfriend gives you, cause I have the same dipshit qualifications as those “activists.”

But enough metaphors. Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle company that is primarily focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock. So that’s what I intend to do; using technical analysis and a bunch of dumbass crayon charts, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing it’s tone towards $RIDE. So just hop off Hindenburgs lap for a minute and listen up.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2: Technical Analysis**

Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators, personally. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, or pretty crayon pictures; they call me Warren Suckit or John D Cuckefeller, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with. With so many people also using these indicators and trading off of them, it increases their efficacy even further: a self-fulfilling prophecy. That being said this is my own analysis, so be sure to conduct your own. With that out of the way, let’s get to it.

**Short Interest:**

Before we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by Fintel, short volume reached its recent peak of 8 million shares, or 30 percent of the total volume, on March 15th, the Monday directly after the short report. The short volume very quickly fell to 13 percent on March 23rd before rising again to 19 percent on Friday. However, the actual short volume on both these days was about 1.2 million shares, so why did the percentage increase? The answer is the total volume for each day. The volume on Friday was a paltry 6 million shares, compared to the stocks average of 13 million. So why are we seeing this consolidation period amidst a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts took their profits and left, realizing the stock was likely to consolidate as the dust settles, and then rally. Not only are they scared of retards like you, who will target a stock just to hurt short sellers forcing them to evolve in their strategies, they also realize that $RIDE is just unlikely to fail outright, even with some bumps in the road. They realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house.

&amp;#x200B;

[Recent Short Volume Ratio on $RIDE, via Fintel](https://preview.redd.it/8xw47cx7oup61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c4b256e188091a6e6c310a240aba74e1133b95)

Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, to a total of 12.5 percent the total float. They have access to the same tools we do to see the shift in the market’s feelings, but one thing they don’t have is the brain wrinkles to realize that you cucks never get tired of a good squeezing.

**The Baseline:**

&amp;#x200B;

[My cozy little default indicator setup, via Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/j6b6dzpaoup61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10fad5c04f3a3ec98b9b972c722542d4d4fb73ed)

We see here the four indicators that I use to get a baseline for any stock I look at; Bollinger Bands, MACD, Stochastics, and good ol' fashioned candlestick price action. I'm gonna break it down Barney style and explain how they each relate to $RIDE for those who have never seen or heard of them, so skip to the ""How it applies to $RIDE"" sections if you think you’re some kind of Michael Burry and don’t need an explanation. It's confusing to log in to your brokerage app every day and just see a single snapshot of what the price is for that day. You might see these dips and your monkey brain gets angry; you know this stock is undervalued (or you will soon) but the market doesn't seem to get it yet. It’s unclear from price alone if the market is beginning to change its mind. That's where indicators come in:

**Indicators Explained and Applied to $RIDE**

*Bollinger Bands:*

This is the indicator we see in the top third quadrant, specifically it is the blue tube that surrounds the candlestick chart as it moves up and down. Simply put, Bollinger Bands use a simple moving average of a stock (mine is set to a period of 20.2) in order to smooth out the craziness of its movements over time. It then plots red lines 2 to 3 standard deviations (mine is set to 2.5 standard deviations) above and below the average. If anyone remembers the bell curve from high school, that's what a standard deviation is.

&amp;#x200B;

[The bell curve, a middle school classic](https://preview.redd.it/kub3hz7coup61.jpg?width=588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72513973274ed8df0e545adca9e799974d2fde04)

Each movement left and right on a bell curve is called a standard deviation, and it encompasses a certain amount of the data from a given set. In the case of Bollinger Bands, that set is price action. When Bollinger Bands are set to 2 standard deviations, for example, that means that 95 percent of the price action of that stock will occur within that tube, and there is a very low likelihood the stock will break out of the bands.

Now you may be asking: how does this indicator determine the standard deviations of price action before it happens anyways? The answer in short: volatility. As a stock’s volatility increases, the bands widen, as they decrease, they constrict. Within a given period of time the price action of a stock will bounce back and forth within this tube, and as volatility changes, so will the size of the tube. Traders use the location of the price within the tube as well as the growth/shrinkage of the tube as buy/sell signals.

*How the Bands apply to $RIDE:*

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIDES Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/htclu2udoup61.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d485ff2d173fc588d65ceac4ad659181e2eef9f5)

This indicator, when applied to $RIDE in isolation, is unfortunately bit up in the air. The tube is currently very wide due to the stock’s extreme volatility. A typical sign to lookout for on the bands is the squeeze/breakout cycle in which the bands constrict due to lower volatility at the moment, and then breakout in an upswing of volatility, as seen below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of a Bollinger band squeeze and breakout](https://preview.redd.it/wscow3ifoup61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8915e1d3713db7ac273a1d26f0ef943d3306f4b4)

We could spot this forming if the ends of the red lines on the top and bottom began to hook inwards, similar to the area I point to using the very poorly drawn arrows. This is something to look out for, but hasn't happened yet. One thing we can see, however, is the price action’s location within the bands. We see it currently trading at or near the lower range of the deviations, which historically can’t happen forever. While the moving average can continue moving down, lowering the range, the stock will still likely move back up within that range at some point, getting close to the top red line. Since the moving average has started flattening out again, this is a nice indicator the stock will at least approach 20 dollars again sometime in the short term (the top of the range seen in red is currently at 22.285 dollars) but not much else to go off with just this. Keep an eye out for a consolidation in the near future leading to a Bollinger squeeze.

*Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):*

My personal favorite indicator, as I consider myself a swing trader, not a day trader. This indicator nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock price. They get it by subtracting a long period exponential moving average (EMA) from a shorter EMA (in my setup I use 8 period minus 17 period since it's more sensitive, however 12 and 26 is most common). The result of this difference creates the purple moving line, which is called the MACD line. The purple line is then plotted with a 9 day EMA in orange, which is called the signal line. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events, and as you can see historically with $RIDE, the MACD has certainly predicted these events before. However, this indicator is not perfect and does not predict how large a breakout may be (which is why we compare it to the volatility shown to us by the Bollinger Bands to find more specific price targets and ranges). It can also provide false positives, such as the lines crossing each other multiple times, or approaching each other and reversing without ever touching.

However, in times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD can often result in violent reversals when they tough. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on an ape favorite around here; GameStop:

&amp;#x200B;

[GameStop MACD analysis after recent 40 dollar dip](https://preview.redd.it/hdtfo57houp61.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97051cedfef9107f8a4924f98811e4d73ae13114)

A friend and I both noticed this crossover beginning to form and bought more the week of the event. It doesn't always work so well, but in this case the MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift; the bears were losing. And as I said before, violent downswings can result in violent upswings. We couldn't predict how much it would go up but however one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day.

You may also notice the histogram bars with the MACD. Do not get confused; the bars at the bottom are just a different way to show the same thing, but it's easier to see reversals cause its color coded. Green means the purple line has moved closer to the orange, which signals a potential slowing and reversal of selling momentum. This is the sign we used to buy in.

*How the MACD applies to $RIDE:*

Now this indicator makes me giddy to see, it's much less up in the air as the bands are. Does the chart below look familiar to anyone? Or did I lose any goldfish attention spans since the very last chart of GME? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself:

&amp;#x200B;

[Potential breakout 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/tq4987wioup61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaa7501da19c82085d2ce13d8b0753ef73ce8b71)

This, my friends, was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. We can see that from a historical perspective, the MACD has followed a massive uptrend before based on being very far below the center line and swinging down violently. Coincidentally, we recently had another event that pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was). Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and continued to approach the signal line in orange. I won't get into why this happens, but it's a good sign. Negative pressure is clearly decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. However, such a violent downswing creates potential for a violent upswing, after all the MACD doesn't want to stay shoved below the centerline for long, it oscillates up and down and in the case of MACD, what goes down must come up. This doesn't indicate an overall trend for the stock, but I've never seen a MACD just go down forever. There will be a correction at some point, and we will have to see if this results in a trend reversal.

One thing we should all agree on: this MACD is beautiful. When you see a MACD like this, honestly there aren't many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the great depression part 2 is starting. Obligatory rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

*The Stochastics:*

An indicator that, for me, simply provides context to the other main 3 that I use. The premise of Stochastics is that when a stock trends upwards, its closing price tends to trade at the high end of the day's range or price action. Price action refers to the range of prices at which a stock trades throughout the daily session. For example, if a stock opened at $10, traded as low as $9.75 and as high as $10.75, then closed at $10.50 for the day, the price action or range would be between $9.75 (the low of the day) and $10.75 (the high of the day). Conversely, if the price has a downward movement, the closing price tends to trade at or near the low range of the day's trading session.

Thus, Stochastics is used to show when a stock has moved into an overbought or oversold position. It can assist in determining if bulls or bears have enough fuel to continue their push in whatever direction. If the stock is overbought, demand is high and there are a lot of buyers. If its oversold then supply is too high, the price is dropping and no one is buying. Neither situation can last forever and thus small reversals occur. These are usually found in the upper 80 percentile and lower 20 percentile range, as a stock cannot remain 80 percent bought or 80 percent sold for long.

Another element of the stochastic is the red and black lines, which can be thought of as buyers and sellers. The black line is buyers and the red is sellers. When they cross, you can visualize if the bears or bulls are starting to overtake the other. When black is above red, buyers are stronger and when red is above black, sellers are stronger.

The Stochastic oscillator is often very accurate and easy to understand, thus widely used, however it is most finicky and can remain overbought or oversold for long periods of time or reverse at the slightest change in momentum. Therefore, it should be used to provide context to the more speculative indicators such as MACD and Bollinger Bands, i.e.; is the stock oversold enough to support the thesis of a reversal? Or is it still hovering in the middle or overbought and is likely to continue its downward trajectory.

*How Stochastics apply to $RIDE:*

&amp;#x200B;

[The stochastics of $RIDE, massively oversold](https://preview.redd.it/v78gy1pkoup61.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7514828a5823c43fd9562f694610b751d601e30d)

Here we can see a clear example of the fickle nature of the stochastics. This would've been a great indicator to time your exit to buy back in with more capital, however if you used it solely to predict the low you would've been hurting for quite some time. MACD + Bollinger bands are better suited for predicting lows. What this oscillator can tell us, however, is how massively oversold $RIDE is at the moment. No one is buying it; thus there is no demand for some time. And rightfully so, I mean if all you hear was what the media and Hindenburg had to say, would you buy it? But rumors don't last forever, and once you read the fundamentals you'll realize once people catch wind of a small hint of success, any small catalyst, the slightest twitch of demand will rocket the stochastics up, along with the other indicators.

*Price Action:*

PRICE ACTION!!!

Finally, the most important indicator of them all. It's extremely easy as a trader to get caught up in the indicators and forget about the pure price action, the literal actions of actual people (or bots) and not abstract depictions of them. Look at the charts, look at each candlestick (look it up if you don't know what a candlestick means, it's very simple), look for patterns that repeat themselves like TRIANGLES! THE TRIANGLES ARE EVERYWHERE, LEARN ABOUT THEM! There's an amazing post in WSB about triangles and wedges that I could link if it's wanted, I know this post is already huge and price action is its own subject. But beside that, the patterns are everywhere. Don't force anything that doesn't exist, like ""Oh based on the chart of $RIDE you can see a classic cup and handle forming with a potential upside around 25 dollars dur dur dur."" Yes, those patterns exist but often fail, especially when you want to see what isn't there. Let the signs come to you with each candlestick. Here's a nice one for example in the 1-hour period chart of $RIDE:

&amp;#x200B;

[Hammer candle at 9AM EST on March 25th, indicating a rejection of the low of 10.89](https://preview.redd.it/6oxywh9noup61.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16d28f2dc3a6cc5ec368bb6dc62d848d06ab77dd)

Always remember the trend is your friend, long term trends are more valuable than short term as I often use the indicators above to predict breakouts. When looking at trends, please use multiple intervals of time. All of the indicators I have shown here use 1 day as a period, but using 1 day, 1 week, and 1 hour will all tell a very different story. Use these different periods to contextualize movement in the big picture. For example, if we instead look at $RIDE with a period of one week, we are told a different story:

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIDE 1 week period, even long term we're at a floor](https://preview.redd.it/vady2dfooup61.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3533f9ba98b23640dea710b4a5286f53e9d32d9e)

Many of the indicators are still there from the day period, but details are lost, and new ones are gained. We can see this isn’t the first time $RIDE has experienced extreme swings like this, but rarely ever does it get pushed lower than the long-term support it has found now. Use this period and make your own assessment of what you believe will happen over the next few weeks, rather than days, but to me the massive overreaction is still obvious even long-term.

Now that I believe I’ve made a compelling enough case that the market is beginning to shift in its sentiment of $RIDE, completely out of context, it’s time to really strap in as I explain the full scope of why Lordstown Motors is more than just a 10 dollar stock in the real world outside of delicious crayons and tea leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3: Competitors**

Now before I move on to discussing the plans and fundamentals of $RIDE, let’s just take a brief look at two of its EV start-up competitors that are looking to produce trucks:

**Nikola ($NKLA):** $5.546B Market Cap

The one everyone wants to draw comparisons to. Not mass-producing anything, but has plans to start producing in 2023. The CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year and they were investigated by the SEC. That fake truck video everyone knows and loves, it was pretty funny I won’t deny it. Just one thing to point out, the CEO of Camping World (who is partnered with Lordstown) [tweeted this video](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1370400227782369285) of the Lordstown tech concept vehicle driving and *specifically calling out Nikola*. The obvious difference is that Lordstown actually has functioning technology… not much else to add there.

**Canoo Inc ($GOEV):** $2.936B Market Cap

Ugliest concept vehicle I’ve ever seen. Lol. Send me a recording of one person you know saying they would buy that and I’ll make a full DD on Canoo. They won’t be starting deliveries until 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4: Fundamentals**

And now, finally, we get to hop on the $RIDE (Lordstown Motors, that is): $1.958B Market Cap.

I primarily trade on indicators, so I had to go on over to [r/LordstownMotors](https://www.reddit.com/r/LordstownMotors/) to learn more about the $RIDE bulls’ perspective. After this, I viewed the company’s most recent [investor presentation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Cash on hand over $600 million. Increasing their investments this year for growth and to increase production capacity. Will be down to \~ $250 million cash by EOY. No debt. The company is literally within walking distance of mass producing (not hand-making) the world’s first ever full size electric pick-up truck. An Endurance will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes starting this September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal. Even bumps in the road will still put them miles ahead of competitors. This is mostly due to the head start they got from GM back in 2019 via a massive [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/05/22/gm-lordstown-motors-plant-jobs-electric-pickups-vehicles/5229669002/). You see, this truck is built a little bit differently than others. It has no engine, transmission, differentials, C/V joints, half shafts, fuel pumps, belts, filters or clutches. That’s about 5,000 parts many operating under high stress or high temperatures that you don’t have to worry about. Why? [Because it uses hub motors](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/best-2020-lordstown-motors-wheel-hub-motors/). Without getting too complicated, this essentially means that there is a motor in each wheel. These motors will reduce the number of moving parts to the fewest in the industry, meaning cheaper cost of ownership. Cheaper cost of ownership is great for fleets. This will give trucks true four-wheel drive. But in case they all somehow fail; the truck is designed to work on as little as 1 hub motor for emergency use. You know how many motors can fail in your car before your wife's boyfriend needs to dial Triple A? I know you’re probably drooling right now so I’ll give you some time to calculate it. Now this is not just a crackpot concept by some egghead that thought he had a fun idea. Hub motors have existed for decades and their power and efficiency are proven in the industrial market in things like construction equipment and buses.

All this new technology, ease of maintenance, fail-safes, and a whopping 75 eMPG give Lordstown huge potential demand for fleets, an industry that hasn’t seen innovation in decades, not to mention a 600HP production. Adam ""what the fuck is a hub motor"" Jonas of Morgan Stanely thought the truck required 5 motors because he thought they were part of the actual wheel during the investor call. They are actually part of the axle, which means the spare tire does not need to come with a motor. One of the biggest critics of the technology, doesn’t even understand how it works.

Now, I’m sure for some of you I’ve spun quite a beautiful web, and it must be a trap, right? Surely all these prospects are priced in, and the price accurately reflects the potential vs risks? Well, let’s just see $RIDE’s market cap:

$1.958B

That’s right. The rational market, with its gallant short selling activists, currently values $RIDE at about a third of the market cap of $NKLA. A company with one of the largest fully functioning factories in the county, innovative technology, investor and production relations with GM and Camping World, is currently worth a third of a truck that rolls. And why is that? Well, simply put, the market is afraid.

With the recent tech sell off and the Hindenburg report telling everyone $RIDE was a scam all along, wouldn’t you be? So, what did the report actually say anyways? We know they have a factory, concepts, 500+ employees, capital, etc. so what’s the problem? Essentially, Hindenburg pointed their fingers and said “Look, Lordstown’s 100,000 preorders are non-binding! Everyone laugh at them!” And now no one on the playground wants to be friends with them, despite the fact that Lordstown never claimed they were binding. They also went after them by saying they have no “sellable product” and that they are “3-4 years away” from production (according to “former employees”) [even though we have video evidence of them being in beta phase and on track for this September](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). Hell, they’re even set to roll out betas [this month](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/northeast-ohio/lordstown-motors-prototype-electric-truck-march-completion/95-357fe0da-c271-40d0-94f7-ce3dc6392e09). And they’ve entered their drivetrain and hub motors into a [race for next month](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/). Ever heard the phrase “buy the fear, sell the greed”? If this company was a fraud just out for your hard earned tendies, do you really think they would oust themselves outright by creating such near future timelines instead of stretching them out for more money?

Now, most EV start-ups aren’t generating revenue at the moment, so it wouldn’t be accurate for me to list a P/E ratio for you all. However, we can look at the earnings per share through the last quarter. $RIDE’s EPS currently sits at -0.23 cents, whereas $NKLA was at -0.38 cents, almost 2x more lost per share. If a stock with a negative EPS bothers you, then you might as well move on as this is a speculative, high-growth sector. However, it is quite clear that Lordstown is bleeding much less than its competitors and on a much faster track to success than them.

If you have read this far, you are telling yourself one of two things. 1: This guy is a shill idiot and this is an obvious bubble, I’m not touching any EV stocks. If you’re that guy, why did you even read this far?? And 2: If $RIDE is so undervalued and has all this going for it, why is it still getting pummeled by the Hindenburg report? Surely the market should start to realize what it's doing?

Well, my friend, that’s where the indicators come in from part 2. Because while fundamentals are great, the market has feelings, you have to caress it and ask how its day was, and if you don’t the mood swings will be vast and unpredictable. The feelings of the market do not change overnight though, you have to be poised for when they do that, so you can take the great fundamentals like the ones I have laid out and use the indicators to find a great entry to be a part of them. That great entry just happens to exist right now for $RIDE, which is why I shared it with you all.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 5: All Together Now, Conclusion**

Let's go back to the full chart from the beginning, with a little more crayon drawing this time:

&amp;#x200B;

[All the indicators primed together in beautiful harmony, ready for a massive upswing](https://preview.redd.it/hwjrixaqoup61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eb4620d6a4eb3c4105e72ca889baf37aeda4818)

I tried to lay it all out in the picture but this is how a true technical analysis should look (with your own style of course). No one indicator means more than the other and all are used to disprove false positives. In the world of technical analysis, we run with potential. Does the potential upside outweigh downside in long or short term? If only long-term interests you, by all means stick to fundamentals and buy whenever. But for the most bang for your buck, if you want to swing in and out of trades and make a profit to increase your capital for long term investments, you need a foundation of chart reading. And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of 25 to 40 dollars and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this. The fundamentals create catalysts for these indicators, the finger is on the trigger, and it's up to you to decide if you like those or not. But if you decide you like the stock and aren't afraid of the negative publicity from the Keemstar of Wall Street, Hindenburg, then use indicators to time your entries and plan your exits. I see upside to this trade from both long term and short-term perspectives honestly.

I hope that I managed to spice things up from your regularly scheduled discussions of GME fundamentals and Shitron memes with this post, or that at least one person reads this all the way through. Most of all, I hope you all gained a few more wrinkles on your brain, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. This is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby and the same can be said about teaching. I want to see everyone learn, but I don't want anyone to blindly rely on me for financial advice.

Please feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info, and I may edit the post to clarify if needed. I know it's an absolute wall.

TLDR; Regardless of if you’re bullish or bearish on the fundamentals of Lordstown Motors, there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. This chart is poised for a breakout 🚀🚀🚀 Get ready for a wild $RIDE!"
Full Technical Analysis and DD on $RIDE: Poised for a Breakout,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/mfe8ko/full_technical_analysis_and_dd_on_ride_poised_for/,Hobarik,1,2021-03-29 08:55:41,37,/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/mfe8ko/full_technical_analysis_and_dd_on_ride_poised_for/,DD,"**PART 1: Introduction**

For many of you, this is likely not the first time you have heard of [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/). Polarizing opinions are plentiful, with the zealous believers on one end and the scrooge-esque bears on the other. And in the midst of all this, Hindenburg Research, a five-man team with a lot of money and a focus on activist short selling, have undoubtedly soiled your opinion of this company. I’m not here to encourage any sort of mob mentality, just hoping to share a bit of analysis I’ve done that’s been received well in some places and poorly in others. As I said, with a lot of people it’s either love or hate for this company, so maybe a few of you will hear me out.

Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle company that is primarily focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock. So that’s what I intend to do; using technical analysis and a bunch of crayon charts, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE.

**PART 2: Technical Analysis**

Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators, personally. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with. With so many people also using these indicators and trading off of them, it increases their efficacy even further: a self-fulfilling prophecy. That being said this is my own analysis, so be sure to conduct your own. With that out of the way, let’s get to it.

**Short Interest:**

Before we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address Reddit’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by Fintel, short volume reached its recent peak of 8 million shares, or 30 percent of the total volume, on March 15th, the Monday directly after the short report. The short volume very quickly fell to 13 percent on March 23rd before rising again to 19 percent on Friday. However, the actual short volume on both these days was about 1.2 million shares, so why did the percentage increase? The answer is the total volume for each day. The volume on Friday was a paltry 6 million shares, compared to the stocks average of 13 million. So why are we seeing this consolidation period amidst a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts took their profits and left, realizing the stock was likely to consolidate as the dust settles, and then rally. Not only are they scared of frenzied Reddit users, who will target a stock just to hurt short sellers forcing them to evolve in their strategies, they also realize that $RIDE is just unlikely to fail outright, even with some bumps in the road. They realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their mom’s house.

&amp;#x200B;

[Recent Short Volume Ratio on $RIDE, via Fintel](https://preview.redd.it/2lsoyxkk7vp61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2810fc1b1a69a4c3205a9d5f736de4ad8a48435e)

Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, to a total of 12.5 percent the total float. They have access to the same tools we do to see the shift in the market’s feelings.

**The Baseline:**

&amp;#x200B;

[My cozy little default indicator setup, via Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/n83b4xwm7vp61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ee4838e145e318d80ca6d1abcfae4a2e79ecbf5)

We see here the four indicators that I use to get a baseline for any stock I look at; Bollinger Bands, MACD, Stochastics, and good ol' fashioned candlestick price action. I'm gonna break it down Barney style and explain how they each relate to $RIDE for those who have never seen or heard of them, so skip to the ""How it applies to $RIDE"" sections if you don’t need an explanation. It's confusing to log in to your brokerage app every day and just see a single snapshot of what the price is for that day. You might see these dips and you feel frustrated; you think this stock is undervalued (or you will soon) but the market doesn't seem to get it yet. Maybe you were lied to. It’s unclear from price alone if the market is beginning to change its mind. That's where indicators come in:

**Indicators Explained and Applied to $RIDE**

*Bollinger Bands:*

This is the indicator we see in the top third quadrant, specifically it is the blue tube that surrounds the candlestick chart as it moves up and down. Simply put, Bollinger Bands use a simple moving average of a stock (mine is set to a period of 20.2) in order to smooth out the craziness of its movements over time. It then plots red lines 2 to 3 standard deviations (mine is set to 2.5 standard deviations) above and below the average. If anyone remembers the bell curve from high school, that's what a standard deviation is.

&amp;#x200B;

[The bell curve, a middle school classic](https://preview.redd.it/2jr8uuqp7vp61.jpg?width=588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6641d77224602d7ae87e890794a0d92677398834)

Each movement left and right on a bell curve is called a standard deviation, and it encompasses a certain amount of the data from a given set. In the case of Bollinger Bands, that set is price action. When Bollinger Bands are set to 2 standard deviations, for example, that means that 95 percent of the price action of that stock will occur within that tube, and there is a very low likelihood the stock will break out of the bands.

Now you may be asking: how does this indicator determine the standard deviations of price action before it happens anyways? The answer in short: volatility. As a stock’s volatility increases, the bands widen, as they decrease, they constrict. Within a given period of time the price action of a stock will bounce back and forth within this tube, and as volatility changes, so will the size of the tube. Traders use the location of the price within the tube as well as the growth/shrinkage of the tube as buy/sell signals.

*How the Bands apply to $RIDE:*

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIDES Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/fr2fro8r7vp61.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ea1cbbed780d7dcd62d72fb57ee199e1a06e69e)

This indicator, when applied to $RIDE in isolation, is unfortunately bit up in the air. The tube is currently very wide due to the stock’s extreme volatility. A typical sign to lookout for on the bands is the squeeze/breakout cycle in which the bands constrict due to lower volatility at the moment, and then breakout in an upswing of volatility, as seen below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of a Bollinger band squeeze and breakout](https://preview.redd.it/w4eoz1os7vp61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79dd8b140b5f4aa0b8fec3caf57d98a741cad1a1)

We could spot this forming if the ends of the red lines on the top and bottom began to hook inwards, similar to the area I point to using the very poorly drawn arrows. This is something to look out for, but hasn't happened yet. One thing we can see, however, is the price action’s location within the bands. We see it currently trading at or near the lower range of the deviations, which historically can’t happen forever. While the moving average can continue moving down, lowering the range, the stock will still likely move back up within that range at some point, getting close to the top red line. Since the moving average has started flattening out again, this is a nice indicator the stock will at least approach 20 dollars again sometime in the short term (the top of the range seen in red is currently at 22.285 dollars) but not much else to go off with just this. Keep an eye out for a consolidation in the near future leading to a Bollinger squeeze.

*Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):*

My personal favorite indicator, as I consider myself a swing trader, not a day trader. This indicator nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock price. They get it by subtracting a long period exponential moving average (EMA) from a shorter EMA (in my setup I use 8 period minus 17 period since it's more sensitive, however 12 and 26 is most common). The result of this difference creates the purple moving line, which is called the MACD line. The purple line is then plotted with a 9 day EMA in orange, which is called the signal line. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events, and as you can see historically with $RIDE, the MACD has certainly predicted these events before. However, this indicator is not perfect and does not predict how large a breakout may be (which is why we compare it to the volatility shown to us by the Bollinger Bands to find more specific price targets and ranges). It can also provide false positives, such as the lines crossing each other multiple times, or approaching each other and reversing without ever touching.

However, in times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD can often result in violent reversals when they tough. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a reddit favorite; GameStop:

&amp;#x200B;

[GameStop MACD analysis after recent 40 dollar dip](https://preview.redd.it/0jcrbk2u7vp61.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d5a17455b0708bedf946688b636149263c2ac4)

A friend and I both noticed this crossover beginning to form and bought more the week of the event. We couldn’t have known how high it would go and average out along the way, but the easing off downward pressure made it appealing. It doesn't always work so well, but in this case the MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift; the bears were losing. And as I said before, violent downswings can result in violent upswings. We couldn't predict how much it would go up but however one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day.

You may also notice the histogram bars with the MACD. Do not get confused; the bars at the bottom are just a different way to show the same thing, but it's easier to see reversals cause its color coded. Green means the purple line has moved closer to the orange, which signals a potential slowing and reversal of selling momentum. This is the sign we used to buy in.

*How the MACD applies to $RIDE:*

Now this indicator makes me giddy to see, it's much less up in the air as the bands are. Does the chart below look familiar to anyone? Or did I lose any goldfish attention spans since the very last chart of GME? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself:

&amp;#x200B;

[Potential breakout](https://preview.redd.it/o2cehrcx7vp61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d83a7e03e9062d8fd71a59fe9b0b613b007e80a)

This, my friends, was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. We can see that from a historical perspective, the MACD has followed a massive uptrend before based on being very far below the center line and swinging down violently. Coincidentally, we recently had another event that pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was). Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and continued to approach the signal line in orange. I won't get into why this happens, but it's a good sign. Negative pressure is clearly decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. However, such a violent downswing creates potential for a violent upswing, after all the MACD doesn't want to stay shoved below the centerline for long, it oscillates up and down and in the case of MACD, what goes down must come up. This doesn't indicate an overall trend for the stock, but I've never seen a MACD just go down forever. There will be a correction at some point, and we will have to see if this results in a trend reversal.

One thing we should all agree on: this MACD is beautiful. When you see a MACD like this, honestly there aren't many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the great depression part 2 is starting.

*The Stochastics:*

An indicator that, for me, simply provides context to the other main 3 that I use. The premise of Stochastics is that when a stock trends upwards, its closing price tends to trade at the high end of the day's range or price action. Price action refers to the range of prices at which a stock trades throughout the daily session. For example, if a stock opened at $10, traded as low as $9.75 and as high as $10.75, then closed at $10.50 for the day, the price action or range would be between $9.75 (the low of the day) and $10.75 (the high of the day). Conversely, if the price has a downward movement, the closing price tends to trade at or near the low range of the day's trading session.

Thus, Stochastics is used to show when a stock has moved into an overbought or oversold position. It can assist in determining if bulls or bears have enough fuel to continue their push in whatever direction. If the stock is overbought, demand is high and there are a lot of buyers. If it’s oversold then supply is too high, the price is dropping and no one is buying. Neither situation can last forever and thus small reversals occur. These are usually found in the upper 80 percentile and lower 20 percentile range, as a stock cannot remain 80 percent bought or 80 percent sold for long.

Another element of the stochastic is the red and black lines, which can be thought of as buyers and sellers. The black line is buyers and the red is sellers. When they cross, you can visualize if the bears or bulls are starting to overtake the other. When black is above red, buyers are stronger and when red is above black, sellers are stronger.

The Stochastic oscillator is often very accurate and easy to understand, thus widely used, however it is most finicky and can remain overbought or oversold for long periods of time or reverse at the slightest change in momentum. Therefore, it should be used to provide context to the more speculative indicators such as MACD and Bollinger Bands, i.e.; is the stock oversold enough to support the thesis of a reversal? Or is it still hovering in the middle or overbought and is likely to continue its downward trajectory.

*How Stochastics apply to $RIDE:*

&amp;#x200B;

[The stochastics of $RIDE, massively oversold](https://preview.redd.it/18ja4exy7vp61.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3505e345a380a91bcaf4ccb9a360f2370230b3e8)

Here we can see a clear example of the fickle nature of the stochastics. This would've been a great indicator to time your exit to buy back in with more capital, however if you used it solely to predict the low you would've been hurting for quite some time. MACD + Bollinger bands are better suited for predicting lows. What this oscillator can tell us, however, is how massively oversold $RIDE is at the moment. No one is buying it; thus there is no demand for some time. And rightfully so, I mean if all you hear was what the media and Hindenburg had to say, would you buy it? But rumors don't last forever, and once you read the fundamentals you'll realize once people catch wind of a small hint of success, any small catalyst, the slightest twitch of demand will rocket the stochastics up, along with the other indicators.

*Price Action:*

PRICE ACTION!!!

Finally, the most important indicator of them all. It's extremely easy as a trader to get caught up in the indicators and forget about the pure price action, the literal actions of actual people (or bots) and not abstract depictions of them. Look at the charts, look at each candlestick (look it up if you don't know what a candlestick means, it's very simple), look for patterns that repeat themselves like TRIANGLES! THE TRIANGLES ARE EVERYWHERE, LEARN ABOUT THEM! There's an amazing post in WSB about triangles and wedges that I could link if it's wanted, I know this post is already huge and price action is its own subject. But beside that, the patterns are everywhere. Don't force anything that doesn't exist, like ""Oh based on the chart of $RIDE you can see a classic cup and handle forming with a potential upside around 25 dollars dur dur dur."" Yes, those patterns exist but often fail, especially when you want to see what isn't there. Let the signs come to you with each candlestick. Here's a nice one for example in the 1-hour period chart of $RIDE:

&amp;#x200B;

[Hammer candle at 9AM EST on March 25th, indicating a rejection of the low of 10.89](https://preview.redd.it/ly708t108vp61.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfdcb839fdae7373e120f36570cd63cfdc5ea702)

Always remember the trend is your friend, long term trends are more valuable than short term as I often use the indicators above to predict breakouts. When looking at trends, please use multiple intervals of time. All of the indicators I have shown here use 1 day as a period, but using 1 day, 1 week, and 1 hour will all tell a very different story. Use these different periods to contextualize movement in the big picture. For example, if we instead look at $RIDE with a period of one week, we are told a different story:

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIDE 1 week period, even long term we're at a floor](https://preview.redd.it/faly3b218vp61.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e0af63d08a442efd445838536fbd370ccdc6e64)

Many of the indicators are still there from the day period, but details are lost, and new ones are gained. We can see this isn’t the first time $RIDE has experienced extreme swings like this, but rarely ever does it get pushed lower than the long-term support it has found now. Use this period and make your own assessment of what you believe will happen over the next few weeks, rather than days, but to me the massive overreaction is still obvious even long-term.

Now that I believe I’ve made a compelling enough case that the market is beginning to shift in its sentiment of $RIDE, completely out of context, it’s time to really strap in as I explain the full scope of why Lordstown Motors is more than just a 10 dollar stock in the real world outside of delicious crayons and tea leaves.

**PART 3: Fundamentals**

And now, finally, we get to hop on the $RIDE (Lordstown Motors, that is): $1.958B Market Cap.

I primarily trade on indicators, so I had to do my DD on the fundamentals here. I decided to view the company’s most recent [investor presentation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Cash on hand over $600 million. Increasing their investments this year for growth and to increase production capacity. Will be down to \~ $250 million cash by EOY. No debt. The company is literally within walking distance of mass producing (not hand-making) the world’s first ever full size electric pick-up truck. An Endurance will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes starting this September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal. Even bumps in the road will still put them miles ahead of competitors. This is mostly due to the head start they got from GM back in 2019 via a massive [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/05/22/gm-lordstown-motors-plant-jobs-electric-pickups-vehicles/5229669002/). 

Their truck is built a little bit differently than others. It has no engine, transmission, differentials, C/V joints, half shafts, fuel pumps, belts, filters or clutches. That’s about 5,000 parts many operating under high stress or high temperatures that you don’t have to worry about. Why? [Because it uses hub motors](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/best-2020-lordstown-motors-wheel-hub-motors/). Without getting too complicated, this essentially means that there is a motor in each wheel. These motors will reduce the number of moving parts to the fewest in the industry, meaning cheaper cost of ownership. Cheaper cost of ownership is great for fleets. This will give trucks true four-wheel drive. But in case they all somehow fail; the truck is designed to work on as little as 1 hub motor for emergency use. You know how many motors can fail in your car before you need to dial Triple A? Now this is not just a crackpot concept by some egghead that thought he had a fun idea. Hub motors have existed for decades and their power and efficiency are proven in the industrial market in things like construction equipment and buses.

All this new technology, ease of maintenance, fail-safes, and a whopping 75 eMPG give Lordstown huge potential demand for fleets, an industry that hasn’t seen innovation in decades, not to mention a 600HP production. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanely thought the truck required 5 motors because he thought they were part of the actual wheel during the investor call. They are actually part of the axle, which means the spare tire does not need to come with a motor. One of the biggest critics of the technology, doesn’t even understand how it works.

Now, I’m sure for some of you I’ve spun quite a beautiful web, and it must be a trap, right? Surely all these prospects are priced in, and the price accurately reflects the potential vs risks? Well, let’s just see $RIDE’s market cap:

$1.958B

That’s right. The rational market currently values $RIDE at about a third of the market cap of $NKLA. A company with one of the largest fully functioning factories in the county, innovative technology, investor and production relations with GM and Camping World, is currently worth a third of a truck that rolls. And why is that? Well, simply put, the market is afraid.

With the recent tech sell off and the Hindenburg report telling everyone $RIDE was a scam all along, wouldn’t you be? So, what did the report actually say anyways? We know they have a factory, concepts, 500+ employees, capital, etc. so what’s the problem? Essentially, Hindenburg called out Lordstown’s 100,000 preorders as non-binding, despite the fact that Lordstown never claimed they were binding. They also went after them by saying they have no “sellable product” and that they are “3-4 years away” from production (according to “former employees”) [even though we have video evidence of them being in beta phase and on track for this September](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). They’re even set to roll out betas [this month](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/northeast-ohio/lordstown-motors-prototype-electric-truck-march-completion/95-357fe0da-c271-40d0-94f7-ce3dc6392e09). And they’ve entered their drivetrain and hub motors into a [race for next month](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/). Ever heard the phrase “buy the fear, sell the greed”? If this company was a fraud just out for money, do you really think they would oust themselves outright by creating such near future timelines instead of stretching them out for more money?

Now, most EV start-ups aren’t generating revenue at the moment, so it wouldn’t be accurate for me to list a P/E ratio for you all. However, we can look at the earnings per share through the last quarter. $RIDE’s EPS currently sits at -0.23 cents, whereas $NKLA was at -0.38 cents, almost 2x more lost per share. If a stock with a negative EPS bothers you, then you might as well move on as this is a speculative, high-growth sector. However, it is quite clear that Lordstown is bleeding much less than its competitors and on a much faster track to success than them.

If you have read this far, you are telling yourself one of two things. 1: This guy is a shill idiot and this is an obvious bubble, I’m not touching any EV stocks. If you’re that guy, why did you even read this far?? And 2: If $RIDE is so undervalued and has all this going for it, why is it still getting pummeled by the Hindenburg report? Surely the market should start to realize what it's doing?

Well, my friend, that’s where the indicators come in from part 2. Because while fundamentals are great, the market has feelings, you have to caress it and ask how its day was, and if you don’t the mood swings will be vast and unpredictable. The feelings of the market do not change overnight though, you have to be poised for when they do that, so you can take the great fundamentals like the ones I have laid out and use the indicators to find a great entry to be a part of them. That great entry just happens to exist right now for $RIDE, which is why I shared it with you all.

**PART 4: All Together Now, Conclusion**

Let's go back to the full chart from the beginning, with a little more drawing this time:

&amp;#x200B;

[All the indicators primed together in beautiful harmony, ready for a massive upswing](https://preview.redd.it/vy203nq28vp61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8450bce910f174fa683f8fd6c77dedac19f1aa5d)

I tried to lay it all out in the picture but this is how a technical analysis looks for me. No one indicator means more than the other and all are used to disprove false positives. In the world of technical analysis, we run with potential. Does the potential upside outweigh downside in long or short term? If only long-term interests you, by all means stick to fundamentals and buy whenever. But for the most bang for your buck, if you want to swing in and out of trades and make a profit to increase your capital for long term investments, you need a foundation of chart reading. And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of 25 to 40 dollars and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this. The fundamentals create catalysts for these indicators, the finger is on the trigger, and it's up to you to decide if you like those or not. But if you decide you like the stock and think the negative publicity from Hindenburg might have bottomed out like the indicators suggest, then use them to time your entries and plan your exits. I see upside to this trade from both long term and short-term perspectives honestly.

I hope that I managed to spice things up from your regularly scheduled discussions with this post, or that at least one person reads this all the way through. Most of all, I hope you all learned a few things, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. This is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby and the same can be said about teaching. I want to see everyone learn, but I don't want anyone to blindly rely on me for financial advice.

Please feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info, and I may edit the post to clarify if needed. I know it's an absolute wall.

**Positions: 35 shares at $13.81 and 2 07/21 $20 calls**

TLDR; I trade stocks based on indicators, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout."

For many of you, this is likely not the first time you have heard of [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/). Polarizing opinions are plentiful, with the zealous believers on one end and the scrooge-esque bears on the other. And in the midst of all this, Hindenburg Research, a five-man team with a lot of money and a focus on activist short selling, have undoubtedly soiled your opinion of this company. I’m not here to encourage any sort of mob mentality, just hoping to share a bit of analysis I’ve done that’s been received well in some places and poorly in others. As I said, with a lot of people it’s either love or hate for this company, so maybe a few of you will hear me out.

Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle company that is primarily focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock. So that’s what I intend to do; using technical analysis and a bunch of crayon charts, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE.

**PART 2: Technical Analysis**

Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators, personally. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with. With so many people also using these indicators and trading off of them, it increases their efficacy even further: a self-fulfilling prophecy. That being said this is my own analysis, so be sure to conduct your own. With that out of the way, let’s get to it.

**Short Interest:**

Before we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address Reddit’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by Fintel, short volume reached its recent peak of 8 million shares, or 30 percent of the total volume, on March 15th, the Monday directly after the short report. The short volume very quickly fell to 13 percent on March 23rd before rising again to 19 percent on Friday. However, the actual short volume on both these days was about 1.2 million shares, so why did the percentage increase? The answer is the total volume for each day. The volume on Friday was a paltry 6 million shares, compared to the stocks average of 13 million. So why are we seeing this consolidation period amidst a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts took their profits and left, realizing the stock was likely to consolidate as the dust settles, and then rally. Not only are they scared of frenzied Reddit users, who will target a stock just to hurt short sellers forcing them to evolve in their strategies, they also realize that $RIDE is just unlikely to fail outright, even with some bumps in the road. They realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their mom’s house.

&amp;#x200B;

[Recent Short Volume Ratio on $RIDE, via Fintel](https://preview.redd.it/iwvdbh6k8vp61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b71823d87c69d8e1c5eeba3713c786a304e196a2)

Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, to a total of 12.5 percent the total float. They have access to the same tools we do to see the shift in the market’s feelings.

**The Baseline:**

&amp;#x200B;

[My cozy little default indicator setup, via Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/2dio8pal8vp61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bb5716829d23698648c60b74e3793a4dcbfec61)

We see here the four indicators that I use to get a baseline for any stock I look at; Bollinger Bands, MACD, Stochastics, and good ol' fashioned candlestick price action. I'm gonna break it down Barney style and explain how they each relate to $RIDE for those who have never seen or heard of them, so skip to the ""How it applies to $RIDE"" sections if you don’t need an explanation. It's confusing to log in to your brokerage app every day and just see a single snapshot of what the price is for that day. You might see these dips and you feel frustrated; you think this stock is undervalued (or you will soon) but the market doesn't seem to get it yet. Maybe you were lied to. It’s unclear from price alone if the market is beginning to change its mind. That's where indicators come in:

**Indicators Explained and Applied to $RIDE**

*Bollinger Bands:*

This is the indicator we see in the top third quadrant, specifically it is the blue tube that surrounds the candlestick chart as it moves up and down. Simply put, Bollinger Bands use a simple moving average of a stock (mine is set to a period of 20.2) in order to smooth out the craziness of its movements over time. It then plots red lines 2 to 3 standard deviations (mine is set to 2.5 standard deviations) above and below the average. If anyone remembers the bell curve from high school, that's what a standard deviation is.

&amp;#x200B;

[The bell curve, a middle school classic](https://preview.redd.it/wk38aocm8vp61.jpg?width=588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec9541bfacf4f2e03652c04595975ce53386df6c)

Each movement left and right on a bell curve is called a standard deviation, and it encompasses a certain amount of the data from a given set. In the case of Bollinger Bands, that set is price action. When Bollinger Bands are set to 2 standard deviations, for example, that means that 95 percent of the price action of that stock will occur within that tube, and there is a very low likelihood the stock will break out of the bands.

Now you may be asking: how does this indicator determine the standard deviations of price action before it happens anyways? The answer in short: volatility. As a stock’s volatility increases, the bands widen, as they decrease, they constrict. Within a given period of time the price action of a stock will bounce back and forth within this tube, and as volatility changes, so will the size of the tube. Traders use the location of the price within the tube as well as the growth/shrinkage of the tube as buy/sell signals.

*How the Bands apply to $RIDE:*

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIDES Bollinger bands](https://preview.redd.it/72hwrndn8vp61.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1fdbd222ca7cc914344caa54574beb57e3575a)

This indicator, when applied to $RIDE in isolation, is unfortunately bit up in the air. The tube is currently very wide due to the stock’s extreme volatility. A typical sign to lookout for on the bands is the squeeze/breakout cycle in which the bands constrict due to lower volatility at the moment, and then breakout in an upswing of volatility, as seen below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of a Bollinger band squeeze and breakout](https://preview.redd.it/ijnsjavp8vp61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c4684ae1a823133f6d950a324420581587449b)

We could spot this forming if the ends of the red lines on the top and bottom began to hook inwards, similar to the area I point to using the very poorly drawn arrows. This is something to look out for, but hasn't happened yet. One thing we can see, however, is the price action’s location within the bands. We see it currently trading at or near the lower range of the deviations, which historically can’t happen forever. While the moving average can continue moving down, lowering the range, the stock will still likely move back up within that range at some point, getting close to the top red line. Since the moving average has started flattening out again, this is a nice indicator the stock will at least approach 20 dollars again sometime in the short term (the top of the range seen in red is currently at 22.285 dollars) but not much else to go off with just this. Keep an eye out for a consolidation in the near future leading to a Bollinger squeeze.

*Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):*

My personal favorite indicator, as I consider myself a swing trader, not a day trader. This indicator nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock price. They get it by subtracting a long period exponential moving average (EMA) from a shorter EMA (in my setup I use 8 period minus 17 period since it's more sensitive, however 12 and 26 is most common). The result of this difference creates the purple moving line, which is called the MACD line. The purple line is then plotted with a 9 day EMA in orange, which is called the signal line. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events, and as you can see historically with $RIDE, the MACD has certainly predicted these events before. However, this indicator is not perfect and does not predict how large a breakout may be (which is why we compare it to the volatility shown to us by the Bollinger Bands to find more specific price targets and ranges). It can also provide false positives, such as the lines crossing each other multiple times, or approaching each other and reversing without ever touching.

However, in times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD can often result in violent reversals when they tough. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a reddit favorite around here; GameStop:

&amp;#x200B;

[GameStop MACD analysis after recent 40 dollar dip](https://preview.redd.it/zrhc3v7r8vp61.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b3c75ef2d451deda30228073790b89127818b47)

A friend and I both noticed this crossover beginning to form and bought more the week of the event. We couldn’t have known how high it would go and average out along the way, but the easing off downward pressure made it appealing. It doesn't always work so well, but in this case the MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift; the bears were losing. And as I said before, violent downswings can result in violent upswings. We couldn't predict how much it would go up but however one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day.

You may also notice the histogram bars with the MACD. Do not get confused; the bars at the bottom are just a different way to show the same thing, but it's easier to see reversals cause its color coded. Green means the purple line has moved closer to the orange, which signals a potential slowing and reversal of selling momentum. This is the sign we used to buy in.

*How the MACD applies to $RIDE:*

Now this indicator makes me giddy to see, it's much less up in the air as the bands are. Does the chart below look familiar to anyone? Or did I lose any goldfish attention spans since the very last chart of GME? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself:

&amp;#x200B;

[Potential breakout](https://preview.redd.it/e8dnerit8vp61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b50960468fc8f25f67550187a26c075d3ef2622)

This, my friends, was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. We can see that from a historical perspective, the MACD has followed a massive uptrend before based on being very far below the center line and swinging down violently. Coincidentally, we recently had another event that pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was). Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and continued to approach the signal line in orange. I won't get into why this happens, but it's a good sign. Negative pressure is clearly decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. However, such a violent downswing creates potential for a violent upswing, after all the MACD doesn't want to stay shoved below the centerline for long, it oscillates up and down and in the case of MACD, what goes down must come up. This doesn't indicate an overall trend for the stock, but I've never seen a MACD just go down forever. There will be a correction at some point, and we will have to see if this results in a trend reversal.

One thing we should all agree on: this MACD is beautiful. When you see a MACD like this, honestly there aren't many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the great depression part 2 is starting.

*The Stochastics:*

An indicator that, for me, simply provides context to the other main 3 that I use. The premise of Stochastics is that when a stock trends upwards, its closing price tends to trade at the high end of the day's range or price action. Price action refers to the range of prices at which a stock trades throughout the daily session. For example, if a stock opened at $10, traded as low as $9.75 and as high as $10.75, then closed at $10.50 for the day, the price action or range would be between $9.75 (the low of the day) and $10.75 (the high of the day). Conversely, if the price has a downward movement, the closing price tends to trade at or near the low range of the day's trading session.

Thus, Stochastics is used to show when a stock has moved into an overbought or oversold position. It can assist in determining if bulls or bears have enough fuel to continue their push in whatever direction. If the stock is overbought, demand is high and there are a lot of buyers. If it’s oversold then supply is too high, the price is dropping and no one is buying. Neither situation can last forever and thus small reversals occur. These are usually found in the upper 80 percentile and lower 20 percentile range, as a stock cannot remain 80 percent bought or 80 percent sold for long.

Another element of the stochastic is the red and black lines, which can be thought of as buyers and sellers. The black line is buyers and the red is sellers. When they cross, you can visualize if the bears or bulls are starting to overtake the other. When black is above red, buyers are stronger and when red is above black, sellers are stronger.

The Stochastic oscillator is often very accurate and easy to understand, thus widely used, however it is most finicky and can remain overbought or oversold for long periods of time or reverse at the slightest change in momentum. Therefore, it should be used to provide context to the more speculative indicators such as MACD and Bollinger Bands, i.e.; is the stock oversold enough to support the thesis of a reversal? Or is it still hovering in the middle or overbought and is likely to continue its downward trajectory.

*How Stochastics apply to $RIDE:*

&amp;#x200B;

[The stochastics of $RIDE, massively oversold](https://preview.redd.it/qphn0x7v8vp61.png?width=1189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7942c17a7cb9b6efb97da6ccccc1eb001029028d)

Here we can see a clear example of the fickle nature of the stochastics. This would've been a great indicator to time your exit to buy back in with more capital, however if you used it solely to predict the low you would've been hurting for quite some time. MACD + Bollinger bands are better suited for predicting lows. What this oscillator can tell us, however, is how massively oversold $RIDE is at the moment. No one is buying it; thus there is no demand for some time. And rightfully so, I mean if all you hear was what the media and Hindenburg had to say, would you buy it? But rumors don't last forever, and once you read the fundamentals you'll realize once people catch wind of a small hint of success, any small catalyst, the slightest twitch of demand will rocket the stochastics up, along with the other indicators.

*Price Action:*

PRICE ACTION!!!

Finally, the most important indicator of them all. It's extremely easy as a trader to get caught up in the indicators and forget about the pure price action, the literal actions of actual people (or bots) and not abstract depictions of them. Look at the charts, look at each candlestick (look it up if you don't know what a candlestick means, it's very simple), look for patterns that repeat themselves like TRIANGLES! THE TRIANGLES ARE EVERYWHERE, LEARN ABOUT THEM! There's an amazing post in WSB about triangles and wedges that I could link if it's wanted, I know this post is already huge and price action is its own subject. But beside that, the patterns are everywhere. Don't force anything that doesn't exist, like ""Oh based on the chart of $RIDE you can see a classic cup and handle forming with a potential upside around 25 dollars dur dur dur."" Yes, those patterns exist but often fail, especially when you want to see what isn't there. Let the signs come to you with each candlestick. Here's a nice one for example in the 1-hour period chart of $RIDE:

&amp;#x200B;

[Hammer candle at 9AM EST on March 25th, indicating a rejection of the low of 10.89](https://preview.redd.it/grhbgsdw8vp61.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138260967fd2d4e6327ce4ef5d88c98773c81882)

Always remember the trend is your friend, long term trends are more valuable than short term as I often use the indicators above to predict breakouts. When looking at trends, please use multiple intervals of time. All of the indicators I have shown here use 1 day as a period, but using 1 day, 1 week, and 1 hour will all tell a very different story. Use these different periods to contextualize movement in the big picture. For example, if we instead look at $RIDE with a period of one week, we are told a different story:

&amp;#x200B;

[$RIDE 1 week period, even long term we're at a floor](https://preview.redd.it/og0rfj7x8vp61.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=332a1feaac425afd3bd49c11553d1e969f5b383a)

Many of the indicators are still there from the day period, but details are lost, and new ones are gained. We can see this isn’t the first time $RIDE has experienced extreme swings like this, but rarely ever does it get pushed lower than the long-term support it has found now. Use this period and make your own assessment of what you believe will happen over the next few weeks, rather than days, but to me the massive overreaction is still obvious even long-term.

Now that I believe I’ve made a compelling enough case that the market is beginning to shift in its sentiment of $RIDE, completely out of context, it’s time to really strap in as I explain the full scope of why Lordstown Motors is more than just a 10 dollar stock in the real world outside of delicious crayons and tea leaves.

**PART 3: Fundamentals**

And now, finally, we get to hop on the $RIDE (Lordstown Motors, that is): $1.958B Market Cap.

I primarily trade on indicators, so I had to do my DD on the fundamentals here. I decided to view the company’s most recent [investor presentation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Cash on hand over $600 million. Increasing their investments this year for growth and to increase production capacity. Will be down to \~ $250 million cash by EOY. No debt. The company is literally within walking distance of mass producing (not hand-making) the world’s first ever full size electric pick-up truck. An Endurance will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes starting this September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal. Even bumps in the road will still put them miles ahead of competitors. This is mostly due to the head start they got from GM back in 2019 via a massive [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/05/22/gm-lordstown-motors-plant-jobs-electric-pickups-vehicles/5229669002/). 

Their truck is built a little bit differently than others. It has no engine, transmission, differentials, C/V joints, half shafts, fuel pumps, belts, filters or clutches. That’s about 5,000 parts many operating under high stress or high temperatures that you don’t have to worry about. Why? [Because it uses hub motors](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/best-2020-lordstown-motors-wheel-hub-motors/). Without getting too complicated, this essentially means that there is a motor in each wheel. These motors will reduce the number of moving parts to the fewest in the industry, meaning cheaper cost of ownership. Cheaper cost of ownership is great for fleets. This will give trucks true four-wheel drive. But in case they all somehow fail; the truck is designed to work on as little as 1 hub motor for emergency use. You know how many motors can fail in your car before you need to dial Triple A? Now this is not just a crackpot concept by some egghead that thought he had a fun idea. Hub motors have existed for decades and their power and efficiency are proven in the industrial market in things like construction equipment and buses.

All this new technology, ease of maintenance, fail-safes, and a whopping 75 eMPG give Lordstown huge potential demand for fleets, an industry that hasn’t seen innovation in decades, not to mention a 600HP production. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanely thought the truck required 5 motors because he thought they were part of the actual wheel during the investor call. They are actually part of the axle, which means the spare tire does not need to come with a motor. One of the biggest critics of the technology, doesn’t even understand how it works.

Now, I’m sure for some of you I’ve spun quite a beautiful web, and it must be a trap, right? Surely all these prospects are priced in, and the price accurately reflects the potential vs risks? Well, let’s just see $RIDE’s market cap:

$1.958B

That’s right. The rational market currently values $RIDE at about a third of the market cap of $NKLA. A company with one of the largest fully functioning factories in the county, innovative technology, investor and production relations with GM and Camping World, is currently worth a third of a truck that rolls. And why is that? Well, simply put, the market is afraid.

With the recent tech sell off and the Hindenburg report telling everyone $RIDE was a scam all along, wouldn’t you be? So, what did the report actually say anyways? We know they have a factory, concepts, 500+ employees, capital, etc. so what’s the problem? Essentially, Hindenburg called out Lordstown’s 100,000 preorders as non-binding, despite the fact that Lordstown never claimed they were binding. They also went after them by saying they have no “sellable product” and that they are “3-4 years away” from production (according to “former employees”) [even though we have video evidence of them being in beta phase and on track for this September](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). They’re even set to roll out betas [this month](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/northeast-ohio/lordstown-motors-prototype-electric-truck-march-completion/95-357fe0da-c271-40d0-94f7-ce3dc6392e09). And they’ve entered their drivetrain and hub motors into a [race for next month](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/). Ever heard the phrase “buy the fear, sell the greed”? If this company was a fraud just out for money, do you really think they would oust themselves outright by creating such near future timelines instead of stretching them out for more money?

Now, most EV start-ups aren’t generating revenue at the moment, so it wouldn’t be accurate for me to list a P/E ratio for you all. However, we can look at the earnings per share through the last quarter. $RIDE’s EPS currently sits at -0.23 cents, whereas $NKLA was at -0.38 cents, almost 2x more lost per share. If a stock with a negative EPS bothers you, then you might as well move on as this is a speculative, high-growth sector. However, it is quite clear that Lordstown is bleeding much less than its competitors and on a much faster track to success than them.

If you have read this far, you are telling yourself one of two things. 1: This guy is a shill idiot and this is an obvious bubble, I’m not touching any EV stocks. If you’re that guy, why did you even read this far?? And 2: If $RIDE is so undervalued and has all this going for it, why is it still getting pummeled by the Hindenburg report? Surely the market should start to realize what it's doing?

Well, my friend, that’s where the indicators come in from part 2. Because while fundamentals are great, the market has feelings, you have to caress it and ask how its day was, and if you don’t the mood swings will be vast and unpredictable. The feelings of the market do not change overnight though, you have to be poised for when they do that, so you can take the great fundamentals like the ones I have laid out and use the indicators to find a great entry to be a part of them. That great entry just happens to exist right now for $RIDE, which is why I shared it with you all.

**PART 4: All Together Now, Conclusion**

Let's go back to the full chart from the beginning, with a little more drawing this time:

&amp;#x200B;

[All the indicators primed together in beautiful harmony, ready for a massive upswing](https://preview.redd.it/d4ds0wdy8vp61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d954e6bd1f23b3e6c8470f3b7724cdf25466663)

I tried to lay it all out in the picture but this is how a technical analysis looks for me. No one indicator means more than the other and all are used to disprove false positives. In the world of technical analysis, we run with potential. Does the potential upside outweigh downside in long or short term? If only long-term interests you, by all means stick to fundamentals and buy whenever. But for the most bang for your buck, if you want to swing in and out of trades and make a profit to increase your capital for long term investments, you need a foundation of chart reading. And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of 25 to 40 dollars and not enough potential for a further crash to justify ignoring this. The fundamentals create catalysts for these indicators, the finger is on the trigger, and it's up to you to decide if you like those or not. But if you decide you like the stock and think the negative publicity from Hindenburg might have bottomed out like the indicators suggest, then use them to time your entries and plan your exits. I see upside to this trade from both long term and short-term perspectives honestly.

I hope that I managed to spice things up from your regularly scheduled discussions with this post, or that at least one person reads this all the way through. Most of all, I hope you all learned a few things, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. This is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby and the same can be said about teaching. I want to see everyone learn, but I don't want anyone to blindly rely on me for financial advice.

Please feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info, and I may edit the post to clarify if needed. I know it's an absolute wall.

**Positions: 35 shares at $13.81 and 2 07/21 $20 calls**

TLDR; I trade stocks based on indicators, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout."

Sorry this is late- I allocated my free time and attention to some questionable movie choices this past week in lieu of wrapping this up. Since I'm now sliming the fresh BK I got from the scratcher before double AP begins, I suppose I also have the time to close this out.

&amp;#x200B;

The long answer questions are gonna be pushed to the end, which puts us at...

&amp;#x200B;

#  Bonus Questions! 

&amp;#x200B;

#  Which character most deserves a rework? 

1. ""Fire Heles 🙏"" 18
2. ""Chat Noir, guy's a mess"" 16
3.  Korwa 16
4.  Clarisse (Fire) 14
5.  Yggdrasil 14
6.  Ilsa (Earth) 13
7. ""Forte again"" 11
8.  Sarasa/Threo 10
9.  Cerberus 8
10.  Rosetta (Grand) 7

Lot of classic picks here at the top with the top 10 taking 47.2% of the total. A few of these have already seen reworks, so I admire the sub's dedication to LOST CAUSES.

As someone who was personally offended by KMR skipping dirt Eustace (6) for an uncap because I suptixd Ilsa and Eustace years ago with the ~~foolish~~ belief that one day they'd both receive 5 star uncaps, I too demand an Ilsa rework as compensation.

I think the character most likely to get a rework with a 5 star this year or next is Clarisse because she:

a. is always popular 

[b.](https://b.got) got a rework in light

c. We get about 1 Alchemist event per year

d. her kit in fire is trash but they didn't touch it along with light. 

e. I just looked at her kit again.

Of course, if she receives a swimsuit version this summer ignore everything I just said. Other safe picks include Rosetta and possibly Korwa because of her swimsuit rework and she's long overdue.

Feel free to offer your desperate and conspiratorial takes on the other characters' potential reworks below.

&amp;#x200B;

#  Which character would you like to receive a Grand version? 

1. Lyria	26
2. Narmaya	16
3. Adam	13
4. Beatrix	9
5. ""BELIAL""	9
6. ""CASSIUS STRAIGHT TO GRAND PLS""	9
7. Ilsa	9
8. Fenrir	7
9. Forte	7
10. Loki	7
11. Pommern	7

The year is 2022. People are without money to pay for food, shelter, or basic utilities after a world historic global financial crash. All at once on Jan 1st, an unprecedented amount of money flowed from banks worldwide into a company called Cygames, crippling world trade and finance in the process. It wasn't enough to just spark Lyria (Grand); every primal water player needed a grid filled with uncapped Vyrn Plushies (Water) (Sabre) to make water competitive with other elements in null-ele raid racing.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry. Good to see Lyria so dominant at the top of a poll and Fenrir + Loki present in one.  I think these are all sound, but I'd swap Adam with Pommern, and then replace Adam with **anyone else**.

If we got Lyria, would she be Any Ele like her SR, or would they commit to one?

Now, a sneak preview: 

Adam (Grand) skills, courtesy of next month's Granblue Channel!

Element: Water

1. I Will Block That Attack!: Substitute (All-Ally)
2. Stern Encouragement: normal team atk up. Duration: 1 to 3 chapters. Depends on when you forget he made an appearance.
3. Do Nothing For 10 Chapters: head to backline, swap back in after a year or so to use skill 1 or 2 (random), then return to backline.

Passive: At battle start, activate skill 3.

#  Which R or SR character would you like to receive a SSR version? 

1. ""Jamil - stop neglecting my boy cygames""	17
2. Lyria	17
3. Meg	17
4.  Camieux  15
5. Walder	13
6. Spinnah	12
7. Ejaeli	10
8. Sevastien	10
9. Elmott	9
10. Cassius	7
11. You	7

Always interesting to leave SSR territory. Hoping we'll get some Meg this year. Cygames is certainly aware of how big of a hit her event was. I think the top 5 are all nearly guaranteed within the next year  or two, but with 6-9 who can say? All good picks though and I hope they all receive the SSRs they deserve.

Gonna do the next 10 because I think these are fun. I'll note: as the numbers get smaller, the higher probability they're inaccurate in my counting. Please give them all SSRs, KMR pls.

1. Balurga	6
2. Barawa	6
3. Cordelia	6
4. La Coiffe	6
5. Lowain	6
6. Erin	5
7. Joel	5
8. Yaia	5
9. Friday	4
10. Nene 4 

#  Which character would you like to see added to GBVS? 

1. Sandalphon	30
2. Seox	22
3. Beatrix	9
4. Grimnir	8
5. Yuisis	7
6. ""Anila, her moveset being a homage to Terry from the Fatal Fury series would be dope""	6
7. Drang	5
8. Ilsa	5
9. Siegfried	5
10. Vane	5
11. Vira	5

Angel boy's here sucking up all the air in the room. Luckily for all of you, he's a guaranteed add! Only question is whether he's season 2 or 3. From the top down, Grimnir is the 1st non-obvious one, and would likely be a good fit. Actually, they'd all be good fits, although you know Ilsa would be the type of cursed Guilty Gear character who punishes you from across the screen every time you whiff. Granted, Ilsa fans enjoy a little punishment.

Any other genre, please: Rosine  (1)

# Final thoughts from skyfarers 

I'm gonna close out here and thank everyone again for taking the time to respond if you did, and taking the time to read through any of this if you managed that as well. I hope everyone found something interesting to take away from all this data- I certainly did- and I hope to do this again some other time with a much better organized survey format.

Now for some other final thoughts:

"" i'am here for 2 years i have no idea what i am doing, i just know that's the gacha compells me to roll ""

"" Cygames taking so long to add elemental gold bar raids that Light has almost reached their burst turns. ""

"" I discovered this game when the quarantine started, and it helped me a lot through last year. It's very rewarding and a great escapism. ""

"" Remove shalems pacifier ""

"" :3 ""

"" Happy Grinding ""

"" Don't go chasing other people's paths, find what you actually like from the game and stick with it. It's a 7 year old game with enough content for everyone, from people who want to see numbers go BRRR, to people who just want to get immersed in a fantastical world. ""

"" Came in for the husbandos, stayed for the charming characters and interesting power progression... and the husbandos ""

"" FA is a blessing. Thanks for the continuing efforts of Cygames!! ""

"" I never thought I'd ever reach a point in this game where not only I can easily blitz earlier content but I'm also knowledgeable enough about how the game works that I can help my friends who are new to the game. It's nice to have actual evidence that shows just how far one has progressed. Helping out new players has really upped my confidence in my skills with this game.  To any new players out there who might read this: If you're willing to put the time in your efforts WILL be rewarded even if you don't notice it at first. ""

"" I just really want a playable Belial man it's been 3 years ""

"" You are here forever\~ ""

"" It's a nice game and all but i'm still waiting for Miku collab ""

"" Does anybody else think that Beatrix gets bullied a little too hard by Cygames? They teased her addition to GBVS when Zeta and Vaseraga were revealed and now even Eustace is in the game! Would anybody object to giving up another character slot for poor Bea? ""

"" During lockdown the regular schedule of GBF and monthly events was a blessing. I'm really thankful for full auto and Skyleap, I'd be too busy with work to play otherwise. ""

"" This game has totally destroyed me. Also, the OST is really good. ""

"" I hope I can still play this game years into the future! ""

"" Boy, Knickknack Shack sure is generous! ""

Archegos Capital collapse - the margin call and its impact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mfja8m/archegos_capital_collapse_the_margin_call_and_its/,digitalpho3nix,1,2021-03-29 14:27:18,49,/r/ASX_Bets/comments/mfja8m/archegos_capital_collapse_the_margin_call_and_its/,NaN,"So this crooked MF called Bill Hwang who runs Archegos Capital has been margin called on his US$30B portfolio, triggering massive drops on large cap stocks in the US exchanges. I'm yet to turn up their most recent 13F filing to see what they hold, but I don't think you are required to disclose your short positions to the SEC as part of the 13F (which seems so strange to me, but anyway).

ViacomCBS, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent, VipShop, Farfetch, GSX Techedu (all large cap companies) all had large drops this week. Viacom and Discovery both ended a crushing **\~50% down** for the week.

Many of these Chinese companies listed on NYSE and NASDAQ are included in the $ASIA ETF which has been taking on water in the last 5 weeks or so. As far as I can see, there is a broader trend of selling off these Chinese stocks, as several companies not named in these articles are heavily sliding also. The block selling by the big US banks is still continuing to recover their capital from Archegos, so we aren't done yet.

I don't think this is anywhere close to a GFC level event as suggested by u/atayls , but safe to say that when a reasonably sized fund falls over in this manner then all the big players will be sure to check their shit pretty carefully which will cause some conservatism short term.

So I guess the question I've been trying to answer is whether to sell my $ASIA, hold out, or buy more?

I personally think it might broadly be far too late to sell. Considering that very broadly, the constituent companies are all still the same, the SP's will all come back up (eventually). But I'm expecting that the SP slide of $ASIA will continue for some time yet. I think I will be looking for an opportunity to average down when the SP curve bottoms out.

Bloody Wall Streeters.

DeFi explained: Liquidity pools,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mfk2oi/defi_explained_liquidity_pools/,Fantastic-Cucumber-1,1,2021-03-29 15:26:54,43,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mfk2oi/defi_explained_liquidity_pools/,SUPPORT,"You may have come across the theory of liquidity pools in the Defi ecosystem.

But what are liquidity pools and how do they work? And why do we really need them in decentralized finance? In this post I will explain how they work, their main benefits and general aspects.

# What are liquidity pools?

Liquidity pools are pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. By offering liquidity, they guarantee trading, and because of this, they are widely used by decentralized exchanges. DeFi platform Bancor took one of the first initiatives to include liquidity pools.

Liquidity pools, in essence, are the trading aspect of a decentralized exchange. Their role is to increase the liquidity of the market among market participants.

# How do liquidity pools work?

In its simplest form, a single liquidity pool contains 2 tokens and each pool establishes a new market for the same pair of tokens. DAI / ETH is perhaps a clear example of a popular liquidity pool at Uniswap.

The first liquidity provider, when a new pool is created, is the one who decides the initial price of the assets in the pool. The liquidity provider is encouraged to provide the pool with an equivalent value of all tokens.

Based on the liquidity provided to a pool, the liquidity provider (LP) receives special tokens called LP tokens in proportion to how much liquidity they provide to the pool. A charge of 0.3% is allocated proportionally to all LP token holders when a transaction occurred in the pool.

The liquidity providers needs to burn their LP tokens if they want to get their underlying liquidity back, plus any unpaid fees. By utilizing a deterministic price algorithm, any token swap within a liquidity pool results in a price shift. This process is also referred to as an automatic market maker (AMM).

A constant commodity market maker algorithm is used for basic liquidity pools such as the one used by Uniswap, which means that the amounts of the 2 tokens given remain the same. In addition, a pool still has liquidity, no matter how massive a trade, because of the algorithm. The main reason for this is that as the target amount increases, the algorithm increases the price of the token asymptotically.

## The importance of liquidity

The reason that liquidity is so important is that it largely determines how the price of an asset can shift. In a market with low liquidity, a relatively limited number of open orders are open on both sides of the order book. This suggests that one trade can shift the price significantly in any direction, making the stock unpredictable and unattractive. Because of this, liquidity pools are an important part of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) revolution.

## What are liquidity pools in Defi?

Liquidity pools are intended to successfully address the low liquidity problem and thus ensure that the price of a token does not fluctuate significantly after executing the order of a single large trade.

As mentioned earlier, decentralized exchanges offer bonuses to those who invest in the liquidity pools to maximize engagement. The user has to deposit money into the liquidity pool to reap the benefits and take advantage of it. Liquidity pools are regulated by one or more smart contract protocols. The amount of funds to be invested and the proportional ratio of each token will vary between different DeFi platforms.

## How to participate in a liquidity pool?

To provide $50 in liquidity in an ETH / USDC pool, it requires a deposit of $50 in ETH and $50 USDC. In this situation, a total deposit of $100 is required. In return, the liquidity provider collects tokens for the liquidity pool. These tokens reflect their proportional pool share and allow them to withdraw their pool share at any time.

Every time a seller places a trade, a trade fee is deducted from the trade and the order is sent to the smart contract with the liquidity pool. The trading fee is set at 0.3% for most decentralized exchanges. In this case, if you deposit $50 ETH and $50 USDC and you make 1% of the pool with your donation. You will then receive 1% of the 0.3% trading fee for one of the specific trades.

## How do liquidity pool exchanges work?

There are currently two types of decentralized exchanges in the DeFi space, namely:

* **Exchange of order book:** The order book exchanges depend on a bid / ask arrangement to fulfill trades. Orders are redirected to an order book when a new buy or sell order is placed. Then the exchange's matching engine executes matching orders for the same price. Examples of order book exchanges are 0x and Radar Relay.
* **Liquidity pool exchanges:** LP exchanges exclude the emphasis of order book trading from their exchange. By doing this, they enable the exchange to keep the liquidity level stable. Examples of LP exchanges are Kyber, Uniswap and Curve Finance.

## Advantages of liquidity pools

* **Guaranteed liquidity at any price level:** Traders do not need to be directly connected with other traders as liquidity is constant, as long as clients have invested their assets in the pool.
* **Automated Pricing Enables Passive Market Making:** Liquidity providers put their money into the pool and the pricing is controlled by the pool’s smart contract.
* **Anyone can become and earn a liquidity provider:** Liquidity pools do not require listing fees, KYCs or other obstacles associated with centralized exchanges. If an investor wants to provide liquidity to the pool, he only needs to deposit the equivalent of the assets.
* **Lower gas fees:** Gas fees are reduced by the minimal smart contract design offered by decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. Effective price calculations and fee allocations within the pool imply less volatility between transactions. Uniswap V3 will reduce the gas fees even (30%) more.

## Returns

The return of the liquidity pool depends on three factors:

* The asset prices upon delivery and withdrawal
* The size of the liquidity pool
* The trading volumes.

It is very important to remember that, in proportion to what’s originally invested, investors would end up removing some ratio of assets. This is where the market movement can work either with or against you.

## Risks of Liquidity Pool

Of course, as with everything in DeFi, you have to consider the potential risks. Some of the associated liquidity risks are listed below:

* Impermanent loss
* Possible smart contract bugs.
* Liquidity pool hacks
* Systemic risks

## Impermanent losses

Before you join a liquidity pool, I would like to stress out the impact of impermanent losses. 

Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of funds occurring when providing liquidity. It’s very often explained as a difference between holding an asset versus providing liquidity in that asset. Impermanent loss is usually observed in standard liquidity pools where the liquidity provider has to provide both assets, and one of the assets is volatile in relation to the other, for example, in a Uniswap USDC/ETH liquidity pool.

If ETH goes up in value, the pool continually has to rely on arbitrageurs ensuring that the pool price reflects the real-world price to maintain the same value of both tokens in the pool. This basically leads to a situation where profit from the token that appreciated in value is taken away from the liquidity provider by the arbitrageurs. At this point, if the LP decides to withdraw their liquidity, the impermanent loss becomes permanent.

## LP tokens

Like any other tokens, a user can use the tokens from the liquidity pool during the period of the smart contract. A user can therefore deposit this token on another platform that accepts the liquidity pool token to get additional yield to maximize returns. Therefore, the user can compose two or three interest rates using yield farming, and ultimately increase returns. 

An example of such a DeFi platform is harvest.finance. Harvest.finance allows the user to stake their LP tokens and rewards them with additional rewards **on top** of their fees rewards from the liquidity pool. In harvest.finance’s case, they reward the user with FARM tokens. 

So as an example: Let’s say you have deposited $100 in a USDC/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 50%. The received UNI LP tokens can then be staked at havest.finance for additional rewards, which in this case would be 70% FARM APY. This means that you would receive in 1 year:

* $50 in LP ($25 in USDC and $25 in ETH tokens).
* $70 in FARM tokens.

As you can see, by staking your LP tokens rewards can be highly lucrative. By utilizing these techniques, APY’s of over 200% can be achieved. Of course, you need to remember that the price of tokens such as FARM are quite volatile and thus are risking to turn your $70 in FARM into way less amount of $ in a matter of days. 

If you are interested in yield farming, I would recommend to use DeFi dashboard zapper.fi, which gives a great overview of all current liquidity pools and farms. 

## Final words

Liquidity pools provide a user-friendly platform for both users and exchanges. The user does not have to meet any special eligibility criteria to participate in liquidity pools, which means that anyone can participate in the provision of liquidity for a token pair. In the DeFi ecosystem, liquidity pools play an essential role, and the concept has been able to increase the level of decentralization.

Coming from a small coastal town, I hated NY- got a 2.5 GPA my freshman year first semester and pass/failed the majority of my courses second semester.

COVID hit, couldn't land a single internship. Returned to NY, joined ROTC briefly for a career change only to be medically DQ'ed this past fall. Back to looking into a business career and got decent grades last semester (3.7).

I managed to join a good consulting club and get a fintech start-up internship for this spring by leveraging my chronic gaming/PC addiction and a few connections. However, my peers and a mentor frontloaded me with a crash course on finance, and after a couple months of research, high-end finance is somewhere I'd like to end up.

What should be my next steps as of right now? I'm trying to coffee chat as many people as possible (high execs, current analysts, and upperclassmen), but I feel way behind the curve having no finance experience.

I'm so torn as articles will say I need a PE/HF/IB/Diversity internship for sophomore to junior summer, while others claim I just need relevant finance experience.

I've established a decent relationship with a HF PM who has taken me under his wing by giving me resources to study, but I'm assuming that's a litmus test for him to see if I'm truly interested so haven't asked for anything else.

Should I be reaching out to boutiques to get possible work for this summer, or is it too late being almost April?

I also saw on a few forums that working at a local well-known bank's retail brokerage filing papers, running coffee etc. could be a good look on my resume.

Would this be a good way to get future positions or am I just wasting my time?

A lot of information, so I'm going to end it here in hopes I outlined the situation properly. Thanks in advance."
Intro Ellipsis.finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/ellipsisFinance/comments/mfm0tc/intro_ellipsisfinance/,GymCrypto,1,2021-03-29 17:55:37,0,/r/ellipsisFinance/comments/mfm0tc/intro_ellipsisfinance/,NaN," From the official medium post: [https://ellipsisfinance.medium.com/introducing-ellipsis-finance-735cba834e91](https://ellipsisfinance.medium.com/introducing-ellipsis-finance-735cba834e91)

Ellipsis.finance is an exchange for stable coins on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It allows for stable coins swap with very low slippage and minimal fees.

# Ellipsis

Ellipsis is an authorised fork of Curve Finance. As a result of this agreement, veCRV holders will receive 25% of the supply over the next 12 months.

Curve Finance will provide support to the Ellipsis team. We have committed to Curve core values of which are :

a. no deposit or withdrawal fees,

b. no lock ups on liquidity, and

c. extremely efficient stable coin swaps.

# Utility

The Ellipsis token (EPS) is a revenue earning token. EPS stakers can earn fees from the Ellipsis protocol.

# Trading Fees

Fees will be equally split between EPS stakers and liquidity providers (50%/50%).

# Reward Pool and Staking Pool

Liquidity providers will receive their EPS from **the reward pool**. Rewarded EPS **claims trading fees and vest over three months. It’s possible to skip the vesting for a 50% early exit penalty.** The tax is distributed to users who locked in the staking pool.

The staking pool **receives trading fees** as well as the EPS tax from people exiting the reward pool early for those who chose to lock for a period of three months. The staking pool has mandatory no lock-up.

# LP Rewards

80% of those rewards will be distributed to liquidity providers while 20% will be distributed to EPS/BNB Liquidity Providers.

5% — Month 1

Introduction to OMGs financial indicator standard,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOTAmarkets/comments/mfouc7/introduction_to_omgs_financial_indicator_standard/,thekashmere,1,2021-03-29 20:48:26,15,/r/IOTAmarkets/comments/mfouc7/introduction_to_omgs_financial_indicator_standard/,NaN,"Hi Guys,

So last week I put up a post with the schedule of [IOTA Standardization meetings with OMG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/mbbvyy/iota_standardization_technical_meetings_with_omg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I basically went down the rabbit hole and I would like to share some of my findings on this topic today. It will be too long for one post so I will divide it into two parts. Part one is an introduction to OMG and their financial indicator standard and part two is about the demand for financial indicators for crypto and Dr. Richard Soley, Chairman and CEO of Object Management Group (OMG) direct involvement with IOTA as the chairman of IOTA Foundation Supervisory Board. tl;dr at the bottom.

This is part 1: Introduction to OMG's financial indicator standard

First of all, what is the Object Management Group? The Object Management Group or OMG for short is a computer industry standards consortium founded in 1989 by eleven companies (including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, American Airlines, iGrafx, and Data General).

So what does a computer standards consortium have to do with finance? Well the OMG Finance Domain Task Force (Finance DTF) was established to help the market understand that data is a business asset. It promotes the notion that data and its semantics (business meaning, context and rules) is the DNA of financial services. It is not just the money but the information about money that is equally critical to manage. The Finance DFT develops innovative strategies, best practices and standards that help transform financial data into smart data of higher business value.

Here are [some words by OMG Finance DTF](https://www.omg.org/industries/finance.htm) on technology standards to improve financial transactions:

*""O\*\*ur world is driven by legal contracts about complex financial instruments and multi-faceted entity relationships* *- yet we have common business terms that have different meanings, common meanings that use different terms and vague definitions that don't capture critical nuances. This is out of place for an industry that operates in real time, on a global basis, performs intricate analysis across many functions, is required to report to regulators with precision and needs improved efficiency by automating business processes. Financial services organizations have a language problem.*

*Financial instruments and their transactions processing is highly complex and nuanced process.   Many estimations put say that* *92% of financial business cost is data.*  *The* *daily cost of Trade Settlement Fails in the US is $200 billion*\*.  The lack of accurate traceability of trade Information as it moves from front and middle office to back office and analyzed for reporting is an acute problem across all sectors of the financial industry. Regulators are increasingly asking for near-real time trade transaction data to conduct systemic risk analysis.\*

*OMG has been developing standards for nearly 30 years and has an international suite of standards to manage and share data in the finance industry. These standards, which are developed by companies in the finance industry and vendors around the world, reduce the risk of new technology, preserve the value of legacy systems, and reduce time to market and integration costs.""*

Some examples of OMG Finance DTF standards are:

* FINANCIAL INDUSTRY BUSINESS ONTOLOGY ([FIBO](https://www.omg.org/hot-topics/finance.htm))
* FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT GLOBAL IDENTIFIER ([FIGI](https://www.omg.org/figi/index.htm))
* BUSINESS PROCESS MODEL AND NOTATION ([BPMN](https://www.omg.org/bpmn/index.htm))

We’ll go more in depth on the FIGI standard as it is where the IOTA involvement starts to evolve around. As some of you may know, the world is aiming to create a common language and model for payments data across the globe with the ISO 20021 standard by 2025.

In 2014 board members of the Object Management Group (OMG) standards consortium unanimously voted to [adopt the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) specification as standard methodology for identifying financial instruments](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/whats-name-bloomberg-global-id-reborn-figi/). The methodology behind the FIGI is based on Bloomberg’s Open Symbology, or BSYM, a system Bloomberg developed for identifying securities across all global asset classes.

Now that the OMG has adopted FIGI as a standard, the BBGID is now known as the FIGI, but the way the system works and its benefit to the market place is still the same. Stripping the BBGID of the Bloomberg name allows for a neutral, generic standard that avoids the branding issue. FIGIs' have been adopted in the market data feeds of: major exchanges like New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) and London Stock Exchange (FTSE) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

tl;dr: Object Management Group (OMG), a not-for-profit technology standards consortium is responsible for standardizing financial indicators in the financial market.

In part 2 I'll write about the demand for financial indicators for crypto and Dr. Richard Soley, Chairman and CEO of Object Management Group (OMG) direct involvement with IOTA as the chairman of IOTA Foundation Supervisory Board.

If you want to be ahead of the curve and dyor I would suggest to watch [this interview with Dr. Richard Soley.](https://youtu.be/14ZPEgtMu6k)

Go to the Video  [https://youtu.be/3Wfwkzk5KxA](https://youtu.be/3Wfwkzk5KxA) 

 03/29/2021 Morning Forecast -Markets are implying a move of 1.26%+/-(up/down) on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have realized a move of 1.07%+/-(up/down). The difference between what market makers are implying and what has been realized has tightened. The spread widened to 293 (20.08-17.15) basis points. The put/call gamma imbalance has been reset but is likely to favor more call buying. However, a tightening spread decreases left-tail risk and reduces the potential for spikes in realized volatility. Realized volatility has decreased recently below 18. This is favorable for wider and larger moves up or down on the index. I expect a decreasing trend over the 2nd Quarter during April, May, and June. The current market environment is favorable for traders looking to sell convexity via short straddles and strangles, call overwriting, put writes, and other short vol strategies to capture alpha on the indices and individual stocks. Bond market volatility has decreased limiting spill-over effects. The MOVE index hovers around 65 to 68 (or movement of 4 basis points daily in Treasury yields.)  However,  economic growth upgrades and rising inflation expectations without rising inflation or economic growth are pushing up real yields, which is creating equity long-duration valuation conflicts and raising discount rates. The S&amp;P is expected to move close to 1.34% up/down this week, which means the S&amp;P could rise 14% or fall 10% above its 200 DAY Moving average (3,534.85.) The S&amp;P traded slightly above its 50-day moving average (3,873.72) last week. Full Year S&amp;P Earnings are expected to total 175 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P at 22x's earnings, which equates to an earnings yield of 4.5% &amp; an inflation-adjusted real earnings yield of 1.93% (using 5-year TIPs Break-evens for inflation 2.57.) Analysts are anticipating earnings in 2022 of 201 per share. At current prices, this puts the S&amp;P forward earnings for 2022 at 19.6x's or a Yield = 5.1% &amp; Inflation Adjusted 2.53%. 

https://preview.redd.it/n3jmtrq0lyp61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e965f6071b55c0a482c62d84335d30fbf3fda7f2

 Forecasters are rushing to up-grade nominal and real growth expectations for the full year in 2021. The highest number of Private Forecasters and those from Federal Open Market Committee members are close to 7% on a Real basis. If this rate of growth is realized it would add 1.3 Trillion Dollars of Real Output to the US Economy ($18.78 Trillion = 20.00  Growth of 1,314 Billion.) The Corona Virus subtracted 3.5% of Real Economic Output from the US Economy. In 2021 the US Economy would need to grow at least 3.62% to break-even on a Real basis (3.5% = 1/(1-0.035.) For the 1st quarter of 2021 current estimates of nominal growth are 300 Billion and a Real Economic output of 130 Billion. This forecast has been surpassed following the release of last week's Income Report. The US is on pace to generate a little under 500 Billion Dollars of Nominal Economic Output in the 1st Quarter. At the current pace If it held through the full year,  would generate close to 3 Trillion Dollars of Economic Output. While this is exciting, I do not think this pace is sustainable or likely to culminate in those size gains. However, I do believe a nominal gain of 1.5 Trillion to 2.2 Trillion in Economic Nominal Output is possible in 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/xjh7rdqylyp61.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450f775c59248ca5d481bb3fc52c8088c019602d

 Full Year Economic Output estimates have increased significantly following the passage of stimulus. The median forecast was anticipating close to 1.2 Trillion Dollars in Nominal Growth and 800 Billion Dollars in real economic output for 2021. The current pace of nominal growth as of this morning would generate a total of 2.9 Trillion Dollars for 2021; Personal Consumption of 2.03 Trillion Dollars, Gross private domestic investment.519 Billion Dollars, Net exports of goods and services -.089 Billion Dollars, Government consumption expenditures, and gross investment.523 Billion Dollars. A major acceleration in growth is positioning the US to capture more than 1/3 of Global Economic Output in 2021. Economists continue to place the highest expectation for growth in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. Investment Banking Professionals are forecasting nominal growth of 400 Billion and real output of 240 Billion for the 2nd Quarter. This is a substantial amount of spending on Goods &amp; Services, which may face downside risk if there are any delays in Covid vaccinations or roll-outs.  Under these assumptions, we would need 50 to 60 Billion dollars of spending on Personal Consumption Expenditures in April, May, and June. I think we could see nominal growth in the 2nd Quarter of 700B to 600B and Real Output is likely between 375B to 310B. For March there is a strong possibility the $1,400 stimulus checks increase consumption similar to economic data in January 2021, which recorded a 487 Billion Dollar nominal gain in Personal Consumption Expenditure. It is also equally likely to engender significantly higher personal savings rates. We may temporarily eclipse the 20% savings rate experienced early in 2020. The higher US savings rate is helping to fund larger dissavings in the Public Sector and reduces substantial reliance on foreigner's savings. 

https://preview.redd.it/baffbssftyp61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a59522c85c5980e6e5b00e76d3ac6e7e6fe949b

 I do worry about the pace of growth for Private Investments in 2021. Gross Private Investments grew at a double-digit clip at the start of the decade but slowed considerably in the latter stages. If this trend of sluggish Private Investment growth persists it could weigh heavily on long-term potential growth via a reduction in capital deepening, which may fail to stimulate substantial increases in worker productivity at a faster rate. There is also a broader and more global risk with Savings and Investment. Due to the Virus, the US Stimulus is likely to engender larger current account deficits. This is partly reflected in stimulus in creditor large Surplus Economies, which have very limited or few domestic investments to make despite higher domestic rates of savings than the US. 

https://preview.redd.it/i539wx2ktyp61.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59862b553efab225b078ad6d72a266119acb4a00

The February non-farm payroll report was strong and robust. However, the trend has been weak Non-Farm Payrolls growth and elevated numbers of Americans receiving some form of unemployment assistance, which indicates large swaths of slack in the labor market. Private Forecast is anticipating payroll growth between 270k and 500k per month, which equates to 3.2 Million &amp; 6.0 Million additions to full-year US payrolls. This key economic indicator is likely to pressure growth in the 1st half of 2021. The relatively slow growth of the US population along with a substantial rise in the number of workers Not in the Labor Force has shrunk the size of the currently available labor pool. In 2020, the US lost a total of  9.7 Million Jobs or a loss of 6%. To break-even this year the US would need employment growth of 6.60%. However, the recent agreement on 1.9 Trillion in deficit spending is a significant tailwind to nominal growth in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This should increase aggregate demand, which should foster higher employment gains, but this assumes that virus cases come down substantially by April/May/June and pandemic flare-ups lessen. This has led some market observers to anticipate economic overheating, which is favorable for upside risk in inflation. I believe these fears are statistically unfounded. However, I do not disagree with rising inflation as a potential risk in the short term. The recent increase in nominal Treasury yields and 5yr Break-Evens on TIPs (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) towards 2.57% is transitory and likely reflecting anticipated increases in energy prices and base effects. The Federal Reserve typically subtracts 40 basis points from the break-even inflation rates, which would mean inflation expectations are currently anchored around the 2% (inflation averaging metric.)

https://preview.redd.it/e81o42wstyp61.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad9c953a959c136845b5b382587b400dafb9b8e6

Following the passage of stimulus larger fiscal dissavings increases capital inflows to finance VERY large TWIN DEFICITS, which should put upward pressure on the US Dollar &amp; downward pressure on Corporate &amp; Government Bond Yields. The current rise in yields and increase in growth expectations will likely favor a stronger US Dollar in the 1st half of 2021. This is also likely to put some additional pressure on higher real yields if growth and inflation increases are realized. Although, potentially weaker inflation data than consensus estimates should allow real yields to remain negative. Dollar appreciation also dampens import/commodity-driven inflation and should lessen temporary transitory base effects. Inflationistah and inflation fear-mongers engaging in scare tactics are likely to be proven wrong. However, inflation base effects are expected to be short-term. There will be a transitory spike in headline inflation data from March/April/and May. The impact on Core PCE is expected to be limited. Market Expectations are split, but I expect the Federal Reserve will look through these spikes

https://preview.redd.it/qw7lt0dhuyp61.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69df767e3fc1a816a6f19c1c705071fce215f570

Political risks have diminished in the 1st quarter due to reconciliation, but it has increased in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, which may pose risk to much-needed Investment spending (infrastructure, human capital, &amp; research development), so I view it in the medium term as tilted to the upside due to potential gridlock. However, there is the possibility for another round of reconciliation in the 2022 budget combined with the removal of the Filibuster Rules in the Senate. This could pave the way for easier passage of additional INVESTMENT lead spending, which is much needed to raise the US Long Term Potential Growth Rate. Although, due to political isolation this increases the potential for Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorism

Vaccine distribution is priced into Q3 2021, but distribution obstacles have increased and efficacy for herd immunity will be closely watched. Redefining herd immunity may become the norm, so instead of a fully vaccinated population of 90%. We may accept a different goal post for ""full vaccination"" perhaps it drops between 70% to 75%(?) Details are currently unknown. The market is currently pricing in an additional 6.54% move +/- (up/down) by June 18th. The S&amp;P 500 could potentially trade as high as 4,163.29 and as low as 3,670.61 by June 18th. The VIX is expected to move 6.49%(points), the VIX is currently 20.08. The VIX price range is 21.38 to 18.85. The Skew Index is EXTREMELY elevated, which indicates market participants are paying up for catastrophic protection (2 sigma event). Stocks continue to offer investors the highest real returns. The nominal yield on equities is 4.5%, while the nominal yield on 10yr Treasury is 1.63%. Real yields on all tenors of government bonds at the shorter end and belly of the curve are decisively negative, but real yields at longer tenors above 20 years have moved into positive territory. Real yields on US Equities remain strongly positive.\*\*Disclaimer with Realized Volatility rising above 12 there is a larger risk of systematic highly leveraged short vol strategies like Equity Vol Targeting, Trend Following, and Risk Parity positioned for a selloff and reduction in market exposure. The potential for a MUCH larger DELAYED sell off 4% to 5% has diminished. We are much more likely to see a fall in realized and implied volatility and a gradual melt-up in asset prices.  The Apr/May VIX contracts at 21 &amp; 23 are fairly priced. In fact, they may now be overpriced given the new economic outlook"
"Under Modi govt, Indian bureaucracy is facing biggest shakeup in seven decades",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mfuxzm/under_modi_govt_indian_bureaucracy_is_facing/,itisverynice,1,2021-03-30 01:39:39,20,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mfuxzm/under_modi_govt_indian_bureaucracy_is_facing/,#General📝,"[https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/under-modi-govt-indian-bureaucracy-is-facing-biggest-shakeup-in-seven-decades-6703321.html](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/under-modi-govt-indian-bureaucracy-is-facing-biggest-shakeup-in-seven-decades-6703321.html)

&amp;#x200B;

 

The higher Indian bureaucracy is being put to the litmus test like never before—and there are many who are flunking the scrutiny.

The test is being conducted at two levels; one, many senior officers—

&amp;#x200B;

# nearly 400—deemed incompetent or corrupt, have been sacked or superannuated compulsorily and prematurely in the last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Two, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pulling no punches when it comes to taking on the country’s elite Indian Administrative Service (IAS). In a move that can be regarded as unprecedented, he told the Parliament last month: “Babus will do everything. By dint of becoming IAS officers, they’ll operate fertiliser warehouses and chemical warehouses, even fly airplanes. What is this big power we have created? What are we going to achieve by handing the reins of the nation to babus? Our babus are also citizens, and so are the youth of India.”

**Public Criticism**

The Prime Minister’s emphatic public denouncement of the IAS has surprised and shocked many in equal measure. Surprised, because the Modi model of governance has involved heavy reliance on IAS officers, both earlier when he was Chief Minister Gujarat and now as Prime Minister, often even at the expense of his ministers. Shocked, because while politicians have in the past derided bureaucrats individually, a collective assault of this nature and that too on the floor of the House, is nothing less than groundbreaking.

Officers of doubtful integrity and conduct, those that have faced vigilance and corruption charges, or others whose work has not been found up to the mark or are of dubious conduct, have always had the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. The difference now is that the sword is not merely hanging, **it is also severing heads.**

# Last year, the central government instructed all ministries and departments to maintain a register of government servants in the 50-55 year age bracket, and those who have completed 30 years in service, as it plans to weed out the ‘corrupt’ and `inefficient officials.

According to an order issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT)—which comes directly under the Prime Minister’ Office (PMO)—all ministries and government departments now have to conduct a quarterly review of the officials, in order to ascertain who among them need to be prematurely retired from service.

**A Series of Long-Pending Reforms**

The steel frame, the once invincible government service, which assured job security like few employment opportunities in the world, is a lot more fallible now.

In the last few years, virtually hundreds of Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Revenue Service (IRS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and other central services officers have been compulsorily or prematurely retired.

The government rules are clear. It is armed with FR 56 (j), read together with Rule 48 of Pension Rules, which deals with premature retirement of senior officers. According to it, the appropriate authority, in the public interest has ‘the absolute right to retire any government servant’ with three months’ notice, after one has attained the age of 50/55 years or completed 30 years of qualifying service, whichever is earlier.

The corresponding pension rule stipulates that the officer, so retired in the public interest, will be entitled to pension based on his qualifying service.

**To get a sense of what is happening, it would be instructive to turn to a few numbers and events.**

&amp;#x200B;

* *On March 17, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs ordered three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of the Uttar Pradesh cadre to be retired prematurely in ‘public interest’ after their services were found to be “unsuitable to continue working as a public servant”.*

&amp;#x200B;

* *In 2019, 50 Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers were compulsorily retired.*

&amp;#x200B;

* *In 2019, 284 officers from the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) were considered for compulsory retirement on account of alleged corruption or inefficiency. The list included officers posted across ministries such as defence (19), home affairs (18), finance (18), and health (22), among others.*

&amp;#x200B;

* *in 2017, DoPT said it has taken actions like premature retirement, cut in remuneration against 381 bureaucrats, including 24 IAS officers for non-performance.*

&amp;#x200B;

* *Between May 2014 and May 2019, sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, was granted against 23 IAS and four IPS officers, according to Union Minister Jitendra Singh.*

&amp;#x200B;

* *In 2019, the government compulsorily retired over 50 IRS officials accused of corruption and sexual harassment, among other charges.*

&amp;#x200B;

What is the story here? 

&amp;#x200B;

There is little doubt that the Indian bureaucracy is amid its biggest churn of the last seven decades. A push for the lateral entry of domain experts, forced retirement of officers in bulk, concerted attempts to break the stranglehold of the IAS, experiments with the time-tested recruitment rules of civil servants, have evoked applause and invited brickbats, by the serving and the superannuated, in equal measure.

Says former Union Secretary Anil Swarup: “Well, the rules provide for such removals, so to that extent they are in order. If the idea is to cleanse the system, then it is a laudable step, but there are many who doubt the intentions of this government.”

A lot of this has to do with perception—the commonly held view among the masses, who often deal with the lower echelons of bureaucracy—is that government servants are not just corrupt but incompetent.

Says Amitabha Bhattacharya, a former IAS officer, who has also served in the private sector and with the UNDP: “Public perception about pervasive corruption, more so in certain departments, particularly at the level of public-interface and at the highest decision-making level, is real. The fact about large-scale inefficiency — mostly at the middle and lower level of bureaucracy stares in our face.”

He believes that if pursued objectively and methodically, measures that the Modi government has taken will have a sobering effect on the bureaucracy and a beneficial impact on public administration at large.

“in cases of premature retirement, there is always a possibility of subjectivity creeping in. Therefore, the review process must be so robust and transparent as to be in a position to stand sustained legal scrutiny,” says Bhattacharya.

The key point is, has it?

It is necessary to understand the systemic architecture to deal with inefficiency and corruption in public service. The limiting conditions of government servants are largely defined by the Fundamental Rules (FR), Conduct Rules, and CCA (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, which came into force decades ago but are amended from time to time.

The ubiquitous Annual Confidential Report/Performance Assessment Report intends to give a picture of an officer’s performance and integrity, as assessed by their superiors.

Besides these, there are specific Acts like the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, to deal with such issues.

**Let’s Talk About Results**

Nevertheless, there is not much evidence that corruption is declining or inefficiency receding.

That the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is clear about what it is doing, is in no doubt. In its election manifesto released before the 2019 general elections, the party stated: “To transform India into a developed nation, we need to work with the guiding principle of ‘minimum government and maximum governance’ and we will bring reform in the civil services and implement it in a manner to achieve.”

From the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2019, Modi stressed the importance of the anti-graft drive against officials. “You must have seen, in the last five years, and this time after coming to power, we have dismissed several people who enjoyed cushy positions in the government,” he said, adding for good effect, \`\`Those who used to be roadblocks in our endeavours (to eradicate corruption), we told them to pack their bags (because) the country doesn’t need (their) services.”

Says a former IAS officer, Vijay Shankar Pandey: “Action against corrupt and inefficient senior officers under FR 56 (j), is not new. I have done it several times in my career. But if you say it is to streamline governance, then I will not agree. In the past, services of many incompetent and corrupt officers have been terminated, but that has hardly brought about efficiency and high standards in governance.”

Pandey is critical of the Prime Minister’s attack on the *\`babus.’* \`\`If you did not have the *babus*, it would be difficult to implement Article 370. Within a moment of it being scrapped, every District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police in Jammu and Kashmir was enforcing it with gusto. Minus the civil bureaucracy, could such a move have been possible,” he queries.

He says it is easy to criticise, but not a single creative line has been said on what should replace the IAS and the civil bureaucracy.

***There are other ways, which are threatening to clip the powers of the all-powerful civil bureaucracy. In 2018, a small advertisement in some newspapers sent shock waves in the hallowed portals of the bureaucracy.***

***The advertisement, which called for 10 lateral entries into the central government, were not new by any chance. It is an old P Chidambaram plan that goes back to the 1980s. Of 450 posts of joint secretary in the central government, 10 were being opened for laterally hiring domain experts.***

Wrote Amitabh Kant, CEO of the NITI Aayog: “Civil servants together with fresh inputs from lateral entrants can provide synergies to policy and implementation like never before. The role of civil servants becomes even more vital since for lateral inductions to get immersed in the government, the system will entail a steep learning curve.”

**Reforms, Meet Resistance**

Clearly, the decision has put question marks on a generalist’s approach to administration and has highlighted the need for domain knowledge experts, given the demands of a growing economy and the need to quicken decision making.

Says a serving officer, tartly: \`\`It is not as if the lateral entrants into the bureaucracy know how to fly planes,” referring to the Prime Minister’s Parliament speech. He did not want to be named.

For some officers, the government’s actions have been disagreeable enough for some IAS officers to leave the service altogether.

In July 2019, former finance secretary Subhash Garg offered to quit from the government after he was abruptly shunted out of the finance ministry.

Soon enough, three relatively junior officers left the service arguing that democratic principles were being compromised under the Modi government — an unprecedented statement from serving officers of the IAS. Incredibly, two of them cited \`ideological’ reasons for the decision, while a third left for having been posted to the Northeast.

Days later, Karnataka cadre officer S. Sasikanth Senthil resigned from the IAS arguing that it was \`unethical’ to be an IAS officer when the \`fundamental building blocks of diverse democracy are being compromised’."

COVID-19 situation has forced businesses to implement the lessons we have learnt during these tough times. The initial aim for the businesses was to flatten the curve, and after a year of hard turmoil, we are moving back to what we call 'normal' but with a new set of rules and regulations. Hence, this normal is not so normal anymore. 

Here is what bouncing back to the new normal look for China:

So, what we are talking about here is how Blockchain is helping enterprises to bounce back from this COVID situation, and we are going to discuss a few areas in which Blockchain is being considered as a potential antidote for Coronavirus. Keep on reading this blog to know more-

**Moving towards the new normal**

After years of research, planning, and implementation, Blockchain technology is becoming a reality across many industries as diverse as healthcare, finance, and software development. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Blockchain was not expected to reach such heights for at least a decade. But the situation after the pandemic has become a catalyst for the adoption of this technology, further accelerating the implementation rates of **Blockchain after COVID.** 

The following statistics show how Blockchain spending is forecasted to increase after the COVID situation:

&amp;#x200B;

A recent IDC report suggested that blockchain is expected to grow just 57.7% worldwide in 2020, significantly less than pre-COVID-19 forecasts estimated, because of IT cutbacks amid the poor economic climate. But these short-term losses would lead to long-term benefits for many [**Blockchain app development companies**](https://www.debutinfotech.com/blockchain-development-services). 

**How Blockchain is playing its part?**

Like many other industries, Blockchain technology is also suffering the hit of the COVID-19 blow. While the world can't get completely back to normal, the process can be accelerated with proper Blockchain implementation techniques. Here are a few ways in which Blockchain is helping various industries to get back to normal:

**1. Restructuring the supply chains**

Smart supply chains and logistics are the keys to a high-functioning economy in the future. The pandemic followed by subsequent lockdowns has greatly impacted the global supply chains. Despite the increased demands for the FMCG industry, many manufacturing units had to close their operations due to safety concerns. Blockchain helped to cater to this increased demand by identifying the manufacturing capabilities of different units in a small time.

Blockchain also helped resolve supply chain management issues due to its immutable and transparent nature. Many business giants such as IBM partnered with the healthcare and pharma industry to help them make their supply chains more efficient after the pandemic. 

**2. Reopening borders to facilitate trade**

The pandemic has taught us the capabilities of Blockchain and how it can help us complete our tasks safely. In difficult times like these, it becomes even more important to deploy technologies such as Blockchain to solve these pressing issues. Since the Blockchain's inception, its features such as decentralization and immutability make it an effective device for handling and protecting confidential information. These benefits are also useful for countries looking forward to reopening their borders. 

One such use-case of Blockchain is with U.S Customs and Border Protection, where the technology is currently being deployed to protect the intellectual rights on American sea-ports imports from theft. Blockchain allows the CBP to safely exchange sensitive data such as trade secrets, identifiable information with manufacturers, retailers, and importers. 

**3. Managing economies with Blockchain**

As we have already seen that Blockchain is a disruptive technology and has changed how digital transactions are recorded on a ledger. Many of the Blockchain researchers believe that if Blockchain tech was already in place, there would have been less impact on the country's economy. 

From Healthcare and pharma to the Financial sector, Blockchain has the power to change the functioning of all the industries. Blockchain can provide secure and transparent transactions globally, for both services and manufacturing sectors. This benefit highlights the opportunities this technology brings while being implemented by governments in their economies. 

So, this is a part of what we at Debut believe is the potential of Blockchain technology to help businesses around the world bounce back from the COVID-19. When implemented with the right strategies, Blockchain can transact with anybody on an open network.

Now, thanks to the Blockchain-based solutions, enterprises are in the process of digital transformation without putting any pressure on old technologies. A blockchain is just a decentralized software for today's market and over some time, it would become new normal for industries across the globe.

Chapter: Finale,https://www.reddit.com/r/bursabets/comments/mga24l/chapter_finale/,Dependent-Visit-9260,1,2021-03-30 15:01:03,22,/r/bursabets/comments/mga24l/chapter_finale/,Education,"# Opportunity is Gold

Where is the opportunity?

If your boss is stepping down, it may be an opportunity for you. If they see there are lack of demand for glove, it may be an opportunity for some people to setup glove production factories.

If you come to think of it, here's the simple conclusion:

***When there is a PROBLEM, there is an opportunity.***

When your boss steps down, the company got a problem. It suddenly missing a head. There's an opportunity. During this pandemic, there's a problem - the world lack gloves and hence, there's an opportunity.

So, that bring us to this equation:

**PROBLEM RECOGNITION = opportunity**

Else, why do you think the investors are always looking at news?

# The Current Big Thing

About a decade or two ago, the Previous Big Thing (I guess we can call it The Previous Big Problem) was about Big Data and so, company such as Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. all flourish and become very successful.

So, that was previous. What is the Current Big Thing?

As you are being aware of, our world is currently facing what I call **""The Problem of the Century""** because it needs the whole world's cooperation to solve this problem:

**CLIMATE CHANGE**

    Disclaimer: The diagram below is of illustration and education purpose only. It is not by any mean a buy or a sell call.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mind Mapping the Problem](https://preview.redd.it/be35d17014q61.jpg?width=435&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee791f974ed49c11b26054673784610747fa8a5d)

    You see Tesla coming up, yes? You see Solar coming up, yes?

From Kyoto Protocol to Paris Agreement, almost all countries on earth agreed, to deal with climate change. Malaysia has committed to a reduction of greenhouse gases by 45% by **2030**. This consists of 35% of unconditional basis and 10% conditional basis upon the receipt of climate finance, technology transfer, and capacity building from developed countries. In 2020, Malaysia is currently on the very bottom of the table, Rank 53 with a score of 34.21. There are 2 parts in dealing with climate change - (1) Deal with the CO2 in the atmosphere and (2) deal with the emission of CO2 by our activities.

# Part 1

Global warming is a huge mess we human made to earth. Right now, **nature deserve some Justice and we are currently being trialled - ""You fix me or you will get obliterated""**. So we are like coronavirus and, earth is the human :).

I believe we are all aware that ""greenhouse gas"" (GHG), e.g. CO2, CH4, is main culprit. The current technology points us to Carbon Capture technology. It's like a big factory with plenty of fans to suck in air and extract carbon through some chemical process. The biggest challenge is how to **store/use the carbon**. There are multiple funded company working on this. For example, you have ***Carbfix, Climework, Carbon Engineering, etc***. One of the funder is Bill Gates. Part 1 is very much about research and scaling the project. Who will undertake this in Malaysia once it is successful? Likely the Government, who will then contract it to some company. Part 2 is the more interesting part as it **involves us.**

# Part 2

What's the point sucking all the carbon while we continue to release more carbon into the atmosphere, right? Thus, we have to start reducing carbon emission. Electricity &amp; Heat production accounts for 25% of global emission. For example, Australia depends their electricity production on coal. In our country, we rely on Hydro-Electric. Hence, this isn't so much of problem for us. The part we likely need to cuts down is O&amp;G. The transportation industry accounts for 14% of the global total. I think this one no need explanation. That's why you have company like ***Tesla*** rising. Agriculture accounts for 18% of global total. Can you imagine, even the cows are blamed for polluting the air. Cows ban from farting? Currently, there is no real solution to this. The **cement industry** account for 8% of global total and they will have to find a better process. One of those company who is doing this is ***BioMason***.

With all that is happening, I believe, the O&amp;G industry is coming to it's sunset time. Well, it won't just disappear but like coal, it's *NOT* going to be the *'commodity of the decade'* anymore. It will be replaced by Renewable Energy such as solar, wind, wave, hydro, kinetic, nuclear, etc aka clean energy. Unlike oil, renewable energy is a **NOT** a commodity - it cannot be traded. If it cannot be traded, what will happen to O&amp;G company like Petronas, Shell, etc. ? You go figure.

About a decade ago, many analyst rejected solar energy mainly because of the cost and the 'duck curve'. The duck curve simply means it produce energy at times we don't need it most, e.g. at night. China has brought the cost down. So, there's 1 more problem - the 'duck curve' which translate to **STORAGE**. This will be the **'holy grail**' because the problem is not about generating the energy. It's about storing it. So, when we talk about storage, naturally battery comes into mind (they call it Battery War) and when we talk about battery, naturally it leads to ***Panasonic*** (Tesla battery supplier). But this is just **Li-ion** (the battery technology we are currently using in phones, cars, etc) and we know the limitation of this battery. It can catch fire, bloat, not very durable and so on. So, we need a better one. That lead us to **Solid State Battery** \- that bring us to ***Toyota, Samsung, QuantumScape, Volkswagen*** and more.

There is also another technology going on in the transportation industry. **The Fuel Cell - hydrogen.** This technology has it own pros and cons and the companies link to this are ***Ballard Power***, ***Plug Power,*** ***Toyota, etc***. Wow, Toyota really throwing in a lot of R&amp;D!

Once you have the company names, you can start looking deeper into the industry. For example, solar energy is not the only development. You can find **ocean wave development**, wind turbines and the most interesting one is **NUCLEAR** \- the one Bill Gates believe most. Singapore is a country with little resources. You ask them to make Hydro-Dam? Well they are doing ***solar on the seas***. But still, it requires a lot of space!! It requires about 1 hectares (around 2.5 football fields) to generate 1MW. In the name of renewable energy, you slaughter the forest who does a good job in reducing carbon footprint. Imagine you use only solar to generate the power for our air-cons and water heater. So, that is one drawback. Nuclear may be Singapore's destiny but 1 Fukushima incident can wipe more than half their country gone. Still, I believe, technology will 1 day help them with this nuclear option.

Solar is definitely a way to go but how far can it go? How far can Solid State Battery go? For example, looking back at Li-ion, it was first introduced by Sony in 1991. Until today, the battery has stay mainstream for about 20+ years and the company behind Li-ion is Panasonic not Sony. **One must also remember, sometimes it's not about who bring the technology to the scene. It's about who makes it better, e.g. more efficient, cheaper, more longevity, less problem.**

[Panasonic](https://preview.redd.it/haqeidi104q61.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e64ecbf37568078c3ed5cc9defeeadf3ac535117)

[Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/v65fiud404q61.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=430c45bd583c138b779fd6dabfabcd983846c57d)

Once you further narrows in, you can start doing your Fundamental Analysis. **1 tip for everyone, intrinsic value is not a variable or a constant. It's a RANGE**.

Sales = Quantity X Price.

Profit = Sales - Cost.

More quantity = higher sales. To produce more quantity means more market. More market means **INTERNATIONAL**. **The lesson is**, the company have to be **AMBITIOUS** (non-jaguh kampung company). Look at Amazon, Coco-Cola, Apple, etc. You want share price to rise? *More revenue, less cost*. For example, now, in the construction sector, **3D printing technology** is surfacing. It that can build a double story house in **less than 2 weeks** (a 650 sq. ft. single story house can be printed in 1 day). It reduces man-power, it encourages skilled worker (less cost).

It's all about mastering the technology. Once you mastered it, you can 'export it' to some other countries and make more money.

If you want to go further, you can then look further into the supply chain. For example, who is TG's supplier? Or what is the main ingredient to make Battery?

# The Mindset of an Investor

**Research means a lot, e.g. industry, competitive advantage, economics factor and there's a lot more, to arrive at one's conclusion. Although, I named some companies, my purpose is TRULY EDUCATIONAL only - attempting to show, how to start looking.** Look at the news, do some mind-mapping, do some research, do some FA, and you are ready to go.

It sometimes need not be a problem. **It can also begin with the things you like**. For example, it can be Fatty Crab Restaurant. If they go big and decide to do public listing, you buy it because you like it! You ask around, people like it! Why Coca-Cola can become so big? Because the teens like it! It's purely **demand based**.

Again, **DO NOT** limit yourself to KLSE. Go where ever opportunity takes you. Many Malaysian companies are adopters, they are not the champion. I think Malaysia have a very good opportunity to do well during this pandemic. For example, we manage do curb the pandemic during our first lockdown. Sadly, our cinemas love showing: **Captain Malaysia: Civil War.**

In the US, they have **crowdfunding**. It's another avenue for small investors. As for the big investors, it's usually a **capital company** like Social Capital that offers capital for start-up company. All the innovator needs is a '*beta model'* that works on small scale and ready to answer some question. So, it's like, the investor, will provide the capital and the owner will provide the idea and solution. In the end, both own the shares of the company. So again, it's the same concept, it's **OWNERSHIP** and **PROFIT SHARING.**

Crowdfunding can also be used as a CSR project. For example, there are people who are willing to plant trees to save the earth but doesn't have the funding or the man-power help. So, those who willing to sponsor the fund can sponsor it, and those willing to do it, will take the money and do it. In Cantonese it's called ""Yau Chin Chut Chin, Mou Chin Chut Lek"" (Those with money, come out with money, those without money contribute man-power efforts and will get paid for it).

One last thing here is the money you invest should be the money you **don't need for your daily life**, e.g. food, loan payments, cloths. It's the money you are ready to save for rainy days or money you are ready to put into your FD. Why? So that you **won't be pressured to selling your stocks when it comes down**. In fact, you buy more when it comes down. For example, if the stock is giving approximately *6%* ***consistent*** dividend yield, why would you want to sell it even though the stock price is coming down? ""Mai du lei ng chit lar. Jung Pek. Sohai lai de"" (A Cantonese Slang for 'Buy also not enough time. Still want to throw. Stupid fella').

As an investor, you always want to own more. It's about ownership and **wealth creation**. Don't borrow from Ah Long, don't go goreng and don't do margin. Don't be Greedy, don't be Fearful.  Having the right mentality and doing the right way is always the best way to go.

**At the end of the day, whether a person is able to be successful, it at one's OWN ENDEAVOUR -** ***either you did your homework or you can just leave it to chance.***

&gt;What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your **circle of competence.** The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.

# Wealth Creation

&gt;Jeff Bezos realized slow compounding. My little theory about company value creation: The faster you build it, that is the half-life, it will get destroyed in the same amount of time.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-  Chamath Palihapitiya

A wealth that is built overnight, will ***likely*** get destroyed overnight. You contra and win RM100,000 today. You'll likely contra and lose RM100,000 tomorrow. Say, you have a dividend portfolio that generates you RM60,000 dividend a year which, took you 25 years to build it. Do you think it can easily get destroyed in 1 day?

Wealth creation is about slow and steady, consistently making money and growing that money. For those who doesn't know, **compounding is an exponential graph.** It starts very painfully. Once it starts to curve up, it rockets! There are 2 parts in compounding - first is the rate (%), the other is the principal. **The more principal you put in every month and the higher the rate (%), the FASTER IT BUILDS.** Hence, you get the quote, **""the richer get richer"".**

&amp;#x200B;

[Compounding - Passive Income of 6&amp;#37; of 200,000 principal](https://preview.redd.it/0nyrl92804q61.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db6837b3e0623fc2a63e61f2e487d98aa24534ff)

I like to put it this way: ""Not losing is actually winning"". Why do you think those smaller club in English Premier League would 'park the bus' when it comes to the bigger club? Simply because the odd is against the smaller club. It is no different in stock market. In trading, you can win big and you can lose big. That's why you hear, ""90% lose money in stock market"".

To me, it's really about, if you 'da kung chai' (A Cantonese slang for working class), getting your salary, put aside some of those money and invest in a company when given a chance. You can also **reinvest the dividend** you get from the company. For example, TG dividend is 0.252 and you own 2000 shares. So your dividend is RM504. You reinvest those dividend into TG to approximately 100 shares and your total shares become 2100 shares. When the next dividend come, say, 0.252 again, then your dividend will be RM529.2. You can buy another 100 shares making it a total of 2200 shares. When this number become big enough, it goes up very fast. Remember the rule of compounding. Slowly and overtime, that number of shares grow and so do your net worth. The next pandemic comes (touch wood), woohoo, $$$$. In the US, they have something called Dividend Reinvestment Plan. I hope our companies could adopt the same thing.

What do you think Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai is doing? He is slowly accumulating his wealth!! Cash is a very bad investment!! . 

What other people like to argue is put the money in some other company can make more money. **My question is: ""Sure make money or not? Who give guarantee? What I know is trading is a ZERO SUM GAME.""** You can try you best effort to con the newbies and win their money but please don't try it on me.

# My take on Sifu and Manipulation

The thing with Sifu Front Running is no secret. Volatility is another reason why they want followers to buy the stock. **When there is volatility, there's money to be made from trading**. Imagine you try to trade on a share that is not so popular currently. The stock barely moves. Can you make money from trading that? Well maybe a little bit.

When the share come down, that's where my actions begin. I'll collect *fundamentally good company (company I think will do pretty well in the future)* at low price. No chance for those traders to take advantage. In fact, they busy throwing. I happily collecting. For example, EPF sell so many TG shares at high price. Now he's happily collecting around RM5 again and enjoy the dividend. **So, who's the fool?**

The thing Sifu should really do, if they wanted to be fair, is to enforce **1 PRICE**. This is the standard norm. Just like the mutual fund, there is only **1 price for ALL**. If I win, you win. If I lose, you lose. That's fair. Although, there is still room for manipulation, very least, it is reduced.

I still give some credits to some Sifu for some of their research. I'll usually expand on those research, fine tune his TP (most of their TP are over-valued) and calculate my buying price. If given the chance, I'll buy else I'll pass. I also no longer play by TA **(I am very well versed with TA)** simply because it's really manipulatable.

Manipulation is something that is going to be here to stay. Can't avoid it. What we can do is to choose carefully the company we want to invest in. Minimize the odd of error! Do enough research, do enough calculation and buy it cheap, e.g. it gives higher return than FD!

# Epilogue - Treasure the Moments

Quality life is really just about what you make out of your own life and I don't mean in terms of money.  I mean in terms of what you do. I don't own a fancy car, I don't wear Versace (I wear a lot of pasar malam, rejected cloths - RM10 and less only), I like learning new things, I enjoy a good meal, and I enjoy good trips with my love ones. Not because I am poor, it's because I live a simple life with a simple mentality.

Earlier last week, our beloved gem, our one and only dog, passed away. It was truly an excruciating moment for all us. Being one of our family member who have been with us for the past 12 years, since her birth to her death, accompanying us through our pains and joys, gave us her final goodbye. During the morning, when I wake up, wishing to call her to my side, only to recall she is gone. For many years, I have not felt this kind of sadness. But last week, it was like a disaster calling that my tears couldn't stop flowing. Our house has never felt this kind of silence for the past 12 years. Very least, there were 'barks' and 'demands'. Life is short. It is precious. The only reason you DON'T feel this is because you feel your life is so sad and bad. The truth is happy time goes by faster and it is your own responsibility to make your life happier. How you want to live your life is of your own creation. Always reserve some time for your family and cherish them while they are still around. Because all that could be left are just memories and pictures - memories and pictures of either you have gave enough of your time to them or, you did not.

Investing has a **VERY STEEP** learning curve. Don't be discouraged and persevere. Be hardworking in learning. Compound your knowledge. And I believe, that knowledge and effort will not disappoint you.

May you find success in your Investment Journey.
