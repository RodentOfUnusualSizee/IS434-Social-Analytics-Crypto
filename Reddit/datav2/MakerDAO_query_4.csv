Two Flavors of Giveth.. Which One to Choose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/comments/mhd03j/two_flavors_of_giveth_which_one_to_choose/,mackerel_runner,1,2021-04-01 02:56:03,0,/r/giveth/comments/mhd03j/two_flavors_of_giveth_which_one_to_choose/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[Giveth TRACE and Giveth.io landing pages](https://preview.redd.it/q34fd0ynteq61.png?width=3615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaccd86ad4805fd8bbc41e98eff1171656fb6915)

***TL;DR*** 

## Giveth TRACE

* Allows for donations on macro and micro levels via Communities, Campaigns, and Milestones
* Has a system of oversight to prevent misuse or fraud
* Donations accepted in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC, and USDC
* Curated Donor Funds via ‚ÄòLiquid Pledging‚Äô
* Giveth doesn‚Äôt charge any fees, in fact we pay the fees to send funds to the recipient
* Works with MetaMask

## Giveth.io

* Streamlined project creation accessible for all
* Multi-wallet functionality
* Peer-to-peer transactions
* Giveth doesn‚Äôt charge any fees
* Fiat donations via Torus On-ramping
* ETH and ERC-20 token donations
* Donate on **xDai** and save on gas

Three key distinguishers of the Giveths are: ***Trust***, ***User Experience,*** and ***Scope***. Let‚Äôs dive in.

# Trust

First up let‚Äôs talk about Trust. Giveth TRACE (Originally Giveth Beta) was launched in 2017. Following [the great DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) from the previous year, the burning question at the time was: how do we make these new decentralized innovations resilient and trustworthy? Giveth itself was on the frontlines of these events and set out to solve these issues.

Giveth TRACE employs smart contracts to handle various transparency-oriented functions of the platform. These interactions happen on the blockchain, including traceable donations, escrow, and dispersal of funds. It uses Milestones for specific projects or goals that can have conditions outlined for funds to be released. An example would be to prove work was done on a project or that money was spent to acquire something specific. The milestone contract is employed to act as an escrow. A milestone creator can designate a recipient other than themselves and also a reviewer. The reviewer of a milestone is responsible to assure that any stated expectations were completed before authorizing the smart contract to release the funds to the recipient.

The new Giveth DApp does not use smart contracts to facilitate donations but instead provides a true peer-to-peer experience where funds go directly from donor to receiver. The resulting transaction is eternally scribed onto the blockchain. There are no escrow or reviewer functions on the Giveth.io DApp so while donations are much more direct, you are encouraged to do your due diligence before donating.

# User Experience

Following the rise of ‚Äòcryptokitties‚Äô and the mooning of the price of ETH in 2018, the Rinkeby test network was implemented on Giveth TRACE to resolve absurd gas fees and scalability issues. This allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Dapp for no actual fees, using only gas on Rinkeby to execute the majority of contract transactions. In fact, Giveth actually pays the fees to send your donations to mainnet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Profile creation on Giveth TRACE is facilitated by smart contract interactions on Rinkeby and is reasonably straightforward, however is currently limited to MetaMask. Giveth TRACE currently allows donations in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC and USDC.

Giveth.io has expanded giving capabilities by allowing donations in ETH and any ERC-20 Token on Mainnet and [**xDai network**](https://www.xdaichain.com/)! The [Giveth.io DApp](https://giveth.io/) uses Onboard.js to permit virtually any Ethereum wallet to be used for donations. Project creation has been streamlined, so creators can sign-in, make a project and start collecting funds literally in minutes. For creating a profile you may choose between standard MetaMask login or Torus Wallet. Torus Wallet also provides a crypto on-ramping feature so you can convert your cold-hard cash into cryptocurrency very easily and get to donating in the digital age. [More Info on Torus wallet can be found here.](https://docs.tor.us/)

# Scope

Scope is the last, but perhaps coolest, distinction I want to mention. Giveth TRACE has **huge** scope: its donation hierarchy is broken down into Communities (formerly known as DACs), Campaigns, and Milestones. Donations made to Communities and Campaigns are stored in a ‚Äòpledge‚Äô vault. The Community or Campaign manager can then delegate your pledge into the Campaign or Milestone, respectively, of their choosing. This system created by Giveth has coined the term ‚ÄòLiquid Pledging‚Äô and in effect allows for curated donor funds. This means would-be donors can make non-custodial contributions to causes that they care about and funds can find their way to the right place at the right time. Once your funds have been delegated you‚Äôre able to track where they went on Giveth TRACE.

Giveth.io Dapp aims to provide a simpler experience. While not achieving the same scope of Giveth TRACE it is much easier to navigate. Donations made on Giveth.io go straight A ‚Üí B and the project owners themselves dictate the scope by the projects they choose to create.

The new Giveth is straightforward if you‚Äôre looking to make simple donations peer to peer without any added complexity but with more connectivity. Giveth TRACE allows you to define how broad or narrow your donations are while maintaining a high standard of transparency and checks on fund flow. Each has specific advantages in terms of collecting donations. Check out both and decide which flavor suits your taste; [Giveth TRACE](https://beta.giveth.io/) or [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/)."

An undervalued project with ambition that is on steam and is hitting goals on a weekly basis.

## In short

From simple payment requests to fully compliant digital currency invoices. Request helps you to get paid in crypto while providing full control over your financial data.

And i'm not going to write out their whole website for you just have a look at [https://request.network](https://request.network) as they're doing a really good job already, but i'll give you a summation and why i think req is undervalued as is. Also have a look at [https://req.network](https://req.network) to see KPI's.

Some features that have already landed or will land within a month:

* Stripe integration.
* Reputation System. (released for closed beta testing)
* Currency swaps. Thats right, request to be paid in ETH and let the payee pay in the currency they feel like.
* XDai integration to reduce fees while ethereum gas fees are extremely expensive.

Some features being planned for the near future:

* FIAT gateways.
* XERO integration. (a major accounting software provider)
* Staking.

Some of the leading innovators and organizations in the decentralized financial (DeFi) ecosystem that either use Request or are partnering with them:

* MakerDAO (top 100 CMC), read their customer story here [https://request.network/en/customer-stories/makerdao/](https://request.network/en/customer-stories/makerdao/)
* AAVE (top 100 CMC)
* Gnosis Safe (top 100 CMC)
* NEAR protocol (top 100 CMC)
* Ocean Protocol
* The Graph
* Indacoin
* 88mph

## Ambitions for this year:

* Hitting 5000 business use cases
* Daily transactions 800 to 1000 a day. (current highest day has hit 110 transactions which includes: invoice sent and invoice paid)

## So why will this ever be worth more OP?

* Adoption.
* Token burn.
* Staking.
* Voting.

## So why is this undervalued OP?

Lets see, so first of all the request foundation has around $47M in assets (Ethereum and KNC), they also hold 1/5th of the supply of all tokens which are never used therefore the supply is smaller than it looks like, oh and those tokens are worth around $33M at the time of writing. That means the company itself is worth around $80M YET the market cap is ONLY $160M! thats only twice the foundations worth.

They only just started marketing because they do not believe in quick hype and quick coins, they and their investors believe in the product, and now the product is fully usable they're starting marketing and are scaling up, looking for full stack developers at the moment. (apply here if you want: [https://request.network/en/career/](https://request.network/en/career/))

## Oh so you like mysteries? Ok fine!

Users from the Request discord have started noticing a few whale wallets (we call them whallets) starting to buy regular tokens, normally around 80k per buy, do you have any explanation why? I might make another post about this soon. Example of a whallet: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a?a=0x027dff68c06d39e1c274b359c4dc269eb40d2c19](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a?a=0x027dff68c06d39e1c274b359c4dc269eb40d2c19)

TL;DR: Request is a invoicing network focusing on the DeFi ecosystem, pay with any currency, get paid in the currency you want. Possibly has $80M in their reserve and at the moment of writing only has 2 times that as a market cap 160 Million."
WHAT ARE STABLECOINS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenbondmeter/comments/mj81a1/what_are_stablecoins/,greenbondmeter,1,2021-04-03 21:00:18,0,/r/greenbondmeter/comments/mj81a1/what_are_stablecoins/,NaN,"  

https://preview.redd.it/mxpnhc792wp61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea32ea031efcacfdcdab3a09ba2f4c6d656b6ae

Stablecoins or stable cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset whose value is linked to that of another asset through a parity relationship.

The most popular stablecoins maintain a 1-to-1 relationship with the US dollar, while others do so with gold or even other cryptocurrencies.

The first stablecoin was Tether (USDT), created by the company Tether Limited. It went on the market in October 2014 and until 2018 it was the only one of its kind, which allowed it to monopolize the entire segment. And also some scandals.

The emergence of DAI, from the MakerDAO project, solved one of Tether‚Äôs biggest problems: trust. From there, later stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC) were showing signs of the consolidation of the use of this type of ‚Äúcrypto-dollars‚Äù.

**What it is, how it works and how it is being used in the market?**

The blockchain is generally associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but these are only the tip of the iceberg. And it is that this technology, which has its origins in 1991, when Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta described the first work on a chain of cryptographically secured blocks, was not noticeable until 2008, when it became popular with the arrival of bitcoin.

When we speak of blockchains or chains of blocks, we refer to a particular way of organizing information, usually in a database format, with the distinctive characteristic that the data contained in a blockchain are arranged in successive blocks, each connected to the previous.

Each block can hold a certain amount of information, and is identified by an alphanumeric figure generated by a hash function. Hash functions are a type of cryptographic algorithm that creates a specific alphanumeric identifier for that piece of information. Bitcoin, for example, uses the SHA256 algorithm, while Ethereum uses Ethash.

In case the information of a block is altered, even in the slightest, the identifier will also be modified. In this way, the hash number allows to know if a certain set of information underwent any change or manipulation.

The chain of blocks, better known by the term blockchain in English, is a single registry, agreed and distributed in several nodes of a network. In the case of cryptocurrencies, we can think of it as the ledger where each of the transactions is recorded.

In a blockchain, each ‚Äúchild block‚Äù contains the hash of the previous block, which we can call its ‚Äúmother block‚Äù. This mother block is also a child of another block, and thus a chain is generated that refers to the first block, also called the ‚Äúgenesis block‚Äù, which is the only one that does not contain hash of previous blocks.

Each block added in the chain was processed, accepted, and incorporated by the entire network in a process known as mining. Therefore, any change in a mother block generates a cascade effect that is transmitted to all subsequent blocks and that forces whoever wants to modify a pre-existing block to validate (mine) the entire chain again.

This means that the longer a chain of blocks is, the more computing power is required to mine it again. Therefore it is more difficult to change. In short, the longer a blockchain is, the more difficult it is to rewrite it.

Its operation can be complex to understand if we delve into the internal details of its implementation, but the basic idea is simple to follow.

**Advantages of stablecoins**

‚Äç‚ÄçBy always being the same value, they eliminate the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.

They keep the purchasing power of their users constant and predictable, without the need to use foreign currency.

People engaged in intense buying / selling activity can maintain stable purchasing power without the need to resort to a foreign currency.

They are a value transfer mechanism without geographical borders and with low commissions.

Most brokers accept them to exchange for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies.

They are very useful for users who trade on different exchanges."

Ethereum Scalability Race - April 2021 update,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/,Liberosist,3,2021-04-04 23:56:15,22,/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/,NaN,"This is my personal perspective on the current status of scalability on Ethereum. Today, Ethereum is all-in on Layer 2 solutions. While there are different definitions for Layer 2, for the purpose of this post, I define it as solutions secured by Ethereum mainnet. This eliminates sidechains like xDai or Polygon, and focuses on rollups. (I will note that because Polygon checkpoints back to ethereum mainnet, so it's a grey area and still a better solution than any non-ethereum smart contract chain.) For an in-depth explanation of rollups, Vitalik's post is a must-read: [An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

[DeverseFi](https://twitter.com/deversifi/status/1376537192621862912/photo/1) has a great banner listing some of the Layer 2 projects currently building on Ethereum, I'll cover some highlights from this list.

# Application-specific rollups

Currently, all rollups on mainnet are application-specific. Some of the exciting application-specific rollups are:

\- Loopring: Payments and DEX

\- zkSync: Payments

\- [zk.money](https://zk.money): Privacy payments

\- ImmutableX: NFT minting and exchange. Interestingly, ImmutableX will have multiple applications built on top of it that need to mint and exchange NFTs, such as Gods Unchained and OpenSea.

All of these already do thousands of TPS, many offer gas-free interactions with the very low gas abstracted away from the user. For example, ImmutableX can do \~9,600 TPS, with each NFT mint costing $0.002 in gas, easily subsidized by the protocol as being effectively gas-free to the end user. Another important UX improvement is that transactions are confirmed effectively instantly. Do try these products (and more listed in the banner above) for a glimpse into the future of blockchain scalability.

# Programmable rollups

Not every smart contract has the resources to build their own application-specific rollup. This is where a programmable rollups enters the fray, and where most smart contracts will scale. It's a very interesting paradigm where there's intense competition to build the best execution environment on top of Ethereum. (Which is why I call it ""Scalability Race"".) 

**Optimistic Ethereum**: Limited mainnet since January 2021 (currently Synthetix only for staking), public testnet is now live though not officially supported till later in April. Public mainnet July 2021, although we expect ""whitelisted"" projects like Uniswap, Chainlink, MakerDAO to go live before then.

**Arbitrum**: An optimistic rollup and direct competition to Optimistic Ethereum. They are committed to a fully public release, and are currently on their release candidate public testnet. They have a crucial advantage over Optimistic Ethereum currently, with BLS signature aggregation.

**Fuel**: Also an optimistic rollup. Currently offers payments, but plans to expand into smart contracts later in 2021.

**zkSync 2.0**: Similar to Fuel, currently a payments protocol, expanding into generalized smart contract support. Unlike the above three, zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup, which brings the advantage of instant exits to L1. Public testnet: May 2021; public mainnet: July 2021.

**StarkNet**: Direct competitor to zkSync 2.0: a programmable ZK rollup. Scheduled for release in late 2021, though potentially accelerating thanks to an impressive $75 million Series B raise last month.

**Polygon**: Acknowledging the centralization flaws of their current sidechain, Polygon are also developing both ZK and optimistic rollups (among other solutions). No concrete dates I could find. My unsolicited recommendation for Polygon would be to abandon their currently announced kitchen-sink model and laser focus on delivering a world class generalized ZK rollup.

We might end up with a situation here where Ethereum L1 will only act as a settlement and security layer, with a majority of activity happening on rollups. Before we move on beyond rollups, I'd point out that there are multiple projects like Celer, Connext, or Hop that are focusing on interoperability between L1 &lt;&gt; L2 and L2 &lt;&gt; L2.

# Enhancements to application-layer

The application-layer (previously called eth1) protocol, EVM and clients continue to mature. For example, EIP-2929 mitigates DoS attacks and could lead to a minor bump in gas limit. EIP-1559 has strong UX implications that \*might\* mitigate users overpaying for gas, and smooth out spikes. There's no one big upgrade here, but a continuous series of enhancements that'll enable higher gas limits over time. As an example, while I was writing this, Vitalik has published an [intriguing proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082) to further improve EIP-1559. For context, many of these improvements have enabled Ethereum's gas limit to increase from 4M in 2017 to 12.5M today. Eventually, we may even get back to eWASM (?).

# Data sharding / data availability sampling (DAS)

DAS is focused on accelerating rollups by offering massive data availability in a granular manner over 64 shards. Where an efficient rollup can do anywhere between 1,000 TPS to 4,500 TPS today, DAS will accelerate this to potentially over 50,000-100,000 TPS. Gas-efficient rollups like ImmutableX will potentially be accelerated past 200,000 TPS. Previously, this was set to ship before The Merge, but is now coming after The Merge, potentially later in 2022 or early 2023. By the way, The Merge itself does not lead to scalability upgrades, but we could see related [proposals to increase gas limit](https://ethresear.ch/t/commit-to-pre-state-instead-of-post-state-on-the-executable-beacon-chain/8802) after The Merge.

# Statlessness / state expiry

Incredibly, we have gotten this far without actually increasing L1 scalability significantly. L1 gas is going to remain high for the near future - get used to it. This may not matter too much if we have massive scalability on L2, though, as that's where most users will be. L1 will act more of a settlement layer for the bigger players - rollups, exchanges, financial institutions, whales etc.

However, with statelessness / state expiry, this is finally being addressed - L1 gas limits will see significant increases without materially sacrificing decentralization &amp; security. It's still early days, but we finally have some [concrete options available](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). We don't have a date here, but personally I wouldn't expect this before 2023.

# Executable sharding

What was previously Phase 2 has now been pushed back given the better solutions now available. Pretty crazy to think rollups did not even exist when sharding was first conceived as a scalability solution! This is where the shards no longer just offering data availability for rollups, but are also able to execute transactions themselves. It's hard to imagine how this will turn out - if rollups attain critical mass and statelessness allows for a significant enough gas limit uptick, we may not even require executable shards at all and it would be better to focus on enhancing (or increasing) data shards, for example. Or, it could be that we only require a smaller number of executable shards. Definitely the most nebulous step here, and something that'll only become clear over time.

# Hybrid scalability

I definitely believe that we'll see all kinds of hybrid solutions going forward, with various degrees of decentralization over multiple layer. Visa and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) are effectively acting as scalability sidechains for Ethereum, though with a significant degree of centralization. What we might see in the future is that Visa cuts out [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and goes directly to a rollup/L2 wallet/service provider. Likewise, I can also see Reddit build their own rollup, which keeps a lot of data on their centralized servers, and only settles the important stuff on mainnet. We already have such solutions today: for example DeverseFi uses Validium where less critical data like order books (?) are maintained on centralized servers, while all transactions and balances are on-chain. It could even apply for a [mainstream application like Fortnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/midbun/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2021/gt4e4a6).

Alright, that probably ended up much longer than I expected, but hopefully it will be informational because there's a lot of misinformation flying around in the crypto space. Feel free to add/correct things and I'll update the post accordingly."
Does it make sense to dollar cost average short positions on Bitcoin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/mk78fb/does_it_make_sense_to_dollar_cost_average_short/,sfcpfc,0,2021-04-05 07:10:54,66,/r/Buttcoin/comments/mk78fb/does_it_make_sense_to_dollar_cost_average_short/,NaN,"Hi. I've been thinking of dollar cost averaging a short position on Bitcoin and I wanted to get some feedback from you guys. I might do this simply as a thought experiment for fun, or might put small amounts of money, but obviously I wouldn't put more that I can afford to lose.

I would short it through Aave on Matic Network (Ethereum sidechain). Now, before you ask why I would short butts on another buttchain, I'll have you know that Ethereum does have an use case: being a decentralized casino. Fun! Who doesn't love gambling?

I wouldn't short it through exchanges as they are unregulated. Some people talked about using actual financial instruments to short it like MSTR puts, shorting GBTC, etc. but I believe the premiums should be big and honestly that's a rabbit hole I don't want to get involved with.

So, let's assume that:

* MakerDAO and DAI are stable and secure (as in, MakerDAO is never hacked and DAI never crashses)
* Aave is stable and secure
* Ethereum is stable and secure
* Matic is stable and secure (Matic can be removed from the equation but then the gas fees on Ethereum are so high that makes doing this impossible with small amounts of money)

I know, big ""ifs"", but let's just continue with the thought experiment.

Here's my premise: Bitcoin will crash eventually. If you're on /r/Buttcoin you already know and probably agree with this. If we believe that, it could make sense to short it. However, there are two concerns with shorting any asset:

* **For how long?** When will the crash happen? This year? In 5 years? No one knows. We do know that it has to crash because it's not sustainable for it to go up forever, but we don't know *when*.

  For shorting in the stock market one would have to pay interest. However in AAVE v2 the average borrow interest for WBTC since inception has been 1.26% while the deposit interest on DAI has been 8.80% (source: https://v2.aavewatch.com/).

  Assuming that we borrow WBTC and sell it for DAI, this means that as long as the BTC price doesn't move, not only we're not paying premiums for our position, we're also earing ""money"" on it. I understand that normally being early would be the same as being wrong, but if we don't pay for our position... then it may not hold true this time.

  For those of you who haven't been exposed to this DeFi madness, this is the same as if I wanted to short TSLA and my broker offered to lend me a share for 1% interest, while having access to 8% deposits on my bank account. Nonsense, right? Is it sustainable? Maybe...? The DAI interest comes from gamblers who're leveraging their position on other cryptocurrencies so it might be sustainable for the short term.

* **What if it goes up?** As we all know, we are not visionaries and we can't predict when the bubble will pop. We can't even predict if we reached the top already. The market is irrational and BTC might reach 100k, 200k... who knows? What we all know is the end result.

  So in order to protect against number go up, we dollar cost average our short positions. Just like butters who DCA their way up, we DCA our way down.

  On stock markets, it is believed that dumping all cash once (""lump sum"") is better than dollar cost averaging over time, because stonks always go up. The same would hold true for shorting, in a theoretical world where we had infinite money, but not in the real world where we can get liquidated.

  However, DCA should protect us against liquidations. We allocate a budget (say 100‚Ç¨ month) and distribute it according to our risk parameters (say 60‚Ç¨ shorts, 40‚Ç¨ collateral). If Bitcoin goes up, we short 60‚Ç¨ worth of Bitcoin and add the 100‚Ç¨ as collateral (40‚Ç¨ from our allocation and 60‚Ç¨ from the sale of BTC).

  This goes on for as long as needed until the bubble bursts, which we are certain that will happen eventually. I believe this should work as long as we can get the 100‚Ç¨/month flow going (otherwise it's game over and we lose everything).

So what do you think? I haven't done the math exhaustively yet. I know that there are many intelligent people in this sub and can point out a couple of flaws on my reasoning (besides the obvious flaw of trusting crypto buttchains to keep our position safe)

TL;DR: It literally can't go tits up"
Algunas cripto-inversiones de riesgo moderado y sin custodia [Abril 2021],https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/mk7doi/algunas_criptoinversiones_de_riesgo_moderado_y/,galapag0,5,2021-04-05 07:19:19,22,/r/merval/comments/mk7doi/algunas_criptoinversiones_de_riesgo_moderado_y/,CRYPTO,"Reedito [mi post original](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/jrrliw/algunas_criptoinversiones_de_riesgo_moderado_y/) sobre inversiones cripto de riesgo ""moderado"", para actualizar la informaci√≥n y proveer algunas nuevas alternativas interesantes. De igual forma que mis posts anteriores, estas son todas inversiones sin custodia que puede hacer sin KYC ni nada por el estilo. Estas inversiones pueden generar m√°rgenes m√°s interesantes (es dif√≠cil ponerle n√∫meros, pero algunos pueden subir 5% en un d√≠a), a√∫n con bajo capital (menos de 1k USD). Por supuesto, tambi√©n tienen un riesgo mayor. 

Eleg√≠ estas criptos por sus fundamentos, por eso recomiendo fuertemente que se pongan a leer como funcionan y para qu√© sirven para que saquen sus propias conclusiones (al contrario de como funcionan muchos DeFi con nombre de comida que suben 100000% en un d√≠a para despu√©s desaparecer al otro d√≠a por un [exit scam](https://www.criptonoticias.com/mercados/sushiswap-tokens-aparta-proyecto-6-millones-dolares-ether/)). Para comprar o vender estas criptos sin KYC, pueden [usar Dharma/Argent](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/j7ou73/argent_vs_dharma_an%C3%A1lisis_de_wallets_de_ethereum/) o cualquier otra billetera con f√°cil acceso a [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) u otros exchanges similares.

Sin m√°s pre√°mbulos, ac√° est√° algunas criptos para holdear en Ethereum:

* ETH: el combustible con el cual funciona la red de Ethereum. No hay mucho para decir, salvo que ahora mismo est√° en un valor ""m√°ximo"" de este a√±o, as√≠ que entren con cuidado.

* SNX: el token fundamental de Synthetix, un [proyecto para generar tokens cuyo precio sigan a bienes reales](https://criptoblog.tutellus.com/synthetix-protocol-y-los-assets-sinteticos/), pero que se puedan comprar o vender como cualquier cripto. Una cripto vol√°til, pero en mi opini√≥n, con gran potencial de crecimiento.

* Los tokens de gobernanza de MakerDAO (MKR), Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP) y AAVE (AAVE): estos tokens tienen buenas perspectivas de crecimiento mientras que DAI, Uniswap, Compound y AAVE sigan siendo relevantes en el espacio cripto (cosa que es probable, en mi opini√≥n). Adem√°s, destaco RSR, el token dual de [Reserve](https://reserve.org/), que apunta a ser una nueva stablecoin para los pa√≠ses latinoamericanos y viene creciendo much√≠simo en pa√≠ses como Venezuela. 

* AMPL: este es un token muy distinto a los dem√°s. Es b√°sicamente [un experimento monetario donde se ajusta todos los d√≠as la cantidad de tokens emitidos para alcanzar un equilibrio del precio](https://www.ampleforth.org/) (muy cercano a 1 USD). La idea es arbitrar *diariamente* con este comportamiento. Extremadamente recomendable [entender bien como funciona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-8yjmsshFg) antes de entrar. En mi opini√≥n, es recomendable s√≥lo si su precio est√° por debajo de 0.70 USD. 

Y fuera de Ethereum tenemos:

* XTZ: la moneda nativa de la red de [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), el m√°s serio competidor de competidor de Ethereum hasta ahora por evitar el uso excesivo de energ√≠a (PoS) y tener contratos inteligentes ya funcionando (incluso un incipiente desarrollo de DeFi como [Dexter](https://dexter.exchange/))

* ADA: el otro competidor serio de Ethereum con PoS es [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) con buenas perspectivas pero un poco m√°s atr√°s que Tezos. El proyecto promete pero todav√≠a no han lanzado contratos inteligentes sobre Cardano, pero puede ser una inversi√≥n interesante, aunque sea una cantidad baja.

Dejo afuera BNB por ahora por ser una cripto completamente controlada por Binance, pero si les interesa /u/No_Swan1684 hizo [un excelente post al respecto](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/lmz5ju/binance_smart_chain_pancakeswap_y_farming_sin/).

En mi opini√≥n, estas son inversiones de riesgo moderado porque es muy poco probable que su valor sea cero de un d√≠a para otro (todos son proyectos conocidos, con auditor√≠as p√∫blicas y bien mantenidos por su comunidad). De todas maneras, sean responsables, y usen s√≥lo una parte de su capital en este tipo de inversiones."

This Microcap Gem Has A Market Cap of $8 Million - Going To Be $700 Million Soon,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mkoo7k/this_microcap_gem_has_a_market_cap_of_8_million/,JizenM,1,2021-04-06 00:28:31,244,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mkoo7k/this_microcap_gem_has_a_market_cap_of_8_million/,Low MCAP coin,"If you don't know who I am, I'm a blockchain enthusiast and Bitcoin investor since 2010/2011 who happens to love this subreddit. I've given you a few microcap gems already, like; [BiFrost - $BFC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/lw9a4b/my_1st_post_post_here_my_100x_token/) when it was around $0.05 and more recently this post about [PhoenixDAO - $PHNX](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/miqo8o/this_microcap_gem_is_about_to_blow_up_is/) when it was around $0.08. 

**I'm here to let you know about another massively undervalued microcap project that has already been posted on this subreddit, (I actually started my research into it after seeing it here).** 

However, I don't think the previous post here got enough attention, (at least not compared to some of the shitcoins often posted here), but since I have quite a few followers I'm hoping this post will give the attention to this project that it deserves. 

Let me know in the comments what you think? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç 

The microcap gem that I'm talking about is **Open Governence Token (OpenDAO - $OPEN) which is a *massively undervalued microcap* project currently sitting at a measly $8 million market cap** with a token price of only around $2.25 at the moment! 

**In my opinion this project is going to explode in value to at least $100 million market cap in the coming days/weeks, and probably $700 - $800 million minimum in the coming 12-18 months*, assuming they manage to deliver what they're promising.** 

**It's one of those rare microcaps that are getting harder and harder to find in this bull market, and that's about to explode in price.** 

$OPEN is project with a solid product that has *incredible value potential* and an experienced fully doxed team, and ***with several VC firms that have already scrutinised the project and invested their own money in the first seed rounds.*** 

Ok, so what is the Open DAO project, what are they doing, and why is it so undervalued? 

**In the first Phase Open DAO - $OPEN is building a system to collateralize all types of online tokens/coins that are currently not possible to use as a security for loans.** 

So what does that mean? 

It means that if you for example hold some *Raven coin*, *DigiByte* or *Swissborg* or any other of the thousands of cryptocurrencies and tokens available on Coinmarketcap, you will soon be able to use these coins as collateral to borrow USD, (stablecoins) at a low yearly interest rate (I believe around 2% or 3%). 

So let's say that you're in crypto for the long haul, (not just to make some quick fiat gains) and you have some tokens you don't want to sell. 

However, at the same time you'd like to free up some cash to buy a new car... 

**With $OPEN you'll now be able to use those strange and wonderful tokens or coins you own as collateral for a USD loan.** 

As you probably know you can already do this with BTC, ETH, BAT and a few other cryptos that have massive marketcaps on places like MakerDAO, Compound and others, *but no one else offers you the ability to use virtually ANY tokens/coins as collateral for loans*. 

**If this got you a bit excited about the potential of $OPEN you'll need to sit down, because we're only just getting started...** üôÇ 

What I've described above is only **Phase 1** of the *Open Governence Token* project, and that Phase has already started to launc just recently. 

**Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 are going to blow you away!** 

In Phase 2 you'll be able to use almost ANY listed stocks you own as collateral if you want to borrow money. 

Do you own 100 or 1000 shares in Tesla, Facebook or Apple for example? 

Ok, you can just lock them up as security in what OpenDAO calls a ***""Cashbox""*** and then use your stocks as collateral to borrow money, (see this videos to understand how the ""cashbox"" system works: https://vimeo.com/478731239 ). 

All without the hassle of dealing with a bank demanding: 

***""pLeAsE pRoViDe YoUr InCoMe StAtEmEnTs FoR tHe LaSt 3 YeArS aNd ShOw Us hOw YoU sPeNd YoUr MoNeY oVeR tHe LaSt 6 MoNtHs, So We cAn MaKe SuRe YoU kNoW hOw To KeEp A bUdGeT.""*** 

**If you go through all this hassle then *MAYBE* we will *CONSIDER* lending you some money, IF your credit score and our other arbitrary demands meet our lending criteria. Oh and yeah that will be at 8.5% interest rate since you don't have any collateral!""** 

***""But Ma'm I DO have collateral. Look, I have all these stocks in my Robinhood account, and my expensive car that's parked right outside!""*** 

***""yEaH bUt We DoN't AcCePt ThOsE sOrT oF tHiNgS aS cOlLaTeRaL aNd 2 yEaRs AgO yOu WeRe 2 WeEkS lAtE oN a PaRkInG tIcKeT.""*** 

Most of us are done with banks and their horrible and predatory practices, for these and many other reasons! üôÑ 

**With OpenDAO and DeFi we don't really need the banks anymore!** üôÇ 

Let's move on... 

**In Phase 3 you'll be able to use gold, silver, your car, you camper van, your summer cabin or maybe even your valuable collectable guitar or almost any other small asset you own as collateral for a loan.** 

And finally... 

**In Phase 4 you'll be able to use land, commercial real estate and other large assets as collateral, making banks almost completely irrelevant.** 

Are you starting to see how big this is going to be yet? üôÇ 

**Here we have a startup crypto project that was launched last year, with a competent team and a project that has been scrutinised by several prominent blockchain Venture Capital Firms who have invested in it (because they know they are going to 100x their investment or more), sitting at *only $8 million* market cap!** 

It's almost unbelievable, and the only explanation is that they're busy building and haven't done any marketing yet, and the VC firms (that normally help with marketing) haven't done much so far, but all that's about to change! 

**According to the team a marketing campaign is planned for the near future. Apparently multiple top crypto and financial publications as well as well-known YouTubers will soon start writing/talking about $OPEN. They‚Äôre also in talks to get listed on multiple big exchanges.** 

Once this happnes, (could be within days, or maybe weeks, I don't know, but it's about to happen), the floodgates will open and the big investors will pick up on this project, which is *virtually unknown* now except for the VC firms that have already invested... 

**This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor, just like the VC firms, and ride the 10x to 100x wave that's *virtually guaranteed* in the coming days/weeks/months (it's always hard to time excatly WHEN something will explode).** üôÇ 

Let me expand a bit about the VC firms btw. 

***""What's all this about VC firms, and why is it a big deal?""*** 

It's important because *OpenDAO (Open Governence Token) has gone through the extensive scrutiny* that comes with raising money from Venture Capital firms. These companies don't just throw millions in seed round funding to projects that they haven't scrutinized and analyzed. 

They do their research before investing. 

**Here Are Some Of The Venture Capital Firms That Have Invested In OpenDAO - $OPEN** 

**Moonwhale** 

These are the guys that discovered and were seed fund investors in projects like ***Avalanche***, ***SuperRare*** and ***Celsius***. 

**Signum Capital** 

This is a Singapore based Venture Capital firm that funded projects like ***Kyber Network*** and ***Zilliqa***. 

**X21 Ventures** 

These guys put in $2 million in the first seed round for ***PAID Network*** for example. 

But you may still be asking: 

*""Why is it so beneficial for me that these VC firms have already invested in Open DAO - $OPEN?""* 

**Here is my take:** 

It's really difficult for ordinary people like you and me to evaluate projects with ambitious plans with a lot of technical aspects to them, like Open DAO has. Remember, they want to collateralize almost **all** onchain and offchain assets! 

It was the same when MakerDao first arrived on the scene. 

*""Is it possible to do what they're planning technically?""* 

*""Are they likely to succeed?""* 

MakerDao now costs more than $2200 per token and is valued at more than $2.2 Billion, but it was hard to know when it launched if it would really work, **and I think these sums may be peanuts compared to what the Open Governence Token could be worth if they succeed!** 

*""Why?""* 

Because the markets they are about to collateralize are so massive. 

**All Crypto:** $1.9 TRILLION
**Stocks:** $85 TRILLION
**Real Estate:** $250 - $300 TRILLION 
**Gold/Silver:** $10 

That's hundreds of Trillions combined, and **$OPEN only needs to capture a tiny fraction of a percent of *any* of these lending markets to be worth Billions, and at the moment they are worth $8 Million!** 

So you do the math on what's about to happen to the token price once this projects gets out there. üôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My point is that it's a lot easier to judge ***the idea*** of a project, (and I think we can all agree that this idea is amazing), than it is to judge the team's ability to execute on that idea, ***but this is where Venture Capital firms excel.*** 

They have specialists that evaluate the team members, not just to make sure they're legit, but also to make sure they have the required expertise to execute on their plans. 

They are also experts at evaluating whether the project plans are achievable or not. 

In the case of $OPEN several of the heavy hitter VC firms have decided that; *""Yes their plans are indeed possible.""* and that's why several prominent VC firms have invested in them. That's important. 

Another good thing is that most VC firms don't just offer funds and then tell the team to; *""Go off and build your idea now"".* 

**They often also function like incubators.** They help projects get the right start, make sure they stay legal and help them deal with compliance and help them promote in mainstream media etc. once the projects are ready and go live. 

VC firms want the maximum return on the projects they invest in, it's as simple as that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç 

**Anyway, this post got a bit longer than I had planned, but I hope you now understand why a $8 million market cap, (or even $40 million if it was that!) makes OpenDAO MASSIVELY undervalued, and at some point soon it will explode in value.** 

It's up to you if you want to be part of that ride or not? 

I know I'm going to be. üôÇ 

**DISCLAIMER** I have a substantial holding in OpenDAO that I've dollar cost averaged in at around $2.15 or so. I plan to sell around 30% once it hits $12 to $15 and hold the rest for at least 18 to 24 months until their project is fully operational. 

**RISK WARNING:** Although I believe there is very little chance of losing money long-term when investing in OpenDAO at these sort of prices (anything below $7 to $8) **there are no guarantees in crypto!** 

***ONLY EVER INVEST MONEY THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE IN ANY CRYPTO PROJECTS AND ALWAYS DYOR AND ATTEMPT TO VERIFY ALL INFORMATION YOURSELF!***

That's hundreds of Trillions combined, and **$OPEN only needs to capture a tiny fraction of a percent of *any* of these lending markets to be worth Billions, and at the moment they are worth $8 Million!** 

So you do the math on what's about to happen to the token price once this projects gets out there. üôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My point is that it's a lot easier to judge ***the idea*** of a project, (and I think we can all agree that this idea is amazing), than it is to judge the team's ability to execute on that idea, ***but this is where Venture Capital firms excel.*** 

They have specialists that evaluate the team members, not just to make sure they're legit, but also to make sure they have the required expertise to execute on their plans. 

They are also experts at evaluating whether the project plans are achievable or not. 

In the case of $OPEN several of the heavy hitter VC firms have decided that; *""Yes their plans are indeed possible.""* and that's why several prominent VC firms have invested in them. That's important. 

Another good thing is that most VC firms don't just offer funds and then tell the team to; *""Go off and build your idea now"".* 

**They often also function like incubators.** They help projects get the right start, make sure they stay legal and help them deal with compliance and help them promote in mainstream media etc. once the projects are ready and go live. 

VC firms want the maximum return on the projects they invest in, it's as simple as that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç 

**Anyway, this post got a bit longer than I had planned, but I hope you now understand why a $8 million market cap, (or even $40 million if it was that!) makes OpenDAO MASSIVELY undervalued, and at some point soon it will explode in value.** 

It's up to you if you want to be part of that ride or not? 

I know I'm going to be. üôÇ 

**DISCLAIMER** I have a substantial holding in OpenDAO that I've dollar cost averaged in at around $2.15 or so. I plan to sell around 30% once it hits $12 to $15 and hold the rest for at least 18 to 24 months until their project is fully operational. 

**RISK WARNING:** Although I believe there is very little chance of losing money long-term when investing in OpenDAO at these sort of prices (anything below $7 to $8) **there are no guarantees in crypto!**

The Open Governance Token are building a new stablecoin that can be collateralized by a variety of assets, including multiple tokens that we can't use as collateral in MAKER. 

They're also going to make it possible to collateralize offline assets soon. You can already borrow USD stablecoins with gold and silver as security for the loan. 

I'm excited about the idea of being able to borrow money and using my smaller market cap tokens as security for the loan, but I'm curious what everyone thinks about how realistic it is for OPEN to also tokenize offline assets? 

They are apparently using something called a ""cashbox"" to secure the offline assets, (there is a video on their website explaining how it works), which I assume is similar to ""the vault"" that MakerDAO uses? 

I guess I'm just curious to know if you all think the plans that the Open Governance Token have are realistic technically? At the moment it has such a low valuation but it sounded on that post like the OPEN project could become even bigger than MakerDAO if they succeed. 

If that's the case I don't want to miss out on the opportunity, but sometimes on those smaller subreddits you get a lot of hype, so I wanted to hear some unbiased opinions?"

This Microcap Gem Has A Market Cap of $8 Million - Going To Be $700 Million Soon,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRYPTOPUMPCLUB/comments/mlkfdv/this_microcap_gem_has_a_market_cap_of_8_million/,Temporary_Activity95,1,2021-04-07 04:04:37,0,/r/CRYPTOPUMPCLUB/comments/mlkfdv/this_microcap_gem_has_a_market_cap_of_8_million/,NaN,"If you don't know who I am, I'm a blockchain enthusiast and Bitcoin investor who happens to love these Facebook groups. I've given a few microcap gems already, like; [BiFrost - $BFC] when it was around $0.05 and more recently Phoenix Dao. 

**I'm here to let you know of a massively undervalued microcap project that has the potential explode, (I actually started my research into it after seeing it here).** 

However, I don't think previous posts here got enough attention, (at least not compared to some of the shitcoins often posted here), but since I have quite a few followers I'm hoping this post will give the attention to this project that it deserves. 

Let me know in the comments what you think? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç 

The microcap gem that I'm talking about is **Open Governence Token (OpenDAO - $OPEN) which is a *massively undervalued microcap* project currently sitting at a measly $8 million market cap** with a token price of only around $2.25 at the moment! 

**In my opinion this project is going to explode in value to at least $100 million market cap in the coming days/weeks, and probably $700 - $800 million minimum in the coming 12-18 months*, assuming they manage to deliver what they're promising.** 

**It's one of those rare microcaps that are getting harder and harder to find in this bull market, and that's about to explode in price.** 

$OPEN is project with a solid product that has *incredible value potential* and an experienced fully doxed team, and ***with several VC firms that have already scrutinised the project and invested their own money in the first seed rounds.*** 

Ok, so what is the Open DAO project, what are they doing, and why is it so undervalued? 

**In the first Phase Open DAO - $OPEN is building a system to collateralize all types of online tokens/coins that are currently not possible to use as a security for loans.** 

So what does that mean? 

It means that if you for example hold some *Raven coin*, *DigiByte* or *Swissborg* or any other of the thousands of cryptocurrencies and tokens available on Coinmarketcap, you will soon be able to use these coins as collateral to borrow USD, (stablecoins) at a low yearly interest rate (I believe around 2% or 3%). 

So let's say that you're in crypto for the long haul, (not just to make some quick fiat gains) and you have some tokens you don't want to sell. 

However, at the same time you'd like to free up some cash to buy a new car... 

**With $OPEN you'll now be able to use those strange and wonderful tokens or coins you own as collateral for a USD loan.** 

As you probably know you can already do this with BTC, ETH, BAT and a few other cryptos that have massive marketcaps on places like MakerDAO, Compound and others, *but no one else offers you the ability to use virtually ANY tokens/coins as collateral for loans*. 

**If this got you a bit excited about the potential of $OPEN you'll need to sit down, because we're only just getting started...** üôÇ 

What I've described above is only **Phase 1** of the *Open Governence Token* project, and that Phase has already started to launch just recently. 

**Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 are going to blow you away!** 

In Phase 2 you'll be able to use almost ANY listed stocks you own as collateral if you want to borrow money. 

Do you own 100 or 1000 shares in Tesla, Facebook or Apple for example? 

Ok, you can just lock them up as security in what OpenDAO calls a ***""Cashbox""*** and then use your stocks as collateral to borrow money, (see this videos to understand how the ""cashbox"" system works: https://vimeo.com/478731239 ). 

All without the hassle of dealing with a bank demanding: 

***""pLeAsE pRoViDe YoUr InCoMe StAtEmEnTs FoR tHe LaSt 3 YeArS aNd ShOw Us hOw YoU sPeNd YoUr MoNeY oVeR tHe LaSt 6 MoNtHs, So We cAn MaKe SuRe YoU kNoW hOw To KeEp A bUdGeT.""*** 

**If you go through all this hassle then *MAYBE* we will *CONSIDER* lending you some money, IF your credit score and our other arbitrary demands meet our lending criteria. Oh and yeah that will be at 8.5% interest rate since you don't have any collateral!""** 

***""But Ma'm I DO have collateral. Look, I have all these stocks in my Robinhood account, and my expensive car that's parked right outside!""*** 

***""yEaH bUt We DoN't AcCePt ThOsE sOrT oF tHiNgS aS cOlLaTeRaL aNd 2 yEaRs AgO yOu WeRe 2 WeEkS lAtE oN a PaRkInG tIcKeT.""*** 

Most of us are done with banks and their horrible and predatory practices, for these and many other reasons! üôÑ 

**With OpenDAO and DeFi we don't really need the banks anymore!** üôÇ 

Let's move on... 

**In Phase 3 you'll be able to use gold, silver, your car, you camper van, your summer cabin or maybe even your valuable collectable guitar or almost any other small asset you own as collateral for a loan.** 

And finally... 

**In Phase 4 you'll be able to use land, commercial real estate and other large assets as collateral, making banks almost completely irrelevant.** 

Are you starting to see how big this is going to be yet? üôÇ 

**Here we have a startup crypto project that was launched last year, with a competent team and a project that has been scrutinised by several prominent blockchain Venture Capital Firms who have invested in it (because they know they are going to 100x their investment or more), sitting at *only $8 million* market cap!** 

It's almost unbelievable, and the only explanation is that they're busy building and haven't done any marketing yet, and the VC firms (that normally help with marketing) haven't done much so far, but all that's about to change! 

**According to the team a marketing campaign is planned for the near future. Apparently multiple top crypto and financial publications as well as well-known YouTubers will soon start writing/talking about $OPEN. They‚Äôre also in talks to get listed on multiple big exchanges.** 

Once this happnes, (could be within days, or maybe weeks, I don't know, but it's about to happen), the floodgates will open and the big investors will pick up on this project, which is *virtually unknown* now except for the VC firms that have already invested... 

**This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor, just like the VC firms, and ride the 10x to 100x wave that's *virtually guaranteed* in the coming days/weeks/months (it's always hard to time excatly WHEN something will explode).** üôÇ 

Let me expand a bit about the VC firms btw. 

***""What's all this about VC firms, and why is it a big deal?""*** 

It's important because *OpenDAO (Open Governence Token) has gone through the extensive scrutiny* that comes with raising money from Venture Capital firms. These companies don't just throw millions in seed round funding to projects that they haven't scrutinized and analyzed. 

They do their research before investing. 

**Here Are Some Of The Venture Capital Firms That Have Invested In OpenDAO - $OPEN** 

**Moonwhale** 

These are the guys that discovered and were seed fund investors in projects like ***Avalanche***, ***SuperRare*** and ***Celsius***. 

**Signum Capital** 

This is a Singapore based Venture Capital firm that funded projects like ***Kyber Network*** and ***Zilliqa***. 

**X21 Ventures** 

These guys put in $2 million in the first seed round for ***PAID Network*** for example. 

But you may still be asking: 

*""Why is it so beneficial for me that these VC firms have already invested in Open DAO - $OPEN?""* 

**Here is my take:** 

It's really difficult for ordinary people like you and me to evaluate projects with ambitious plans with a lot of technical aspects to them, like Open DAO has. Remember, they want to collateralize almost **all** onchain and offchain assets! 

It was the same when MakerDao first arrived on the scene. 

*""Is it possible to do what they're planning technically?""* 

*""Are they likely to succeed?""* 

**MakerDao now costs more than $2200 per token and is valued at more than $2.2 Billion, but it was hard to know when it launched if it would really work. I think Open Governence Token - $OPEN could be much more valuable if they succeed!** 

*""Why?""* 

Because the markets they are about to collateralize are so massive. 

**All Crypto:** $1.9 TRILLION

**Stocks:** $85 TRILLION

**Real Estate:** $250 - $300 TRILLION 

**Gold/Silver:** $10 - $11 TRILLION

That's hundreds of Trillions combined, and **$OPEN only needs to capture a tiny fraction of a percent of *any* of these lending markets to be worth Billions, and at the moment they are worth $8 Million!** 

So you do the math on what's about to happen to the token price once this projects gets out there. üôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My point is that it's a lot easier to judge ***the idea*** of a project, (and I think we can all agree that this idea is amazing), than it is to judge the team's ability to execute on that idea, ***but this is where Venture Capital firms excel.*** 

They have specialists that evaluate the team members, not just to make sure they're legit, but also to make sure they have the required expertise to execute on their plans. 

They are also experts at evaluating whether the project plans are achievable or not.

I aped in and bought some after seeing that post, and today I was pleasantly surprised to see I had gained 20% since yesterday.

Anyway, I liked the idea of $OPEN so much that today I decided to start doing some of my own research into this coin. **Because although it sounded soooooo promising in that post yesterday many of us have learned that not everything that glimmer is gold!**

**Anyway I'm now more convinced than I was yesterday that this is could be the investment of a lifetime for me!** 

Let me tell you what I found out today, (or maybe I was just too stupid to figure out yesterday and all of you guys already did?).

**OpenDAO is creating a bank!**

Not in the strict sense of the word maybe, but they are going to make as much if not MORE money than a bank does, AND ALL THAT MONEY WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG THE $OPEN token holders! That's crazy!

**Most of us know that the reason banks make so much money is because** ***they have the power to CREATE MONEY*** **by giving out loans.** 

**That is exactly what $OPEN is going to do. Create money from nothing, and then lend it out with interest!**

And guess who gets the interest? We do!

How?

**THEY ARE GOING TO PAY ALL OF US DIVIDENDS FROM THE PROFITS!**

And the craziest thing of it all is that we get to vote and decide HOW MUCH dividents we are going to get!

You know the big bosses on the board of directors in the banks, voting massive dividends and golden parachutes for each other? 

That's going to be us with $OPEN!

Yesterday I invested after having seen that post because I saw great potential for the $OPEN token to go up a lot in price. 

It's hard not to think it will when you compare it with MakerDAO (the token that creates the $DAI stablecoin) and you realize that MakerDAO is worth $2.3 BILLION and the token costs $2,350. 

Then you compare it to OpenDAO with a tiny market cap and costs $2.20 and you realize that soon OpenDAO is likely going to be MORE valuable than MakerDAO because of what was explained in that post yesterday!

So that's why I invested yesterday, **but today I learned something even MORE exciting that I guess I was too dumb to understand from the post yesterday?** 

**The Open Governance token is ALSO going to be paying dividends to us token holders!** 

These are the profits that the ""bank"" makes by creating money (almost from thin air) and then lending it out with interest. 

Anyway, I just got so excited by all that news and wanted to share it with anyone who invested in $OPEN yesterday like I did.

Here is the video where I discovered all this. 

It's from the official OpenDAO channel and an interview with the lead architect , but for some reason it only has like 130 views so far (no wonder this is a true moonshot!). The sound is really bad and it's hard to understan, but the information is priceless!

CURIO INVEST - $CUR ‚Äì $3 million cap swiss crypto startup tokenizing real world assets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mlz5bv/curio_invest_cur_3_million_cap_swiss_crypto/,feelzerian,1,2021-04-07 18:31:11,19,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mlz5bv/curio_invest_cur_3_million_cap_swiss_crypto/,Low MCAP coin,"**CURIO INVEST - $CUR TOKEN** 

TLDR: $ 3 million market cap and one of the most legit projects you will find in crypto regardless of market cap. For god‚Äôs sake take 5 minutes and just read it. **Oh and they will buy a Tesla.**

First, lets quickly look at how legit CURIO is in comparison to crypto in general and especially compared to other tiny market caps:

* The company behind curio is ‚ÄúCurio AG‚Äù, a registered company in Indi‚Ä¶ just kidding, CURIO is based in Switzerland and the company is registered in Liechtenstein. A shit ton of large european companies are registered in Liechtenstein for tax reasons; I know because I worked for one of Germany‚Äôs largest tax law firms and had to advise these tax evaders daily‚Ä¶ but they were rich, at least. An ‚ÄúAG‚Äù is basically a corporation for you us law folks. The commercial register entry is [right here](https://imgur.com/a/N9CbJhp) for you.
* They are [part of the ‚Äúswiss fintech national team‚Äù](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2020-09-17/schweizer-fintech-nati-geht-auf-pitch-tour), a small group of swiss fintech companies chosen by switzerlands biggest start up incubator
* One of switzerlands largest newspapers [wrote a whole article about Curio](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/geld/fuer-100-franken-einen-anteil-an-einem-ferrari-kaufen/story/28029869)
* a thousand other things like [being chosen as the best swiss crypto startup](https://gomedici.com/top-blockchain-startups-in-switzerland-crypto-valley)

What does Curio do? Well, let‚Äôs start with a copypasta: CurioInvest is a fintech platform enabling tokenized investments in rare collectible cars and other fine assets. Curio brings real-world assets into the Blockchain, so private investors can use them as collateral for lending as well as other DeFi services."" In essence, it enables new financial services in previous illiquid markets available for both institutional as well as retail investors.

But let me put it in simpler words:

Rich folk don‚Äôt just buy boomer ETFs or invest in hedgefunds. They also buy really really nice shit that appreciates in value even more than their stocks. Quote by Christoph Gr√∂ne (rich fuck): ‚ÄúWhen you have 250 million, you can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door. You can't destroy it. You buy a car, the car becomes more valuable. You buy houses, the houses become more valuable. You go into Gold, the Gold becomes more valuable. You can't destroy the money by consumption.‚Äù (for German speaking folks, it's [right a at the start of this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y2WxM2Srlc))

**Wait, did he just say you buy a car and it becomes more valuable?** Yes he did, and he knows best, since he has these 250 million bucks.

Now, he isn‚Äôt talking about buying a Ford Focus, but about buying really nice cars. He can do it, but you and I can‚Äôt. But what if we split that Ferrari F12tdf worth $1 Million into a million parts? You would throw $100 in, I‚Äôm putting 20k down and if we find enough people, we can buy that really nice car and everyone has a stake in it. Remember: You can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door, you can‚Äôt destroy it. This is how the rich fucks are doing it, they just don‚Äôt need a crowd.

And now give a big fucking applause to CURIO: With Curio, really nice real-world assets are being tokenized so that you and I TOGETHER can buy our fair share of that Ferrari, of that nice real estate object, of that fine Mona Lisa or nice million dollar bottle of wine and make money like the rich fucks do. And who looks after that Ferrari or that Mona Lisa? Curio does.

UNilord protocol is far more better then FEI , FEI protocol have burned so many ETH and even after this protocol is not stable.

PEER is a critical component of the Unilord Protocol, which allows anyone to leverage their crypto assets by balancing dual-control assets Unipeer (Non-Governance Token) and Unilord (Governance Token) in the market and the products. These dual assets can be utilized as universal, low volatility collateral that can maintain its value and other decentralized finance protocols from sudden market shifts.

The PEER token‚Äôs market capitalization is calculated based on the expected LORD‚Äôs future price as well as its self-burning rate. Additionally, as the PEER market cap increases, so does the system‚Äôs ability to keep LORD stable. Thus, the design‚Äôs priority is to accrue maximal value to the PEER token while maintaining LORD as a systematic stable coin.

The Unipeer Non-Governance Token is a non-stable mining token in the Unilord Protocol. It is meant to be volatile and hold rights to governance and all excess De-Fi products provided by Unilord. It is important to note that we take a highly governance-minimized approach to designing trustless tokens. We eschew DAO-like active management such as MakerDAO.

 The fewer parameters for a community to actively manage, the less there is to disagree. The only parameters for governance through PEER are adding and switching through the pools provided to accrue values. 

The PEER token might be volatile, which might experience upside and downside through the system. The PEER supply is initially set to 100,000,000 tokens at genesis.

 However, the circulation amount will likely be deflationary as **3% of PEER executed in transactions are burned and used for fees on our own products.** The protocol design is such that PEER would be broadly deflationary in supply as long as LORD demand grows.

TLDR: [$ 3.5 million market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/curio/) and one of the most legit projects you will find in crypto regardless of market cap. TA is looking fine, 2$ is stronghold support and [the chart is ready for elliot wave 5](https://i2.wp.com/patternswizard.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/elliottwave.png?fit=2914%2C1509&amp;ssl=1). For god‚Äôs sake take 5 minutes and just read it. **Oh and they will buy a Tesla.**

First, lets quickly look at how legit CURIO is in comparison to crypto in general and especially compared to other tiny market caps:

* The company behind curio is ‚ÄúCurio AG‚Äù, a registered company in Indi‚Ä¶ just kidding, CURIO is based in Switzerland and the company is registered in Liechtenstein. A shit ton of large european companies are registered in Liechtenstein for tax reasons; I know because I worked for one of Germany‚Äôs largest tax law firms and had to advise these tax evaders daily‚Ä¶ but they were rich, at least. An ‚ÄúAG‚Äù is basically a corporation for you us law folks. The commercial register entry is [right here](https://imgur.com/a/N9CbJhp) for you.
* They are [part of the ‚Äúswiss fintech national team‚Äù](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2020-09-17/schweizer-fintech-nati-geht-auf-pitch-tour), a small group of swiss fintech companies chosen by switzerlands biggest start up incubator
* One of switzerlands largest newspapers [wrote a whole article about Curio](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/geld/fuer-100-franken-einen-anteil-an-einem-ferrari-kaufen/story/28029869)
* a thousand other things like [being chosen as the best swiss crypto startup](https://gomedici.com/top-blockchain-startups-in-switzerland-crypto-valley)

What does Curio do? Well, let‚Äôs start with a copypasta: CurioInvest is a fintech platform enabling tokenized investments in rare collectible cars and other fine assets. Curio brings real-world assets into the Blockchain, so private investors can use them as collateral for lending as well as other DeFi services."" In essence, it enables new financial services in previous illiquid markets available for both institutional as well as retail investors.

But let me put it in simpler words:

Rich folk don‚Äôt just buy boomer ETFs or invest in hedgefunds. They also buy really really nice shit that appreciates in value even more than their stocks. Quote by Christoph Gr√∂ne (rich fuck): ‚ÄúWhen you have 250 million, you can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door. You can't destroy it. You buy a car, the car becomes more valuable. You buy houses, the houses become more valuable. You go into Gold, the Gold becomes more valuable. You can't destroy the money by consumption.‚Äù (for German speaking folks, it's [right a at the start of this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y2WxM2Srlc))

**Wait, did he just say you buy a car and it becomes more valuable?** Yes he did, and he knows best, since he has these 250 million bucks.

Now, he isn‚Äôt talking about buying a Ford Focus, but about buying really nice cars. He can do it, but you and I can‚Äôt. But what if we split that Ferrari F12tdf worth $1 Million into a million parts? You would throw $100 in, I‚Äôm putting 20k down and if we find enough people, we can buy that really nice car and everyone has a stake in it. Remember: You can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door, you can‚Äôt destroy it. This is how the rich fucks are doing it, they just don‚Äôt need a crowd.

And now give a big fucking applause to CURIO: With Curio, really nice real-world assets are being tokenized so that you and I TOGETHER can buy our fair share of that Ferrari, of that nice real estate object, of that fine Mona Lisa or nice million dollar bottle of wine and make money like the rich fucks do. And who looks after that Ferrari or that Mona Lisa? Curio does. Curio rent‚Äôs the garage, they buy the thing, they sell it, you don‚Äôt have to do jack shit but get a piece of that really nice thing.

Who is behind Curio? Well the team prefers to stay anon‚Ä¶ fuck no, [everyone is doxed and just look at their beautiful faces](https://imgur.com/a/UUhhMYn). Beautiful.

* They are [part of the ‚Äúswiss fintech national team‚Äù](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2020-09-17/schweizer-fintech-nati-geht-auf-pitch-tour), a small group of swiss fintech companies chosen by switzerlands biggest start up incubator
* One of switzerlands largest newspapers [wrote a whole article about Curio](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/geld/fuer-100-franken-einen-anteil-an-einem-ferrari-kaufen/story/28029869)
* a thousand other things like [being chosen as the best swiss crypto startup](https://gomedici.com/top-blockchain-startups-in-switzerland-crypto-valley)

What does Curio do? Well, let‚Äôs start with a copypasta: CurioInvest is a fintech platform enabling tokenized investments in rare collectible cars and other fine assets. Curio brings real-world assets into the Blockchain, so private investors can use them as collateral for lending as well as other DeFi services."" In essence, it enables new financial services in previous illiquid markets available for both institutional as well as retail investors.

But let me put it in simpler words:

Rich folk don‚Äôt just buy boomer ETFs or invest in hedgefunds. They also buy really really nice shit that appreciates in value even more than their stocks. Quote by Christoph Gr√∂ne (rich fuck): ‚ÄúWhen you have 250 million, you can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door. You can't destroy it. You buy a car, the car becomes more valuable. You buy houses, the houses become more valuable. You go into Gold, the Gold becomes more valuable. You can't destroy the money by consumption.‚Äù (for German speaking folks, it's [right a at the start of this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y2WxM2Srlc))

**Wait, did he just say you buy a car and it becomes more valuable?** Yes he did, and he knows best, since he has these 250 million bucks.

Now, he isn‚Äôt talking about buying a Ford Focus, but about buying really nice cars. He can do it, but you and I can‚Äôt. But what if we split that Ferrari F12tdf worth $1 Million into a million parts? You would throw $100 in, I‚Äôm putting 20k down and if we find enough people, we can buy that really nice car and everyone has a stake in it. Remember: You can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door, you can‚Äôt destroy it. This is how the rich fucks are doing it, they just don‚Äôt need a crowd.

And now give a big fucking applause to CURIO: With Curio, really nice real-world assets are being tokenized so that you and I TOGETHER can buy our fair share of that Ferrari, of that nice real estate object, of that fine Mona Lisa or nice million dollar bottle of wine and make money like the rich fucks do. And who looks after that Ferrari or that Mona Lisa? Curio does. Curio rent‚Äôs the garage, they buy the thing, they sell it, you don‚Äôt have to do jack shit but get a piece of that really nice thing.

Who is behind Curio? Well the team prefers to stay anon‚Ä¶ fuck no, [everyone is doxed and just look at their beautiful faces](https://imgur.com/a/UUhhMYn). Beautiful. [And look at them again.](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/20/what-next-oh-yes-turning-a-luxury-car-into-a-non-fungible-token/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE9LPQEoVkBF_sjDwKKcKV53pdMJt21gBN8xVAAWQb4cUf30ihDC20d9aZKoF3ELt_6E-brlwwEGpHMfGUj4c8hmnMqU3lRVrIOXedf_H4GhHh5SBhW9ED9vRNBGBT7ZeH6uJCfkXHei4GqbNOPF6GhSFzxaImdLU7nWs83ADhas) Real people! I don‚Äôt want to copypasta, so here‚Äôs just a little bit of extra info: Every little step they do, they are advised by two highly specialized Swiss/Liechtenstein lawyers, Matthias Niederm√ºller and Dr. Tom Frey (google them, they are very real too. I'm scared of being sued if I link lawyers...). [Advisor Georg Hauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georghauer/) is General Manager at N26 ‚Äì [N26 is a startup neobank and one of Germany‚Äôs ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N26), i.e. a start up with a pre IPO-valuation of &gt;1 billion dollars (N26 is valued at about $5 billion right now). Another advisor, Harald Steger is in a head position at BNB Paribas (second largest bank in europe). [They have partnerships with Makerdao, Chainlink, Polkadot, Avalanche among others](https://imgur.com/a/6xdbEVW), but that‚Äôs not unique. Just mentioning it.

Community? Oh yes. The [official Telegram](https://t.me/curiocarQA) has 18k members, the [community telegram](https://t.me/CurioInvestCommunity) has 2k members, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/curio_invest) has 3.6k followers. The curio team ‚Äì especially their dev ‚Äì is insanely active and has been very stoically answering every boring fucking question that comes up for a year.

Token? Well, there is the [CUR token](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/curio/) and there is [CGT](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/curio-governance/), the governance token. The supply is low at 2.000.000 CUR max. If CGT picks up and you have CUR ‚Äì no worries. You will always be able to swap CUR to CGT at CUR price but not the other way around, meaning that CUR will always at least have the same price as CGT. But right now: Just get CUR and cry some tears of joy, because you are gonna make it. You can get it on UNISWAP, PROBIT and HitBTC. The entry is pretty nice right now (ATH 5$, now we‚Äôre at about 2$). Disclaimer: If hold chunk of it, but I already bought it ages ago, so I don‚Äôt hold heavy bags.

What‚Äôs next? Well, read this, and then read it again:

It's a fork of MakerDAO and its stablecoin, $USDFL is backed by a collateral.   


Freeliquid allows liquidity providers to borrow up to 90% of their stablecoin LP tokens in $USDFL as collateral. Users can then reinvest the loans in their LP's with no additional cost (it charges a 0% APR for now) and no liquidation possible. ROI increases by 90% then and there without doing anything much.

I'm currently getting a 30% ROI on stablecoins.

  
For those wondering how I'm able to obtain MAD APYs with Freeliquid:

1. Deposit USDC/USDT in Uniswap. 

2. Collateralize my LPs for a 90% USDFL loan via #Freeliquid's smart contracts. 

3. Convert USDFL to USDC/USDT

4. Add more liquidity. 

5. Repeat the collateralization process. 

6. Once satisfied with earnings, I can sell my borrowed liquidity for USDFL, pay back my Freeliquid loan, and regain secure control over my LPs.

It charges no fees atm but it has proposed a 2% fees and when that happens. $FL could moon big. If you ask me, literally any fork of MakerDAO can be worth in the hundreds of millions, $FL can moon big."

I thought to myself APR is low, can it be increased? Then I came across freeliquid and borrowed their $USDFL as collateral for my LP's with 0% interest and basically used it to put money from loans back into LP's.  


I've been doing it like this:  


1. Deposit USDC/USDT in Uniswap. 

2. Collateralize my LPs for a 90% USDFL loan via #Freeliquid's smart contracts.

SubDAO: We believe that an era of DAO lies right ahead.,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SubDAO/comments/mt4wyl/subdao_we_believe_that_an_era_of_dao_lies_right/,SubDAO,1,2021-04-18 11:06:40,0,/r/u_SubDAO/comments/mt4wyl/subdao_we_believe_that_an_era_of_dao_lies_right/,NaN,"If you cut off a spider‚Äôs head, it dies; if you cut off a starfish‚Äôs leg it grows a new one, and that leg can grow into an entirely new starfish. Traditional top-down organizations are like spiders, and distributed organizations are like starfish, having a strong ability to survive.

In today‚Äôs block-chain world, such starfish organization is known as DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) which makes it possible for the old social system to go through earth-shattering changes. In DAO, the rules of management and operation are written on the blockchain in the form of a smart contract, according to which everyone acts in an open and fair way, thus realizing self-operation and ‚Äúunstoppable‚Äù ability without centralized control and human intervention.

Since the failure of ‚Äúthe DAO‚Äù project in 2016, DAO has gone a long way, such as MakerDAO, Aragon, and MolochDAO, which are all based on Ethereum ecology. However, although we have witnessed the maturity and growth of the ecosystem, it is still in its infancy and it is too early to put it into operation on a large scale as it needs more time to evolve. With the maturity of Polka Ecology (Substrate framework is functioning increasingly perfectly, supporting one-click chaining) and compatibility (supporting cross-chaining), we have perceived the opportunity that DAO can further develop based on Polka.

There is a governance module in the Substrate framework. While creating a Runtime, the creator can freely choose to join this module, and its goal is self-evident: enable the Substrate chain to realize completely decentralized self-management. SubDAO Network (also known as Starfish Network) has different goals. The goal of **SubDAO** is to create a (1) cross-chain platform providing (2) general and customized functionalities to govern a DAO (3) connecting to DApp with the ability to (4) access off-chain external data. SubDAO enables organizations without major service chains to easily use cross-chain assets and cross-chain protocols to complete smart contract-based events, which is our initial assumption about SubDAO for Polka ecology.

Aragon has gone the extra mile for the standardized definition of DAO. We think that in the initial stage, SubDAO should realize several types of DAO templates of the simplest version, such as Fund Template, Parachain Slot Auction Template, and Voting Template, so as to design different templates by defining different types of events:

l Define creation rules (such as defining membership);

l Define voting rules;

l Define the rules and custody methods of fund pools;

l Define the budget process.

And in terms of user experience, it allows Polka users to create a DAO within ‚Äú15 minutes‚Äù:

a. Select a template;

b. Select the organization name;

c. Set parameters for each template;

d. Submit the generated organization.

The early design version of SubDAO can realize the following (but not limited to) tasks and functions.

l A Polka parallel chain can realize simple fundraising through fundraising templates;

l A VC for Polka can use multiple currencies as a fund pool to complete multi-signing of the fund pool through the fund template and the investment proposal through voting, and use the fundraising DAO of the above-mentioned parallel chain to complete the token purchase. At the same time, the new tokens obtained can be guaranteed by the shareholder currency;

l An IPO-oriented fund can inject DOT and participate in the IPO voting process through the IPO template, and interact with the IPO module of the parallel chain. The DOT or parallel chain tokens obtained can be guaranteed by equity currency, and complete mortgage lending, currency stabilization, and other operations even through Acala or other parallel chains;

l A localized community (such as Polkaworld Community) can get donations supported by multiple parallel chains and go through the application and approval process of activity budget for different parallel chains.

To complete the above cases, we not only need to redesign the Ethereum products similar to Aragon, but need to design the special events of Polka:

l DAO needs to support event interaction with relay chain, and treasury, governance and society modules of other parallel chains, etc.;l

l DAO needs to support asset interaction with other parallel chains.

Although there are, of course, other aspects involving more technical planning of the SubDAO project, there is no need to describe them one by one in detail here.

The development of human society is undergoing a great change of decentralization. Perhaps this society will not be completely decentralized in the end, but at least centralization and decentralization will coexist. Organizations similar to DAO have cut a figure and made its way from Wikipedia to Skype in the traditional economy. The smart contract will become a milestone to the maturity and boom of DAO organization, just as Bitcoin has triggered a financial revolution. When DAO is mature enough to replace traditional organizations, there will be a major social change for us to embrace.

In that new society, people have the right and freedom to form organizations without centralization, borders, and government censorship. Everyone can freely put forward and decide their own needs, abide by and safeguard the rules of their own organization so as to build a more just and democratic society in which there are no sanctions or unreasonable instructions. The demands put forward by people or organizations, which will be displayed as a series of codes in the smart contract, can be voted and executed according to certain rules.

We believe that an era of DAO lies right ahead."

I've been avidly consuming information for the last 3 weeks while setting up hardware wallets, exchange wallets and mining with my single gpu between gaming sessions with friends and day job.

All in all it is a fun little hobby on the side that is very rewarding insofar as the learning curve from zero to ....well wherever I may be so far is tough but fun.

I'm looking for some recommendations on good articles, content creators when it comes to mining and investing that revenue to grow it.  I'm not looking for guides on how to become a gpu farm. Learning driven rather than income driven

Specifically, lower level info on:
1) how to join Liquidity Pools (should I do uniswap, what about the binance chain and cakeswap, wtf is sushiswap...too many swaps).  Am I doomed to transfer fees everywhere?
2) yield farming? Compound? I've only recently learned of this and am just now reading more
3) staking. Is it worth taking mining revenue and staking it in Dot or Ada? Seems like smaller revenues from a small miner may not return any real revenue
4) Makerdao - is this lending a la crypto mode?
5) exchanges. How do people know the ""legitness"" of a dex? Example. I mined Ergo for 2 days for fun to learn about different algorithms. I look at coinmarketcap and see gate.io /coinex / vitex / got it and the list goes on...how do I bet the exchanges? 

My main resources so far have been:
https://academy.binance.com/en - solid breakdowns for novices like myself to more complex topics. TIL about Impermanent Loss.
Son of a tech - solid youtuber for mining info who I found to be genuine/down to earth and technical in his reviews
Coin bureau - only watched a few resources so far but seems good for topic overviewa

What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)? (Guide),https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/mvcj5v/what_is_a_decentralized_autonomous_organization/,Expensive-Analyst-65,1,2021-04-21 18:13:18,15,/r/defi/comments/mvcj5v/what_is_a_decentralized_autonomous_organization/,NaN," Here's a quick guide for you all to get up to speed on what a DAO actually is!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a DAO?**

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, DAO, is a type of organization that isn't managed by people, but by computer programs. This allows a DAO to function by itself without the need for any human control. DAOs automate functions that would've otherwise been done by humans, through the use of many smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does a DAO work?**

To first create a DAO, the rules have to be created and put into smart contracts that run the organization, then there is a funding round. Since there is no central authority, DAOs operate by a token system where holders of the tokens get voting rights to make decisions and changes, essentially a governance token. So individuals now also have a monetary incentive to see the DAO succeed. This encourages its community to vote on changes that will be in the best interest of the organization as a whole.

Since DAOs operate on a blockchain, every financial transaction and rule change is recorded and publicly available to view. This makes it a completely transparent organization which anybody would be free to audit at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of a DAO**

MakerDAO is a DAO that is behind the stablecoin DAI. Unlike a stablecoin like USDC, MakerDAO doesn't control how many DAI are created, that is up to the users. Anybody can create DAI and use their other services, no sign-up required. Since it is decentralized most changes and decisions are made and voted on by its stakeholders, those who hold the MKR token. Eventually, the foundation will push MakerDAO into full decentralization where every aspect of the platform is decided by its community.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why were DAOs created?**

DAOs were created to solve the principal-agent dilemma. The dilemma is that in a system where an individual, ‚Äúagent‚Äù, can make decisions on behalf of others, the ‚Äúprincipal‚Äù, there are risks that the agent won't make decisions that are in the best interest of the principal. Essentially, somebody that is making decisions for others may only make decisions that benefit themselves. This is a large problem that many organizations and companies around the world face.

The way DAOs try to solve this is by first making the organization decentralized. If no one person can control the organization, then there is less risk that somebody could control it the way they want. Since the DAO runs on the internet it means that everything can be done automatically which decreases the reliance on humans. Then the token system gives its stakeholders a reason to make good changes for the organization. If they try to make bad decisions or ones that won't benefit others, when those changes get voted on the other stakeholders will simply vote against it.

In theory, the concept of a DAO is quite a revolutionary, and possibly disruptive, technology. With MakerDAO leading the pack, it will be interesting to see how they evolve and grow over time.

Radix possibly the most long term moon project in crypto today (Betanet in 7 Days),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mvpzeq/radix_possibly_the_most_long_term_moon_project_in/,T2000-TT,1,2021-04-22 05:31:40,20,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mvpzeq/radix_possibly_the_most_long_term_moon_project_in/,Low MCAP coin,"There are a lot of memecoins going round but today I present you with an actual project. Radix is the only L1 protocol with unlimited scalability and full atomic composability across all shards.


For people who don't know what atomic composability is, it is the ability to instantly commit a transaction across multiple shards at the same time in a single step. This is in contrast to non-atomic composability where a transaction goes through on one shard first and then other shards later or cross shard transactions take multiple blocks to process. Non atomic composability is really inefficient and completely breaks a lot of apps, things like flash loans and apps like yearn and MakerDAO stop working properly across shards without atomic composability and even apps like Uniswap can experience problems.
By providing atomic composability and Unlimited scalability Radix is the only project that will be able to scale DeFi indefinitely into the future without issues.


Radix makes dapp building much easier too, dapps are built out of FSM components which are more secure than solidity smart contracts, easier to build and easier to learn for traditional web devs crossing over into the world of decentralised apps. App developers who build useful components on Radix will receive lifetime royalties whenever their component is used, encouraging the growth of the Radix ecosystem and rewarding devs for making valuable contributions.
Right now the project is sitting at a marketcap of 170M, this is nothing for a project that is solving such huge problems and has this level of technology.
If the tech wasn't enough, Radix is about to release their Betanet a week from today and Mainnet in June. It is early now but momentum is building up now and after seeing what recently happened with Solana I don't think it will remain undervalued for much longer.

TLDR
- Unlimited scalability, very fast, cheap fees
- The only platform where apps don't lose performance with sharding
- Easy to build apps on
- Lower risk of smart contract exploits
- Great developer incentive program (lifetime rewards)
- Betanet in 1 week, Mainnet in June
- 170M marketcap
Radix has real potential to be a top 10 project."

The MakerDAO governance community consists of two major components:   


* **On-chain Governance**
* **Off-chain Governance**

While On-chain Governance takes place via the [Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), Off-chain Governance happens in the [MakerDAO forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/). It‚Äôs a place where everyone can come discuss, ask questions, and have their voice heard. 

**It‚Äôs fundamentally possible to influence MakerDAO‚Äôs expertise-driven decision-making processes without holding any MKR.**

As part of the efforts to further better governance participation, the DAO has enabled an incentive mechanism to reward forum contributions, called SourceCred. As a consequence, you don‚Äôt need MKR tokens to both positively influence Maker Governance and be financially rewarded for doing so.

In short, you can get DAI rewards for forum contributions appreciated by other members.

**If that sounds interesting, head** [**here**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/what-is-sourcecred-and-how-do-i-opt-in/3913) **to find all of the necessary resources, including on how to opt in and start receiving rewards.**

# 1. Market Wrap: Bitcoin in Neutral at $55.5K as Ether Continues Bull Run

&gt;***The price of bitcoin has changed little over the past 24 hours, despite the asset‚Äôs notorious volatility.***  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs boring bitcoin so far this week, with ether making gains for traders in a crypto market that overall is still signaling bullishness.  
Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $55,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.9% over the previous 24 hours.  
Bitcoin‚Äôs 24-hour range: $54,565-$57,043  
BTC close to the 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.  
The price of bitcoin has changed little over the past 24 hours, despite the asset‚Äôs notorious volatility causing the spot market to undulate from $54,565 to $57,043 during the session, a $2,478 swing.  
Nevertheless, BTC has mostly stayed above $55,000 for almost a month. According to historical data, the last time bitcoin closed below that level was back on March 26.

# 2. Bitcoin Liquidity ‚ÄòLikely to Remain Resilient‚Äô After Volatility Shock, JPMorgan Says

&gt;***JPMorgan expects bitcoin liquidity should recover, though it may take a few days as market conditions stabilize.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 15% sell-off earlier this week occurred as leveraged long positions were quickly liquidated, but since then, the market appears to have stabilized, suggesting ‚Äúthe worst of liquidations are behind us,‚Äù JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts wrote on Wednesday.  
‚ÄúA recovery in the hashrate and signs of more efficient arbitrage trading suggests liquidity should continue to improve from here,‚Äù the analysts wrote in a report.  
‚ÄúGoing forward, bitcoin liquidity should remain robust and resilient; depth on major exchanges has continued to drop less and recover faster than other asset classes.‚Äù  
The report also mentioned the unique value of 24/7 access to consistent and stable liquidity pools in cryptocurrency markets, which could encourage overall stability.  
The sell-off was ‚Äúlikely exacerbated by the prevalence of high-frequency market making, which we estimate makes up \~80% of on-screen liquidity on major cryptocurrency exchanges and is prone to runs when threatened by a spike in volatility.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThough it will take a few days to play out, history suggests liquidity should recover quickly.‚Äù

# 3. Maker Price Passes $4K for First Time, as MakerDAO Brings Real Estate to DeFi

&gt;***‚ÄúReal world‚Äù assets have entered DeFi, as the Maker protocol reportedly just minted $38,000 of dai stablecoins to finance a mortgage loan.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Maker made history in 2017 as the first blockchain-based protocol to launch a major automated cryptocurrency-lending platform, helping to initiate a boom in what‚Äôs known as decentralized finance, or DeFi.  
Now Maker is paving the way for what might become another source of growth in the now-$60 billion DeFi industry: lending against trillions of dollars of ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù assets like residential properties, in competition with banks and other financiers. In this case, ‚Äúreal world‚Äù refers to collateral other than cryptocurrencies. Even the giant U.S. bank Citigroup is writing about Maker.  
Holders of the project‚Äôs maker (MKR) tokens have been rewarded with a 55% price increase in the past week, the second-most among the 46 cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of at least $3 billion. The token has gained nearly six-fold this year to a market value of about $4 billion.

# 4. Binance‚Äôs Tesla Stock Token May Have Raised Regulatory Red Flags

&gt;***Binance may need a license to market security tokens to the Hong Kong public.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Binance‚Äôs marketing campaign for its security token representing Tesla stocks to citizens in Hong Kong may be a violation of local securities regulations, according to a prominent local news outlet.  
Inducing members of the Hong Kong public to purchase securities is a regulated activity that requires a license from the city‚Äôs top financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Gaven Cheong, a partner at law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons told the South China Morning Post on Wednesday. Binance does not appear to have secured a license to market or trade security tokens in the region, according to the report.  
Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume, launched its first Binance Stock Token on April 12. This new service allows its users to buy fractions of companies‚Äô shares with digital tokens. The zero-commission tokens qualifies holders for returns including dividends.

# 5. Ampleforth Is Giving Governance Tokens to Every Wallet That Ever Held AMPL

&gt;***Project leads estimate over 75,000 users will be eligible to claim the new FORTH governance token.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Rebasing cryptocurrency protocol Ampleforth is launching a governance token that all past and present users of its price-elastic AMPL token are able to claim.  
Project leads told CoinDesk any wallet that has ever ‚Äútouched‚Äù AMPL ‚Äî 75,743 wallets at press time ‚Äî will be eligible to collect its portion of the new FORTH tokens through the next year. Active participants in the protocol should expect a higher share, they said.  
The FORTH airdrop is set to be Ampleforth‚Äôs first step in decentralizing the decision-making process that keeps its uncollateralized token, which has a market cap of around $460 million, more or less orbiting $1. Coinbase Pro listed FORTH Wednesday, shortly after the token‚Äôs reveal.

If I understand this correctly...MakerDAO just accepted a real-asses (non-digital) as collateral against a DAI loan. 

My question: in case the lender defaults, and the DAO remains with the real-world-assest, how is the DAO going to liquidate this assest? A real assest rests on legal frameworks. It also requires physical actions.

I opened my coinbase account and did the basic tasks to get the free crypto. Those small tasks are very good since they give you a basic introduction. I still hold the first tasks I did like Algorand, MakerDao, and Celo. This Celo platform has shown me how good of a platform it is and seeing how Deutsche Telekom decided to buy Celo surprises me of how Celo doesn't get more attention. I like Tmobile since they have always tried to be different from the cellphone industry. I know they offer bank accounts, paying solutions, unlimited data, netflix accounts, home internet that's cheaper than most internet providers. I'm not entirely sure what their plan is with CELO other than a network of sending money but I can't wait to see what they bring to the table. I love this CELO community. Keep it up guys!"

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Our story begins in frenetic 2021, where apart from massive growth and people buying meme stocks and coins, DeFi has opened the opportunity to be exposed to the rapidly appreciating and highly volatile assets while mainting USD-protected positions.

&gt; While Ethereum has a headstart there&amp;#039;s clearly more than one network that can carry financial services, and the void that is created while waiting for Ethereum 2.0 might be filled by other contestants such as Polkadot.

&gt; Multi-chain is currently also a user experience problem, managing their private keys was already hard for mom and pop, but constantly switching networks in Metamask, remember what token is used to pay for gas in a particular network and open multiple tabs for bridging capital between various blockchains is simply too much for most people.

&gt; While there is no shortage of DeFi dashboards we set out to deliver a service that would get you from point A to point B faster in your personal finances.

&gt; Scenario-driven user experience of Ariadne will let you move funds quicker and cheaper within a single or multiple blockchains.

&gt; While we do not target the DeFi space taken by zapper.

Everyone who has been in Cryptocurrency for a while knows that Reddit is one of the main hubs for Cryptocurrency information and communities (along with Twitter and Telegram).  However, with Reddit's search function not being ideal, and many communities having a variety of different names, it is hard to find any communities you may be looking for.

Below is a master-list of all CryptoCurrency Communities that have a significant presence on Reddit.  This list also includes ""Community Feed"" links, which carry a feed of all communities within a particular listing category.

This list will be updated as new communities are found or created.  Please comment below if there is a community you do not see listed.

Everyone who has been in Cryptocurrency for a while knows that Reddit is one of the main hubs for Cryptocurrency information and communities (along with Twitter and Telegram).  However, with Reddit's search function not being ideal, and many communities having a variety of different names, it is hard to find any communities you may be looking for.

Below is a master-list of all CryptoCurrency Communities that have a significant presence on Reddit.  This list also includes ""Community Feed"" links, which carry a feed of all communities within a particular listing category.

This list will be updated as new communities are found or created.  Please comment below if there is a community you do not see listed.

Everyone who has been in Cryptocurrency for a while knows that Reddit is one of the main hubs for Cryptocurrency information and communities (along with Twitter and Telegram).  However, with Reddit's search function not being ideal, and many communities having a variety of different names, it is hard to find any communities you may be looking for.

Below is a master-list of all CryptoCurrency Communities that have a significant presence on Reddit.  This list also includes ""Community Feed"" links, which carry a feed of all communities within a particular listing category.

This list will be updated as new communities are found or created.  Please comment below if there is a community you do not see listed.

I used [https://defiexplore.com/liquidations](https://defiexplore.com/liquidations) to bid on a 50,000 Dai auction for 23 eth. When I connected clicked bid (with metamask wallet connected), the system said ""insufficient Dai"" even though the same system showed that I have ""50,000 DAI unused from previous bids. It will be used for future bids. You can withdraw it any time"". What do you think the problem is and any suggestions? Thanks."

DeFi: ¬øQu√© es el ‚Äúfarmeo‚Äù de criptomonedas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buenbit/comments/mx2843/defi_qu√©_es_el_farmeo_de_criptomonedas/,Buenbit,1,2021-04-24 02:48:03,0,/r/Buenbit/comments/mx2843/defi_qu√©_es_el_farmeo_de_criptomonedas/,NaN,"Autora: [Diana Aguilar](https://twitter.com/criptodiana).

*Cuando comenzamos a adentrarnos en las finanzas descentralizadas, tambi√©n conocidas como ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù, nos encontramos con un concepto novedoso: ‚Äúfarmear‚Äù. Estamos hablando de una forma de generar dinero a partir de las criptomonedas que manejamos en este ecosistema donde viven servicios financieros que no dependen de bancos ni gobiernos. Pero ¬øqu√© es el farming y c√≥mo funciona?*

**Farmear: Una pr√°ctica com√∫n**

Este t√©rmino viene de la palabra *farm* (que significa ‚Äúgranja‚Äù en ingl√©s). Pero ¬øpor qu√© hablamos de ‚Äúgranja‚Äù? Pensemos en la [miner√≠a, que es la forma en la que se ‚Äúcrean‚Äù las criptomonedas.](https://buenbit.com/blog/negocio-para-pocos-como-funciona-la-mineria-en-bitcoin/) Un t√©rmino com√∫n en el mundo de las criptomonedas es la de las ‚Äúgranjas‚Äù de miner√≠a, las cuales son sencillamente un conjunto de dos o m√°s mineros. Estos mineros lo que hacen es validar y confirmar transacciones que suceden en las diferentes *blockchains,* como Bitcoin y Ethereum.

En base a esto, podemos decir que ‚Äúfarmear‚Äù es un verbo que significa **generar criptomonedas a partir de la actividad de miner√≠a con dos o m√°s mineros.** Esta actividad se distingue por ser una forma de generar ingresos pasivos, algo muy atractivo que adem√°s se logra en otros tipos de instrumentos financieros del ecosistema DeFi. Veamos otro de ellos.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0ktbcmp3yyu61.jpg?width=901&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3c76da4ccf78e493446e47bfdc50394d53294d)

**Crea ganancias con tus criptomonedas**

Ahora hablemos de un tipo diferente de *farming* o ‚Äúfarmeo‚Äù en el mundo de criptomonedas: el *yield farming* o ‚Äúagricultura de rendimiento‚Äù. Esta es una pr√°ctica propia del ecosistema DeFi, la cual tambi√©n permite a los usuarios realizar inversiones empleando tokens y criptomonedas directamente para cosechar ingresos pasivos.

La agricultura de rendimiento es una forma de inversi√≥n que se realiza usando la tecnolog√≠a de Ethereum y de contratos inteligentes, y que es cada vez m√°s utilizada entre los usuarios de las criptomonedas. **El** ***yield farming*** **se basa en comprar criptoactivos (principalmente**[ **tokens ERC-20**](https://buenbit.com/blog/como-armar-tu-propio-token-ethereum-en-cinco-minutos/)**, como Dai) y resguardarlos para generar valor.**

Pero ¬øc√≥mo funciona y en qu√© se diferencia de otras formas de inversi√≥n? Puesto de forma sencilla, en primer lugar, puedes diversificar las plataformas de inversi√≥n empleadas para colocar tus fondos y aumentar tu capital. Siendo literales respecto a la analog√≠a de la ‚Äúgranja‚Äù, lo que hacemos es ‚Äúplantar‚Äù nuestros fondos en diferentes tipos de plataformas para cosechar ganancias. Pero el proceso involucra m√°s que esto, convirti√©ndose en una actividad que requiere cierto nivel de estrategia por parte de aquellas personas que deseen invertir en criptomonedas o tokens.¬†

As√≠ nos encontramos con un nuevo t√©rmino: ***liquidity pools*** **o piscinas de liquidez.** Cada plataforma de inversi√≥n cuenta con esta herramienta, la cual es b√°sicamente un contrato inteligente que contiene fondos. Cuando un usuario destina capital en cierto token o criptomonedas, se convierte en un proveedor de liquidez, lo cual le genera ingresos por parte de la plataforma en la forma de recompensas dependiendo del protocolo que maneje cada servicio.¬†

Finalmente, podemos proceder a experimentar y elegir [el mejor protocolo](https://buenbit.com/blog/como-elegir-el-mejor-protocolo-defi/) o servicio para sacar ganancias a nuestro capital haciendo agricultura de rendimiento.

**Farmear en la pr√°ctica**

Actualmente, existen proyectos como MakerDAO el cual es el emisor de la *stablecoin* o criptomoneda estable Dai y precursor en la pr√°ctica de farmear o realizar agricultura de rendimiento. Esto se debe a la capacidad de Dai para generar buenos rendimientos (al d√≠a de hoy, Buenbit ofrece retornos dolarizados del 9% anual) y generar grandes ganancias a mediano y largo plazo.

Por ejemplo, si deseamos hacer agricultura de rendimiento, podemos ir a un exchange descentralizado como Uniswap, donde es posible crear una piscina de liquidez o ser proveedora de liquidez.¬†

Una vez en la plataforma, podemos depositar tokens o criptomonedas (ether y Dai, por ejemplo) en un contrato inteligente generado por la plataforma, el cual permite a cualquier usuario realizar el intercambio de sus tokens por los nuestros en esta piscina. Claro, debemos aclarar que hablamos de montos importantes ya que una piscina de liquidez podr√≠a tener, por ejemplo, 1.000 ETH y 1.000.000 DAI. De esta forma, permitir√≠a al creador de la piscina recibir recompensas por parte de la plataforma y generar rendimientos con sus fondos.¬†

De otra forma, podemos sencillamente participar en piscinas pre-existentes e intercambiar nuestros tokens o servirnos de los beneficios para inversores que ofrecen las plataformas donde elijamos operar.

*Debemos dejar en claro que realizar esta actividad de inversi√≥n puede ser altamente riesgosa, por lo que se recomienda discreci√≥n en el manejo de fondos y siempre realizar una investigaci√≥n previa antes de colocar nuestro dinero en alguna plataforma.*"

It allows users to move their liquidity tokens from one pool to another so that they can move their current deposits to SpaceSwap pools with minimal transaction fees. Project developers promise to provide a wide range of various liquidity pools for DeFi &amp; CeFi protocols - Oracles, lending protocols, synthetic assets, and so on. SpaceSwap DeFi protocol gives liquidity providers additional means of profit-making. While conventional protocols are designed to bring liquidity providers loan interest only, SpaceSwap takes it a step further by introducing a new scheme of yield farming. Aside from the high APY rates, users will enjoy additional incentives in the form of MILK tokens. Thus, their passive income isn‚Äôt restricted by the deposit period.

**Features of SpaceSwap**

SpaceSwap garnered a lot of attraction since its very beginning, owing to its 2 unique features:

‚ñ™ **A one-stop-station for all major DeFi protocols.** 

SpaceSwap integrates all prominent DeFi protocols in one place. For the first stage, leading protocols such as Curve, Compound, and AAVE (among others) will be added. Later, SpaceSwap will support DeFi stablecoins and CeFi stablecoins such as yDAI, aUSDT, wBTC and sUSD. Synthetic assets for cryptocurrencies and major oracles like MakerDAO and Compound will also be integrated in the future.  

‚ñ™ **Multi-layer reward system**

The incentivization plan of [SpaceSwap](https://spaceswap.app/) engages users even when they don't have any deposits. The native token on the platform, Milky Way tokens (MILK2), are provided in addition to interest. This will be particularly profitable after a few months, considering the fact that the price of MILK2 will rise once the project is fully evolved. The best part is, to encourage users to move their assets, SpaceSwap rewards are multiplied for the first blocks.

‚ñ™ SpaceCrew - Decentralized exchange liquidity pool - 08/30/2021.

‚ñ™ Key partnerships - new pools, new exchanges - 2021, 2022

SpaceSwap pools accrue profit for liquidity providers through all the DeFi protocols at the same time. Uniswap yields profit during the period that assets are being held in their liquidity pools. Users earn trading fees only as long as their assets are stored there. However, with SpaceSwap, it is different; LP‚Äôs opportunities are expanded. Users with crypto deposits are offered MILK2 tokens in addition to trading fees. So, even when you have to pull your funds out and thus no longer contribute to the liquidity of the platform, you can still earn a profit through your MILK2 reserves from the protocol's fees.

One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics  is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

&amp;#x200B;

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part  owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can  vary ‚Äî how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do  with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*:  I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends  geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You  can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital  ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or  language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide  which autonomous organisation will succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**:  decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision  making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this  coordination. *Example:*  [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**:  like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate  it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the  ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**.  It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics  design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper  into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**.

Let me know if you want me to do a deep dive into a DAO or other episodes that you are interested in. Check the [video explanation](https://youtu.be/bCblZG3KXGY) here."

Stablecoins are still built using blockchain technology, they do not operate with the same supply / demand economic values that many other cryptocurrencies do.

On traditional financial markets, interest rates reveal significant information about the health of the economy and form the basis for almost all asset valuation models. Whether calculating expected returns or present and future market value, the interest rate is a key variable based on the lending and borrowing of assets.

Interest rates for cryptocurrencies incentivize users to loan out their crypto assets, because users can earn higher returns by lending their assets, than they could have by storing them in a personal wallet or device. Rates for cryptocurrencies, coupled with strong demand for borrowing, would free previously idle balances of capital for investing, trading, and generating new market activity.

Despite the benefits that active lending, borrowing, staking and allocation would generate for the cryptocurrency industry, investors and overall market activity growth, the sector is still in the early stages of development. 

Interest on crypto deposits can vary by up to 16 percentage points, depending on the platform. This variance exists in large part because of the difference in business models.

Service providers, such as Nexo, borrow cryptocurrencies from primarily retail customers and provide loans in fiat. Others, such as [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), enables customers to stake cryptocurrencies through locking coins up for a period of time by using an app. Decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders, such as MakerDAO, facilitate loans strictly financed in crypto and paid out in also crypto. Platforms like [Midas.Investments](https://Midas.Investments) rely on allocations and all available mechanisms for earning yields enabling to invest in a managed and automated investment portfolio based on a strategy with rebalancing.

Each of these services attracts different client segments with varying expectations of fees and service levels.

Over time, companies with competitively low interest rates on cryptocurrencies will go out of business. The natural dynamics of the free market, as applied to any industry, weed out inefficient business models and promote standards of practice through competition. As the sector grows and consolidates, interest rates are likely to converge to sustainable levels.

Rocketpool Node Operator Token RPL value,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mz2cij/rocketpool_node_operator_token_rpl_value/,Altruistic-Good1296,1,2021-04-27 00:59:51,27,/r/ethstaker/comments/mz2cij/rocketpool_node_operator_token_rpl_value/,NaN,"I'm considering running one or more Rocketpool Node(s) but can't get my head around how the Rocketpool RPL token accrues value. It seems that running a RocketPool node may make an extra % or two in ETH staking rewards, which in itself may not be worth it over running a vanilla ETH2 node. The RPL staking, on the other hand, is more difficult for me to determine value. While it'll be nice to use it and be able to pay the bills while accruing more ETH:

* What can RPL be used for other than rocketpool governance or swapping to something else to sell? Are there defi applications? I know rEth may soon be accepted into MakerDao which will let it be used in a variety of different ways (maybe allowing for higher returns than locking up eth as a node operator??)
* How does RPL accrue value? It seems like it may get bought up initially since it's a requirement to run a RocketPool node, but it inflates at 5%/year. Given that inflation, will it even keep up with ETH's price or will its value drop (RPL/ETH, RPL/USD), potentially requiring more to be put into the node to maintain the minimum collateral/insurance requirements?"

Liquidation risks / Sudden spikes in DAI price,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mzpwme/liquidation_risks_sudden_spikes_in_dai_price/,torkildj,1,2021-04-27 22:38:36,18,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mzpwme/liquidation_risks_sudden_spikes_in_dai_price/,NaN,"I am new to the MakerDAO project and I am looking to take a loan against my ETH. My goal is to convert the generated DAI to USDC and use that USDC to generate passive income that would give me around 10-13% currently. Given the fact that the stability fee is 5.5% for ETH-A, I could make some nice returns.

When it comes to my ETH stack, I am risk averse, so I am looking for a liquidation ratio of about 400%, which should give me ample time add more collateral, in case there is a downturn in ETH prices. 

What I am not sure about is how the liquidation engine works and if sudden spikes in the DAI price could cause a liquidation, with my proposed liquidation ratio. 

If there is anybody with some in-depth knowledge about liquidation in relation to proper risk management and taking my situation into consideration, a little advice would be highly appreciated!"

The **InsurAce** community staked $5 million in the first hour, equivalent to 25% of the protocol‚Äôs initial staking cap. After 12 hours, this had reached 50% of the $20 million target.

This triggered the launch of **InsurAce‚Äôs** insurance services within 24 hours of the mainnet launch, and by doing so, **InsurAce** becomes the second-largest live DeFi insurance protocol by market cap (as of 27th April at 12pm EST, according to CoinGecko).

**Initially, InsurAce will provide cover for twenty core protocols that have been announced as starting insurable assets:**

dHEDGE, Yearn.Finance, MakerDAO, Curve, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Ethereum, AAVE, Compound, Tornado Cash, Set Protocol, Synthetix, Nexus Mutual, Balancer, Vesper, Ren VM, dydx, Bancor, Reflexer, 1Inch.

DeFi Investors can look forward to the lowest premiums on the market when insuring their portfolios through **InsurAce** (proven to be up to 40%-60% less than leading competitors across a portfolio of 6 protocols with $4 million TVL). This portfolio method of insurance can also be more cost-effective with regards to Gas Fees compared to other insurance protocols. An example is laid out at the end of this article for a comparison of premium and gas fee. Furthermore, **InsurAce‚Äôs** insurance products have no KYC, respecting the privacy of its insurance customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Stakers already have access to high yields from the 6 tokens that can be staked with **InsurAce**. There is currently a limit to staking, set at $20 Million. Once achieved, the system will be stress tested for scalability ahead of releasing this cap and adding new tokens and insurance products. Following this, stakers can expect to earn a yield of 30‚Äì50% on average from their staked tokens.

**InsurAce** was recently audited by **SlowMist** and determined to be **‚ÄúLow Risk‚Äù**. The audit report can be found here: [Audit Report](https://insurace-protocol.gitbook.io/landing-page/documentation/security/slowmist-security-auditing-report).

At the time of writing, there is over $60 billion Total Value Locked in DeFi projects globally. This figure is up from under $1 billion at the start of 2020 and doesn‚Äôt appear to be slowing down. Despite the enormity of the existing holdings, under 2% of the market is insured against faults, hacks, and other failures in the smart contracts that this value is held on.

Moreover, in the last 9 months alone, there have been losses totalling over $120 million due to exactly the types of issues that will be covered by DeFi insurance protocols.

InsurAce‚Äôs new insurance services and mainnet look to expand quickly into this market, boosting confidence in DeFi and reducing smart contract risk. *Take a look for yourself at* [*app.InsurAce.io*](http://app.insurace.io/)*.*

**Gas Fee comparison**

We took a range of 10 protocols and bought cover through both **InsurAce** and Nexus Mutual, the current market leader in DeFi insurance. With our portfolio method of insurance, the gas fees of **InsurAce** were 50% cheaper than Nexus Mutual because you have to buy the 10 covers separately instead of together which results in higher Gas Fees. (This may not always be the case, but this information is up to date as of 27th April 2021 12pm EST. )

&amp;#x200B;

InsurAce Protocol is a Singapore based DeFi Insurance protocol that has quickly become the second largest protocol in DeFi insurance. At the time of writing, the protocol has a $40 million market cap based on a circulating supply of 8 million INSUR tokens. There is a maximum release of 100 million INSUR Tokens which can be mined through staking on the protocol."
