Arbitrage Sports Betting Coaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phillylist/comments/npv3cz/arbitrage_sports_betting_coaching/,rogue1351,1,2021-06-01 22:18:46,0,/r/Phillylist/comments/npv3cz/arbitrage_sports_betting_coaching/,NaN,"I am looking to work with someone local who is interested in making money via arbitrage sports betting. This essentially means you’re betting both teams but on different sites and profiting by doing so, regardless of who wins the game.

Example: 

New York Yankees vs. Houston Astros

Sportsbook 1 odds: Yankees +110

Sportsbook 2 odds: Astros +110

In this example, you will wager $100 on each team. The total amount of wagers for this game will be $200. Regardless of which team wins the game, the bettor will be paid $110 for a winning wager plus the original $100 for a total of $210. You would profit $10 in this situation, regardless of who wins the game.

Yes, this is 100% legal. It’s just capitalizing on inefficient markets. The sports book don’t like people like me, but that’s fine.

I have been doing this for over a year with success. But it’s not as simple as it sounds, there is a learning curve if you’d like to achieve efficient profitability. That’s where I come in and teach you everything I’ve learned in the last year.

I would never have access to your accounts or your money, I would just be teaching you what to do and how to maximize your earnings for a fee. As long as you’re willing to put in some work on your phone, the fee would be nominal compared to the profits. 

Qualifications:

I am only interested in working with people who I think can do well with this, so there are some qualifications:

-You’re getting paid to move money between different sports books so you need capital. You should have at least 10k and plan to have that money tied up for 3 months before withdrawing to be efficient. Having 20k would be ideal. Again, I would never have or want access to your money, I’d just be showing you what to do and how to do it.

-some type of background in business, math, finance or risk management. You need to be able to understand statistical concepts and be proficient. I will teach you the process but ultimately the burden falls on you to make good decisions with the information I teach you.

-Time, you need time to do look through everything and make appropriate decisions. I spend 1-2 hours a day doing this. If your life is already jam packed, don’t bother.

-Some baseline knowledge of how sports betting works would be helpful. You don’t need to be an expert.

Things you’ll learn: how to find arbitrage bets, best practices for each sportsbook and how to handle the arbs for each site, how to convert free bets, how to calculate equity, how to maximize initial sign up promotions (first thing we’ll be doing) and how to make money on casino promotions. When you combine all elements, its a very profitable adventure.

I would charge you $750 for an initial sign up fee. That would get you about 10 hours of my time over a 1-2 week period which really should teach you 80-90% of everything I know. If you still need more help on a sustained basis, I would do a $100 a week fee. You would not need to pay me in perpetuity though because I’m gonna set you up to do everything yourself. You will recover my $750 fee within 1 week because sportsbooks give excellent sign up bonuses and you’ll make a lot of money in the beginning. Happy to talk on the phone if you’re interested."

Feeling Disillusioned - Keep Pursuing Career in Security?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/nqep4b/feeling_disillusioned_keep_pursuing_career_in/,TheRealTimbo_Slice,1,2021-06-02 13:52:58,12,/r/cybersecurity/comments/nqep4b/feeling_disillusioned_keep_pursuing_career_in/,NaN,"Not really sure what I am hoping to accomplish with this post, but just get my thoughts out and maybe get some input.

After getting a degree in finance I was working in banking for a few years and was bored as hell. Eventually I found networking and cybersecurity and decided that was the way I wanted to go since I could figure out how things work, fix things, and honestly was just amazed with all the new stuff I was discovering. Got the CompTIA trifecta and CCNA, learned programming (snake, coffee, C+1), broke into general IT and am now working in a NOC for a cloud provider (probably not the one you're thinking of). I have excelled in all my roles and have enjoyed learning new things in each new job, although I find I get to the end of the learning curve pretty quickly. The next step is security, probably a SOC -&gt; IR -&gt; TI? RE?

The issue I am running into is that as I talk to and connect with more people in the industry as I try to make the jump, it seems like most people don't actually enjoy their jobs that much. Maybe the company doesn't take security seriously, maybe they're overworked, regardless it doesn't sound like people are actually enjoying day to day work. I feel like there's this promise of a sexy job fighting bad guys, but it turns out to be a lot of politics and button clicking. I have also realized through working in a NOC the high ticket, repetitive issue environment is rough and I am not sure if I want to do that again in a SOC and then IR and always be putting out fires. 

Basically I am wondering if it is still worth it to continue pursuing a career in security if it seems like a place passions go to die and get sucked into ""real job"" world, but there's still tons of stress. Or if I should go after something less stressful that would just be a job. Compliance (also security, I know), software engineering, something still in the tech vein but just not security related. Networking seems to be more about fixing stuff when it breaks then actual design and implementation unless I stay in networking for 5-7 years, but not sure I want to invest that kind of time. I kind of find myself just wanting to go be outside more and more, not have to worry about work once I am off the clock, and just working an easy, albeit probably boring, job. I could also just be burned out from shift work and need a break.

Focused on providing the best user experience, Paçoca’s goal is to reduce the learning curve and ease the journey of the beginner DeFi user.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the greatest innovation for financial markets in the world and it’s growing exponentially fast, not only the number of users, but also new protocols are increasing everyday.

However, it’s still in the early days and the learning curve is too steep for the average user, which makes it a barrier for mass adoption. Each new protocol works in a certain way that’s specific to that particular protocol, therefore users have to do a lot of research or even buy courses to have access to the benefits of DeFi.

[Pacoca.io](http://pacoca.io/) comes with the proposal to enhance the user experience and reduce the DeFi learning curve, so even beginners can interact with the blockchain in a fast and natural way.

[Pacoca.io](http://pacoca.io/) was born to optimize the experience of Defi users. The goal is to provide a broad and centralized view of the assets staked in different DeFi projects in EVM based blockchains like BSC, Ethereum and Polygon. The platform values simplicity and is the perfect place for those looking for an elegant DeFi hub with a real time portfolio watcher.

**DeFi 101 FAQ**

* Why is decentralising important? Because users like you and me can now take control of the money we use, instead of relying on banks and intermediaries. They are taking a lot of mark up in this process!
* What ""power"" does DeFi bring? It gives people the ability to create and move money across the world at any given time
* What's the difference between DeFi and bitcoin? Bitcoin is money. It's programmable money. DeFi is the operating system of money. So bitcoin is like Facebook app. And DeFi is the iOS that your iPhone runs on.

**What is DeFi**

DeFi means decentralised finance. 10 years ago, we saw the creation of Bitcoin — a decentralised money. Building upon this asset (decentralised money), we are now at the stage of decentralised finance.

**Give Me An Example**

If Adam has $100 and Ron needs to borrow $100, how does that work? If you trust each other, you can just lend directly, and maybe Adam charges an interest rate, let's say 5%.

In the traditional finance space today, you don't know each other. So Adam put the money with the bank. The bank pays Adam some interest. Then the bank uses that money to find people like Ron, who wants to borrow. And Ron pays the interest to the bank.

DeFi now replaces the role of the bank. And solves the problem of ""trust"" across the world. Instead of trusting the people, DeFi turns that trust into code in the system. How? (1) money (aka Facebook app) is programmable. And (2) the operating system of money (aka your iOS or Android system) is also programmable.

Now, Adam can find all the Rons in the world without having to

* Trust Ron or know Ron personally
* Engage with a bank or third party that will take profits away
* Find a centralised institution

**Tell Me More about this ""Programmable Money System"" thing**

We are basically programming code into the money (e.g. $Dai). And in the code, we incentivise people to put money in or take money out.

How? We do this by changing interest rates.

This will change people's behaviours by creating loans and to encourage lending or borrowing.

When demand drops, the interest rate drops. People are more likely to demand more $Dai now, since it is cheaper.

When demand goes up, there is too much supply. Interest rates increase. People demand less $Dai because it's more expensive now.

The change in interest rate is executed by programs and code!

**What's so cool about it though?**

Well, you can use this programmable money ($Dai) to lend it out. Someone can borrow it and use it as collateral to do something else instead. Maybe like to stake the $Dai in a Curve vault and gain both interest and $CRV governance token while also earning $YFI tokens.

The entire system is a huge lego building block to stake on top of each other. That's where the fun begins!"

"Combining negative rates, forward guidance and asset purchases: identification and impacts of the ECB’s unconventional policies",https://www.reddit.com/r/econmonitor/comments/nqtbdr/combining_negative_rates_forward_guidance_and/,cayne77,1,2021-06-03 02:56:23,0,/r/econmonitor/comments/nqtbdr/combining_negative_rates_forward_guidance_and/,Research,"[ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2564~e02f3aad4c.en.pdf)

&gt; The purpose of this paper is to use the methods of modern empirical finance and time-series macro-econometrics to assess the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies when the policy interest rate is negative. Drawing on the ECB’s nearly unique experience with combining systematic forward guidance (FG) on future settings of its policy rate and a massive programme of bond purchases (QE) with a negative interest rate policy (NIRP), we provide new empirical evidence that bears on the efficacy of these three instruments, jointly and individually.


**Non-technical summary**

&gt; When a negative interest rate policy (NIRP) is deployed in concert with forward-leaning guidance (FG) and an asset purchase programme of the type popularly known as quantitative easing (QE), theidentification of the impacts of the three instruments, and particularly of FG, on financial prices and the macro-economy is challenging. We seek to solve this empirical challenge by embracing a novel identification approach and applying it to the ECB’s unconventional policy history since 2013. We use a dense, controlled event study to identify surprises to the FG and QE policies (specifically, the ECB’s Asset Purchase Programme (APP) initiated in mid-2014 and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) introduced in March 2020) and quantify their impacts on different segments of the predictive distributions of the future short-term interest rate that we extract from rate options, and on the sovereign yield curve.

&gt; We find that NIRP has exerted a sizeable influence on the sovereign curve throughout maturities. The magnitude of the response in long-term interest rates to the NIRP impulse exceeds by a wide margin the extent to which long rates are seen to react to conventional policy cuts away from the lower bound. On net, the impact of rate FG has been more subdued. 

&gt; According to the conditional forecasting methodology that we employ to gauge the transmission of the three policies to real activity and inflation, in 2019 GDP growth and annual inflation would have been 1.1 p.p. and 0.75 p.p. lower, respectively, and the unemployment rate 1.1 p.p. higher than they actually were, had the ECB abstained from using NIRP, FG and QE over the previous six years or so.

**Highlights from the introduction**

&gt; Essentially, a cut in negative ground doesn’t propagate through the yield curve quite in the same way as a traditional equally-sized cut from and to a non-negative level. Instead, its transmission through the yield curve bears a very close resemblance to the transmission of a typical FG shock: it gives rise to the same hump-shaped term structure of impacts.

&gt; Why does NIRP masquerade like FG? In Rostagno et al. (2019) we show that in ZLB conditions market expectations of future short-term rates demonstrate a marked upward tilt, as the conditional distribution at any time t of all plausible rate paths up to h periods ahead is censored at zero, with a possibly bulky probability mass assigned to zero-rate realisations and some residual probability placed on realisations above a zero rate. However, NIRP shatters the notion that zero is the lower bound on short-term rates.

&gt; The second component of our accounting methodology to keep track of the effects of FG and QE (re)calibrations is related to the term in the regressions that quantifies markets’ evolving views about the steady-state stock of the ECB’s QE bond portfolios. These expectations tend to grow over time and bid down interest rates incrementally well ahead of a (re)calibration event. For QE, we count those front-loaded interest rate changes toward the cumulative effect of the final announcement, together with the market reaction to the eventual announcement itself. If markets had over-predicted the bond programme augmentation in the run-up to the announcement, the anticipated effect will be curtailed by the effect of the final market disappointment. If expectations had been too conservative, the final surprise will top up the rate effect produced by the anticipations.

&gt; We find that NIRP has exerted a sizeable influence on the sovereign curve throughout maturities while the overall impact of rate FG has been more subdued. The magnitude of the response in long-term interest rates to the NIRP impulse exceeds by a wide margin the extent to which long rates are seen to react to conventional policy cuts away from the lower bound. QE explains the lion’s share of yield effects, particularly over the back end of the yield curve. We estimate QE to have compressed the 10-year euro area average sovereign yield by around 200 basis points since 2015."

Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises
•	Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
o	Austerity
o	Debt defaults/Restructurings
o	Central Bank printing money “QE”
o	Transfers of money and credit
•	The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary.  Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers.  This process is painful for everyone
•	Template of a debt crisis
•	Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
o	Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible.  IE - 0% interest rates
o	Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle. 
•	Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
•	During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
•	Credit is cut during a crisis.  Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
•	Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
•	Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
•	Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
•	Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
o	This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
•	It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
•	No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
•	During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in “bailing out” financial institutions
•	Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
•	It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
•	By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
•	Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk
Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle
•	Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes.  Debt is financing activities that produce growth.  Known as “Goldilocks” period
•	Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth.  This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more.  This can go on for decades.  These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
o	Usually start from Bull markets.  Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
o	Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
o	Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
o	As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
o	The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
o	Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily.  This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
o	Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don’t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles.  And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
o	Don’t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
o	Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
	How to Spot a Bubble
•	Prices are high relative to traditional measures
•	Broad bullish sentiment
•	Purchases are financed by high leverage
•	New buyers enter the market
•	Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
•	Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
•	The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
o	Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
o	This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices.  Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
o	Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
o	A negative “wealth effect” occurs when one’s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending.  This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
o	Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
	People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
o	Unemployment is low
o	The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
	Immediate post bubble period
	People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find “cheap” stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
	Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
	As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
	This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
•	The “Depression”
o	In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy.  But in a depression, rates can’t be cut because they are already at 0%
o	The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy.  IE – “QE” or printing money or stimulus
o	Declines of 50% of people’s assets are common
o	As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people.  Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
o	Runs on banks are common
o	At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
o	People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money.  Which slows down the economy
o	Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard.  It doesn’t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
o	If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
o	A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money.  And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn’t real
o	Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
o	The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
o	The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of “real” wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
o	The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
	They are typically slow to react initially because they don’t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
	Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do.  But it doesn’t bring the debt and income into balance.  Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes.  All this is bad
	“QE” or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail.  However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
	Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.  
	Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times.  Political populism tends to take hold after this time period.  Taxes on the rich become common talking points.  Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
	Stocks usually fall 50%
	Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
	Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
	Economic activity falls about 10%
	Unemployment is 10-15%
	Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
•	The “Beautiful Deleveraging”
o	Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
o	Printing money during this phase doesn’t necessarily cause inflation.  It won’t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces.  If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok.  However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.  
o	But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy’s and cause a “ugly inflationary deleveraging” IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920’s
o	Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won’t work (IE – Already at 0%)
o	All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
o	In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
	Austerity causes more pain than benefit
	Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
	Redistributing of sufficient size doesn’t happen without a revolution
•	Pushing on a string phase
o	Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
o	Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
o	The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a “ugly inflationary deleveraging” to occur
	Monetary Policy 1
•	Usually try to lower interest rates first.  If that doesn’t work, they go to 2
	Monetary Policy 2
•	“QE” or printing money and buying financial assets.  But over time, QE’s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low.  IE – investors don’t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns.  Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
•	Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness.  This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency’s suitability as a store of value.  This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
•	At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don’t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
	Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
•	Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
•	Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
•	Normalization
o	System gets back to normal.  But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame.  And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again
 
Inflationary Depression
•	Reserve currency countries that don’t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.  
•	If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one

Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle

•	Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness.  This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression
•	Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if
o	Don’t have reserve currency
o	Have low foreign exchange reserves
o	Have large foreign debt
o	Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit
o	Have negative real interest rates
o	History of high inflation 
•	5 Stages of debt cycle.  Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage
o	Early – Low debt levels.  Productive Investments.  Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns.   Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
o	Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle.  But debts are rising faster than incomes.  Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt.  Country becomes the “hot” place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal.  Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains.  Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
o	Top – Bubble bursts.  The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed.  Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail.  Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices.  Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency.  Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
	Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
	Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
•	Spending down reserves
•	Raising rates
	Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
o	Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline.  A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn’t good.  Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard.  Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don’t.  After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
	Usually, 30% decline in the currency
	50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
o	Normalization – Supply demand balance return.  Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3).  But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

Hyperinflation

•	If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income.  And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
•	Inflation psychology sets in with the public.  Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop"

FTX FUND — Blockchain Ecosystem to simplify DeFi
friday,4 june, 2021 4:25 PM
In recent years, the number of companies operating in The Finance and The Technology sector have developed exponentially, especially those in the field of blockchain and security technology using cryptocurrencies. Along with the recent changes and intersections between finance, technology, and stocks, many of these companies have simultaneously filed for listing on stock exchanges.Example of these companies are: Coinbase, Riot Blockchain; et cetera. Microstrategy has successfully listed on the world’s largest stock exchange — Nasdaq.
Digital financial investments can be a remarkably profitable endeavour however it can be difficult to grow your fortune in an online world because you need to keep track of trades, manage community presence and optimize funds.

The FTX Foundation for Charitable Giving
FTX has grown tremendously this past year. Our daily volume is averaging $5b, our userbase has grown, and this week we unveiled trading on Blockfolio. Those are just the start; there’s a ton of big things on the horizon.
We are pretty happy with how things have been going in 2021, both for us and for the crypto community as a whole. It’s important in times like these, though, to never lose sight of the fact that revenue and expansion can only ever be step one of a two-step plan; they are not ends in and of themselves.
FTX was founded with the goal of having the largest possible positive impact on the world. That’s why, since the beginning of 2020, the exchange, its affiliates, and its employees have donated tens of millions of dollars to charitable causes, with some among us having pledged to donate the majority of what we make here. We’re proud of that, and we want to do more of it in the years to come.
But as we’ve had more discussions around this topic, we’ve come to realize that something has been missing. It’s a cliché, but we couldn’t have done any of this without you, the users; no company can go without its customers, of course, but the phrase is doubly true in any situation where network effects are at play. And so it feels right that you have a say in where our collective donations go.

CRYPTOCURRENCY
FTX Fund Cryptocurrency Platform mission: is to open the cryptocurrency market to everyone with a variety of interesting products and services. As a trustworthy company, we encourage blockchain adoption and offer a safe and easy way to take part in the future of financial markets. FTX Fund Token blockchain platform is all engrafted with a set of unique features which makes its outstanding for its users and crypto-currency (digital) traders etc.

DEFI
One of the biggest trends in the crypto space from 2021–2023 could be DeFi projects. DeFi stands for Decentralized finance, and it powers services such as lending, borrowing, derivative products, yield farming, insurance, mutual funds, and trading securities through a decentralized, open-source network. DeFi will bring a revolution to the entire financial system
• Decentralized exchanges (DEX) providing peer-to-peer trading: Curve, Uniswap, Bancor, Kyber, and Synthetix.
• Loan contracts using the calculated algorithm to determine interest rates, based on supply and demand: Compound, Aave, and Maker.
• Asset management solutions for automatic robo-advisors in the field of finance and insurance: Yearn.Finance, Melon, Set protocol, Zapper.fi and Insta.dapp

Altcoin Roundup: Post-crash prices give investors a chance to build a diversified portfolio,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_daotvinh12/comments/nsondq/altcoin_roundup_postcrash_prices_give_investors_a/,daotvinh12,1,2021-06-05 13:34:58,0,/r/u_daotvinh12/comments/nsondq/altcoin_roundup_postcrash_prices_give_investors_a/,NaN," Looking to build a diversified crypto portfolio? DeFi, stablecoins and oracles are three cornerstone sectors to consider. 

https://preview.redd.it/uageuuqgvd371.jpg?width=668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86359af6e8535ef12124b28b7c9c115ce9c0c32f

 

*Welcome to Cointelegraph Market’s Altcoin Roundup, an in-depth newsletter that focuses on investing from the perspective of fundamental analysis and seeks to identify emerging blockchain projects and tokens that fill niche demands within the growing cryptocurrency market.*

The concept of multi-sector investing has long been advocated in traditional finance as the conventional approach to building a balanced portfolio. Typical allocations include representation of stocks, government and corporate bonds, commodities and real estate.

Now that the cryptocurrency market has grown to a multitrillion-dollar ecosystem with numerous emerging assets, clear sectors are beginning to emerge. Savvy crypto investors looking to apply portfolio diversification practices to their holdings should begin to pay attention.  


The previous Altcoin Roundup discussed some of the top layer-one solutions and coins like Polkadot/DOT, Cosmos/ATOM and Solana/SOL that have been gaining prominence over the past year, but these projects could also fall under the large-cap investment umbrella alongside high-profile assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA.

Once an investor has an adequate representation of blue-chip projects, other emerging sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), oracles and stablecoins can be considered.

## DeFi: Uniswap, Aave and PancakeSwap

Decentralized finance emerged during the summer of DeFi in 2020, and the sector helped kick off the current bull market by bringing a new level of excitement to the crypto ecosystem, which was in need of the next big innovation.

One of the best metrics used to demonstrate the rising success of DeFi as a whole is the total value locked (TVL) ranking, which collectively reached an all-time high at $157.63 billion on May 14, according to data from Defi Llama, and stands at $116.62 billion at the time of writing.  
 

The release of Uniswap’s decentralized exchange (DEX) interface — which enabled new projects to immediately launch and made tokens available to the general public — helped ignite a wave of growth and innovation across the market that continues to expand to this day.

In less than a year, Uniswap evolved into the top DEX serving the crypto community, seeing an all-time record of $5.74 billion in 24-hour trading volume during the market sell-off on May 19 and $5.37 billion in total volume locked on the platform.  
 

The vast array of liquidity pools is the primary allure for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Through these pools, stakers have the ability to earn a yield by providing liquidity for the exchange in return for a portion of the trading fees. A number of pools offer staking returns ranging from 25% to 2,000%, and traders are able to select pools based on a variety of factors, including their appetite for risk.

While Uniswap has led the way for DEXs, there are other options like Aave’s lending platform that has emerged as the highest-ranking DeFi protocol by total value locked, with more than $14.1 billion in TVL at the time of writing.

Aave’s recent decision to offer layer-two (L2) access on Polygon has brought renewable energy to the AAVE ecosystem, as traders and liquidity gladly migrated to the lower-fee environment offered on Polygon. This resulted in a significant boost in TVL for both AAVE and Polygon’s native token, MATIC, which is now the second-ranked protocol by TVL, with $11.08 billion locked on the protocol.

Every balanced portfolio also has a small 1% to 5% allocation reserved for higher-risk assets, and the crypto market has no shortage of high-risk, high-growth assets.

For tokenholders who are open to a little more risk in return for higher yields, the Binance Smart Chain-based PancakeSwap boasts a TVL of $7.67 billion, and offers annual percentage rates (APR) of up to 482.54%, according to the project’s website, with all rewards paid out in the protocol’s native CAKE token.

## Stablecoins are the new “savings accounts”

Though a token that stays pegged to a fixed value may not sound like the most attractive opportunity for investors, stablecoins have evolved to play a crucial role in the functioning of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Stablecoins often serve as the backbone of trading pairs on centralized and decentralized exchanges, as well as offering traders a simple way to lock in gains.

The two most prominent stablecoins are Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which have circulating supplies of $60.9 billion and $21.6 billion tokens, respectively. Tether is currently the most traded crypto token, boasting 24-hour trading volumes that range from $100 billion to $290 billion.  
 

Other popular stablecoins include Binance USD (BUSD), the stablecoin created for use within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, as well as the algorithmically controlled stablecoin DAI, which is minted via pledging collateral on the Maker protocol.

For those looking to earn a little extra yield while in the safety of stablecoins, there are multiple options available such as depositing tokens into a lending protocol like AAVE to earn up to 5% on deposits or the decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve, which offers yields of up to 50% for some stablecoins pools offered.

Other popular options include supplying liquidity for the various decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap, which offers 8.64% for its DAI-BUSD liquidity pool, or QuickSwap, which offers a reward plus fee of the annual percent yield of 15.01% for its USDT-USDC pool and 26.75% for its DAI-USDC pool.

## Oracles

In a world that is becoming increasingly dominated by digital data, no cryptocurrency portfolio would be complete without access to an oracle provider. These entities are the industry’s heavyweights that facilitate the secure exchange of data and information within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as well as wider financial markets.

Currently, Chainlink is one of the most dominant oracle projects and a key player that comprises a thriving open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers and security auditors.  
 

While the Chainlink network doesn’t currently offer a direct way to earn a yield through a simplified staking or governance mechanism, it is easy for tokenholders to put their stash to work in DEX liquidity pools and DeFi protocols like Aave.

For investors who are not ready to trust decentralized exchanges and DeFi platforms, centralized yield-bearing companies like Nexo, Celsius and BlockFi are also available for crypto investors looking to earn a return on their holdings.

Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance also offer direct staking capabilities. For example, investors could stake BAND for up to 11.7% APR on major exchanges.

As a result of the May sell-off, which saw more than $1.2 trillion in value wiped out of the cryptocurrency market, many of the top projects are now well below their all-time high values and trading at what some investors would describe as “bargain bin” prices.

While market participants remain unsure as to which way prices are headed in the short term, it would be wise to investigate these opportunities sooner rather than later, as the notoriously volatile crypto market can make significant moves at the drop of a hat.

What Is Curve Finance in DeFi (Ethereum)? (Very Underrated IMHO),https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-curve-finance-in-defi,ethereum88,1,2021-06-05 15:32:47,2,/r/ethtrader/comments/nsqbp5/what_is_curve_finance_in_defi_ethereum_very/,Discussion,
I give up. Sharing what I experienced and learned from the race for those who have free time to read.,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nt1yc0/i_give_up_sharing_what_i_experienced_and_learned/,120103116,1,2021-06-06 02:21:52,4,/r/jobs/comments/nt1yc0/i_give_up_sharing_what_i_experienced_and_learned/,Rejections,"Hi guys, 

I have been a lurker on this sub for a while and decided to post this as a way to mark a point in my career and share how I failed. If you are looking for tips to land a job, sorry, nothing like that here.

Obligatory apologies in advance because English is not my first language.

TLDR: I gave up the race. All the best luck to those who are still in.

CAUTION: LONG WALL OF TEXT AHEAD. PUT YOUR PHONE TO READING MODE!

A bit of context first: I am in my late 20s and in SEA if you need to take social and cultural context to understand.

My last full time job ended on Jan 2021. I have been applying for jobs since Nov ‘20 and estimated there were about than 200 applications give or take. My last position was a Manager and I had been a Manager for 6 months, before that I have 3 years working experience. Most of people I work with or professionally know, give me good recommendations; even at the last place I worked for, I had good standing relationship with C-level executives. I am the type that gets bored quickly and likes challenges, I got promoted with little experience, mostly due to my abilities to handle high pressure work and multitasking for different fields. I was also very lucky to have great personal Mentors and Line Managers at work who were very supportive and willing to coach me for my mistakes. However, for the most part, was me trying to get out of boring situations and work cases; everyday I need a new challenge. I generally don’t like people at work, except my Manager and their Managers. I left my job due to toxic workplace, low pay, unstable working scopes, unclear career advancement, also boring industry, etc 

What was my approach for the job search:

1. I am comfortable with relocation. Unfortunately, I also have to accept that there’s very little chance I can be moved or relocated to a different country. 

2. I am comfortable with learning in a new industry. Of course this has to come with 1) they are willing to give me some space to learn and 2) the Line Manager is patient to guide a newcomer.

3. I do not have an issue with starting low (in terms of level and comp package), as long as the new position has interesting movements in the long terms. Heck I even considered teach myself accounting and programming since I am a quite technical person.

4. Job title is a minor factor for me. I know this from being a Hiring Manager for more than a year and written every single job description in my Department. Focus on the job scope, responsibilities and requirements.

5. Work-life balance, this complements with point 2 and 3 above. When I joined the last company, the first six months was working 12 hours everyday for 6 days a week because there was shortage of management roles and individuals. I gained weight and had sleeping problems, mental health issue, form bad habits such as spending money uncontrollably to compensate for the stress I had at work. Heh, so much for climbing the corporate ladder then I could earn lots of $$$ and put it in my retirement fund. When I left my job, I had like enough money to last me 6 months, given I moved back into my parent’s place, that saved some expenses. 

What happened during my job search; some personal experience and observations:

\- I was lucky to have connections who were very excited to refer me positions they know were suitable for me. This is what quality connections can do, they understand your abilities and skills through long-term working or personal relationships. They helped me follow up with the hiring decision and explained to me the job scopes even better than the HR contact or HM during interview.

\- ATS and cover letters were my biggest dislikes and I think most people feel the same. My reasoning is simple: if I wrote you a cover letter, you have to write me a rejection note; it’s only courtesy, right? How else do I know your system did not break and my application was bottom-listed by an algorithm OR my application did show up at all? I gather some data along the way, 60% asked for a cover letter (both mandatory and not), and 80% used ATS, somewhat 20-30% used LinkedIn Easy Apply; I am not sure whether the LinkedIn application was viewed at all. If anyone has Recruiter Subscription, please shed some light for me.

\- A typical conversation I had with HM or HR was about them divulging into the fact that I want to switch industry and/or lower positions and/or lower pay. I feel very disrespected when it comes to the part that they think it’s THEIR JOB to voice an opinion regarding my career movement. 

\- I applied to lots of jobs in different industries that matched my abilities like 70% and above. It is expected that I will face rejections due to conservative mindsets but heh at least I learned lots of thing from that.

\- Silent rejections are simply just unprofessional. A “we will keep your profile for future opportunities” is an even worse kind of BS. 

How some applications/interviews went:

Job 1:

The job: internal reference, slightly different field, friend is the HRBP passing my resume for HM, only to be rejected because I did not have enough experience. According to them this is not a typical position in the field so “under-qualify” rejection to them was bs. 

Job 2:

The job: internal reference, industry I used to work in, international tech company, position is slightly different but should not pose a big risk, good comp package.

The process: 5 interview rounds, 3 with different HMs and, 2 with HR for screening and final offering. At the last round, they offered me a different position (no big deal), more suitable career development (great), but I had to relocate to a country where it was the worse in terms of death cases (ew what). Normally I would accept in a heartbeat but there is a tricky part. I would have to work from home for the time being with a local package (obviously lower than the expected package) and they will offer a second contract, which I asked for the confirmation of the final number, they said they couldn’t confirm. I could understand their challenges at the time BUT as a candidate, this posed a question of risk here: what if in the second contract they offer the bare minimum? I know the pay range of both positions and to compare the pros and cons, it’s not worth jumping into a country with raging pandemic without knowing what to get in return. I rejected the offer since they won’t process me with the original job I applied for.

Job 3: 

The job: internal reference, referred by my friend who was previously a Client, same LOB, 90% match of skillset and knowledge. Do I have to emphasize that this is the job I excelled at, that’s why I got to work with the Client?

The result: Rejected at CV screening due to “your qualifications are not a match for this position” :) 

Job 4:

The job: reference by a co-worker, same position and work scope is less, more focused on my available skillset, also one of the top 5 companies in their industry.

The process: They asked to submit some files, including my payslip (blargh I know) and my salary expectation.

Round 1 + 2: with HMs, cool people, easy going.

Round 3: with Regional Managers, cool guys, seems pleasant to work with.

I received a call that they could only offer me a x% increase from my previous salary; yeah guys, if they ask for the payslips, they will play this “increment from the payslip number and our policy” card. If you had to submit the payslip, be ready to walk away. Trust me, if they play this card with you, they’re not worth your time. I thanked them on the phone politely, great knowing them blah blah. 

After 24hrs, I had another emergency call with local and Regional HR to sort this out, they agreed to offer a new salary that is 80% more than my old salary. They told me to wait for their written offer, which never came. I figured it was due to some clashes between local vs regional bureaucracy or they did not like it when I tried to clarify my job scope in the last call (some context, in any industry it’s very important to understand who you will work with because each type of Client has very different policies and it is not typical to offer that salary for the job scope they mentioned; I did not regret asking though, better tough initially than being stuck later)

Job 5:

The job: different field, same industry, lower level position, top global company in the industry, company with good reputation for work life balance and development.

The process:

Round 1: with 1st HM and HR, very pleasant experience, extremely experienced interviewers and recruiter. I received lots of compliment for my resume and they said it’s clear that I was overqualified for this position and they would love to have me interviewed for a different internal posting. 

Round 2: 2nd HM. A typical narcissist type of Manager. When I revealed that I do have connection currently working at the Department they are interview me for, they proceed to divulge more sensitive information which was really rude. My connection did not know I was applying at their company but the interviewer proceed to ask things like this: who is better, me or my connection (because we used to hold the same positions in a team), why I left my previous positions (for.each.single.position), etc. This interviewer is the type of manager who had worked for so long in one position and became very good at manipulating people. During the interview, after the first few minutes, I already had the bad feelings but I played stupid to see how far they would go.

After I left the interview, I called up my connections (who used to work at that company) to check on this person and my instinct was right about them being a narcissist. I am glad I did not receive an offer.

SO, those are just 5 of many interviews and applications I have experienced during my job search. I rejected some, and got rejected a lot but also learned a lot.

What I’ve learned:

\- Most company will assume that once you’ve raised to Manager position, your standing in the industry is pretty much unmovable or you shouldn’t be going somewhere else. Every application which I was called for phone screening and the position is in a different industry, they asked the same question why do you want to move to xx industry/field. Apparently, “I want to explore different perspectives, knowledge and solve new problems” is all about me and did not attract them. 

\- Most job descriptions are poorly written. For example: “Having 2 year working experience” vs. “having 2 years experience in xx field” is assumed to be the same from the recruiter’s pov. Lots of entry level jobs require you to have working experience, sometimes in any field, and there is a reason to it. For me, when I was an HM, this is because the job’s nature requires applicant to have some problem solving skills in professional capacity; knowledge can be trained but skills is harder and most of the “fast-pace” businesses have no time for your skill to grow.

\- The “payslip” card is a low move, be prepared to move on. No regrets!

\- I had lots of doubt if I did not have any luck because my resume was bad, until I realized that the people who understood me the most during the application process are either who knows me professionally (my references) and experienced HMs and HRs. They can read a candidate and move the conversations to where they could explore my strengths and potential, not those who would focus on the fact I did not have relevant experience. I do constantly revise my resume regularly but the format and content did not change much, if anything I only added more relevant points that I forgot to include previously.

\- If you asked me at this point in my life, if I would spend those first 6 months at my previous company like I did, I’d say with more moderation. Don’t even think about your company will look out for your. If they are, lucky you; if not, don’t take it personally, it’s just how businesses work. Focus on the thing you can control, which is your effort and dedication at work. The work intensity is what helped me got my promotion but I wasn’t in the race for the title, I want money.

\- Networking is important but it’s not everything. You can see that all of my internal references did not work for me. I am an introvert so I’m not comfortable going out there chatting with people I don’t know on LinkedIn just to get a slim chance that they have something to offer. The references I had from the people I’d known for some years at least, or had worked together, are the ones that resonates with me the most because they understand my abilities very well and the ones I really think suited me the best. However, there’s more to successfully land a job. If you are using LinkedIn like me, quality over quantity. If you see an opportunity, take it; if it doesn’t work out, move on.

Where I am now.

Right now, I am working for one of my friend. They came to me with an offer that basically “I know what you can do. You can solve problems. You don’t bullshit around and I like that about you. The pay is not much but I will show you everything there is you need to know.”

I also started a small business, no profit so far but it’s a learning curve.

What else happened.

You wouldn’t believe what happened to me in the last two weeks, I have received 3 calls asking if I am still available for work. 

(1) is a position I applied a month ago, mind you it’s a Manager position for MNC Finance company, they were calling to check that if I am “available for a chat regarding a position at our firm”. To let you know, I do not get to where I am by dwelling on something I did a month ago. I also know how HR at these company works, if they did not call within 2 biz day, consider it gone. This one, a month, I had to hold my bitchy side to not ask “how many candidates before me was rejected or have rejected?”

(2) and (3) are positions at which I applied to 2-3 months ago. I kept seeing the jobs re-posted again and again. I know these types, only want the perfect candidate so I did not think much just like case (1). I got calls from a recruiter and a headhunter asking if I am interested. This time I just had to say it in the most professional tone I could “Hey, thanks for calling but since you did not approach me within a week, I moved on to different opportunities.”

My HR friend said this is one of the whys they don’t send you rejection letters, in case they want to approach you later. To which I respond, that would just be a waste of everyone’s time, right? It’s their job to estimate how likely they can find candidates that fit their “very specific” requirements, especially when you’re hiring management positions.

I really thought when they were recruiting Manager positions, they would behave more professionally and be more invested. I was wrong.

If you reach here; thanks for reading. I tried to make this less of a venting post but rather sharing my story and hoping it might shed some lights if you used to have questions like me. Since each applicant is unique, I don’t expect I can resonate with everyone. However, if you have similar experience, I’d would love to hear."
The safest way to get passive income with cryptocurrencies: A Guide to Interest on Stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/passiveincome/comments/nt770e/the_safest_way_to_get_passive_income_with/,cantorstheorem,1,2021-06-06 06:31:54,0,/r/passiveincome/comments/nt770e/the_safest_way_to_get_passive_income_with/,NaN," I have recently been observing the growing interest of this sub in participating in the world of cryptocurrencies, but that also comes with the worry that such participation can only be done by accepting major risks and instabilities. Responding to that, I'm writing this post as a starting point for the safest and stable way of engaging with cryptocurrencies in order to generate passive income. Furthermore, I hope to instigate further research, since I was far from exhausting about any subject I touched. 

To start, a stablecoin is a form of cryptocurrency with the twist that, differently than Bitcoin or Ethereum, it uses some clever systems to make sure that its value always follows some offline asset, with little fluctuations from its target price. The most famous instances of stablecoins are pegged to the value of the US Dollar, but it's possible to have stablecoins for other fiat currencies, gold, silver, or jewelry. For our purposes, let's focus only on Dollar pegged stablecoins. 

# How do I know I can always get my dollars back?

Each USD stablecoin has its own way of making sure it will always be worth one dollar and that you always can convert back to fiat USD if you want to. At the date of writing, the most used stablecoins ranked by market cap (that is, how much money is being held on each stablecoin) are USDT (Tether), USDC (USD Coin), and DAI (Dai). The biggest difference to understand between those three is that USDT and USDC are centralized stablecoins, which means that there are institutions that ensure the value and liquidity of your coin. On the other hand, DAI is decentralized and uses automated markets and arbitrage to ensure value and liquidity. I'll write about each of them briefly below, but I will certainly not cover the topic completely. Again, I encourage you to do your own research about each of them afterward. 

Tether: Tether was founded by the same owners of Bitfinex, and originally promised that each instance of the Tether token would be backed by reserved real dollars, but that's not the case now. In 2019 they changed their backing to include loans from other companies, and in 2021, after much controversy, Tether published a report that announces the true backing was less than 70%, with 65% of it being commercial papers, not cash. The crypto community didn't take this lightly and many doubt the long-term security of Tether. Despite all of that, Tether continues to be the most popular stablecoin, and so far it has the biggest liquidity and stability compared to its peers. 

USD Coin: USDC was created by Centre in a collaboration between Circle and Coinbase. Different from Tether, each one USDC token is backed by one dollar held on a bank account, and Centre held frequent audits to publicly confirm their claim. Although the centralization of USDC can be considered a reason to worry in and of itself, the token is the second most popular stablecoin, and Centre has been considered transparent and trustworthy until now. 

Dai: Last but not least, we have Dai, a decentralized stablecoin. To ensure the safety of Dai, we do not need to look at institutions or individuals, we just need to look at its code. It is trustless and permissionless. That said, understanding how it works is quite a task and beyond the scope of this post since it would require me at least triple the number of words it already has just to make the slightest justice to its clever system. Still, there are, of course, risks: everything you need to know about Dai is in its code, but that doesn't mean such code could not contain bugs. I will add though that the system behind Dai is completely open and constantly scrutinized by its community, and that, so far, years of use have confirmed the security and stability of Dai, even in face of wild crypto market swings. 

# How about the passive income with interests?

Similarly as before, we have centralized and decentralized options. The main difference is that in the centralized options your stablecoins would be custodially held by an institution, which would be responsible for ensuring the safety of your funds. In the decentralized options, on the other hand, the coins continue to be fully at your control, but also, securing them becomes your sole responsibility. 

There is an ever-increasing list of centralized and decentralized options to apply your stablecoins and in this post, I'll just touch on a few of the most notable known of them. 

BlockFi: BlockFi is the most popular lending and borrowing crypto platform as far as I noticed. Interest rates for stablecoins on BlockFi are around 8.5% APY, which is compound monthly. Moreover, you should be attentive to BlockFi's withdrawal fees and limits which could be checked [here](https://blockfi.com/fees/). The money you will receive comes from BlockFi lending your funds to other companies. According to BlockFi, the security of the platform is ensured by a robust risk management protocol in choosing their clients, which you can read more about [here](https://blockfi.com/how-blockfi-handles-risk-and-security). 

BlockFi has some interesting promotions for new users. Depending on your initial deposit you can make $15 to $250. Beware that you have to deposit a ridiculous amount of crypto to get to $250, but $15 is easily achievable with a $25 initial deposit. Check with your friends and family if any of them can provide you with a referral code or link. Alternatively, you can search the internet for any random referral links. All of them will give you the same benefits, but it is always best to make someone you know happy first.

Celsius: Celsius has the highest interest rate on this list, with a standard of 8.8% APY paid in kind for your stablecoins that could go up to 12% if you hold an appropriate amount of CEL (Celsius own token) in your wallet. You can withdrawal your funds anytime for free, with Celsius covering any network fees that may be required. The money you will receive comes from Celsius lending your crypto to other companies, and the safety of your funds rests on the protocol they follow to choose the conditions of such lendings, which, according to Celsius, usually require two times the amount borrowed in collateral.

Celsius also has some impressive promotions to attract new users. At the time of writing, you could use the promotion code BTC50 to make $50 worth of BTC. Furthermore, you could use a referral code of other users on the signing up page to make more $40 worth of BTC, totalizing a $90 bonus in rewards for new users. The condition is that this money will only be available to you if you hold $400 worth of crypto in your Celsius wallet for one month. I advise you to check if any of your friends or family already use Celsius and have a referral code, since they will also be making $40 when you unlock your reward. Alternatively, you could search the internet for referral codes or, since I'm a Celsius user, use mine: 131236d788. Still, I encourage you to make someone you know happy before any random user on the internet, including myself.

Nexo: Nexo interest rate on stablecoins is 8% APY paid in kind, compounding daily. However, the interests can reach up to 12% APY if you hold a certain amount of NEXO (Nexo own token) in your Nexo wallet. Similar to other options, the money you make will come from loans Nexo will make with your funds. On the other hand, in the security realm, Nexo has insurances worth 375,000,000, making it, in my opinion, the most secure of the three options already covered.

I could not find information about any bonus or referral links for new users of Nexo. In their defense, however, they have one of the most user-friendly apps in the space, making it a good option for someone who is not all that familiar with the technology.

Aave Now we finally come to one of the decentralized options. Aave is the most used decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing. The interest rates in stablecoins on Aave can vary from 1% up to 16% depending on the crypto market. It can be less than some centralized options at times, but mind that with Aave you continue to be in full control of your coins. Aave uses over-collateralized (which means that the borrowers have to lock more crypto than they are borrowing) smart contracts (completely automated contracts). 

Using Aave you don't need to trust any private company to manage your money, you just need to trust the code. Understanding this code and the clever system it generates, however, is not easy, and I encourage you to research as much as possible about it before taking the decision of using it or instead opting for the centralized alternatives. I do personally believe that the potential of decentralized finance protocols like Aave can be world-changing.

Compound: Similarly to Aave, Compound is a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing. The interest rates can vary between 2% and 8% depending on what stablecoin you are using and other movements of the market. As with Aave, you continue to have complete control over your coins while using Compound, and, besides that, you can withdrawal your funds from the protocol at any time you want. Trustless and permissionless, Compound is one of the examples of what the future of finance could look like. 

Other notable options not mentioned above: Curve, Kucoin, Crypto.com, Binance Earn. 

# Closing Thoughts

Lending with stablecoins provides an alternative to the low interest you would usually receive at your bank. This additional gain comes from the automation of the most useless parts of the legacy banking system. One analogy is that, instead of automating the cashier, crypto offers the option of automating the credit card company. The decentralized options above are, of course, more close to this ideal. That said, some people use the strategy of dividing their funds between two or more lending platforms and decentralized protocols, that way, not exposing themselves to the risks of just of one them. 

Finally, as I said before, I hope this post will be used just as a starting point for more in-depth research before any financial decision is made."

Inside Of The LP Token Of Nebula Protocol You Must Know,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CryptographerCold753/comments/ntsern/inside_of_the_lp_token_of_nebula_protocol_you/,CryptographerCold753,1,2021-06-07 02:39:49,0,/r/u_CryptographerCold753/comments/ntsern/inside_of_the_lp_token_of_nebula_protocol_you/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7at4s1xrwo371.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6ae83582273f6e303398eea1218c0a62d558373

The cryptocurrency business has seen significant growth in recent years. Many investors have been persuaded to participate in the cryptocurrency market as a result of the DeFi movement, especially in recent months. Consumers can get financial services through the DeFi platform that they couldn't get from other financial platforms, such as banking. The DeFi platform features options including a stake, yield farm, and loan/borrow that allow customers to maximize their return on investment. The Nebula Protocol is a DeFi Token that was published by the community very recently. Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn are three critical functions that take place throughout each SNBL exchange.

# Let's Understand Nebula Protocol's LP Token 

Automated market maker (AMM) systems like Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer are a crucial component of the rapidly expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, and they provide a fresh approach to trading in general. The liquidity provider (LP) token is an essential feature of automated market maker platforms. LP tokens enable AMMs to be non-custodial, which means they do not keep your tokens but run through computerized procedures that promote decentralization and fairness. Liquidity provider tokens also allow new levels of token trading and access throughout the whole DeFi ecosystem, facilitating development through substantial network effects.

# Example Of LP Token Function

For example, if you donate USD 10 in assets to a Balancer pool with a total value of $100, you will earn 10% of the pool's LP tokens. Because you hold 10% of the crypto liquidity pool, you make 10% of the LP tokens. The LP tokens represent your claim to a portion of the pool's assets. When you hold these LP tokens, you have complete authority over when you withdraw your part of the pool, with no intervention from anyone – not even the Balancer platform. Furthermore, because LP tokens are ERC-20 tokens, they may be moved, swapped, and staked on different protocols.

# Nebula Protocol's LP Token Enhance Liquidity

Before establishing liquidity provider tokens, all assets in the Ethereum ecosystem were unreachable during their use. Tokens are often locked up when they need to be staked, which is typical as part of a governance system. For example, ETH will be locked up in Ethereum 2.0's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to validate and add new blocks to Ethereum's blockchain. When a token is staked in this manner, it cannot be utilized for other purposes, implying less liquidity in the system. At least within DeFi, creating readily convertible assets in AMMs in the form of LP tokens overcomes the problem of locked crypto liquidity.

# SNVault of Nebula Protocol

Apart from the passive yield farming, Nebula Protocol has created its own synthetic asset with a total distribution of 50,000 SNVault tokens (SVT). For SVT distribution, Nebula Protocol is using a modified version of the PancakeSwap farming infrastructure. Since Nebula Protocol does not intend to create its own competitor against PancakeSwap, Nebula Protocol did not migrate to Nebula Protocol’s own pools. Instead, Nebula Protocol just used the staking/farming model for distribution.

The merchandise store on Nebula strives to make the life of blockchain project creators and fans easier by offering ready-made high-quality crypto goods goods for hundreds of the most popular crypto currencies and tokens. Users may purchase many sorts of clothes and accessories for their favorite cryptocurrency, token, or project online.

## Introduction and motivation

Hello and welcome to my post on FSRV / Katapult. Thanks in advance for reading. Most importantly, please feel free to step in and correct any mistakes you notice or criticize where you find appropriate. 

**I'm posting this because I have a lot of money (to me) in this and would love for people to poke holes in this company and potentially save me from losing that money :) We are all trying to help each other here.**

#### Post structure
* It's long and most people want a TL;DR.  Each section will have its own TL;DR and you can skim through all of them to get the picture, or just jump directly to the summary the very end.

# 1. Background Information on the PIPE, SPAC Team, and Target
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|PIPE|
|The world renowned Tiger Global Management who were early investors in Facebook, Spotify,  Stripe, Coinbase, Xiaomi. Certainly the most famous of anyone / thing else on this list.|
|SPAC|
|Founded Nov 2019, before the flood of SPACs. Extremely qualified, educated group with many decades in Fintech  / on Wall Street. As an example, the CEO remarks about how well he knows /has worked often with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Board members include a former CFO of Lehman brothers and the current CEO of Icahn industries.|  
|Target|
|Katapult: Buy-now pay later service that works with online retailers. Their niche is that they target the non-prime market. We’ll (obviously) get to the details elsewhere in this post|

### 1.1 PIPE
#### Tiger Global Management
* A  hedge / venture capital / private equity fund that has become very successful and well known for its venture capital investments.
* Founded in 2001 by Chase Coleman III
* Venture capital investors in :
   * Facebook 
   * Spotify 
   * Coinbase 
   * Stripe 
   * Xiaomi 
   * The list really does just go on with these guys
Here is what Orlando Zayas has to say about their deal with Tiger [(page 5)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; And the fact that we understood the risk and how to underwrite the risk and that the business was pretty solid. I think those were the things. I’m not speaking for them, but I think they saw in us some of the feedback I get from many of the investors, we were thrilled to have Tiger join us. You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.

Founded in 2012 as Cognical doing business as “Zibbly” , with the company re-branded Katapult in November 2019.

#### Original Founders
Honestly, most of the original founders do not impress much.  To me on the outside, it reads like a few Cornell undergrads had a decent idea, got the ear of an angel investor,  and then got actual experts to design the real product.

Most importantly are the two following experts in computer science / machine learning who were founders:
	* **Ashutosh Saxena,** PhD from Stanford in Computer Science with an emphasis on artificial intelligence ]https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxenaashutosh]
	* **Pierre Sermanet,** PhD in deep learning and computer vision from New York University, researcher for Google Brain [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sermanet]

	* Andrew Hancox: Angel investor, invested in BlockFi
	* Brandon Wright, Chinedu Eleanya, Cornell undergrads at time of founding. 
	

#### Current Executive Team
**CEO Orlando Zayas**:
* CEO since 2017

#### Number Of Employees
I can’t find this information easily.  Going purely by LinkedIn numbers, there are 101 employees. LinkedIn “Company Size” info says 51-200 employees. The careers page has 21 open positions [ [BambooHR](https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) What I can say is that if you look back at a WebArchive page of the listings from January [BambooHR](http://web.archive.org/web/20210118070621/https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) you can see there were only 13 and they were also a different set of positions.

# 2 The Deal
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|SPAC trust+150m PIPE = 400m. Only 8% will go to the balance sheet, with the other 92% going as cash to existing shareholders and tx fees. But, while on the higher end of the spectrum, this is pretty common. If you want to own a solid company you have to pay up. |

&gt; You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.
\-Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas

$250M from the SPAC trust and $150M from the PIPE will go to Katapult ([slide 45](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf))

Of this 400m, here’s where it ends up:
* $325m will be provided as cash consideration to existing shareholders. 
* $32m will go to the balance sheet
* $43m will be spent on transaction expenses

26% of the combined company will be owned by the SPAC holders. 

*Note: In reality, it’s 18m coming from he balance sheet for the deal, and 50m going to it, but I just simplified that to a 32m credit to the balance sheet here.* 

### Pros
The pro is that we get Katapult in the public markets.  We’re not getting a horrible 5% or 10% cut like some SPAC deals, 26% is decent. 
### Cons
The real con is obvious: Of the $400m in financing, $325m of it is going directly to buy out the current shareholders. Only 32/400 = 8% is going to the balance sheet to help the company! 82% of the proceeds will be going to buy out existing shareholders. 

Additionally, PIPE is getting 16% of the final company but only putting in 
 
### My take
While the exact % going to shareholders may be on the high end at 82% (but not highest end), this is the price of buying a good, profitable company with realistic growth prospects. Here are some other examples of this.

# 3 Katapult In Depth
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services for non-prime customers provided at checkout time for durable goods (appliances, car parts, computers, etc). They are able to make a niche here and profit due to building sophisticated models of non-prime customer behavior beyond what a traditional credit score gives. They find the ones that they can lend to, and provide a fast checkout experience to get your items, and a convenient payment mechanism that incentivizes paying the item off. |

&gt; And so I think they saw that we were clearly focused in an area that is being overlooked. It’s a green space and then we got to profitability. And so, you know, we’re driving, you know, and that’s not much, that’s not a lot of the other BNPLs can’t brag about that. And I can, but it’s been because our business is built on true fundamentals and we understand the future and we understand what’s going to happen. And so we’ve planned the business out well. 
\- Orlando Zayas

### 3.1 Business
Katapult’s business is to provide “buy now pay later” service to non-prime customers at checkout time.  They work with merchants to integrate their system into online payment portals, and at checkout customers will have the option to check out. If customers pay off the lease within 90 days, they pay only 5% plus a $45 fee. 

They also parter with prime lender Affirm. The duo provides a “waterfall” service to merchants. They claim Affirm rejects 65% of applicants at many of the merchants Affirm is with, these are passed on to Katapult and Katapult specializes in these nonprime customers and approves 60% of them [(source)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf).

### 3.2 Technology
They use a variety of inputs collected throughout the shopping experience, as well as user inputs, to build a sophisticated model of the risk provided by the customer. In a recent podcast, FinServ CEO Lee Einbinder actually potentially let slip one of their inputs that might be used to judge risk-  the way users move their mouse.  They claim to use [(slide 30)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf):
* “7 minimum user inputs”
* ~ “100 gathered user attributes”
* ~ “2,000 3rd party data elements”

In most scenarios they claim to provide ~30% better detection of “true good payers” than an existing 3rd party off the self score. [(slide 31)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)

### 3.3 Quick facts
Profitable since 2020 [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average order value is $600[(slide 25)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average return on lease has increased 40% , relative to it’s value at the end of 2018[(slide 32)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average time to lease payoff is around 7 months [(page 3)](And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.)


### 3.4 Balance Sheet
Easily one of the healthier balance sheets we’ve seen in SPAC-land. The [highlights](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm): 
* After the merger they will have 32m of net debt. 
* Liquidity situation: &gt;$100m of liquidity 
* They do not foresee a need ed to take on any more debt or raise capital to achieve their targets. From the CEO [(page 3):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; …..we have a lending agreement where it’s a warehouse agreement that literally can expand up to 250 million, […] even though we did, you know, around 200 million and last year, I only used about a third of that line to fund that growth. 
&gt; 
&gt; And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.

### 3.5 Financials and Growth
Revenue in 2020 was 247m. Revenue Growth for 2018-2020 has been at about 140% YoY [(slide 12)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm) on average. Going forward, they’re expecting  upwards of 75% for the next few years before beginning to taper off to ‘only’ in the 40%s YoY [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) This equates to about $1,130 in expected revenue in 2022 (not 2026  or something insane!),.

EBITDA / Profit  for 2020 was 41m EBITDA and 23m net profit . For 2021, they expect EBITDA growth of 114% to 70m before, like the revenue, tapering to “only” 43% EBITDA growth in 2022 for 216m revenue. 

The CEO is clear that they are focused on what is working and not getting sidetracked, at least for the near term [(page 4)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; **Speaker 2:** ….There’s enough headroom for us to grow just in buy now, pay later, and then maybe we’ll introduce a checking account or something like that a little bit later, or where would you say you’re seeing your growth? Is it BNPL or is it more let’s go into other things?
&gt; **Orlando Zayas (CEO):**  You know, near term, and that’s in the next two to three years, I would say definitely staying in the BNPL space. You know, as we grow our portfolio of consumers and you’re right now, we’ve approved over 1.5 million consumers for shopping, you know, we’ve done over 500,000 leases. And so as we grow that base, I think there’s going to be a lot of opportunity to, you know, do things like checking accounts and other things, because, you know, we’re going to have a much different perspective about that consumer. It’s not going to be FICO driven.

# 4. The Competition and Their Valuations
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|There is a lot of competition in BNPL - Katapult sidesteps all of this by only going for the customers that the other players reject. They have figured out how to profit off of this group and are doing extremely well. Their public peers in BNPL - even the ones that sort of look at that non-prime space - are trading at levels 5-10 times higher than Katapult on a revenue/earnings adjusted basis. The value is insanely cheap compared to the other players. |

### 4.1 There is a lot of competition in the Buy Now Pay Later space. There is (almost) no competition in the non-prime Buy Now Pay Later space.
Buy now pay later companies are growing like weeds. Here is a short list of public ones:
* Affirm
* PayPal
* Afterpay
* Sezzle
And private ones:
* Klarna (The king in the space)
* QuadPay
* SplitIt
the list goes on and on…by the time you read this there are probably two more.

But these are almost all going for **prime customers**. They use traditional factors like your credit score, along with more modern ones, to accept or decline a customer. In Katapult’s investor presentation, they state that Affirm declines **up to 65% of the people who apply**.  Even if this number is traditionally lower - it’s an insane group. FSRV CEO Einbinder says he thinks the number is something like **40-45% r**ejected in the podcast in the References section. It’s a huge number - and Katapult has the field all to itself, as long as it can find out how to profit off of them when others passed on the opportunity. And without a doubt, the answer to that question is that they have. 

### 4.2 Katapult’s Post-Merger Valuation Will Be Shockingly Low Compared to Public and Private Peers
Comparing the companies as a function of their valuation divided by their market cap shows a clear trend…except for Katapult?
| Company | M Cap. |  2020 Rev |  M Cap/ 2020 Rev |  2020 EBITDA | M Cap /  2020 EBITDA  |
|——————|——————|————————|—————————————|————————|——————————|
| Affirm^1 |  15.8b  | 510m | 30.98x  | -112m  | N/A, Negative EBITDA |
| Afterpay | 21.3b | 519.2m | 41x | 44 .4m |  479.9x |
| Sezzle | 13.6b | 58.8m | 23x | -27.9m |  N/A, Negative EBITDA  |
| Klarna^2 | 31b | 1.087b | 28.5x | -195m |  N/A, Negative EBITDA |
| Katapult | 1.33b | 247m | 5.38x | 41m | 32.4x |
Sources: [Affirm](https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/9de99ee8-3e89-46db-80c2-1af22a07543b) , [Afterpay](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-FINAL-APT_FY20-Annual-Report.pdf) , [Sezzle](https://asx.api.markitdigital.com/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02347237-2A1283548?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) , [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/03/30041759/Annual-Report-Klarna-Bank-AB-2020-210329.pdf) , [Katapult](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm)

The situation gets even wilder when you look at the projected 2021 numbers (Not 2026 or something, 2021, which is over in 6 months…) .

| Company | M Cap. |  2021E Rev |  M Cap/ 2021E Rev |  2021E EBITDA | M Cap /  2021E EBITDA  |
|——————|——————|————————|—————————————|————————|——————————|
| Affirm^1 |  15.8 b  | 770m | 20.5x | -125m | N/A, Negative EBITDA  |
| Afterpay^(1,3) | XX | XX | 25.7x  | XX | XX  |
- [ ] | Sezzle^(1,3) | 13.6b | XX | 12.73x | XX | XX  |
| Klarna^2 | 31b | XX | XX | XX | N/A, Negative EBITDA  |
| Katapult | 1.33b | 455m | 2.92x | 70m | 19x |
Sources: [Affirm](https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/ddd095d6-2aaa-4e3b-8277-4c2d1c3cdb3b) , Afterpay^3 , Sezzle^3 , Klarna , [Katapult](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)

^1 Affirm and Afterpays’ fiscal years end in June . So this revenue data is technically shifted back in time by 6 months, but their Market Cap is current. The effect is that this is a little unfair to these companies - their M Cap / Rev #s should a bit lower. But you get the order of magnitude here. I thought about calculating it on a Jan-Dec basis but gave up when I couldn't find 2022E (For July-Dec 2021) numbers easily.

^2 Klarna is a private company. [Market cap /valuation estimate.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/) I can’t find 2021 estimates. 

^3 I can’t find 2021 expected numbers for these guys. And I do not feel like digging more. These numbers are instead calculated from the Katapult investor presentation - a footnote states the multiples provided were as of market close on 12/15 - I have scaled the multiples by the stock price change since then.  [slide 42.](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf). EBITDA multiples were not provided in a way that allows this. 

I won’t even add 2022…..…..but you get the point. It’s being priced at an insane discount. Surely it must be growing more slowly? Let’s take a look at the 2020 revenue growth numbers. Again, please keep in mind the caveat that Afterpay / Affirm are based on June 2019- June 2020 #s, while the others are Jan 2020-Dec 2020. So give those guys whatever discount you think is fair or do the math I was too lazy to do :)

| Company |  2020 Revenue Growth %  |
|——————|——————|
| Affirm^1 |  92%  | 
| Afterpay^1 | 97% | 
| Sezzle | 272%| 
| Klarna^2 | 40% | 
| Katapult | 168% |

The Katapult CEO was directly asked about this valuation gap. His response says it all [(page 6):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)

&gt; I think it’s an undiscovered gem. I mean, I’ve had numerous investor calls after we made the announcement that weren’t included on the pipe. And I don’t know how many times I’ve heard it. We missed this one and we don’t know how, and we’re really excited to talk to you. So I think it’s an undiscovered gem, you know, the headlines were Affirm, the headlines were Afterpay. The headlines were, you know, Klarna. And so then, you know, we kind of sneak up and they’re like, wait a minute. This is a really good market and focused on the right market yet. They figured out how to make money at it. And so I think it just stuck up. That’s why I’m looking forward to closing the deal, changing the ticker to KPLT and having our name out there.
&gt; 
&gt; And, you know, Kristen obviously is going to help us get our name out there to investors as well. And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public. So I think it’s undervalued because one, it’s a surprise and two, you know, we got to get out there and start spreading the news. So I think once we close, you know, you’ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we’re at and Affirm, because you’re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?

In January, during the peak of the SPAC bull market, FSRV rushed to $19+ a share! At the height of that mania, here’s what the FSRV CEO Lee Einbinder had to say at a press event [(page 8-9).](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021003302/ea133671-425_finservacq.htm) And remember this was at nearly $19 a share! :

&gt; Just to frame the valuation, when we announced the deal back in December, we had priced the transaction at 14 times, 2021 EBITDA. Obviously, the stock has moved up since then. But when you look at the valuation of Katapult today, relative to peers, the peer group that we looked at, included other point of sale payment companies like an AfterPay or Sezzle, or even a PayPal or Repay that focuses on similar customers. And then Affirm, which just went public recently. And I think what stands out for Katapult is really the growth rate. The growth rate of historically 100% and going forward north of 75%.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no peers that are exhibiting that same growth rate and that are also profitable today. And that’s what really stands out. And that’s why we think the valuation is still compelling. So even as we sit here today, Katapult is trading at around 13 times next year’s EBITDA. And when you look at that, relative to some of these other companies, we’re still trading in a meaningful discount. A company like Affirm, which isn’t even profitable, I believe is trading at north of 20 times next year’s revenues. And when you look at Katapult, we’re around a 10th of that. I think we’re trading around 2.5 times next year’s revenue.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you think about the opportunity here, you’re buying Katapult, which is profitable today and will continue to be profitable in the future, at any metric you want to look at relative to Affirm, it’s sort of a 10th of the valuation and higher growth rates, it kind of doesn’t make sense to us. And I think that’s why the market is endorsing the story.

### 4.2 Sezzle is a Smaller, Up-and-Coming Potential Threat (That’s Already Valued More Highly?!)
Sezzle is an up-and-comer offering similar services to non-prime customers, with a more global vision than Katapult. They also provide services to help customers raise their credit scores. Sezzle and Target recently signed a deal: [Sezzle, Target Sign Contract For BNPL Product | PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/sezzle-target-sign-3-year-contract-bnpl-product/)

Sezzle is definitely something to keep an eye on -  for one their average return on leases is shockingly low compared to what Katapult pulls out. Katapult made $247m revenue on $201m of originations in 2020.  Sezzle made $49.6m of income on $856m of originations in 2020.  This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of Sezzle’s income, 80%, comes from merchant fees.  So the business is quite different.


Additionally, take a look at Sezzle’s offerings: [Sezzle | Highest-shopper-rated Buy Now, Pay Later solution](https://sezzle.com/stores?category=1) and look at [Katapult’s offerings](https://katapult.com/store-locator/).  There is a larger risk associated with loans for the things Sezzle sells - these are clothes, fashion goods, etc. In a recession are without a doubt going to pay off their refrigerator, laptop, bed, or tires before getting  to this stuff.

Definitely something to keep an eye on, but not a concern at this point considering **they are already at market caps** . They’re not making nearly as much revenue as the other players yet, they’re not profiting on the little they are making,

# 5. Risks
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
| No TL;DR here - you need to read the risks and understand what you are buying. |

### 5.1 Non-prime customers
There is a risk-reward curve out there for point-of-sale lending and Katapult’s customers are higher on the risk side of that. They are lending to people who can’t get approved by other companies. These other companies are not filled with idiots - they aren’t lending to these people for a reason: the risk of default is high.

Katapult is able to use their technology to lower this risk. Even they reject customers they view as too high of a risk. But their sophisticated models allow to to pick out the customers that were passed over as high risk by prime lenders, but were safe to loan to for this specific purchase. 

The  Katapult CEO was asked about this question specifically. He’s clearly put thought into the problem, and what happens to their company in a downturn. In short, they saw an **improvement**in their customer base during the COVID recession as once prime customers were turned away more and more by banks that were tightening up. On top of that, they focus on items that people are going to be damn sure they pay off - appliances, tires, furniture, etc. 

His full response was the following:
&gt; And if you think about during even the financial crisis, you know, cars did really well, right? Even subprime auto did well. And so you asked yourself why. Those are things that people need. You need your car to go back and forth to work.  And I remember my boss at what Wacovia Bank saying, “Well, and they were auto lending.” And they said, “We’ll never lend money in New York City in the boroughs.” And I was like, “Really? Why?” And they said, “Because you don’t have to have your car there.
&gt; […] And so those people tend to focus on that car is, this is my ticket to my job. I need to make sure that I don’t lose this car. And the same goes with our products. And then the durable goods products. If you look at, you know, appliances and furniture, you know, people need appliances and we actually do some auto, we do a lot of tires and tires are really interesting for us and they pay better.  
&gt; […] And when you look at the lease to own product, what happens during a recession is the prime lenders tighten up pretty dramatically. And we saw this, you know, April 15th last year, April and March last year when COVID first started happening. The prime lenders, I mean, tightened up, and then we saw a better customer. And so, for us, it kind of shifts that subprime customer up into closer to prime, because they’re not accessing, you know, credit through the prime lenders.
&gt; […] Right. So, you know, that’s why I hate to use the term subprime. I like to use the term non-prime because my population expands quite a bit during a recession, and I get a better customer. And we saw that if you looked at our vintages during the first weeks of COVID and the shutdowns that happened, and the tightening that happened, which all the banks admitted it. I mean, they all admitted they were tightening up. We saw some of our best performing portfolio during those times.

Some facts:
* The fraud rate across their entire portfolio is about 3%.
	* For reference [auto loans are at 1%.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/auto-loan-fraud-is-soaring-in-a-parallel-to-the-housing-bubble)
* They claim to be able to recover 80-90% of the lease cost on charge-offs. 


###  5.2 Merchant concentration
#### The bad
58% of KPLT’s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020, and 90% from their top 10 merchants. This is obviously a huge risk. 
#### The good 
1. This 58% number is decreasing - in 2019 it was 72% coming from Wayfair. [Proxy statement, pg 31](https://www.cstproxy.com/finservacquisition/sm2021/smproxy/images/FinServ_Acquisition_Corp-SMProxy2021.pdf)
2. The CEO is clear that they have a deal with Wayfair for the near future, and they’re actually currently working with Wayfair on integrating deeper and expanding the partnership. 
3. Though we don’t have Katapult’s 2021 Q1 earnings, **we do have Wayfairs.**  And being such a large percentage of Katapult’s current revenue means we can get a good look at how they are doing by looking at Wayfair. [Wayfair smashed earnings this quarter](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/19/wayfair-earnings-5-stellar-numbers-you-might-have/)   running the stock up 20%.  If you’re going to have merchant concentration in the early stages, Wayfair is NOT a bad place to have it.  Part of this concentration risk in the revenue #'s has to be because Wayfair just keeps growing revenue so quickly and eclipsing others.

[From the CEO:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; Yeah, I’m not worried about it because if you’re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we’re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We’re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. [….] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it’s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.

#### Most buy now pay later services have run into some version of this problem. 

Affirm’s is Peloton. Peloton comprised 30% of Affirm’s 2020 revenue [Affirm S-1 pg 26](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm#tRIFA) 

Sezzle just landed Target as a parter, and will certainly run into the same problem with Target. 

Afterpays is small enough of a % that they don’t mention it specific #'s, but they do say this ([Afterpay prospectus, pg 58](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Afterpay-Prospectus.pdf)
&gt; Although Afterpay does not currently depend on any one retail merchant for more than approximately 20% of its revenue, the Group’s business is still at a relatively early stage and retail merchant client revenue is not as diversified as it might be for a more mature business. The loss of even a small number of Afterpay’s key retail merchant clients may materially and adversely impact Afterpay’s revenue and profitability, and increase marketing expenses to sign up new retail merchant clients to replace those lost. 


#### Government regulation
At the end of the day, this is a business loaning to poorer customers with poor credit. The result is that the interest rates have to be high to make it profitable.  That being said, the “maximum cost” for an item with Katapult is still **more than double the cash price of the item**.  Having the poorest people people pay $1,300 for a $640 refrigerator is not a politically popular idea. On top of this, Democrats have traditionally been in favor of increased consumer protections, and they currently control the house, senate, and presidency. 

#### Prime lenders entering the nonprime market
Katapult benefits greatly from its partnership with Affirm. It gets to piggyback on Affirms’ exclusive partnership with Shopify, for example. It also gets to offer Affirms’ prime servers to merchants it approaches to sweeten the deal. If Affirm were to enter the non-prime market and abandon Katapult,  this would a massive negative if it were to happen before Katapult fully has time to mature. But as far as I can tell from the available information, the partnership is strong.

# 6. Summary
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|Prime-customer only services skip people with poor credit  scores in order to manage their risk. In 2021, you can use tech to build a better model for that risk than a FICO credit score. And then you can profit off of the people that are safe to lend to but the FICO score missed.  Katapult does this, and extremely well - they profit now, not in 2026 - and they’re growing at well over 100% the past few years and 75%+ going forward.  Despite this, they are valued at 1/5t h to 1/10th of their peers in the space, even though these peers have not even figured out how to be profitable yet. KPLT Represents an amazing value. |


At the end of the day, Katapult is about the following: in pretty much all things in life,  and especially finance, risk and reward are intricately linked. Lenders need to be able to evaluate that risk in order to collect  an appropriately sized return. Credit scores are a popular way to do this in traditional lending. 

But they are pretty broad strokes - and massive portions of the population do not have good credit score and are written off - even though they would have been safe to lend to in a specific situation.  This misallocation of risk allows for a new lender to build an edge if they can identify it. 

Katapult is about using the new technology tools afforded to us by the internet in order to find the find the people that these broad strokes missed and to lend to them in a way that works for this class of people. 

They do this, and they do it well. They’re profitable when no one else has figured out how to be profitable in the space. At the same time, they’re not sacrificing growth, because they’re also growing as fast or faster than others in the space. I am a strong fan of the stock at this valuation. 

## Tin-foil hat theory
Completely unfounded, but just my hopes that we will get killer earnings or some new partnerships announced once the company is public. 

The CEO has sort of hinted at some things coming out after merger in the second half of 2021.The CEO was asked about why their valuation is just so low compared to competitors. Says they can’t say too much with the merger agreement.   IMO seems like he started to overspeak about things coming up, “**and we’ve got some.**.” ,paused, and pivoted to just saying that they had a really strong team.  Definitely a small pause in the video.  The full quote:

&gt; And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public.  [(~18:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DBd7vVbcl8)

Additionally, when talking about the PIPE Tiger Managements involvement with them:

&gt; So I’m hoping that they see, you know, especially once we, you know, turn the ticker symbol to KPLT and we can start talking about guidance and opportunities and everything that’s coming down our way, that they continue to be a longterm."
"FSRV votes Monday 6/7 regarding the merger with Katapult (KPLT) , here is why this weeks merger is the best valued entry you are going to get into the surging buy-now-pay-later space, SPAC or not",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SPACsTookMyHome/comments/ntyw01/fsrv_votes_monday_67_regarding_the_merger_with/,SPACsTookMyHome,1,2021-06-07 07:44:18,0,/r/u_SPACsTookMyHome/comments/ntyw01/fsrv_votes_monday_67_regarding_the_merger_with/,NaN,"&gt; And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. \[...\] So I think once we close, you know, you’ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we’re at and Affirm, because you’re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?

## Introduction and motivation

Hello and welcome to my post on FSRV / Katapult. Thanks in advance for reading. Most importantly, please feel free to step in and correct any mistakes you notice or criticize where you find appropriate. 

**I'm posting this because I have a lot of money (to me) in this and would love for people to poke holes in this company and potentially save me from losing that money :) We are all trying to help each other here.**

#### Post structure
* It's long and most people want a TL;DR.  Each section will have its own TL;DR and you can skim through all of them to get the picture, or just jump directly to the summary the very end.
* I strongly encourage you to at least skim the Katapult [investor presentation](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) before reading. But it will be referenced a lot regardless.
* This is divided up into different sections with a table of contents below. Everyone has different factors they care about in companies so I encourage you to check out what matters to you.
* This post will certainly not be perfect nor exhaustive.

#### References
* Mostly spread out throughout the post. I did list some general sources at the end, but couldn’t fit them in so they’ll be in a comment on the full post and linked to in the table of contents. 
* I will not be providing resources for easily google-able facts that are not relevant to the primary points. As an example, no source is provided for the fact that Tiger Global Management was founded in 2001 by Chase Coleman III. Just google it bro.
* I do get lazy so I probably skipped a few that I should have had, just drop a comment and I will find the source for you.

# 1. Background Information on the PIPE, SPAC Team, and Target
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|PIPE|
|The world renowned Tiger Global Management who were early investors in Facebook, Spotify,  Stripe, Coinbase, Xiaomi. Certainly the most famous of anyone / thing else on this list.|
|SPAC|
|Founded Nov 2019, before the flood of SPACs. Extremely qualified, educated group with many decades in Fintech  / on Wall Street. As an example, the CEO remarks about how well he knows /has worked often with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

&gt; And the fact that we understood the risk and how to underwrite the risk and that the business was pretty solid. I think those were the things. I’m not speaking for them, but I think they saw in us some of the feedback I get from many of the investors, we were thrilled to have Tiger join us. You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.

### 1.3 Target: Katapult
Founded in 2012 as Cognical doing business as “Zibbly” , with the company re-branded Katapult in November 2019.

#### Original Founders
Honestly, most of the original founders do not impress much.  To me on the outside, it reads like a few Cornell undergrads had a decent idea, got the ear of an angel investor,  and then got actual experts to design the real product.

Most importantly are the two following experts in computer science / machine learning who were founders:
	* **Ashutosh Saxena,** PhD from Stanford in Computer Science with an emphasis on artificial intelligence ]https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxenaashutosh]
	* **Pierre Sermanet,** PhD in deep learning and computer vision from New York University, researcher for Google Brain [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sermanet]
Other co-founders:
	* Andrew Hancox: Angel investor, invested in BlockFi
	* Brandon Wright, Chinedu Eleanya, Cornell undergrads at time of founding. 
	

#### Current Executive Team
**CEO Orlando Zayas**:
* CEO since 2017
*  Former VP of Emerging Markets at GE Capital

#### Number Of Employees
I can’t find this information easily.  Going purely by LinkedIn numbers, there are 101 employees. LinkedIn “Company Size” info says 51-200 employees. The careers page has 21 open positions [ [BambooHR](https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) What I can say is that if you look back at a WebArchive page of the listings from January [BambooHR](http://web.archive.org/web/20210118070621/https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) you can see there were only 13 and they were also a different set of positions.

# 2 The Deal
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|SPAC trust+150m PIPE = 400m. Only 8% will go to the balance sheet, with the other 92% going as cash to existing shareholders and tx fees. But, while on the higher end of the spectrum, this is pretty common. If you want to own a solid company you have to pay up. |

&gt; You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.
\-Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas

$250M from the SPAC trust and $150M from the PIPE will go to Katapult ([slide 45](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf))

Of this 400m, here’s where it ends up:
* $325m will be provided as cash consideration to existing shareholders. 
* $32m will go to the balance sheet
* $43m will be spent on transaction expenses

26% of the combined company will be owned by the SPAC holders. 

*Note: In reality, it’s 18m coming from he balance sheet for the deal, and 50m going to it, but I just simplified that to a 32m credit to the balance sheet here.* 

### Pros
The pro is that we get Katapult in the public markets.  We’re not getting a horrible 5% or 10% cut like some SPAC deals, 26% is decent. 
### Cons
The real con is obvious: Of the $400m in financing, $325m of it is going directly to buy out the current shareholders. Only 32/400 = 8% is going to the balance sheet to help the company! 82% of the proceeds will be going to buy out existing shareholders. 

Additionally, PIPE is getting 16% of the final company but only putting in 
 
### My take
While the exact % going to shareholders may be on the high end at 82% (but not highest end), this is the price of buying a good, profitable company with realistic growth prospects. Here are some other examples of this.

# 3 Katapult 
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services for non-prime customers provided at checkout time for durable goods (appliances, car parts, computers, etc). They are able to make a niche here and profit due to building sophisticated models of non-prime customer behavior beyond what a traditional credit score gives. They find the ones that they can lend to, and provide a fast checkout experience to get your items, and a convenient payment mechanism that incentivizes paying the item off. |

&gt; And so I think they saw that we were clearly focused in an area that is being overlooked. It’s a green space and then we got to profitability. And so, you know, we’re driving, you know, and that’s not much, that’s not a lot of the other BNPLs can’t brag about that. And I can, but it’s been because our business is built on true fundamentals and we understand the future and we understand what’s going to happen. And so we’ve planned the business out well. 
\- Orlando Zayas

### 3.1 Business
Katapult’s business is to provide “buy now pay later” service to non-prime customers at checkout time.  They work with merchants to integrate their system into online payment portals, and at checkout customers will have the option to check out. If customers pay off the lease within 90 days, they pay only 5% plus a $45 fee. 

They also parter with prime lender Affirm. The duo provides a “waterfall” service to merchants. They claim Affirm rejects 65% of applicants at many of the merchants Affirm is with, these are passed on to Katapult and Katapult specializes in these nonprime customers and approves 60% of them [(source)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf).

### 3.2 Technology
They use a variety of inputs collected throughout the shopping experience, as well as user inputs, to build a sophisticated model of the risk provided by the customer. In a recent podcast, FinServ CEO Lee Einbinder actually potentially let slip one of their inputs that might be used to judge risk-  the way users move their mouse.  They claim to use [(slide 30)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf):
* “7 minimum user inputs”
* ~ “100 gathered user attributes”
* ~ “2,000 3rd party data elements”

In most scenarios they claim to provide ~30% better detection of “true good payers” than an existing 3rd party off the self score. [(slide 31)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)

### 3.3 Quick facts
Profitable since 2020 [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average order value is $600[(slide 25)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average return on lease has increased 40% , relative to it’s value at the end of 2018[(slide 32)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average time to lease payoff is around 7 months [(page 3)](And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.)


### 3.4 Balance Sheet
Easily one of the healthier balance sheets we’ve seen in SPAC-land. The [highlights](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm): 
* After the merger they will have 32m of net debt. 
* Liquidity situation: &gt;$100m of liquidity 
* They do not foresee a need ed to take on any more debt or raise capital to achieve their targets. From the CEO [(page 3):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; …..we have a lending agreement where it’s a warehouse agreement that literally can expand up to 250 million, […] even though we did, you know, around 200 million and last year, I only used about a third of that line to fund that growth. 
&gt; 
&gt; And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.

### 3.5 Financials and Growth
Revenue in 2020 was 247m. Revenue Growth for 2018-2020 has been at about 140% YoY [(slide 12)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm) on average. Going forward, they’re expecting  upwards of 75% for the next few years before beginning to taper off to ‘only’ in the 40%s YoY [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) This equates to about $1,130 in expected revenue in 2022 (not 2026  or something insane!),.

EBITDA / Profit  for 2020 was 41m EBITDA and 23m net profit . For 2021, they expect EBITDA growth of 114% to 70m before, like the revenue, tapering to “only” 43% EBITDA growth in 2022 for 216m revenue. 

The CEO is clear that they are focused on what is working and not getting sidetracked, at least for the near term [(page 4)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; **Speaker 2:** ….There’s enough headroom for us to grow just in buy now, pay later, and then maybe we’ll introduce a checking account or something like that a little bit later, or where would you say you’re seeing your growth? Is it BNPL or is it more let’s go into other things?
&gt; **Orlando Zayas (CEO):**  You know, near term, and that’s in the next two to three years, I would say definitely staying in the BNPL space. You know, as we grow our portfolio of consumers and you’re right now, we’ve approved over 1.5 million consumers for shopping, you know, we’ve done over 500,000 leases. And so as we grow that base, I think there’s going to be a lot of opportunity to, you know, do things like checking accounts and other things, because, you know, we’re going to have a much different perspective about that consumer. It’s not going to be FICO driven.

# 4. The Competition and Their Valuations
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|There is a lot of competition in BNPL - Katapult sidesteps all of this by only going for the customers that the other players reject. They have figured out how to profit off of this group and are doing extremely well. Their public peers in BNPL - even the ones that sort of look at that non-prime space - are trading at levels 5-10 times higher than Katapult on a revenue/earnings adjusted basis. The value is insanely cheap compared to the other players. |

### 4.1 There is a lot of competition in the Buy Now Pay Later space. There is (almost) no competition in the non-prime Buy Now Pay Later space.
Buy now pay later companies are growing like weeds. Here is a short list of public ones:
* Affirm
* PayPal
* Afterpay
* Sezzle
And private ones:
* Klarna (The king in the space)
* QuadPay
* SplitIt
the list goes on and on…by the time you read this there are probably two more.

But these are almost all going for **prime customers**. They use traditional factors like your credit score, along with more modern ones, to accept or decline a customer. In Katapult’s investor presentation, they state that Affirm declines **up to 65% of the people who apply**.  Even if this number is traditionally lower - it’s an insane group. FSRV CEO Einbinder says he thinks the number is something like **40-45% r**ejected in the podcast in the References section. It’s a huge number - and Katapult has the field all to itself, as long as it can find out how to profit off of them when others passed on the opportunity. And without a doubt, the answer to that question is that they have. 

### 4.2 Katapult’s Post-Merger Valuation Will Be Shockingly Low Compared to Public and Private Peers
Comparing the companies as a function of their valuation divided by their market cap shows a clear trend…except for Katapult?

|Company |Market Cap|2020 Rev|M Cap / 2020 Rev|2020 EBITDA|M Cap / 2020 EBITDA|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|

The situation gets remains when you look at the projected 2021 numbers (Not 2026 or something, 2021, which is over in 6 months…) .

|Company |Market Cap|2021 Rev|M Cap / 2021 Rev|2021 EBITDA|M Cap / 2021 EBITDA|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Affirm^1**|15.8b|770m|20.5x|-125m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|
|**Afterpay^(1,3)**|21.3b|-|25.7x|-|-|
|**Sezzle^3**|1.36b|-|12.73x|-|-|
|**Klarna^2**|31b|-|-|-|-|
|**Katapult**|1.33b|455m|2.92x|S|19x|


^1 Affirm and Afterpays’ fiscal years end in June . So this revenue data is technically shifted back in time by 6 months, but their Market Cap is current. The effect is that this is a little unfair to these companies - their M Cap / Rev #s should a bit lower. But you get the order of magnitude here. I thought about calculating it on a Jan-Dec basis but gave up when I couldn't find 2022E (For July-Dec 2021) numbers easily.

^2 Klarna is a private company. [Market cap /valuation estimate.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/) I can’t find 2021 estimates. 

^3 I can’t find 2021 expected numbers for these guys. And I do not feel like digging more. These numbers are instead calculated from the Katapult investor presentation - a footnote states the multiples provided were as of market close on 12/15 - I have scaled the multiples by the stock price change since then.  [slide 42.](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf). EBITDA multiples were not provided in a way that allows this. 

I won’t even add 2022…..…..but you get the point. It’s being priced at an insane discount. Surely it must be growing more slowly? Let’s take a look at the 2020 revenue growth numbers. Again, please keep in mind the caveat that Afterpay / Affirm are based on June 2019- June 2020 #s, while the others are Jan 2020-Dec 2020. So give those guys whatever discount you think is fair or do the math I was too lazy to do :)

|Company|2020 Revenue Growth %|
:--|:--|
|**Affirm**|92%|
|**Afterpay**|97%|
|**Sezzle**|272%|
|**Klarna**|40%|
|**Katapult**|168%|

The Katapult CEO was directly asked about this valuation gap. His response says it all [(page 6):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)

&gt; I think it’s an undiscovered gem. I mean, I’ve had numerous investor calls after we made the announcement that weren’t included on the pipe. And I don’t know how many times I’ve heard it. We missed this one and we don’t know how, and we’re really excited to talk to you. So I think it’s an undiscovered gem, you know, the headlines were Affirm, the headlines were Afterpay. The headlines were, you know, Klarna. And so then, you know, we kind of sneak up and they’re like, wait a minute. This is a really good market and focused on the right market yet. They figured out how to make money at it. And so I think it just stuck up. That’s why I’m looking forward to closing the deal, changing the ticker to KPLT and having our name out there.
&gt; 
&gt; And, you know, Kristen obviously is going to help us get our name out there to investors as well. And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public. So I think it’s undervalued because one, it’s a surprise and two, you know, we got to get out there and start spreading the news. So I think once we close, you know, you’ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we’re at and Affirm, because you’re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?

In January, during the peak of the SPAC bull market, FSRV rushed to $19+ a share! At the height of that mania, here’s what the FSRV CEO Lee Einbinder had to say at a press event [(page 8-9).](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021003302/ea133671-425_finservacq.htm) And remember this was at nearly $19 a share! :

&gt; Just to frame the valuation, when we announced the deal back in December, we had priced the transaction at 14 times, 2021 EBITDA. Obviously, the stock has moved up since then. But when you look at the valuation of Katapult today, relative to peers, the peer group that we looked at, included other point of sale payment companies like an AfterPay or Sezzle, or even a PayPal or Repay that focuses on similar customers. And then Affirm, which just went public recently. And I think what stands out for Katapult is really the growth rate. The growth rate of historically 100% and going forward north of 75%.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no peers that are exhibiting that same growth rate and that are also profitable today. And that’s what really stands out. And that’s why we think the valuation is still compelling. So even as we sit here today, Katapult is trading at around 13 times next year’s EBITDA. And when you look at that, relative to some of these other companies, we’re still trading in a meaningful discount. A company like Affirm, which isn’t even profitable, I believe is trading at north of 20 times next year’s revenues. And when you look at Katapult, we’re around a 10th of that. I think we’re trading around 2.5 times next year’s revenue.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you think about the opportunity here, you’re buying Katapult, which is profitable today and will continue to be profitable in the future, at any metric you want to look at relative to Affirm, it’s sort of a 10th of the valuation and higher growth rates, it kind of doesn’t make sense to us. And I think that’s why the market is endorsing the story.

### 4.2 Sezzle is a Smaller, Up-and-Coming Potential Threat (That’s Already Valued More Highly?!)
Sezzle is an up-and-comer offering similar services to non-prime customers, with a more global vision than Katapult. They also provide services to help customers raise their credit scores. Sezzle and Target recently signed a deal: [Sezzle, Target Sign Contract For BNPL Product | PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/sezzle-target-sign-3-year-contract-bnpl-product/)

Sezzle is definitely something to keep an eye on -  for one their average return on leases is shockingly low compared to what Katapult pulls out. Katapult made $247m revenue on $201m of originations in 2020.  Sezzle made $49.6m of income on $856m of originations in 2020.  This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of Sezzle’s income, 80%, comes from merchant fees.  So the business is quite different.


Additionally, take a look at Sezzle’s offerings: [Sezzle | Highest-shopper-rated Buy Now, Pay Later solution](https://sezzle.com/stores?category=1) and look at [Katapult’s offerings](https://katapult.com/store-locator/).  There is a larger risk associated with loans for the things Sezzle sells - these are clothes, fashion goods, etc. In a recession are without a doubt going to pay off their refrigerator, laptop, bed, or tires before getting  to this stuff.

Definitely something to keep an eye on, but not a concern at this point considering **they are already at market caps** . They’re not making nearly as much revenue as the other players yet, they’re not profiting on the little they are making,

# 5. Risks
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
| No TL;DR here - you need to read the risks and understand what you are buying. |

### 5.1 Non-prime customers
There is a risk-reward curve out there for point-of-sale lending and Katapult’s customers are higher on the risk side of that. They are lending to people who can’t get approved by other companies. These other companies are not filled with idiots - they aren’t lending to these people for a reason: the risk of default is high.

Katapult is able to use their technology to lower this risk. Even they reject customers they view as too high of a risk. But their sophisticated models allow to to pick out the customers that were passed over as high risk by prime lenders, but were safe to loan to for this specific purchase. 

The  Katapult CEO was asked about this question specifically. He’s clearly put thought into the problem, and what happens to their company in a downturn. In short, they saw an **improvement**in their customer base during the COVID recession as once prime customers were turned away more and more by banks that were tightening up. On top of that, they focus on items that people are going to be damn sure they pay off - appliances, tires, furniture, etc. 

His full response was the following:
&gt; And if you think about during even the financial crisis, you know, cars did really well, right? Even subprime auto did well. And so you asked yourself why. Those are things that people need. You need your car to go back and forth to work.  And I remember my boss at what Wacovia Bank saying, “Well, and they were auto lending.” And they said, “We’ll never lend money in New York City in the boroughs.” And I was like, “Really? Why?” And they said, “Because you don’t have to have your car there.
&gt; […] And so those people tend to focus on that car is, this is my ticket to my job. I need to make sure that I don’t lose this car. And the same goes with our products. And then the durable goods products. If you look at, you know, appliances and furniture, you know, people need appliances and we actually do some auto, we do a lot of tires and tires are really interesting for us and they pay better.  
&gt; […] And when you look at the lease to own product, what happens during a recession is the prime lenders tighten up pretty dramatically. And we saw this, you know, April 15th last year, April and March last year when COVID first started happening. The prime lenders, I mean, tightened up, and then we saw a better customer. And so, for us, it kind of shifts that subprime customer up into closer to prime, because they’re not accessing, you know, credit through the prime lenders.
&gt; […] Right. So, you know, that’s why I hate to use the term subprime. I like to use the term non-prime because my population expands quite a bit during a recession, and I get a better customer. And we saw that if you looked at our vintages during the first weeks of COVID and the shutdowns that happened, and the tightening that happened, which all the banks admitted it. I mean, they all admitted they were tightening up. We saw some of our best performing portfolio during those times.

Some facts:
* The fraud rate across their entire portfolio is about 3%.
	* For reference [auto loans are at 1%.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/auto-loan-fraud-is-soaring-in-a-parallel-to-the-housing-bubble)
* They claim to be able to recover 80-90% of the lease cost on charge-offs. 


###  5.2 Merchant concentration
#### The bad
58% of KPLT’s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020, and 90% from their top 10 merchants. This is obviously a huge risk. 
#### The good 
1. This 58% number is decreasing - in 2019 it was 72% coming from Wayfair. [Proxy statement, pg 31](https://www.cstproxy.com/finservacquisition/sm2021/smproxy/images/FinServ_Acquisition_Corp-SMProxy2021.pdf)
2. The CEO is clear that they have a deal with Wayfair for the near future, and they’re actually currently working with Wayfair on integrating deeper and expanding the partnership. 
3. Though we don’t have Katapult’s 2021 Q1 earnings, **we do have Wayfairs.**  And being such a large percentage of Katapult’s current revenue means we can get a good look at how they are doing by looking at Wayfair. [Wayfair smashed earnings this quarter](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/19/wayfair-earnings-5-stellar-numbers-you-might-have/)   running the stock up 20%.  If you’re going to have merchant concentration in the early stages, Wayfair is NOT a bad place to have it.  Part of this concentration risk in the revenue #'s has to be because Wayfair just keeps growing revenue so quickly and eclipsing others.

[From the CEO:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; Yeah, I’m not worried about it because if you’re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we’re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We’re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. [….] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it’s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.

#### Most buy now pay later services have run into some version of this problem. 

Affirm’s is Peloton. Peloton comprised 30% of Affirm’s 2020 revenue [Affirm S-1 pg 26](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm#tRIFA) 

Sezzle just landed Target as a parter, and will certainly run into the same problem with Target. 

Afterpays is small enough of a % that they don’t mention it specific #'s, but they do say this ([Afterpay prospectus, pg 58](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Afterpay-Prospectus.pdf)
&gt; Although Afterpay does not currently depend on any one retail merchant for more than approximately 20% of its revenue, the Group’s business is still at a relatively early stage and retail merchant client revenue is not as diversified as it might be for a more mature business. The loss of even a small number of Afterpay’s key retail merchant clients may materially and adversely impact Afterpay’s revenue and profitability, and increase marketing expenses to sign up new retail merchant clients to replace those lost. 


#### Government regulation
At the end of the day, this is a business loaning to poorer customers with poor credit. The result is that the interest rates have to be high to make it profitable.  That being said, the “maximum cost” for an item with Katapult is still **more than double the cash price of the item**.  Having the poorest people people pay $1,300 for a $640 refrigerator is not a politically popular idea. On top of this, Democrats have traditionally been in favor of increased consumer protections, and they currently control the house, senate, and presidency. 

#### Prime lenders entering the nonprime market
Katapult benefits greatly from its partnership with Affirm. It gets to piggyback on Affirms’ exclusive partnership with Shopify, for example. It also gets to offer Affirms’ prime servers to merchants it approaches to sweeten the deal. If Affirm were to enter the non-prime market and abandon Katapult,  this would a massive negative if it were to happen before Katapult fully has time to mature. But as far as I can tell from the available information, the partnership is strong.

# 6. Summary
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|Prime-customer only services skip people with poor credit  scores in order to manage their risk. In 2021, you can use tech to build a better model for that risk than a FICO credit score. And then you can profit off of the people that are safe to lend to but the FICO score missed.  Katapult does this, and extremely well - they profit now, not in 2026 - and they’re growing at well over 100% the past few years and 75%+ going forward.  Despite this, they are valued at 1/5t h to 1/10th of their peers in the space, even though these peers have not even figured out how to be profitable yet. KPLT Represents an amazing value. |


At the end of the day, Katapult is about the following: in pretty much all things in life,  and especially finance, risk and reward are intricately linked. Lenders need to be able to evaluate that risk in order to collect  an appropriately sized return. Credit scores are a popular way to do this in traditional lending. 

But they are pretty broad strokes - and massive portions of the population do not have good credit score and are written off - even though they would have been safe to lend to in a specific situation.  This misallocation of risk allows for a new lender to build an edge if they can identify it. 

Katapult is about using the new technology tools afforded to us by the internet in order to find the find the people that these broad strokes missed and to lend to them in a way that works for this class of people. 

They do this, and they do it well. They’re profitable when no one else has figured out how to be profitable in the space. At the same time, they’re not sacrificing growth, because they’re also growing as fast or faster than others in the space. I am a strong fan of the stock at this valuation. 

## Tin-foil hat theory
Completely unfounded, but just my hopes that we will get killer earnings or some new partnerships announced once the company is public. 

The CEO has sort of hinted at some things coming out after merger in the second half of 2021.The CEO was asked about why their valuation is just so low compared to competitors. Says they can’t say too much with the merger agreement.   IMO seems like he started to overspeak about things coming up, “**and we’ve got some.**.” ,paused, and pivoted to just saying that they had a really strong team.  Definitely a small pause in the video.  The full quote:

&gt; And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public.  [(~18:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DBd7vVbcl8)

Additionally, when talking about the PIPE Tiger Managements involvement with them:

&gt; So I’m hoping that they see, you know, especially once we, you know, turn the ticker symbol to KPLT and we can start talking about guidance and opportunities and everything that’s coming down our way, that they continue to be a longterm.

## Introduction and motivation

Hello and welcome to my post on FSRV / Katapult. Thanks in advance for reading. Most importantly, please feel free to step in and correct any mistakes you notice or criticize where you find appropriate. 

**I'm posting this because I have a lot of money (to me) in this and would love for people to poke holes in this company and potentially save me from losing that money :) We are all trying to help each other here.**

#### Post structure
* It's long and most people want a TL;DR.  Each section will have its own TL;DR and you can skim through all of them to get the picture, or just jump directly to the summary the very end.
* I strongly encourage you to at least skim the Katapult [investor presentation](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) before reading. But it will be referenced a lot regardless.
* This is divided up into different sections with a table of contents below. Everyone has different factors they care about in companies so I encourage you to check out what matters to you.
* This post will certainly not be perfect nor exhaustive.

#### References
* Mostly spread out throughout the post. I did list some general sources at the end, but couldn’t fit them in so they’ll be in a comment on the full post and linked to in the table of contents. 
* I will not be providing resources for easily google-able facts that are not relevant to the primary points. As an example, no source is provided for the fact that Tiger Global Management was founded in 2001 by Chase Coleman III. Just google it bro.
* I do get lazy so I probably skipped a few that I should have had, just drop a comment and I will find the source for you.

# 1. Background Information on the PIPE, SPAC Team, and Target
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|PIPE|
|The world renowned Tiger Global Management who were early investors in Facebook, Spotify,  Stripe, Coinbase, Xiaomi. Certainly the most famous of anyone / thing else on this list.|
|SPAC|
|Founded Nov 2019, before the flood of SPACs. Extremely qualified, educated group with many decades in Fintech  / on Wall Street. As an example, the CEO remarks about how well he knows /has worked often with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Board members include a former CFO of Lehman brothers and the current CEO of Icahn industries.|  
|Target|
|Katapult: Buy-now pay later service that works with online retailers. Their niche is that they target the non-prime market. We’ll (obviously) get to the details elsewhere in this post|

### 1.1 PIPE
#### Tiger Global Management
* A  hedge / venture capital / private equity fund that has become very successful and well known for its venture capital investments.
* Founded in 2001 by Chase Coleman III
* Venture capital investors in :
   * Facebook 
   * Spotify 
   * Coinbase 
   * Stripe 
   * Xiaomi 
   * The list really does just go on with these guys
Here is what Orlando Zayas has to say about their deal with Tiger [(page 5)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; And the fact that we understood the risk and how to underwrite the risk and that the business was pretty solid. I think those were the things. I’m not speaking for them, but I think they saw in us some of the feedback I get from many of the investors, we were thrilled to have Tiger join us. You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.

### 1.3 Target: Katapult
Founded in 2012 as Cognical doing business as “Zibbly” , with the company re-branded Katapult in November 2019.

#### Original Founders
Honestly, most of the original founders do not impress much.  To me on the outside, it reads like a few Cornell undergrads had a decent idea, got the ear of an angel investor,  and then got actual experts to design the real product.

Most importantly are the two following experts in computer science / machine learning who were founders:
	* **Ashutosh Saxena,** PhD from Stanford in Computer Science with an emphasis on artificial intelligence ]https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxenaashutosh]
	* **Pierre Sermanet,** PhD in deep learning and computer vision from New York University, researcher for Google Brain [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sermanet]
Other co-founders:
	* Andrew Hancox: Angel investor, invested in BlockFi
	* Brandon Wright, Chinedu Eleanya, Cornell undergrads at time of founding. 
	

#### Current Executive Team
**CEO Orlando Zayas**:
* CEO since 2017
*  Former VP of Emerging Markets at GE Capital

#### Headquarters
In 2021 relocated from New York, NY to Plano, TX to be in a business-friendly jurisdiction. [[News Flash • Plano Economic Development, TX • CivicEngage](http://www.planotexas.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=93)]

#### Number Of Employees
I can’t find this information easily.  Going purely by LinkedIn numbers, there are 101 employees. LinkedIn “Company Size” info says 51-200 employees. The careers page has 21 open positions [ [BambooHR](https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) What I can say is that if you look back at a WebArchive page of the listings from January [BambooHR](http://web.archive.org/web/20210118070621/https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) you can see there were only 13 and they were also a different set of positions.

# 2 The Deal
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|SPAC trust+150m PIPE = 400m. Only 8% will go to the balance sheet, with the other 92% going as cash to existing shareholders and tx fees. But, while on the higher end of the spectrum, this is pretty common. If you want to own a solid company you have to pay up. |

&gt; You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.
\-Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas

$250M from the SPAC trust and $150M from the PIPE will go to Katapult ([slide 45](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf))

Of this 400m, here’s where it ends up:
* $325m will be provided as cash consideration to existing shareholders. 
* $32m will go to the balance sheet
* $43m will be spent on transaction expenses

26% of the combined company will be owned by the SPAC holders. 

*Note: In reality, it’s 18m coming from he balance sheet for the deal, and 50m going to it, but I just simplified that to a 32m credit to the balance sheet here.* 

### Pros
The pro is that we get Katapult in the public markets.  We’re not getting a horrible 5% or 10% cut like some SPAC deals, 26% is decent. 
### Cons
The real con is obvious: Of the $400m in financing, $325m of it is going directly to buy out the current shareholders. Only 32/400 = 8% is going to the balance sheet to help the company! 82% of the proceeds will be going to buy out existing shareholders. 

Additionally, PIPE is getting 16% of the final company but only putting in 
 
### My take
While the exact % going to shareholders may be on the high end at 82% (but not highest end), this is the price of buying a good, profitable company with realistic growth prospects. Here are some other examples of this.

# 3 Katapult 
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services for non-prime customers provided at checkout time for durable goods (appliances, car parts, computers, etc). They are able to make a niche here and profit due to building sophisticated models of non-prime customer behavior beyond what a traditional credit score gives. They find the ones that they can lend to, and provide a fast checkout experience to get your items, and a convenient payment mechanism that incentivizes paying the item off. |

&gt; And so I think they saw that we were clearly focused in an area that is being overlooked. It’s a green space and then we got to profitability. And so, you know, we’re driving, you know, and that’s not much, that’s not a lot of the other BNPLs can’t brag about that. And I can, but it’s been because our business is built on true fundamentals and we understand the future and we understand what’s going to happen. And so we’ve planned the business out well. 
\- Orlando Zayas

### 3.1 Business
Katapult’s business is to provide “buy now pay later” service to non-prime customers at checkout time.  They work with merchants to integrate their system into online payment portals, and at checkout customers will have the option to check out. If customers pay off the lease within 90 days, they pay only 5% plus a $45 fee. 

They also parter with prime lender Affirm. The duo provides a “waterfall” service to merchants. They claim Affirm rejects 65% of applicants at many of the merchants Affirm is with, these are passed on to Katapult and Katapult specializes in these nonprime customers and approves 60% of them [(source)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf).

### 3.2 Technology
They use a variety of inputs collected throughout the shopping experience, as well as user inputs, to build a sophisticated model of the risk provided by the customer. In a recent podcast, FinServ CEO Lee Einbinder actually potentially let slip one of their inputs that might be used to judge risk-  the way users move their mouse.  They claim to use [(slide 30)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf):
* “7 minimum user inputs”
* ~ “100 gathered user attributes”
* ~ “2,000 3rd party data elements”

In most scenarios they claim to provide ~30% better detection of “true good payers” than an existing 3rd party off the self score. [(slide 31)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)

### 3.3 Quick facts
Profitable since 2020 [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average order value is $600[(slide 25)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average return on lease has increased 40% , relative to it’s value at the end of 2018[(slide 32)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average time to lease payoff is around 7 months [(page 3)](And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.)


### 3.4 Balance Sheet
Easily one of the healthier balance sheets we’ve seen in SPAC-land. The [highlights](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm): 
* After the merger they will have 32m of net debt. 
* Liquidity situation: &gt;$100m of liquidity 
* They do not foresee a need ed to take on any more debt or raise capital to achieve their targets. From the CEO [(page 3):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; …..we have a lending agreement where it’s a warehouse agreement that literally can expand up to 250 million, […] even though we did, you know, around 200 million and last year, I only used about a third of that line to fund that growth. 
&gt; 
&gt; And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.

### 3.5 Financials and Growth
Revenue in 2020 was 247m. Revenue Growth for 2018-2020 has been at about 140% YoY [(slide 12)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm) on average. Going forward, they’re expecting  upwards of 75% for the next few years before beginning to taper off to ‘only’ in the 40%s YoY [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) This equates to about $1,130 in expected revenue in 2022 (not 2026  or something insane!),.

EBITDA / Profit  for 2020 was 41m EBITDA and 23m net profit . For 2021, they expect EBITDA growth of 114% to 70m before, like the revenue, tapering to “only” 43% EBITDA growth in 2022 for 216m revenue. 

The CEO is clear that they are focused on what is working and not getting sidetracked, at least for the near term [(page 4)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; **Speaker 2:** ….There’s enough headroom for us to grow just in buy now, pay later, and then maybe we’ll introduce a checking account or something like that a little bit later, or where would you say you’re seeing your growth? Is it BNPL or is it more let’s go into other things?
&gt; **Orlando Zayas (CEO):**  You know, near term, and that’s in the next two to three years, I would say definitely staying in the BNPL space. You know, as we grow our portfolio of consumers and you’re right now, we’ve approved over 1.5 million consumers for shopping, you know, we’ve done over 500,000 leases. And so as we grow that base, I think there’s going to be a lot of opportunity to, you know, do things like checking accounts and other things, because, you know, we’re going to have a much different perspective about that consumer. It’s not going to be FICO driven.

# 4. The Competition and Their Valuations
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|There is a lot of competition in BNPL - Katapult sidesteps all of this by only going for the customers that the other players reject. They have figured out how to profit off of this group and are doing extremely well. Their public peers in BNPL - even the ones that sort of look at that non-prime space - are trading at levels 5-10 times higher than Katapult on a revenue/earnings adjusted basis. The value is insanely cheap compared to the other players. |

### 4.1 There is a lot of competition in the Buy Now Pay Later space. There is (almost) no competition in the non-prime Buy Now Pay Later space.
Buy now pay later companies are growing like weeds. Here is a short list of public ones:
* Affirm
* PayPal
* Afterpay
* Sezzle
And private ones:
* Klarna (The king in the space)
* QuadPay
* SplitIt
the list goes on and on…by the time you read this there are probably two more.

But these are almost all going for **prime customers**. They use traditional factors like your credit score, along with more modern ones, to accept or decline a customer. In Katapult’s investor presentation, they state that Affirm declines **up to 65% of the people who apply**.  Even if this number is traditionally lower - it’s an insane group. FSRV CEO Einbinder says he thinks the number is something like **40-45% r**ejected in the podcast in the References section. It’s a huge number - and Katapult has the field all to itself, as long as it can find out how to profit off of them when others passed on the opportunity. And without a doubt, the answer to that question is that they have. 

### 4.2 Katapult’s Post-Merger Valuation Will Be Shockingly Low Compared to Public and Private Peers
Comparing the companies as a function of their valuation divided by their market cap shows a clear trend…except for Katapult?

|Company |Market Cap|2020 Rev|M Cap / 2020 Rev|2020 EBITDA|M Cap / 2020 EBITDA|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Affirm^1**|15.8b|510m|40x|-112m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|
|**Afterpay**|21.3b|519.2m|41x|44.4m|479.9x|
|**Sezzle**|1.36b|58.8m|23x|-27.9m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|
|**Klarna^2**|31b|1.087b|28.5x|-195m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|
|**Katapult**|1.33b|247m|5.4x|41m|32.4x|
Sources: [Affirm](https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/9de99ee8-3e89-46db-80c2-1af22a07543b) , [Afterpay](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-FINAL-APT_FY20-Annual-Report.pdf) , [Sezzle](https://asx.api.markitdigital.com/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02347237-2A1283548?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) , [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/03/30041759/Annual-Report-Klarna-Bank-AB-2020-210329.pdf) , [Katapult](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm)

The situation gets remains when you look at the projected 2021 numbers (Not 2026 or something, 2021, which is over in 6 months…) .

|Company |Market Cap|2021 Rev|M Cap / 2021 Rev|2021 EBITDA|M Cap / 2021 EBITDA|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Affirm^1**|15.8b|770m|20.5x|-125m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|
|**Afterpay^(1,3)**|21.3b|-|25.7x|-|-|
|**Sezzle^3**|1.36b|-|12.73x|-|-|
|**Klarna^2**|31b|-|-|-|-|
|**Katapult**|1.33b|455m|2.92x|S|19x|


^1 Affirm and Afterpays’ fiscal years end in June . So this revenue data is technically shifted back in time by 6 months, but their Market Cap is current. The effect is that this is a little unfair to these companies - their M Cap / Rev #s should a bit lower. But you get the order of magnitude here. I thought about calculating it on a Jan-Dec basis but gave up when I couldn't find 2022E (For July-Dec 2021) numbers easily.

^2 Klarna is a private company. [Market cap /valuation estimate.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/) I can’t find 2021 estimates. 

^3 I can’t find 2021 expected numbers for these guys. And I do not feel like digging more. These numbers are instead calculated from the Katapult investor presentation - a footnote states the multiples provided were as of market close on 12/15 - I have scaled the multiples by the stock price change since then.  [slide 42.](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf). EBITDA multiples were not provided in a way that allows this. 

I won’t even add 2022…..…..but you get the point. It’s being priced at an insane discount. Surely it must be growing more slowly? Let’s take a look at the 2020 revenue growth numbers. Again, please keep in mind the caveat that Afterpay / Affirm are based on June 2019- June 2020 #s, while the others are Jan 2020-Dec 2020. So give those guys whatever discount you think is fair or do the math I was too lazy to do :)

|Company|2020 Revenue Growth %|
:--|:--|
|**Affirm**|92%|
|**Afterpay**|97%|
|**Sezzle**|272%|
|**Klarna**|40%|
|**Katapult**|168%|

The Katapult CEO was directly asked about this valuation gap. His response says it all [(page 6):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)

&gt; I think it’s an undiscovered gem. I mean, I’ve had numerous investor calls after we made the announcement that weren’t included on the pipe. And I don’t know how many times I’ve heard it. We missed this one and we don’t know how, and we’re really excited to talk to you. So I think it’s an undiscovered gem, you know, the headlines were Affirm, the headlines were Afterpay. The headlines were, you know, Klarna. And so then, you know, we kind of sneak up and they’re like, wait a minute. This is a really good market and focused on the right market yet. They figured out how to make money at it. And so I think it just stuck up. That’s why I’m looking forward to closing the deal, changing the ticker to KPLT and having our name out there.
&gt; 
&gt; And, you know, Kristen obviously is going to help us get our name out there to investors as well. And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public. So I think it’s undervalued because one, it’s a surprise and two, you know, we got to get out there and start spreading the news. So I think once we close, you know, you’ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we’re at and Affirm, because you’re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?

In January, during the peak of the SPAC bull market, FSRV rushed to $19+ a share! At the height of that mania, here’s what the FSRV CEO Lee Einbinder had to say at a press event [(page 8-9).](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021003302/ea133671-425_finservacq.htm) And remember this was at nearly $19 a share! :

&gt; Just to frame the valuation, when we announced the deal back in December, we had priced the transaction at 14 times, 2021 EBITDA. Obviously, the stock has moved up since then. But when you look at the valuation of Katapult today, relative to peers, the peer group that we looked at, included other point of sale payment companies like an AfterPay or Sezzle, or even a PayPal or Repay that focuses on similar customers. And then Affirm, which just went public recently. And I think what stands out for Katapult is really the growth rate. The growth rate of historically 100% and going forward north of 75%.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no peers that are exhibiting that same growth rate and that are also profitable today. And that’s what really stands out. And that’s why we think the valuation is still compelling. So even as we sit here today, Katapult is trading at around 13 times next year’s EBITDA. And when you look at that, relative to some of these other companies, we’re still trading in a meaningful discount. A company like Affirm, which isn’t even profitable, I believe is trading at north of 20 times next year’s revenues. And when you look at Katapult, we’re around a 10th of that. I think we’re trading around 2.5 times next year’s revenue.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you think about the opportunity here, you’re buying Katapult, which is profitable today and will continue to be profitable in the future, at any metric you want to look at relative to Affirm, it’s sort of a 10th of the valuation and higher growth rates, it kind of doesn’t make sense to us. And I think that’s why the market is endorsing the story.

### 4.2 Sezzle is a Smaller, Up-and-Coming Potential Threat (That’s Already Valued More Highly?!)
Sezzle is an up-and-comer offering similar services to non-prime customers, with a more global vision than Katapult. They also provide services to help customers raise their credit scores. Sezzle and Target recently signed a deal: [Sezzle, Target Sign Contract For BNPL Product | PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/sezzle-target-sign-3-year-contract-bnpl-product/)

Sezzle is definitely something to keep an eye on -  for one their average return on leases is shockingly low compared to what Katapult pulls out. Katapult made $247m revenue on $201m of originations in 2020.  Sezzle made $49.6m of income on $856m of originations in 2020.  This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of Sezzle’s income, 80%, comes from merchant fees.  So the business is quite different.


Additionally, take a look at Sezzle’s offerings: [Sezzle | Highest-shopper-rated Buy Now, Pay Later solution](https://sezzle.com/stores?category=1) and look at [Katapult’s offerings](https://katapult.com/store-locator/).  There is a larger risk associated with loans for the things Sezzle sells - these are clothes, fashion goods, etc. In a recession are without a doubt going to pay off their refrigerator, laptop, bed, or tires before getting  to this stuff.

Definitely something to keep an eye on, but not a concern at this point considering **they are already at market caps** . They’re not making nearly as much revenue as the other players yet, they’re not profiting on the little they are making,

# 5. Risks
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
| No TL;DR here - you need to read the risks and understand what you are buying. |

### 5.1 Non-prime customers
There is a risk-reward curve out there for point-of-sale lending and Katapult’s customers are higher on the risk side of that. They are lending to people who can’t get approved by other companies. These other companies are not filled with idiots - they aren’t lending to these people for a reason: the risk of default is high.

Katapult is able to use their technology to lower this risk. Even they reject customers they view as too high of a risk. But their sophisticated models allow to to pick out the customers that were passed over as high risk by prime lenders, but were safe to loan to for this specific purchase. 

The  Katapult CEO was asked about this question specifically. He’s clearly put thought into the problem, and what happens to their company in a downturn. In short, they saw an **improvement**in their customer base during the COVID recession as once prime customers were turned away more and more by banks that were tightening up. On top of that, they focus on items that people are going to be damn sure they pay off - appliances, tires, furniture, etc. 

His full response was the following:
&gt; And if you think about during even the financial crisis, you know, cars did really well, right? Even subprime auto did well. And so you asked yourself why. Those are things that people need. You need your car to go back and forth to work.  And I remember my boss at what Wacovia Bank saying, “Well, and they were auto lending.” And they said, “We’ll never lend money in New York City in the boroughs.” And I was like, “Really? Why?” And they said, “Because you don’t have to have your car there.
&gt; […] And so those people tend to focus on that car is, this is my ticket to my job. I need to make sure that I don’t lose this car. And the same goes with our products. And then the durable goods products. If you look at, you know, appliances and furniture, you know, people need appliances and we actually do some auto, we do a lot of tires and tires are really interesting for us and they pay better.  
&gt; […] And when you look at the lease to own product, what happens during a recession is the prime lenders tighten up pretty dramatically. And we saw this, you know, April 15th last year, April and March last year when COVID first started happening. The prime lenders, I mean, tightened up, and then we saw a better customer. And so, for us, it kind of shifts that subprime customer up into closer to prime, because they’re not accessing, you know, credit through the prime lenders.
&gt; […] Right. So, you know, that’s why I hate to use the term subprime. I like to use the term non-prime because my population expands quite a bit during a recession, and I get a better customer. And we saw that if you looked at our vintages during the first weeks of COVID and the shutdowns that happened, and the tightening that happened, which all the banks admitted it. I mean, they all admitted they were tightening up. We saw some of our best performing portfolio during those times.

Some facts:
* The fraud rate across their entire portfolio is about 3%.
	* For reference [auto loans are at 1%.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/auto-loan-fraud-is-soaring-in-a-parallel-to-the-housing-bubble)
* They claim to be able to recover 80-90% of the lease cost on charge-offs. 


###  5.2 Merchant concentration
#### The bad
58% of KPLT’s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020, and 90% from their top 10 merchants. This is obviously a huge risk. 
#### The good 
1. This 58% number is decreasing - in 2019 it was 72% coming from Wayfair. [Proxy statement, pg 31](https://www.cstproxy.com/finservacquisition/sm2021/smproxy/images/FinServ_Acquisition_Corp-SMProxy2021.pdf)
2. The CEO is clear that they have a deal with Wayfair for the near future, and they’re actually currently working with Wayfair on integrating deeper and expanding the partnership. 
3. Though we don’t have Katapult’s 2021 Q1 earnings, **we do have Wayfairs.**  And being such a large percentage of Katapult’s current revenue means we can get a good look at how they are doing by looking at Wayfair. [Wayfair smashed earnings this quarter](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/19/wayfair-earnings-5-stellar-numbers-you-might-have/)   running the stock up 20%.  If you’re going to have merchant concentration in the early stages, Wayfair is NOT a bad place to have it.  Part of this concentration risk in the revenue #'s has to be because Wayfair just keeps growing revenue so quickly and eclipsing others.

[From the CEO:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; Yeah, I’m not worried about it because if you’re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we’re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We’re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. [….] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it’s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.

#### Most buy now pay later services have run into some version of this problem. 

Affirm’s is Peloton. Peloton comprised 30% of Affirm’s 2020 revenue [Affirm S-1 pg 26](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm#tRIFA) 

Sezzle just landed Target as a parter, and will certainly run into the same problem with Target. 

Afterpays is small enough of a % that they don’t mention it specific #'s, but they do say this ([Afterpay prospectus, pg 58](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Afterpay-Prospectus.pdf)
&gt; Although Afterpay does not currently depend on any one retail merchant for more than approximately 20% of its revenue, the Group’s business is still at a relatively early stage and retail merchant client revenue is not as diversified as it might be for a more mature business. The loss of even a small number of Afterpay’s key retail merchant clients may materially and adversely impact Afterpay’s revenue and profitability, and increase marketing expenses to sign up new retail merchant clients to replace those lost. 


#### Government regulation
At the end of the day, this is a business loaning to poorer customers with poor credit. The result is that the interest rates have to be high to make it profitable.  That being said, the “maximum cost” for an item with Katapult is still **more than double the cash price of the item**.  Having the poorest people people pay $1,300 for a $640 refrigerator is not a politically popular idea. On top of this, Democrats have traditionally been in favor of increased consumer protections, and they currently control the house, senate, and presidency. 

#### Prime lenders entering the nonprime market
Katapult benefits greatly from its partnership with Affirm. It gets to piggyback on Affirms’ exclusive partnership with Shopify, for example. It also gets to offer Affirms’ prime servers to merchants it approaches to sweeten the deal. If Affirm were to enter the non-prime market and abandon Katapult,  this would a massive negative if it were to happen before Katapult fully has time to mature. But as far as I can tell from the available information, the partnership is strong.

# 6. Summary
|**TL;DR**|
|:---:|
|Prime-customer only services skip people with poor credit  scores in order to manage their risk. In 2021, you can use tech to build a better model for that risk than a FICO credit score. And then you can profit off of the people that are safe to lend to but the FICO score missed.  Katapult does this, and extremely well - they profit now, not in 2026 - and they’re growing at well over 100% the past few years and 75%+ going forward.  Despite this, they are valued at 1/5t h to 1/10th of their peers in the space, even though these peers have not even figured out how to be profitable yet. KPLT Represents an amazing value. |


At the end of the day, Katapult is about the following: in pretty much all things in life,  and especially finance, risk and reward are intricately linked. Lenders need to be able to evaluate that risk in order to collect  an appropriately sized return. Credit scores are a popular way to do this in traditional lending. 

But they are pretty broad strokes - and massive portions of the population do not have good credit score and are written off - even though they would have been safe to lend to in a specific situation.  This misallocation of risk allows for a new lender to build an edge if they can identify it. 

Katapult is about using the new technology tools afforded to us by the internet in order to find the find the people that these broad strokes missed and to lend to them in a way that works for this class of people. 

They do this, and they do it well. They’re profitable when no one else has figured out how to be profitable in the space. At the same time, they’re not sacrificing growth, because they’re also growing as fast or faster than others in the space. I am a strong fan of the stock at this valuation. 

## Tin-foil hat theory
Completely unfounded, but just my hopes that we will get killer earnings or some new partnerships announced once the company is public. 

The CEO has sort of hinted at some things coming out after merger in the second half of 2021.The CEO was asked about why their valuation is just so low compared to competitors. Says they can’t say too much with the merger agreement.   IMO seems like he started to overspeak about things coming up, “**and we’ve got some.**.” ,paused, and pivoted to just saying that they had a really strong team.  Definitely a small pause in the video.  The full quote:

&gt; And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public.  [(~18:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DBd7vVbcl8)

Additionally, when talking about the PIPE Tiger Managements involvement with them:

&gt; So I’m hoping that they see, you know, especially once we, you know, turn the ticker symbol to KPLT and we can start talking about guidance and opportunities and everything that’s coming down our way, that they continue to be a longterm.

Staking multiple cryptos efficiently?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nu10db/staking_multiple_cryptos_efficiently/,nomeri,1,2021-06-07 09:43:01,22,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nu10db/staking_multiple_cryptos_efficiently/,MINING-STAKING,"  I bought a bunch of different cryptos on coinbase and don't really have any intention of selling them anytime soon, so I want to stake as many as I can. I'm staking everything I can on coinbase, and I moved a few to a wallet that also can stake multiple cryptos; however, I still have a list of ones that aren't being staked.

So, a few of these can be staked, but where I can stake them only lets me stake one type of crypto (at least from what I can tell anyway). Is there a wallet or other service that maybe I overlooked that can stake more than one of these at once just for my convenience? Or am I stuck with moving these individually to their own separate platform if I want to stake it? 

I could transfer them to another crypto I can stake easily, but I'd rather avoid that. Below is the list of ones I'm trying to stake as many as possible in one place. Thanks for any insight on this!

Your bank pays you a quarter percent. But some cryptos will pay you 6% or even way more for locking in funds for the “true-believers” in any particular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. If you’re not afraid of watching your token’s value fall 20% or more, then DeFi yield is your next crypto investment.  

Yield paying DeFi cryptos are one of the main reasons why cryptocurrency investors have been diversifying from Bitcoin to the alt-coin universe, led by Ethereum. But for the past year, at least, it’s also been about Algorand, which I own, because it pays 6% yield. It’s not as safe as the Global X Super Dividend (DIV) ETF, which I also own. But Algorand and other tokens are – for investors – another way to capture yield in a diversified, crypto way.

Many of these DeFi protocols (think of them as fintech startups, in layman’s terms) are for investors that have a deep knowledge of cryptocurrency, the platforms they are operating on, and can lose most of their investment without losing sleep.

In short, there are many ways DeFi projects pay their investors yield, not just through [‘yield farming’.](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-yield-farming-beginners-guide) 

**A Quick Overview and Three Picks**

DeFi is financial services running on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. DeFi tokens earn interest, allow you to borrow, lend, buy insurance, or simply trade as a speculative crypto investment.  

“Yield farming” is a reward scheme that’s taken hold in the DeFi crypto world over the last year. If you want to compare it to traditional investing, it’s like yield on a bond, or a dividend. It is arguably one of the main reasons investors who are not using Algorand, buy Algorand, among others.

Like a traditional dividend paying stock or bond, yield on DeFi tokens fluctuates depending on how these projects and exchanges roll them out. Anyone with a Coinbase account can easily discover which coins pay yield. It’s how I found Algorand.

“The focus of investors should be on the fundamentals of the project, not just the yield it pays,” says Eric Nguyen, CEO of Spores Research, and a former senior investment analyst of Elliott Management, a hedge fund with over $35 billion in assets under management. “If it is decided to hold certain project’s tokens over the long run, then exploring yield-paying systems is an option. But, deciding on coin investment purely based on the yield offered will be problematic since there are also downsides to take into account. One main issue is that annual percentage yield might be high but the staking period available is low – for example you can reach 200% APY in 15 days, assuming it’s compounded daily. In actuality your coin balance will only increase maybe 4.6% in those 15 days,” he says. 

Like traditional dividend payments, if the price per coin goes up, then the yield paid on your crypto gives you new coins and now you have more coins that are worth more money.

But DeFi yield, for traditional Wall Street investors, is a little more like C rated junk bonds. High risk, high reward, if you get the timing right and the underlying instrument is sound and serious about paying what it promises.

“DeFi is trying to imitate traditional financial service providers with a decentralized twist,” says Gil Shpirman, CEO of Don-Key.Finance. In April, Don-Key completed a private funding round to bootstrap it’s Defi social yield farming platform to the tune of [$2.2 million captured from some of the new blockchain funds ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/13/social-yield-farming-platform-don-key-locks-2-million-from-cryptos-top-players/)like Black Edge Capital in Chicago, Genesis Block Ventures in the Caymans, MoonWhale of Bangkok, and Dubai’s Morningstar Ventures, to name a few.

Just as a bank takes a deposit from a customer and pays him 1% interest and then loans that same amount out to another customer and charges 5% in interest, a decentralized protocol will do the same thing but with a “smart contract” in the middle to reduce cost and increase efficiency. Investors are paid in “rewards”, which is like yield and – depending on the project. 

“Some good examples are MakerDao, Aave and Curve,” Shpirman says.

The Maker Protocol is one of the largest decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain, and was the first DeFi application to earn significant adoption. Their DAI coin is a stable coin that basically trades in line with the dollar and pays around 2% yield. It’s one of the biggest stable coins and yield paying coins out there with a market cap of more than $4 billion.

Aave, another DeFi protocol I have been looking at to buy, defines itself as a non-custodial liquidity protocol designed for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets in crypto. If you owned DAI and you deposited it in the Aave application, you could earn 1.57% APY. Aave pay yield for collateral, but not for farming.

Curve Finance is not for beginners. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralized protocols exchange stable coins and capture some yield that way.

“You are providing your capital and getting a return on them, but this is not without risks as some of the smaller DeFi projects have suffered exploits in the past,” says Nguyen, meaning “hacks”. 

“You should pick coins where you understand the fundamentals and believe in their long-term value because the yield might not be able to cover the decrease in their value,” Nguyen says.

As this market becomes more sophisticated, and an extension of traditional Wall Street, investors who ultimately want to allocate more of their portfolio to crypto are going to need to do one of three things:

**1)**     Wing it with the main coins – Bitcoin and Ethereum, or Grayscale ETFs that hold them, should you not want to be bothered opening an account on an exchange (you should do it, anyway)

**2)**     Risk it with the DeFi coins you read about from trusted investors and other sources or;

**3)**    Go find a specialist cryptocurrency firm, open an account with them, and let them do the work. 

**Don’t Fear the Reaper**

The recent volatility in crypto, with Bitcoin struggling to get back over $40,000 and losing around $375 billion in market cap over the last three weeks, is unlikely to kill interest in DeFi investing, says Antoni Trenchev, Co-Managing Partner at Nexo, a regulated financial institution for digital assets with $4 billion under assets based in London. 

“There are so many legitimate (DeFi yield) projects out there, but I think the future belongs to those that are compliant, well-capitalized, and scalable businesses with functional products and highly professional teams,” says Trenchev, who thinks Nexo is one of them. They give their investor clients tax-efficient instant cryptocurrency credit lines, a high-yield on both crypto and fiat, send and pay capabilities, high-level crypto trading, custodial insurance and a crypto wallet called the Nexo Wallet. 

Despite some saying that a new “crypto winter” is starting, DeFi protocols built on Ethereum, for instance, produced all-time high revenues in May, according to data [compiled by The Block. ](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106858/defi-protocols-ethereum-may-revenue?utm_source=coinbase&amp;utm_medium=rss)

The total locked value of liquidity pools in yield farming DeFi projects stood at $7,977,544,158 as of this weekend.

More sophisticated trades use DeFi marketplaces like Venus to lend their coins like a bank, and receive interest, or “rewards” in the Venus coin, XVS. That coin price is up nearly 10-fold since January. Some of the higher yielding lending pools are for those lending in Polkadot (DOT). It pays around 10%.

Pancake Swap is another one for sophisticated traders. Some of the trades on Pancake Swap are like 10x leveraged bets in a traditional market. I’d avoid.

For this reason, I’m sticking with Algorand and watch my rewards pile up in my Algorand wallet. 

“If there’s one takeaway from the recent episode of market volatility, it is the reinforcement of the view that in crypto, you have to take the long-term view because, on the one-, five-, ten-year scale, it tends to outperform just about any asset,” says Trenchev. Their NEXO coin is up over 1,100% in the last 12 months.

“The space has survived and thrived because of and in spite of price declines of 30% and more, and a few times per year,” he says. “Cryptocurrencies remain the only free market left nowadays and show that an asset — such as Bitcoin — cannot be the best performer and also not be volatile. Volatility is an essential feature of high asset performance.”

"The case for why Workhorse (WKHS) may moon, UPDATED",https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nu7z8r/the_case_for_why_workhorse_wkhs_may_moon_updated/,edar29,1,2021-06-07 17:09:33,190,/r/WKHS/comments/nu7z8r/the_case_for_why_workhorse_wkhs_may_moon_updated/,NaN,"My first post received a lot of media attention so I'm posting an update.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.

2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.

3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.

4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.

5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?

6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase. 

7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.

8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.

9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:

1. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.

2. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.

10. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.

11. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.

12. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.

13. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.

14. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us. 

15. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.

16. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research. 

17. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.

18. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.

19. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.

2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.

3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.

2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.

3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.

4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.

5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

I am not a financial analyst. I am a physician with a love of finance. I do not give financial advice. This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong. You can lose all of your money on this stock or any stock for that matter. You must do your own homework and research before buying any stock. I personally love this stock and I own over 10,000 shares of it.

The case for Workhorse WKHS (Updated),https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu83cq/the_case_for_workhorse_wkhs_updated/,edar29,1,2021-06-07 17:18:23,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu83cq/the_case_for_workhorse_wkhs_updated/,DD,"My first post received a lot of media attention so I'm posting an update.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
   1. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
   2. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
10. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
11. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
12. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
13. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
14. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
15. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
16. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
17. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
18. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
19. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

&amp;#x200B;

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

&gt; And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. \[...\] So I think once we close, you know, you’ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we’re at and Affirm, because you’re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?

## Introduction and motivation

Hello and welcome to my post on FSRV / Katapult. Thanks in advance for reading. Most importantly, please feel free to step in and correct any mistakes you notice or criticize where you find appropriate. 

**I'm posting this because I have a lot of money (to me) in this and would love for people to poke holes in this company and potentially save me from losing that money :) We are all trying to help each other here.**

#### Post structure
* It's long and most people want a TL;DR.  Each section will have its own TL;DR and you can skim through all of them to get the picture, or just jump directly to the summary the very end.
* I strongly encourage you to at least skim the Katapult [investor presentation](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) before reading. But it will be referenced a lot regardless.
* This is divided up into different sections with a table of contents below. Everyone has different factors they care about in companies so I encourage you to check out what matters to you.
* This post will certainly not be perfect nor exhaustive.

#### References
* Mostly spread out throughout the post. I did list some general sources at the end, but couldn’t fit them in so they’ll be in a comment on the full post and linked to in the table of contents. 
* I will not be providing resources for easily google-able facts that are not relevant to the primary points. As an example, no source is provided for the fact that Tiger Global Management was founded in 2001 by Chase Coleman III. Just google it bro.
* I do get lazy so I probably skipped a few that I should have had, just drop a comment and I will find the source for you.

# 1. Background Information on the PIPE, SPAC Team, and Target
  **TL;DR** PIPE: The world renowned Tiger Global Management who were early investors in Facebook, Spotify,  Stripe, Coinbase, Xiaomi. Certainly the most famous of anyone / thing else on this list.

 **TL;DR** SPAC: Founded Nov 2019, before the flood of SPACs. Extremely qualified, educated group with many decades in Fintech  / on Wall Street. As an example, the CEO remarks about how well he knows /has worked often with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Board members include a former CFO of Lehman brothers and the current CEO of Icahn industries.

 **TL;DR** Target: Katapult. A Buy-now pay later service that works with online retailers. Their niche is that they target the non-prime market. We’ll (obviously) get to the details elsewhere in this post|

&gt; And the fact that we understood the risk and how to underwrite the risk and that the business was pretty solid. I think those were the things. I’m not speaking for them, but I think they saw in us some of the feedback I get from many of the investors, we were thrilled to have Tiger join us. You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.

#### Neuburger Berman

### 1.3 Target: Katapult
Founded in 2012 as Cognical doing business as “Zibbly” , with the company re-branded Katapult in November 2019.

#### Original Founders
Honestly, most of the original founders do not impress much.  To me on the outside, it reads like a few Cornell undergrads had a decent idea, got the ear of an angel investor,  and then got actual experts to design the real product.

Most importantly are the two following experts in computer science / machine learning who were founders:
	* **Ashutosh Saxena,** PhD from Stanford in Computer Science with an emphasis on artificial intelligence ]https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxenaashutosh]
	* **Pierre Sermanet,** PhD in deep learning and computer vision from New York University, researcher for Google Brain [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sermanet]
Other co-founders:
	* Andrew Hancox: Angel investor, invested in BlockFi
	* Brandon Wright, Chinedu Eleanya, Cornell undergrads at time of founding. 
	

#### Current Executive Team
**CEO Orlando Zayas**:
* CEO since 2017
*  Former VP of Emerging Markets at GE Capital

#### Number Of Employees
I can’t find this information easily.  Going purely by LinkedIn numbers, there are 101 employees. LinkedIn “Company Size” info says 51-200 employees. The careers page has 21 open positions [ [BambooHR](https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) What I can say is that if you look back at a WebArchive page of the listings from January [BambooHR](http://web.archive.org/web/20210118070621/https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) you can see there were only 13 and they were also a different set of positions.

# 2 The Deal
**TL;DR**: SPAC trust+150m PIPE = 400m. Only 8% will go to the balance sheet, with the other 92% going as cash to existing shareholders and tx fees. But, while on the higher end of the spectrum, this is pretty common. If you want to own a solid company you have to pay up. 


&gt; You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it’s after that that they made their commitment. So we’re excited to have them as a partner.

\-Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas

$250M from the SPAC trust and $150M from the PIPE will go to Katapult ([slide 45](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf))

Of this 400m, here’s where it ends up:
* $325m will be provided as cash consideration to existing shareholders. 
* $32m will go to the balance sheet
* $43m will be spent on transaction expenses

26% of the combined company will be owned by the SPAC holders. 

*Note: In reality, it’s 18m coming from he balance sheet for the deal, and 50m going to it, but I just simplified that to a 32m credit to the balance sheet here.* 

### Pros
The pro is that we get Katapult in the public markets.  We’re not getting a horrible 5% or 10% cut like some SPAC deals, 26% is decent. 
### Cons
The real con is obvious: Of the $400m in financing, $325m of it is going directly to buy out the current shareholders. Only 32/400 = 8% is going to the balance sheet to help the company! 82% of the proceeds will be going to buy out existing shareholders. 

Additionally, PIPE is getting 16% of the final company but only putting in 
 
### My take
While the exact % going to shareholders may be on the high end at 82% (but not highest end), this is the price of buying a good, profitable company with realistic growth prospects. Here are some other examples of this.

# 3 Katapult 
**TL;DR** : Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services for non-prime customers provided at checkout time for durable goods (appliances, car parts, computers, etc). They are able to make a niche here and profit due to building sophisticated models of non-prime customer behavior beyond what a traditional credit score gives. They find the ones that they can lend to, and provide a fast checkout experience to get your items, and a convenient payment mechanism that incentivizes paying the item off. 


&gt; And so I think they saw that we were clearly focused in an area that is being overlooked. It’s a green space and then we got to profitability. And so, you know, we’re driving, you know, and that’s not much, that’s not a lot of the other BNPLs can’t brag about that. And I can, but it’s been because our business is built on true fundamentals and we understand the future and we understand what’s going to happen. And so we’ve planned the business out well. 
\- Orlando Zayas

### 3.1 Business
Katapult’s business is to provide “buy now pay later” service to non-prime customers at checkout time.  They work with merchants to integrate their system into online payment portals, and at checkout customers will have the option to check out. If customers pay off the lease within 90 days, they pay only 5% plus a $45 fee. 

They also parter with prime lender Affirm. The duo provides a “waterfall” service to merchants. They claim Affirm rejects 65% of applicants at many of the merchants Affirm is with, these are passed on to Katapult and Katapult specializes in these nonprime customers and approves 60% of them [(source)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf).

### 3.2 Technology
They use a variety of inputs collected throughout the shopping experience, as well as user inputs, to build a sophisticated model of the risk provided by the customer. In a recent podcast, FinServ CEO Lee Einbinder actually potentially let slip one of their inputs that might be used to judge risk-  the way users move their mouse.  They claim to use [(slide 30)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf):
* “7 minimum user inputs”
* ~ “100 gathered user attributes”
* ~ “2,000 3rd party data elements”

In most scenarios they claim to provide ~30% better detection of “true good payers” than an existing 3rd party off the self score. [(slide 31)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)

### 3.3 Quick facts
Profitable since 2020 [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average order value is $600[(slide 25)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average return on lease has increased 40% , relative to it’s value at the end of 2018[(slide 32)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)
Average time to lease payoff is around 7 months [(page 3)](And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.)


### 3.4 Balance Sheet
Easily one of the healthier balance sheets we’ve seen in SPAC-land. The [highlights](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm): 
* After the merger they will have 32m of net debt. 
* Liquidity situation: &gt;$100m of liquidity 
* They do not foresee a need ed to take on any more debt or raise capital to achieve their targets. From the CEO [(page 3):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; …..we have a lending agreement where it’s a warehouse agreement that literally can expand up to 250 million, […] even though we did, you know, around 200 million and last year, I only used about a third of that line to fund that growth. 
&gt; 
&gt; And so I think that’s going to continue. We’ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don’t need, you know, additional capital.

### 3.5 Financials and Growth
Revenue in 2020 was 247m. Revenue Growth for 2018-2020 has been at about 140% YoY [(slide 12)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm) on average. Going forward, they’re expecting  upwards of 75% for the next few years before beginning to taper off to ‘only’ in the 40%s YoY [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) This equates to about $1,130 in expected revenue in 2022 (not 2026  or something insane!),.

EBITDA / Profit  for 2020 was 41m EBITDA and 23m net profit . For 2021, they expect EBITDA growth of 114% to 70m before, like the revenue, tapering to “only” 43% EBITDA growth in 2022 for 216m revenue. 

The CEO is clear that they are focused on what is working and not getting sidetracked, at least for the near term [(page 4)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; **Speaker 2:** ….There’s enough headroom for us to grow just in buy now, pay later, and then maybe we’ll introduce a checking account or something like that a little bit later, or where would you say you’re seeing your growth? Is it BNPL or is it more let’s go into other things?
&gt; **Orlando Zayas (CEO):**  You know, near term, and that’s in the next two to three years, I would say definitely staying in the BNPL space. You know, as we grow our portfolio of consumers and you’re right now, we’ve approved over 1.5 million consumers for shopping, you know, we’ve done over 500,000 leases. And so as we grow that base, I think there’s going to be a lot of opportunity to, you know, do things like checking accounts and other things, because, you know, we’re going to have a much different perspective about that consumer. It’s not going to be FICO driven.

# 4. The Competition and Their Valuations
**TL;DR**: There is a lot of competition in BNPL - Katapult sidesteps all of this by only going for the customers that the other players reject. They have figured out how to profit off of this group and are doing extremely well. Their public peers in BNPL - even the ones that sort of look at that non-prime space - are trading at levels 5-10 times higher than Katapult on a revenue/earnings adjusted basis. The value is insanely cheap compared to the other players. 

### 4.1 There is a lot of competition in the Buy Now Pay Later space. There is (almost) no competition in the non-prime Buy Now Pay Later space.
Buy now pay later companies are growing like weeds. Here is a short list of public ones:
* Affirm
* PayPal
* Afterpay
* Sezzle

And private ones:
* Klarna (The king in the space)
* QuadPay
* SplitIt
the list goes on and on…by the time you read this there are probably two more.

But these are almost all going for **prime customers**. They use traditional factors like your credit score, along with more modern ones, to accept or decline a customer. In Katapult’s investor presentation, they state that Affirm declines **up to 65% of the people who apply**.  Even if this number is traditionally lower - it’s an insane group. FSRV CEO Einbinder says he thinks the number is something like **40-45% r**ejected in the podcast in the References section. It’s a huge number - and Katapult has the field all to itself, as long as it can find out how to profit off of them when others passed on the opportunity. And without a doubt, the answer to that question is that they have. 

### 4.2 Katapult’s Post-Merger Valuation Will Be Shockingly Low Compared to Public and Private Peers
Comparing the companies as a function of their valuation divided by their market cap shows a clear trend…except for Katapult?

|Company |Market Cap|2020 Rev|M Cap / 2020 Rev|2020 EBITDA|M Cap / 2020 EBITDA|

The situation gets remains when you look at the projected 2021 numbers (Not 2026 or something, 2021, which is over in 6 months…) .

|Company |Market Cap|2021 Rev|M Cap / 2021 Rev|2021 EBITDA|M Cap / 2021 EBITDA|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Affirm^1**|15.8b|770m|20.5x|-125m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|
|**Afterpay^(1,3)**|21.3b|-|25.7x|-|-|
|**Sezzle^3**|1.36b|-|12.73x|-|-|
|**Klarna^2**|31b|-|-|-|-|
|**Katapult**|1.33b|455m|2.92x|S|19x|


^1 Affirm and Afterpays’ fiscal years end in June . So this revenue data is technically shifted back in time by 6 months, but their Market Cap is current. The effect is that this is a little unfair to these companies - their M Cap / Rev #s should a bit lower. But you get the order of magnitude here. I thought about calculating it on a Jan-Dec basis but gave up when I couldn't find 2022E (For July-Dec 2021) numbers easily.

^2 Klarna is a private company. [Market cap /valuation estimate.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/) I can’t find 2021 estimates. 

^3 I can’t find 2021 expected numbers for these guys. And I do not feel like digging more. These numbers are instead calculated from the Katapult investor presentation - a footnote states the multiples provided were as of market close on 12/15 - I have scaled the multiples by the stock price change since then.  [slide 42.](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf). EBITDA multiples were not provided in a way that allows this. 

I won’t even add 2022…..…..but you get the point. It’s being priced at an insane discount. Surely it must be growing more slowly? Let’s take a look at the 2020 revenue growth numbers. Again, please keep in mind the caveat that Afterpay / Affirm are based on June 2019- June 2020 #s, while the others are Jan 2020-Dec 2020. So give those guys whatever discount you think is fair or do the math I was too lazy to do :)

|Company|2020 Revenue Growth %|
:--|:--|
|**Affirm**|92%|
|**Afterpay**|97%|
|**Sezzle**|272%|
|**Klarna**|40%|
|**Katapult**|168%|

The Katapult CEO was directly asked about this valuation gap. His response says it all [(page 6):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)

&gt; I think it’s an undiscovered gem. I mean, I’ve had numerous investor calls after we made the announcement that weren’t included on the pipe. And I don’t know how many times I’ve heard it. We missed this one and we don’t know how, and we’re really excited to talk to you. So I think it’s an undiscovered gem, you know, the headlines were Affirm, the headlines were Afterpay. The headlines were, you know, Klarna. And so then, you know, we kind of sneak up and they’re like, wait a minute. This is a really good market and focused on the right market yet. They figured out how to make money at it. And so I think it just stuck up. That’s why I’m looking forward to closing the deal, changing the ticker to KPLT and having our name out there.
&gt; 
&gt; And, you know, Kristen obviously is going to help us get our name out there to investors as well. And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public. So I think it’s undervalued because one, it’s a surprise and two, you know, we got to get out there and start spreading the news. So I think once we close, you know, you’ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we’re at and Affirm, because you’re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?

In January, during the peak of the SPAC bull market, FSRV rushed to $19+ a share! At the height of that mania, here’s what the FSRV CEO Lee Einbinder had to say at a press event [(page 8-9).](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021003302/ea133671-425_finservacq.htm) And remember this was at nearly $19 a share! :

&gt; Just to frame the valuation, when we announced the deal back in December, we had priced the transaction at 14 times, 2021 EBITDA. Obviously, the stock has moved up since then. But when you look at the valuation of Katapult today, relative to peers, the peer group that we looked at, included other point of sale payment companies like an AfterPay or Sezzle, or even a PayPal or Repay that focuses on similar customers. And then Affirm, which just went public recently. And I think what stands out for Katapult is really the growth rate. The growth rate of historically 100% and going forward north of 75%.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no peers that are exhibiting that same growth rate and that are also profitable today. And that’s what really stands out. And that’s why we think the valuation is still compelling. So even as we sit here today, Katapult is trading at around 13 times next year’s EBITDA. And when you look at that, relative to some of these other companies, we’re still trading in a meaningful discount. A company like Affirm, which isn’t even profitable, I believe is trading at north of 20 times next year’s revenues. And when you look at Katapult, we’re around a 10th of that. I think we’re trading around 2.5 times next year’s revenue.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you think about the opportunity here, you’re buying Katapult, which is profitable today and will continue to be profitable in the future, at any metric you want to look at relative to Affirm, it’s sort of a 10th of the valuation and higher growth rates, it kind of doesn’t make sense to us. And I think that’s why the market is endorsing the story.

### 4.2 Sezzle is a Smaller, Up-and-Coming Potential Threat (That’s Already Valued More Highly?!)
Sezzle is an up-and-comer offering similar services to non-prime customers, with a more global vision than Katapult. They also provide services to help customers raise their credit scores. Sezzle and Target recently signed a deal: [Sezzle, Target Sign Contract For BNPL Product | PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/sezzle-target-sign-3-year-contract-bnpl-product/)

Sezzle is definitely something to keep an eye on -  for one their average return on leases is shockingly low compared to what Katapult pulls out. Katapult made $247m revenue on $201m of originations in 2020.  Sezzle made $49.6m of income on $856m of originations in 2020.  This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of Sezzle’s income, 80%, comes from merchant fees.  So the business is quite different.


Additionally, take a look at Sezzle’s offerings: [Sezzle | Highest-shopper-rated Buy Now, Pay Later solution](https://sezzle.com/stores?category=1) and look at [Katapult’s offerings](https://katapult.com/store-locator/).  There is a larger risk associated with loans for the things Sezzle sells - these are clothes, fashion goods, etc. In a recession are without a doubt going to pay off their refrigerator, laptop, bed, or tires before getting  to this stuff.

Definitely something to keep an eye on, but not a concern at this point considering **they are already at market caps** . They’re not making nearly as much revenue as the other players yet, they’re not profiting on the little they are making,

# 5. Risks
**TL;DR**: No TL;DR here - you need to read the risks and understand what you are buying. 

### 5.1 Non-prime customers
There is a risk-reward curve out there for point-of-sale lending and Katapult’s customers are higher on the risk side of that. They are lending to people who can’t get approved by other companies. These other companies are not filled with idiots - they aren’t lending to these people for a reason: the risk of default is high.

Katapult is able to use their technology to lower this risk. Even they reject customers they view as too high of a risk. But their sophisticated models allow to to pick out the customers that were passed over as high risk by prime lenders, but were safe to loan to for this specific purchase. 

The  Katapult CEO was asked about this question specifically. He’s clearly put thought into the problem, and what happens to their company in a downturn. In short, they saw an **improvement**in their customer base during the COVID recession as once prime customers were turned away more and more by banks that were tightening up. On top of that, they focus on items that people are going to be damn sure they pay off - appliances, tires, furniture, etc. 

His full response was the following:
&gt; And if you think about during even the financial crisis, you know, cars did really well, right? Even subprime auto did well. And so you asked yourself why. Those are things that people need. You need your car to go back and forth to work.  And I remember my boss at what Wacovia Bank saying, “Well, and they were auto lending.” And they said, “We’ll never lend money in New York City in the boroughs.” And I was like, “Really? Why?” And they said, “Because you don’t have to have your car there.
&gt; […] And so those people tend to focus on that car is, this is my ticket to my job. I need to make sure that I don’t lose this car. And the same goes with our products. And then the durable goods products. If you look at, you know, appliances and furniture, you know, people need appliances and we actually do some auto, we do a lot of tires and tires are really interesting for us and they pay better.  
&gt; […] And when you look at the lease to own product, what happens during a recession is the prime lenders tighten up pretty dramatically. And we saw this, you know, April 15th last year, April and March last year when COVID first started happening. The prime lenders, I mean, tightened up, and then we saw a better customer. And so, for us, it kind of shifts that subprime customer up into closer to prime, because they’re not accessing, you know, credit through the prime lenders.
&gt; […] Right. So, you know, that’s why I hate to use the term subprime. I like to use the term non-prime because my population expands quite a bit during a recession, and I get a better customer. And we saw that if you looked at our vintages during the first weeks of COVID and the shutdowns that happened, and the tightening that happened, which all the banks admitted it. I mean, they all admitted they were tightening up. We saw some of our best performing portfolio during those times.

Some facts:
* The fraud rate across their entire portfolio is about 3%.
	* For reference [auto loans are at 1%.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/auto-loan-fraud-is-soaring-in-a-parallel-to-the-housing-bubble)
* They claim to be able to recover 80-90% of the lease cost on charge-offs. 


###  5.2 Merchant concentration
#### The bad
58% of KPLT’s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020, and 90% from their top 10 merchants. This is obviously a huge risk. 
#### The good 
1. This 58% number is decreasing - in 2019 it was 72% coming from Wayfair. [Proxy statement, pg 31](https://www.cstproxy.com/finservacquisition/sm2021/smproxy/images/FinServ_Acquisition_Corp-SMProxy2021.pdf)
2. The CEO is clear that they have a deal with Wayfair for the near future, and they’re actually currently working with Wayfair on integrating deeper and expanding the partnership. 
3. Though we don’t have Katapult’s 2021 Q1 earnings, **we do have Wayfairs.**  And being such a large percentage of Katapult’s current revenue means we can get a good look at how they are doing by looking at Wayfair. [Wayfair smashed earnings this quarter](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/19/wayfair-earnings-5-stellar-numbers-you-might-have/)   running the stock up 20%.  If you’re going to have merchant concentration in the early stages, Wayfair is NOT a bad place to have it.  Part of this concentration risk in the revenue #'s has to be because Wayfair just keeps growing revenue so quickly and eclipsing others.

[From the CEO:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)
&gt; Yeah, I’m not worried about it because if you’re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we’re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We’re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. [….] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it’s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.

#### Most buy now pay later services have run into some version of this problem. 

Affirm’s is Peloton. Peloton comprised 30% of Affirm’s 2020 revenue [Affirm S-1 pg 26](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm#tRIFA) 

Sezzle just landed Target as a parter, and will certainly run into the same problem with Target. 

Afterpays is small enough of a % that they don’t mention it specific #'s, but they do say this ([Afterpay prospectus, pg 58](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Afterpay-Prospectus.pdf)
&gt; Although Afterpay does not currently depend on any one retail merchant for more than approximately 20% of its revenue, the Group’s business is still at a relatively early stage and retail merchant client revenue is not as diversified as it might be for a more mature business. The loss of even a small number of Afterpay’s key retail merchant clients may materially and adversely impact Afterpay’s revenue and profitability, and increase marketing expenses to sign up new retail merchant clients to replace those lost. 


#### Government regulation
At the end of the day, this is a business loaning to poorer customers with poor credit. The result is that the interest rates have to be high to make it profitable.  That being said, the “maximum cost” for an item with Katapult is still **more than double the cash price of the item**.  Having the poorest people people pay $1,300 for a $640 refrigerator is not a politically popular idea. On top of this, Democrats have traditionally been in favor of increased consumer protections, and they currently control the house, senate, and presidency. 

#### Prime lenders entering the nonprime market
Katapult benefits greatly from its partnership with Affirm. It gets to piggyback on Affirms’ exclusive partnership with Shopify, for example. It also gets to offer Affirms’ prime servers to merchants it approaches to sweeten the deal. If Affirm were to enter the non-prime market and abandon Katapult,  this would a massive negative if it were to happen before Katapult fully has time to mature. But as far as I can tell from the available information, the partnership is strong. 


____

# 6. Summary
**TL;DR**: Prime-customer only services skip people with poor credit  scores in order to manage their risk. In 2021, you can use tech to build a better model for that risk than a FICO credit score. And then you can profit off of the people that are safe to lend to but the FICO score missed.  Katapult does this, and extremely well - they profit now, not in 2026 - and they’re growing at well over 100% the past few years and 75%+ going forward.  Despite this, they are valued at 1/5t h to 1/10th of their peers in the space, even though these peers have not even figured out how to be profitable yet. KPLT Represents an amazing value. 


At the end of the day, Katapult is about the following: in pretty much all things in life,  and especially finance, risk and reward are intricately linked. Lenders need to be able to evaluate that risk in order to collect  an appropriately sized return. Credit scores are a popular way to do this in traditional lending. 

But they are pretty broad strokes - and massive portions of the population do not have good credit score and are written off - even though they would have been safe to lend to in a specific situation.  This misallocation of risk allows for a new lender to build an edge if they can identify it. 

Katapult is about using the new technology tools afforded to us by the internet in order to find the find the people that these broad strokes missed and to lend to them in a way that works for this class of people. 

They do this, and they do it well. They’re profitable when no one else has figured out how to be profitable in the space. At the same time, they’re not sacrificing growth, because they’re also growing as fast or faster than others in the space. I am a strong fan of the stock at this valuation. 

## Tin-foil hat theory
Completely unfounded, but just my hopes that we will get killer earnings or some new partnerships announced once the company is public. 

The CEO has sort of hinted at some things coming out after merger in the second half of 2021.The CEO was asked about why their valuation is just so low compared to competitors. Says they can’t say too much with the merger agreement.   IMO seems like he started to overspeak about things coming up, “**and we’ve got some.**.” ,paused, and pivoted to just saying that they had a really strong team.  Definitely a small pause in the video.  The full quote:

&gt; And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you’re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we’ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we’ve added to even recently because we’re going public.  [(~18:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DBd7vVbcl8)

Additionally, when talking about the PIPE Tiger Managements involvement with them:

&gt; So I’m hoping that they see, you know, especially once we, you know, turn the ticker symbol to KPLT and we can start talking about guidance and opportunities and everything that’s coming down our way, that they continue to be a longterm. 


But this last bit is just wishful thinking / conspiracies :) The company is good regardless. Thanks for reading!

In a land scarce Singapore, putting money in Real Estate is a non-productive and inflationary way to make individual gains at the cost of societal welfare.  


However I also think it is an unfortunately necessary evil.  


We should clarify why it is non-productive first. There are two kinds of capital, productive and rent seeking.  


Productive Capital are the investments that lead to the development or acquisition of assets, technologies or skills that allow new or more efficient/profitable methods of production/marketing of goods or services. Whether these new methods or goods/services are beneficial or not is another argument, but ultimately they are additions and alterations to the whole of economic activity, and under the reasoned guidance of government, it will probably work out to everyone's benefit.   


Rent Seeking Capital are investments that seek to extract monies by purchasing control of a particular element of an existing method of production, which is often a indispensable part of economy, such as land or water rights. These investments do not add to the overall economic activity, but instead extract out a sum that inevitably gets passed on, adding inefficiency and higher costs to the overall economy.  


All investments are a mix of both, depending on the circumstances. However in Singapore, Real Estate investments, especially REITS, private property and overpriced HDBS intended to rent to foreigners/PRs, are explicitly Rent Seeking. Take an industrial building for example, as private property investments pour into surrounding area, the land price of building's owner increases and the owner must pass on the opportunity cost of not selling to their tenants in the form of higher rents, which to the extent that they are small businesses, will pass on that cost as higher prices in their products. If the owner does sell however, the new owner will probably also charge higher rents to recoup their investment. If the land appreciation + rent increases are only local, the tenants may choose to go elsewhere if possible, but if it is a Singapore wide phenomenon, then must either pass on the rent fees or move overseas. For some businesses it is possible, but for essential local services like F&amp;B it is impossible. Unsurprisingly F&amp;B outlets suffer the most outrageous rental arrangements.  


Real Estate Investment is also inflationary, in that it increases the price of goods without adding equal value. From a supply and demand POV, this effect is obvious. Singapore's real (or politically motivated) scarcity of land creates a near vertical supply curve, where higher prices don't increase price by much. Hence when demand increases, the price increases without much change in supply. However this goes a lot further than land prices alone, as most essential goods are linked to price. Housing Rents (or Mortgage payments) is the most obvious, and Dine in Food because of passed on Mall Rental Fees. Export manufacturing goods/services must also work in rental costs into their export price, as well as the housing costs of their workers as a part of salary costs. Many goods contain a passed on land-rental fees. Given that Singapore is an international facing economy, uncompetitive export prices (and comparatively competitive import prices) due to inflation is especially dangerous.  


The worst thing is that this inflationary non-competitiveness is entirely artificial and 'unnecessary' because most of it arises from demand driven inflation due to Singaporean investment money not wanting to go anywhere else.  


However I think that unless Index Funds, Crypto or other investment alternatives gain the appeal and safety of real estate, this situation of Singaporeans constantly pouring their excess cash into real estate investments is a situation that can't be helped.  


The problem is that many Singaporeans with money to invest aren't especially suited to earning money from productive capital.   


Singaporean PMETs, as overworked as they are, don't really have the bandwidth to start a business on the side. The wealthiest PMETs also work for governments and foreign MNCs/GLCs, the former of which doesn't exactly prepare one to jumpstart a SME, the latter of which utilising (due to their size) too complex of production methods to mimic on an SME scale with individual investment. This is also not considering the more technical positions where productive techniques are acquired are often filled by foreign talent due to our labor policy of prioritizing technical skill in foreign migrants.  


Our local SME capitalists aren't in that good of a situation either, as preferential tax policy towards foreign MNCs has priced alot of them out from major productive sectors, leaving only subsidiary/supplier roles and the odd niches where MNCs don't find profitable enough. The profit margins there are often not enough to be worth the investment, especially the opportunity cost investment of PMETs that are used to drawing Gov/GLC/MNC salaries.  


We lack the time, energy and technical competencies to delve head first into productive capital and get our ROIs from jumpstarting our own business and going through the pains of producing, marketing and selling our own product. A tiring and dangerous affair scarcely worth the possibly meager returns.

In light of this, ""passive"" forms of income investment are more preferable, as they allow safe, steady and predictable returns on investment to take place concurrently with full time employment in lucrative positions. The king of this is real estate, with more ""active"" property management being less preferable, and more ""passive"" forms like REITS being more preferable.  


This is because the inescapable fact is that people grow old and become less employable, and the wage and lifestyle commanded previously by PMETs undergoes severe risk upon retirement. In the absence of their own business or strong filial contributions by one's children, the risk of destitution exists for the retired middle class.  


Stocks and other investment assets do exist, however they are exposed at least symbolically to the risk of sudden crashes, always fresh in the memory of anyone whose family member was affected by an economic crisis.   


CPF also exists, however as a cash based account, it is also vulnerable to inflation that exceeds its interest earned. The same goes for all other cash based savings, or variations of it.  


So that leaves Real Estate as the only asset that is confirmed to always at least keep pace with inflation, whilst also providing regular passive and retirement proof income streams in the form of rents or REITS dividends.  


What is achieve is individual safety, the cost is societal detriment. The worst being borne on the next generation that must suffer directly from higher rents, choose to have less children as a result of the resultant smaller disposable income/less time away from working to pay rent.   


This shrinking population effect should mean a demand side fall on rents and real estate prices, but since that would endanger too many retirements, it is likely that a politically motivated supply restriction on land/buildings will be engaged to maintain prices. This leading overall to a shrinking and less vibrant economy.  


This is ironic because as an Asian Society, we used to invest heavily in our children as a means to secure our retirement, financing them to have more children to broaden the base and better secure the silver years of the most elder. This is a form of productive capital investment. However as filial piety declines as a reliable route for retirement (for many reasons), the resultant retirement funds capital flight into rent seeking real estates achieves the opposite effect, increasing rents/housing prices and making it more difficult to have children.  


So it seems the solution is to have children and finance those children to have more children, but really how many of us can safely count on our children being their for our later years? How many families remain with the moral and emotional core that can sustain this kind of arrangement?"

The case for W*rkh*rse,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcs0z/the_case_for_wrkhrse/,edar29,1,2021-06-09 03:54:20,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcs0z/the_case_for_wrkhrse/,DD,"My first post received a lot of media attention so I'm posting an update.

Allow me to summarize:

1. W\*rkh\*rse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. W\*rkh\*rse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. They have a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. They have developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and they are set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, they more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Their main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
   1. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, they now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
      1. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so their capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
10. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. W\*rkh\*rse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
11. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
12. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which they were invested in.
13. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
14. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean they will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, they may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to their competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance they will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
15. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
16. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked them. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
17. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
18. The stock price was about 30% of its 52-week high when this was first written.  Mods preventing this post so it's higher now.
19. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

&amp;#x200B;

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. W\*rkh\*rse is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. W\*rkh\*rse is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. Their fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

Supplying the Demand and Quanting Even More - 6/8/21 Analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvgslf/supplying_the_demand_and_quanting_even_more_6821/,myplayprofile,1,2021-06-09 06:44:55,81,/r/Superstonk/comments/nvgslf/supplying_the_demand_and_quanting_even_more_6821/,DD 👨‍🔬,"It's time to get back to basics, ECON 101. All prices are subject to supply and demand, and at the most basic level, this is taught in economics as a supply and demand curve where the optimal price for something is where the most buyers (demand) and most sellers (supply) are available. These same concepts apply to GME, and using the historical data of price and volume, I've made a model showing this supply and demand and there's some pretty intriguing information that's hidden in the data. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before getting to the tea, lets review what a standard supply-demand curve looks like from ECON 101 - 

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""Equilibrium\\"" price P at quantity Q supplied](https://preview.redd.it/93urqzxt44471.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5406abad42d1a2a89eb0503cf8644ffad3f74e98)

What does this mean? In the simplest terms, the quantity of a product supplied by sellers increases up and to the right as prices rise. The quantity of a good buyers are willing to buy (demand) increases as prices decline, shown by the line moving down and to the right. The equilibrium price is the natural price the good will ultimately end up selling at based on the intersection of the supply and demand lines where seller are willing to supply q to meet the demand buyers have at q.

&amp;#x200B;

This concept can be applied real time to stocks, but the supply and demand curve never will look as clean as shown above because things get complicated in the real world. However, with the historical pricing data that shows price and volume of trades at a given price, you can start making your own supply and demand curves at home! Seems useful, and spoiler alert, it is.

&amp;#x200B;

For the purpose of the post to present the data as clean and concise as possible, here are some adjustments I've made to my models - 

1. The models start using price data from 1/22/21 until today, and utilize closing prices and volume from yahoo finance - [LINK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME). 1/22 was the highest volume trading day in GME's history, and is used as a reference.
2. The volume information has been ""normalized"" by dividing the daily trade volume by the highest volume day seen on 1/22. This returns a value of 1 for volume on 1/22, and a percentage of 1 for all other days. This will make sense once you start viewing the charts.
3. I have assumed ""demand"" volume is simply based on the volume of the trading days.
4. I have assumed ""supply"" is 1 - normalized trade volume. The most supply ever made available to the market was on 1/22 as each trade in theory needs a buyer and seller. Think of this value as the remaining ""supply"" left at the end of the trading day.
5. I have flipped the quantity and price axis in my analysis to not only help present the data, but also drive home the point price is what drives the volume in a short squeeze scenario, rather than price being driven by volume.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, lets takes a look at what GME's modeled demand curve looks like - 

[Modeled GME stock demand; Vertical Axis value 1 = 1\/22 trade volume 197 million share](https://preview.redd.it/df6awqmf94471.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a41e99f4bb2d213eaf3d5bac390b09a26608e8)

Well, the model shows demand typically moves down and to the right, until we reach that tricky $300/share level that results in really interesting things happening, like the internet going down today, 3/10 50% loss in share price in 10 minutes, or straight up buying restrictions on GME like in Jan. This model is showing that instead of going demand for GME shares going to 0 after 300 like typically would be expected with rising prices - **THE DEMAND FOR GME SHARES BEGINS TO RISE EXPONENTIALLY AFTER $300!!!**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, demand is just one part of the supply/demand balance, we still need the supply piece, so what does that look like?

[GME Modeled Stock \\""Supply\\"". Amount supplied = \(1 - \\""normalized demand\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/vvj5dp72b4471.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1802ac52fb1a9095d1f87fbc27793637ee6e27f)

So from the start of the chart, again, an the supply of GME stock shows an ""upward"" and to the right movement, signifying more supply will show up as prices rise. However, again, something really interesting is happening after $300/share price for GME. It seems the supply of GME shares actually begins to dry up, and liquidity drops off a cliff after the $300 mark. Now, with both of these models, they are in no way perfect, and subject to some pretty big deviations from the model line, but I think this is mostly a result from some of the noise added to the model during the initial Jan squeeze and the second squeeze in Feb with the legend u/DeepFuckingValue doubled down. Happy birthday Sir! I didn't adjust or remove any of this data because I wanted to present the raw pricing and let you use your own discretion and critical thinking if this can be relied on.

&amp;#x200B;

To pull this all together, I present the ultimate model of the GME Supply-Demand curves - 

&amp;#x200B;

[Triangles - Price; Black - Supply Curve; Red -Demand Curve](https://preview.redd.it/ndth21pic4471.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdcdf95c068484c3b0e3276c3c6f966d1ac9e538)

&amp;#x200B;

I have highlighted today's close in the larger yellow triangle. It appears now there is some math behind the idea the $300 mark is the event horizon of the financial black hole GME short position created, as after that point Demand for GME begins to skyrocket and supply of GME shares becomes non existent. This is not financial advise. Diamonds are not formed without extreme pressure. **The ALGOs NEED the supply curve to turn into the type of curve they have been programmed for where rising prices result in more supply.** 💎🖐 ruins any and all algorithmic/rules based trading that use classical economics to drive the trading.

&amp;#x200B;

Final note, I made an OPINION post speculating on how we may be on the verge of not just a GME infinity squeeze, but also an infinity squeeze of the GME digital currency that may or may not be announced tomorrow.

This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

--------------------------

Highest shorted stock and a small cap stock what else can I say. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.

The FBI’s breach of a bitcoin wallet held by the cyber criminals who attacked Colonial Pipeline is all about sloppy storage, and not a reflection of a security vulnerability in the cryptocurrency, crypto experts told CNBC.

“Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful, tools we have,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco in a statement on Monday.

ARTICLE:

The FBI’s breach of a bitcoin wallet held by the cyber criminals who attacked Colonial Pipeline is all about sloppy storage, and not a reflection of a security vulnerability in the digital currency, crypto experts told CNBC.

On Monday, the Justice Department reported a successful mission to retrieve $2.3 million in bitcoin paid by Colonial Pipeline to ransomware hackers in April. Court documents indicated that investigators traced bitcoin transaction records to a digital wallet, which they subsequently seized under court order. Officials were then able to access that wallet with something called a “private key,” or password. 


It remains unclear how exactly the FBI retrieved the key. 

“I don’t want to give up our tradecraft in case we want to use this again for future endeavors,” Elvis Chan, an assistant special agent with the FBI’s San Francisco office, said in a news call Monday.

How the FBI likely seized bitcoin

Until the FBI is more transparent with its methods, it’s not possible to know exactly how federal investigators managed to retrieve the private key in question. But there are a few possible scenarios. 

DarkSide, the cyber criminal gang that targeted Colonial, reportedly used a payment server to collect the funds. A centralized platform like this is relatively easy for the FBI to track. 

“Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful, tools we have,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco in a statement on Monday.


“Because these transnational, organized criminal groups are facilitating these payments in cryptocurrency, and because of the transparency and traceability that cryptocurrency provides, you can actually more effectively follow the money and potentially mitigate and arrest illicit activity within this ecosystem, than you can with traditional finance and fiat currencies and payments,” explained Jesse Spiro, Global Head of Policy for Chainalysis, a company that provides blockchain forensic and investigative services to private sector companies, including crypto exchanges.

When a ransomware-related payment is made, Chainalysis is actually able to produce and generate what Spiro characterizes as “unprecedented intelligence and information in relation to the supply chain.”

Chainalysis was not able to speak to any specifics on the Colonial investigation.

Once the FBI had that wallet in hand, it’s extremely unlikely they broke something called the “Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm,” which is how the digital currency ensures that bitcoin can only be spent by the rightful owner.

“In fact, that is so far-fetched, as to be impossible,” said Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures.

What’s much more likely, according to Carter, is that they were able to access a server where the hackers stored private key information. That points not to any fundamental flaw in bitcoin’s security, but rather a case of bad IT hygiene for a criminal organization. 

Just take the 2014 hack of Mt. Gox, once the leading bitcoin exchange. It was the first high-profile hack in cryptocurrency history. The exchange filed for bankruptcy and lost 750,000 of its users’ bitcoins, plus 100,000 of its own. 

“Bitcoin itself functioned perfectly, but what functioned imperfectly was their system of storing your private keys,” explained Carter.

This is why some cyber criminals take their coins offline to cold storage, in order to insulate nefariously earned tokens from the government and law enforcement. 

“If you want to store your coins truly outside of the reach of the state, you can just hold those private keys directly. That’s the equivalent of burying a bar of gold in your backyard,” said Carter.  

Setting a good precedent

One former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission thinks the FBI breaking into the crypto wallet of a cyber criminal actually sets a good precedent for acceptance of cryptocurrency. 

“It proves that the bitcoin blockchain is not hostile ground for law enforcement,” said Chris Giancarlo. “It proves that it is not a perfect tool for criminal activity.”

Mati Greenspan, portfolio manager and Quantum Economics founder, agrees that the breach bodes well for bitcoin. 

″Many market participants, myself included, were expecting President Joe Biden to use crypto as a scapegoat for the hack and to come out with crushing reforms,” said Greenspan. “Instead, they were clued in to what we already knew: That it is easier for authorities to catch criminals who use crypto than anything else.”

Carter also appeared unfazed. “We’ve seen these kinds of seizures before, and I’m sure we’ll continue to.”

Despite the common stereotype, there’s no data to indicate that criminals disproportionately use cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. In fact, Chainalysis estimates that less than 1% of cryptos are used for illicit purposes.

Math Black Magic and Why It is Mathematically Impossible for Hedgies to Unfuk Themselves,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvkpas/math_black_magic_and_why_it_is_mathematically/,nydus_erdos,1,2021-06-09 10:08:11,0,/r/Superstonk/comments/nvkpas/math_black_magic_and_why_it_is_mathematically/,DD 👨‍🔬,"\# A. What I Hope to Prove

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that hedgies are indeed mathematically fucked, in that they have naked shorted \*\*AT LEAST\*\* the same amount of shares outstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

\# B. What I Attempt to Find

&amp;#x200B;

These are not topics I intend to prove, just theories I'd like to explore. I attempt to:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Try to guess hedgies' original trading algorithm and how apes fucked it up.

&amp;#x200B;

2. See if there's any link among the strange behavior of the exponential and logarithmic charts, the progressively weaker short attacks and the Pareto Principle.

&amp;#x200B;

3. \*\*Derive an equation that estimates total shares shorted in order to make more accurate estimates of short interest.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\# C. Primary Sources

\## Finnerty's Paper

&amp;#x200B;

u/atobitt's \[H.O.C. III\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house\_of\_cards\_part\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/)) mentions an \[academic paper\]([https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf)) titled \*""Short Selling, Death Spiral Convertibles, and the Profitability of Stock Manipulation""\* written March 2005 by John D. Finnerty, a finance professor.

&amp;#x200B;

In the paper, he lays out a model to examine naked short selling. In particular, he demonstrates that in order \*\*to drive a firms price very close to zero, a manipulator MUST naked short AT LEAST the same number of shares as there are shares outstanding, doubling the float.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## Pareto Principle

u/sososhibby posted \[a comment\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm3mtr/relevant\_af/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm3mtr/relevant_af/)) mentioning a couple things:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Pareto principle is 80 percent consequences from 20 percent of causes aka 80/20 rule.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;In this case you could drop price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need another 80 percent of shares shorted to drop the price the extra 20 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;TLDR Finnerty formula = Over time, it takes exponentially more shorts to drop the same delta in price.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;This explains how they were able to drop price down to 40 dollars, but haven't been able to get it back to there...They couldn't get the price to drop like that because they were too far the distribution curve to possibly generate a price drop like that...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;...makes so much fucking sense...why the log scale price chart fits the exponential curve. Basically, the log chart represents distance in deltas...Some part of the supply demand chain needs to get fucked up for the log chart to fit an exponential curve. This exponential increase in necessary naked shorts to drive price action explains that.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Charts

&amp;#x200B;

u/JTH1 discovered the equations of the \[exponential &amp; log charts\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvcwn5/0608\_update\_slightly\_more\_pimped\_gme\_exponential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvcwn5/0608_update_slightly_more_pimped_gme_exponential/)). The charts showed the curves were acting as a floor in both cases and fit each other, which is very strange.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# D. Market Rundown

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, Finnerty's paper is a thing of logical and \[mathematical beauty\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty)). He took a very complex system and expressed it elegantly and simply. As a math ape, it literally brought a tear to my eye when I finally understood it. I'd highly recommend it to any other math apes.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*However\*\*, I know most people and apes have a...\*strained\* relationship with math, \*\*so I read all 73 pages of the paper so you don't have to!\*\* I try to lay out his model as concisely as possible as to who the participants are and how the market behaves.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Market Participants

&amp;#x200B;

\### Informed Investor

\- Informed investors do short sell, but do not engage in abusive or naked short selling. They locate, borrow and return shares on time.

\- The informed investor has information advantage. They know if the true intrinsic value is high \*(H)\* or low \*(L)\*.

\- Only shorts stocks that legitimately have low real intrinsic value \*(L)\*.

\- Assume there is only one informed investor in this model.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Manipulator

\- The manipulator \*(M)\* has the information advantage as well. Through research or by observing the informed investor, they know the true intrinsic value of the stock and seek to manipulate the stock below that value.

\- A manipulator can appear as an informed investor to other participants by copying the selling behavior of the informed investor.

\- Manipulator can be a Market Maker (MM).

&amp;#x200B;

 \&gt;Market makers have lower shorting costs since they can sell on a downtick and do not have to commit that they will be able to borrow shares before they sell short. Market makers are granted these exceptions to facilitate their market-making activities. A strategy a manipulator can employ to reduce its cost of shorting is to register as a market maker for the target stock. If naked shorting, there is zero cost. (Pg. 17, footnote 33)

&amp;#x200B;

\- There is only one manipulator in this model.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Active Traders

\- Think of this group as regulation abiding MM's.

\- They can short sell, but do not engage in abusive short selling.

\- Active traders does not have as much information as the manipulator and informed investor. They do not know the true value of the stock.

 \- They can interpret market signals and see what the informed investor does, which gives them information advantage over retail investors.

 \- They mostly base their moves on what the informed investor does and only act after they do.

 \- They don't know if the informed investor they are watching is actually a manipulator in disguise.

\- There is more than one active trader.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Uninformed Investors

\- These are old type retail investors, not apes. 

\- Uninformed investors have the ultimate information advantage, they have no idea how much the stock is really worth.

  \- They always stand ready to buy more shares at lower prices than those currently prevailing, since they don't know the true intrinsic value of the stock.

  \- This willingness to buy provides consistent cash flow (liquidity) to short sellers.

\- Uninformed investors demand for shares is dependent on the supply of shares in their possession.

\- There are many uninformed investors.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Insiders and Long Term HODL'ers

\- Passive group that does not take an active role in the market. They neither sell nor buy shares.

\- They exist in the model so there are shares for the shorts to borrow and to set the initial market price.

\- Assume they own all outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Time Breakdown

The paper has a timeline/progression of how the market behaves. There are three points expressed as time \*t\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 0\*

\- This is right before anything happens and the model is at the initial conditions.

\- All shares are held by insiders and long term investors who do not plan on selling.

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 1\*

\- This is when the short sale can be initiated by the the informed investor or the manipulator or, depending on the situation, by both of them.

\- Also during this time the active traders are observing the informed investor (or a manipulator posing as one) and current market signals. They do not act during this time.

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 2\*

\- This is when the active trader takes action, they do what they saw the informed investor (or the manipulator posing as one) do.

\- The short sellers from time 1 can short additional shares if they decide to.

\- Market equilibrium forms at this time.

\- The informed investor or the manipulator can sustain a short position until time 3 but it is less expensive to sustain it to time 2 (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 3\*

\- This is when the stocks true intrinsic value is revealed to all market participants to be \*H\* or \*L\*.

\- This represents the long run, and it may be very costly for the informed investor or the manipulator to maintain a short position (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

\- If the informed investor has not closed their short position already, this is were they cover.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Market Equilibrium

At time 2, the market enters equilibrium. There are two basic forms of equilibrium: pooling and separating.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pooling

This type of equilibrium is when the manipulator wants to remain undetected so the other market participants mistake him as an informed investor.

&amp;#x200B;

The advantage to this is that the manipulator stands less of a chance of getting caught or squeezed. On top of this, active traders may pile on to short the stock as well when they see blood in the water. This causes the price to drop even lower, helping the manipulator. 

&amp;#x200B;

The disadvantage is that the manipulator loses profit to the extra competition and sole control over the price action.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Separating

This is when the manipulator doesn't care if they are detected. In some cases, they want to be detected to scare off competition. The advantage is that this strategy maximizes their profit and they have full price control. The disadvantage is they have a greater chance of getting caught or squeezed.

&amp;#x200B;

\# E. Demand Curves

\## General Demand Curve

This whole model is governed by the uninformed investors demand, since they are the buyers. Their demand is highly dependent on the supply of shares. The uninformed traders willingness to hold \*Q\* shares at time \*t\* is summarized by the demand curve (Pg. 15):

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/EKSffe4](https://imgur.com/EKSffe4)

&amp;#x200B;

\- The function \*D(Q)\* represents the uninformed investors demand which is equal to the price at time \*t\* represented by \*P(t)\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*H\* and \*L\* are the potential true values of the stock revealed to active traders and uninformed investors at time 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*A\* is a constant representing the current market price.

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*B\* is a constant representing the price at which uninformed investors buy, which is lower than the prevailing price. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Note that at time zero, all shares are in the hands of long term investors so \*P(0) = A\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\## The Unravelling Problem

If the manipulator was not naked short selling, then they would have to cover at time 2 or at time 3 when the true price is revealed to everyone. This presents what the paper refers to as the unravelling problem.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the issue shorts face when covering their positions. Since retail knows the real price at time 3 their demand curve shifts. Buying to cover at the real price causes the price to increase. Both factors cut into profits.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Problem When True Price = \*H\*

If true price is revealed to be \*H\* at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/7ZSZkeR](https://imgur.com/7ZSZkeR)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the worst case scenario for hedgies. Not only did they not suppress the price to \*L\* they now have to buy to cover. The number of shares retail holds \*Q\* goes to zero since hedgies have to buy them back, which will push the price to \*H\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Problem When True Price = \*L\*

If true price is revealed to be \*L\*, at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/bZu6YyV](https://imgur.com/bZu6YyV)

&amp;#x200B;

Not as bad as the previous case, but even covering at \*L\* will push price a little bit higher and cut into the hedgies' profits.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

\# F. Naked Short Selling

Naked short selling removes the unravelling problem at no cost to the manipulator. It's quite literally free money:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Naked short selling and manipulating the price downward provide cash returns to the manipulator, who can withdraw cash from his clearing firm account as the shorted shares are marked to market at progressively lower prices. Through naked shorting, the manipulator realizes these returns without investing any cash (provided the market price never rises above the sale price). (Pg. 34, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The clearing firm retains the cash proceeds from the short sale to secure the selling broker’s delivery obligation. The clearing firm releases cash equal to the reduction in value of the shorted shares as the price of the shares declines (or demands additional cash margin if the share price rises). (Pg. 34, footnote 51)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The daily trading volume could be quite high if the manipulator is rapidly turning over its short position, but the daily trading and settlement activity may appear to be normal market making because the dealer’s net position on the day does not change. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Pumping the trading volume also reduces the short interest ratio (short interest divided by the average daily trading volume) to help conceal the manipulation. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&amp;#x200B;

\-\*\*Remember naked shorting creates phantom shares which increases the float.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## True Shares Outstanding

Based on the original demand curve we can calculate the total shares outstanding at time 0. Since this is during the initial conditions, this is the true value of shares outstanding. Also, since uninformed investors are always willing to buy at a lower price and, hypothetically, if the long term investors decided to sell all outstanding shares \*Q\* to uninformed traders then price would fall to \*L\*:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\## Naked Short Selling in Pooling Equilibrium

\### When True Price = \*H\*

Using the previous equations we can find the amount of shares necessary to drive the final price at time 3 close to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/ajXUX57](https://imgur.com/ajXUX57)

&amp;#x200B;

\### When True Price = \*L\*

Same process with \*L\*:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/SFtQhxT](https://imgur.com/SFtQhxT)

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth noting,

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The manipulators profit depends on his ability to manipulate the firm's stock price and keep it depressed. The stronger the financial condition of the firm at time 3 (the higher \*L\* is), the greater the number of shares the manipulator has to sell short at time 3 to drive the price close to zero. (Pg. 45, par. 2)

&amp;#x200B;

\## More Shorted Shares than Outstanding

We have the true shares outstanding, we know the amount of shares needed to short an \*H\* valued company to zero, and the amount of shares needed to short a \*L\* valued company to zero.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/ARDbaTI](https://imgur.com/ARDbaTI)

&amp;#x200B;

\### When Value Is \*H\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Building a short position of \*H/B\* to drive \*P(3)\* to zero would involve naked shorting more shares than the firm has outstanding because \*H/B &gt; (A-L)/B\*. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The manipulator can not drive the share price close to zero unless he can naked short an extraordinary number of shares. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

So to drive the \*H\* company to zero hedgies have to naked short \*Q\_H\* shares. But remember our general equations governing the demand curve:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/s4sgfbA](https://imgur.com/s4sgfbA)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Proving that if hedgies want to short a company with a high intrinsic value to zero they must short more shares that are in existence.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\### When Value is \*L\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Even if the manipulator's short position is \*L/B\*, it might still exceed the entire number of shares the firm has outstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

If \*L=P(2)\* then the manipulator will naked short the same number of shares that the firm has outstanding. This next equation should look familiar:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/lOKPPaH](https://imgur.com/lOKPPaH)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So then if \*L&gt;P(2)\* then the manipulator will naked short more shares than firm has outstanding. By naked shorting the same number of shares that are outstanding, the manipulator has doubled the float. (Pg. 55, footnote 77)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## Naked Short Selling In Separating Equilibrium

In separating equilibrium, the manipulator scares the other participants away with unconcealed aggressive naked shorting. This maximizes profits by eliminating competition. Since the manipulator has price control it doesn't matter whether the time 3 price should be $H$ or $L$. The lack of competition also makes this strategy a bit more formulaic than the previous examples. The manipulator maximizes his short sale proceeds by naked shorting at time 1 (Pg. 48 par. 1, Pg. 54-55, par. 1):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/HdY6wSH](https://imgur.com/HdY6wSH)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;This has occurred with a huge volume of naked shorting and a precipitous decrease in share price that first cut the price in half and then reduced it close to zero. (Pg. 46, par. 2)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\# G. Inverted Demand Curve

First, lets put the original general demand curve into slope intercept:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/CNQn7f6](https://imgur.com/CNQn7f6)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, this is a line with a downwards slope of \*-B\*. Recall that B is the price that retail buys at which is always lower than the prevailing price. That means that as retail acquires more and more shares, the price/demand will decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/kS0jSte](https://imgur.com/kS0jSte)

&amp;#x200B;

With apes, however, it works the opposite way. Yes, we'll buy at any prices, but what I think fucked up the algorithm is we buy at higher and higher prices because ape and FOMO. In this case, demand and price increase as supply increases. Meaning that if apes got all the shares, the price would rise to \*H\* This changes the slope of the demand curve positive:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/xEI3qBB](https://imgur.com/xEI3qBB)

&amp;#x200B;

What I gathered from this is most of the hedgies' problem results from a simple change in sign. I take this a bit further and apply it to the exponential and log curves. I figure that the inverse of these functions is what fucked up what the algorithm originally intended.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# H. Exponential vs. Logarithmic

The following list has the floors calculated by u/JTH1 and the inverted version of the curve the hedgies originally had planned.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/62uNWKr](https://imgur.com/62uNWKr)

&amp;#x200B;

\## What Hedgies Were Expecting

Based on the inverse theory, I think this is more what the hedgies were expecting: (I tried to keep the scaling to a minimum, but I apologize for the the monstrosity of equations you might see):

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/undefined](https://imgur.com/undefined)

&amp;#x200B;

Red curve is (27) and blue curve is (28).

&amp;#x200B;

\## What Apes Did

And this is what apes did instead:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/2EkAx11](https://imgur.com/2EkAx11)

&amp;#x200B;

Blue is (29) and red is (30)

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if there's anything significant here, but laying lines tangent to curves got me thinking of \~\~calculus\~\~ \~\~simple calculus\~\~ math black magic, which helped me figure out formula to find outstanding shares later on, so I thought it was worth mentioning.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# I. Pareto Principle

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle...aka 80/20 rule. In this case, you could drop the price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need 80 percent of shares shorted to drop price the extra 20 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;In business, the term long tail is applied to rank-size distribution often form power laws and are thus long-tailed distributions in the statistical sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Hedgie Case

I thought it was interesting that the author stressed throughout the paper, that price is reduced CLOSE to zero and not zero. Remember, in separated equilibrium naked shorting drops the price by a third, then halves it before it quickly drops close to zero. 

&amp;#x200B;

That sounded like asymptotic behavior, so I was curious to see the progression to zero so I kept it going and halved \*P(2)\* again and repeated the process with my result. I assume this is happening quickly between time 2 and time 3:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/k2GMNV3](https://imgur.com/k2GMNV3)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/wY6DR1Y](https://imgur.com/wY6DR1Y)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd take it further but you get the picture. So I took the points made a scatter plot. Didn't look like much. I got curious and wanted to see if I could fit  so I decided to see if I could fit the negative exponential curve. I had to use some scaling factors, but always try to base them as a proportion of 1.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/qpuHsWN](https://imgur.com/qpuHsWN)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/nr5bP1D](https://imgur.com/nr5bP1D)

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't look like much either, but the fact that it had asymptotic behavior at 0.2 or 20 percent, I figured it might be worth mentioning.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Ape Case

Remember, in the normal case of naked shorting in separating equilibrium the price is dropped by a third, then halved, then taken close to zero.

&amp;#x200B;

In the ape case, the price increases. This is where the exponential/power function may come into play. I tried to find the rate of change by re-computing values using equations from earlier:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/7Ck0TWa](https://imgur.com/7Ck0TWa)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/c1Vygtf](https://imgur.com/c1Vygtf)

&amp;#x200B;

As with the last set of values, I wanted to examine the behavior of the ape curve between time 2 and time 3:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/qghwg2t](https://imgur.com/qghwg2t)

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like the price increases by a third, then by 1.25 or 25 percent. I did the same process of scatter and fitting curve this time with the exponential.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/uKcC5Wt](https://imgur.com/uKcC5Wt)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, not sure if there's anything here, but the number 0.8 or 80 percent stood out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# J. Impossible to Short to Zero

&amp;#x200B;

This time using the ape curve, I used the same process as earlier to find the amount of shares needed to drive the price close to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/Mwnnchh](https://imgur.com/Mwnnchh)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*These expressions violate our general demand curve rules, because all elements cannot be negative:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/NkyUeJK](https://imgur.com/NkyUeJK)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*This seems to imply that if apes continue their strategy the price cannot go to zero. It is mathematically impossible.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# K. How Many Shares Are Shorted?

So far, we have equations that:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Relate \*P(t)\* to \*Q\*

2. Relate \*P(t)\* to \*t\* 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to find a expression that can relate \*Q\* and \*t\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Hedgies' Curves

First, I set equal to each other:

But, there are still constants to worry about so I \~\~tried calculus\~\~ had a math séance:

For such a huge number, I thought to check the other A value of 40 dollars to see what I got:

&amp;#x200B;

\# L. Yes, But What Does It Mean?

\*\*What I can't figure out is what the asymptotic behavior represents in the model and what it implies.\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this the mathematical confirmation of what we've suspected all along, that it is no longer possible for hedgies to dilute the float meaningfully?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this the stalemate that occurs when the shares are being bought at higher rate?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this the amount retail holds?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this is significant, but I don't know how."

What I Hope to Prove

I hope to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that hedgies are indeed mathematically fucked, in that they have naked shorted **AT LEAST** the same amount of shares outstanding.

# B. What I Attempt to Find

These are not topics I intend to prove, just theories I'd like to explore. I attempt to:

1. Try to guess hedgies' original trading algorithm and how apes fucked it up.

2. See if there's any link among the strange behavior of the exponential and logarithmic charts, the progressively weaker short attacks and the Pareto Principle.

3. **Derive an equation that estimates total shares shorted in order to make more accurate estimates of short interest.**

# C. Primary Sources
## Finnerty's Paper

u/atobitt's [H.O.C. III](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/) mentions an [academic paper](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) titled *""Short Selling, Death Spiral Convertibles, and the Profitability of Stock Manipulation""* written March 2005 by John D. Finnerty, a finance professor.

In the paper, he lays out a model to examine naked short selling. In particular, he demonstrates that in order **to drive a firms price very close to zero, a manipulator MUST naked short AT LEAST the same number of shares as there are shares outstanding, doubling the float.**

## Pareto Principle
u/sososhibby posted [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm3mtr/relevant_af/) mentioning a couple things:

&gt; The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle.

&gt;Pareto principle is 80 percent consequences from 20 percent of causes aka 80/20 rule.

&gt;In this case you could drop price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need another 80 percent of shares shorted to drop the price the extra 20 percent.

&gt;TLDR Finnerty formula = Over time, it takes exponentially more shorts to drop the same delta in price.

&gt;This explains how they were able to drop price down to 40 dollars, but haven't been able to get it back to there...They couldn't get the price to drop like that because they were too far the distribution curve to possibly generate a price drop like that...

&gt;...makes so much fucking sense...why the log scale price chart fits the exponential curve. Basically, the log chart represents distance in deltas...Some part of the supply demand chain needs to get fucked up for the log chart to fit an exponential curve. This exponential increase in necessary naked shorts to drive price action explains that.

## Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Charts

u/JTH1 discovered the equations of the [exponential &amp; log charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvcwn5/0608_update_slightly_more_pimped_gme_exponential/). The charts showed the curves were acting as a floor in both cases and fit each other, which is very strange.

---

# D. Market Rundown

In my opinion, Finnerty's paper is a thing of logical and [mathematical beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty). He took a very complex system and expressed it elegantly and simply. As a math ape, it literally brought a tear to my eye when I finally understood it. I'd highly recommend it to any other math apes.

**However**, I know most people and apes have a...*strained* relationship with math, **so I read all 73 pages of the paper so you don't have to!** I try to lay out his model as concisely as possible as to who the participants are and how the market behaves.

## Market Participants

### Informed Investor
- Informed investors do short sell, but do not engage in abusive or naked short selling. They locate, borrow and return shares on time.
- The informed investor has information advantage. They know if the true intrinsic value is high *(H)* or low *(L)*.
- Only shorts stocks that legitimately have low real intrinsic value *(L)*.
- Assume there is only one informed investor in this model.

### Manipulator
- The manipulator *(M)* has the information advantage as well. Through research or by observing the informed investor, they know the true intrinsic value of the stock and seek to manipulate the stock below that value.
- A manipulator can appear as an informed investor to other participants by copying the selling behavior of the informed investor.
- Manipulator can be a Market Maker (MM).

 &gt;Market makers have lower shorting costs since they can sell on a downtick and do not have to commit that they will be able to borrow shares before they sell short. Market makers are granted these exceptions to facilitate their market-making activities. A strategy a manipulator can employ to reduce its cost of shorting is to register as a market maker for the target stock. If naked shorting, there is zero cost. (Pg. 17, footnote 33)

- There is only one manipulator in this model.

### Active Traders
- Think of this group as regulation abiding MM's.
- They can short sell, but do not engage in abusive short selling.
- Active traders does not have as much information as the manipulator and informed investor. They do not know the true value of the stock.
 - They can interpret market signals and see what the informed investor does, which gives them information advantage over retail investors.
 - They mostly base their moves on what the informed investor does and only act after they do.
 - They don't know if the informed investor they are watching is actually a manipulator in disguise.
- There is more than one active trader.

### Uninformed Investors
- These are old type retail investors, not apes. 
- Uninformed investors have the ultimate information advantage, they have no idea how much the stock is really worth.
  - They always stand ready to buy more shares at lower prices than those currently prevailing, since they don't know the true intrinsic value of the stock.
  - This willingness to buy provides consistent cash flow (liquidity) to short sellers.
- Uninformed investors demand for shares is dependent on the supply of shares in their possession.
- There are many uninformed investors.

### Insiders and Long Term HODL'ers
- Passive group that does not take an active role in the market. They neither sell nor buy shares.
- They exist in the model so there are shares for the shorts to borrow and to set the initial market price.
- Assume they own all outstanding shares.

## Time Breakdown
The paper has a timeline/progression of how the market behaves. There are three points expressed as time *t*.

### *Time 0*
- This is right before anything happens and the model is at the initial conditions.
- All shares are held by insiders and long term investors who do not plan on selling.

### *Time 1*
- This is when the short sale can be initiated by the the informed investor or the manipulator or, depending on the situation, by both of them.
- Also during this time the active traders are observing the informed investor (or a manipulator posing as one) and current market signals. They do not act during this time.

### *Time 2*
- This is when the active trader takes action, they do what they saw the informed investor (or the manipulator posing as one) do.
- The short sellers from time 1 can short additional shares if they decide to.
- Market equilibrium forms at this time.
- The informed investor or the manipulator can sustain a short position until time 3 but it is less expensive to sustain it to time 2 (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

### *Time 3*
- This is when the stocks true intrinsic value is revealed to all market participants to be *H* or *L*.
- This represents the long run, and it may be very costly for the informed investor or the manipulator to maintain a short position (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).
- If the informed investor has not closed their short position already, this is were they cover.

## Market Equilibrium
At time 2, the market enters equilibrium. There are two basic forms of equilibrium: pooling and separating.

### Pooling
This type of equilibrium is when the manipulator wants to remain undetected so the other market participants mistake him as an informed investor.

The advantage to this is that the manipulator stands less of a chance of getting caught or squeezed. On top of this, active traders may pile on to short the stock as well when they see blood in the water. This causes the price to drop even lower, helping the manipulator. 

The disadvantage is that the manipulator loses profit to the extra competition and sole control over the price action.

### Separating
This is when the manipulator doesn't care if they are detected. In some cases, they want to be detected to scare off competition. The advantage is that this strategy maximizes their profit and they have full price control. The disadvantage is they have a greater chance of getting caught or squeezed.

---

# E. Demand Curves
## General Demand Curve
This whole model is governed by the uninformed investors demand, since they are the buyers. Their demand is highly dependent on the supply of shares. The uninformed traders willingness to hold *Q* shares at time *t* is summarized by the demand curve (Pg. 15):

https://imgur.com/EKSffe4

- The function *D(Q)* represents the uninformed investors demand which is equal to the price at time *t* represented by *P(t)*. 

- *H* and *L* are the potential true values of the stock revealed to active traders and uninformed investors at time 3. 

- *A* is a constant representing the current market price.

- *B* is a constant representing the price at which uninformed investors buy, which is lower than the prevailing price. 

- Note that at time zero, all shares are in the hands of long term investors so *P(0) = A*.

## The Unravelling Problem
If the manipulator was not naked short selling, then they would have to cover at time 2 or at time 3 when the true price is revealed to everyone. This presents what the paper refers to as the unravelling problem.

This is the issue shorts face when covering their positions. Since retail knows the real price at time 3 their demand curve shifts. Buying to cover at the real price causes the price to increase. Both factors cut into profits.

### Problem When True Price = *H*
If true price is revealed to be *H* at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

This is the worst case scenario for hedgies. Not only did they not suppress the price to *L* they now have to buy to cover. The number of shares retail holds *Q* goes to zero since hedgies have to buy them back, which will push the price to *H*.

### Problem When True Price = *L*
If true price is revealed to be *L*, at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

https://imgur.com/bZu6YyV

Not as bad as the previous case, but even covering at *L* will push price a little bit higher and cut into the hedgies' profits.

# F. Naked Short Selling
Naked short selling removes the unravelling problem at no cost to the manipulator. It's quite literally free money:

&gt;Naked short selling and manipulating the price downward provide cash returns to the manipulator, who can withdraw cash from his clearing firm account as the shorted shares are marked to market at progressively lower prices. Through naked shorting, the manipulator realizes these returns without investing any cash (provided the market price never rises above the sale price). (Pg. 34, par. 1)

&gt;The clearing firm retains the cash proceeds from the short sale to secure the selling broker’s delivery obligation. The clearing firm releases cash equal to the reduction in value of the shorted shares as the price of the shares declines (or demands additional cash margin if the share price rises). (Pg. 34, footnote 51)

&gt;The daily trading volume could be quite high if the manipulator is rapidly turning over its short position, but the daily trading and settlement activity may appear to be normal market making because the dealer’s net position on the day does not change. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&gt;Pumping the trading volume also reduces the short interest ratio (short interest divided by the average daily trading volume) to help conceal the manipulation. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

-**Remember naked shorting creates phantom shares which increases the float.**

## True Shares Outstanding
Based on the original demand curve we can calculate the total shares outstanding at time 0. Since this is during the initial conditions, this is the true value of shares outstanding. Also, since uninformed investors are always willing to buy at a lower price and, hypothetically, if the long term investors decided to sell all outstanding shares *Q* to uninformed traders then price would fall to *L*:

## Naked Short Selling in Pooling Equilibrium
### When True Price = *H*
Using the previous equations we can find the amount of shares necessary to drive the final price at time 3 close to zero:

https://imgur.com/ajXUX57

### When True Price = *L*
Same process with *L*:

https://imgur.com/SFtQhxT

It is also worth noting,

&gt;The manipulators profit depends on his ability to manipulate the firm's stock price and keep it depressed. The stronger the financial condition of the firm at time 3 (the higher *L* is), the greater the number of shares the manipulator has to sell short at time 3 to drive the price close to zero. (Pg. 45, par. 2)

## More Shorted Shares than Outstanding
We have the true shares outstanding, we know the amount of shares needed to short an *H* valued company to zero, and the amount of shares needed to short a *L* valued company to zero.

https://imgur.com/ARDbaTI

### When Value Is *H*

&gt;Building a short position of *H/B* to drive *P(3)* to zero would involve naked shorting more shares than the firm has outstanding because *H/B &gt; (A-L)/B*. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

&gt;The manipulator can not drive the share price close to zero unless he can naked short an extraordinary number of shares. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

So to drive the *H* company to zero hedgies have to naked short *Q_H* shares. But remember our general equations governing the demand curve:

https://imgur.com/s4sgfbA

**Proving that if hedgies want to short a company with a high intrinsic value to zero they must short more shares that are in existence.**

### When Value is *L*

&gt;Even if the manipulator's short position is *L/B*, it might still exceed the entire number of shares the firm has outstanding.

If *L=P(2)* then the manipulator will naked short the same number of shares that the firm has outstanding. This next equation should look familiar:

https://imgur.com/lOKPPaH

**So then if *L&gt;P(2)* then the manipulator will naked short more shares than firm has outstanding. By naked shorting the same number of shares that are outstanding, the manipulator has doubled the float. (Pg. 55, footnote 77)**

## Naked Short Selling In Separating Equilibrium
In separating equilibrium, the manipulator scares the other participants away with unconcealed aggressive naked shorting. This maximizes profits by eliminating competition. Since the manipulator has price control it doesn't matter whether the time 3 price should be $H$ or $L$. The lack of competition also makes this strategy a bit more formulaic than the previous examples. The manipulator maximizes his short sale proceeds by naked shorting at time 1 (Pg. 48 par. 1, Pg. 54-55, par. 1):

https://imgur.com/THEBdXi

https://imgur.com/X2L0kCv

https://imgur.com/HdY6wSH

&gt;This has occurred with a huge volume of naked shorting and a precipitous decrease in share price that first cut the price in half and then reduced it close to zero. (Pg. 46, par. 2)

# G. Inverted Demand Curve
First, lets put the original general demand curve into slope intercept:

https://imgur.com/CNQn7f6

As you can see, this is a line with a downwards slope of *-B*. Recall that B is the price that retail buys at which is always lower than the prevailing price. That means that as retail acquires more and more shares, the price/demand will decrease.

https://imgur.com/kS0jSte

With apes, however, it works the opposite way. Yes, we'll buy at any prices, but what I think fucked up the algorithm is we buy at higher and higher prices because ape and FOMO. In this case, demand and price increase as supply increases. Meaning that if apes got all the shares, the price would rise to *H* This changes the slope of the demand curve positive:

https://imgur.com/xEI3qBB

What I gathered from this is most of the hedgies' problem results from a simple change in sign. I take this a bit further and apply it to the exponential and log curves. I figure that the inverse of these functions is what fucked up what the algorithm originally intended.

# H. Exponential vs. Logarithmic
The following list has the floors calculated by u/JTH1 and the inverted version of the curve the hedgies originally had planned.

## What Hedgies Were Expecting
Based on the inverse theory, I think this is more what the hedgies were expecting: (I tried to keep the scaling to a minimum, but I apologize for the the monstrosity of equations you might see):

Red curve is (27) and blue curve is (28).

## What Apes Did
And this is what apes did instead:

Blue is (29) and red is (30)

Not sure if there's anything significant here, but laying lines tangent to curves got me thinking of ~~calculus~~ ~~simple calculus~~ math black magic, which helped me figure out formula to find outstanding shares later on, so I thought it was worth mentioning.

# I. Pareto Principle

&gt;The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle...aka 80/20 rule. In this case, you could drop the price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need 80 percent of shares shorted to drop price the extra 20 percent.

&gt;In business, the term long tail is applied to rank-size distribution often form power laws and are thus long-tailed distributions in the statistical sense.

## Hedgie Case
I thought it was interesting that the author stressed throughout the paper, that price is reduced CLOSE to zero and not zero. Remember, in separated equilibrium naked shorting drops the price by a third, then halves it before it quickly drops close to zero. 

That sounded like asymptotic behavior, so I was curious to see the progression to zero so I kept it going and halved *P(2)* again and repeated the process with my result. I assume this is happening quickly between time 2 and time 3:

https://imgur.com/k2GMNV3

https://imgur.com/wY6DR1Y

I'd take it further but you get the picture. So I took the points made a scatter plot. Didn't look like much. I got curious and wanted to see if I could fit  so I decided to see if I could fit the negative exponential curve. I had to use some scaling factors, but always try to base them as a proportion of 1.

https://imgur.com/qpuHsWN

https://imgur.com/nr5bP1D

Didn't look like much either, but the fact that it had asymptotic behavior at 0.2 or 20 percent, I figured it might be worth mentioning.

## Ape Case
Remember, in the normal case of naked shorting in separating equilibrium the price is dropped by a third, then halved, then taken close to zero.

In the ape case, the price increases. This is where the exponential/power function may come into play. I tried to find the rate of change by re-computing values using equations from earlier:

https://imgur.com/7Ck0TWa

https://imgur.com/c1Vygtf

As with the last set of values, I wanted to examine the behavior of the ape curve between time 2 and time 3:

https://imgur.com/qghwg2t

It looks like the price increases by a third, then by 1.25 or 25 percent. I did the same process of scatter and fitting curve this time with the exponential.

https://imgur.com/uKcC5Wt

Also, not sure if there's anything here, but the number 0.8 or 80 percent stood out to me.

# J. Impossible to Short to Zero

This time using the ape curve, I used the same process as earlier to find the amount of shares needed to drive the price close to zero:

https://imgur.com/Mwnnchh

**These expressions violate our general demand curve rules, because all elements cannot be negative:**

https://imgur.com/NkyUeJK

**This seems to imply that if apes continue their strategy the price cannot go to zero. It is mathematically impossible.**

---

# K. How Many Shares Are Shorted?
So far, we have equations that:

1. Relate *P(t)* to *Q*
2. Relate *P(t)* to *t* 

My goal is to find a expression that can relate *Q* and *t*.

## Hedgies' Curves
First, I set equal to each other:

# L. Yes, But What Does It Mean?
**What I can't figure out is what the asymptotic behavior represents in the model and what it implies.** 

- Is this the mathematical confirmation of what we've suspected all along, that it is no longer possible for hedgies to dilute the float meaningfully?

- Is this the stalemate that occurs when the shares are being bought at higher rate?

- Is this the amount retail holds?

I feel like this is significant, but I don't know how."

# A. What I Hope to Prove

I hope to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that hedgies are indeed mathematically fucked, in that they have naked shorted **AT LEAST** the same amount of shares outstanding.

# B. What I Attempt to Find

These are not topics I intend to prove, just theories I'd like to explore. I attempt to:

1. Try to guess hedgies' original trading algorithm and how apes fucked it up.

2. See if there's any link among the strange behavior of the exponential and logarithmic charts, the progressively weaker short attacks and the Pareto Principle.

3. **Derive an equation that estimates total shares shorted in order to make more accurate estimates of short interest.**

# C. Primary Sources
## Finnerty's Paper

u/atobitt's [H.O.C. III](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/) mentions an [academic paper](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) titled *""Short Selling, Death Spiral Convertibles, and the Profitability of Stock Manipulation""* written March 2005 by John D. Finnerty, a finance professor.

In the paper, he lays out a model to examine naked short selling. In particular, he demonstrates that in order **to drive a firms price very close to zero, a manipulator MUST naked short AT LEAST the same number of shares as there are shares outstanding, doubling the float.**

## Pareto Principle
u/sososhibby posted [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm3mtr/relevant_af/) mentioning a couple things:

&gt; The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle.

&gt;Pareto principle is 80 percent consequences from 20 percent of causes aka 80/20 rule.

&gt;In this case you could drop price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need another 80 percent of shares shorted to drop the price the extra 20 percent.

&gt;TLDR Finnerty formula = Over time, it takes exponentially more shorts to drop the same delta in price.

&gt;This explains how they were able to drop price down to 40 dollars, but haven't been able to get it back to there...They couldn't get the price to drop like that because they were too far the distribution curve to possibly generate a price drop like that...

&gt;...makes so much fucking sense...why the log scale price chart fits the exponential curve. Basically, the log chart represents distance in deltas...Some part of the supply demand chain needs to get fucked up for the log chart to fit an exponential curve. This exponential increase in necessary naked shorts to drive price action explains that.

## Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Charts

u/JTH1 discovered the equations of the [exponential &amp; log charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvcwn5/0608_update_slightly_more_pimped_gme_exponential/). The charts showed the curves were acting as a floor in both cases and fit each other, which is very strange.

# D. Market Rundown

In my opinion, Finnerty's paper is a thing of logical and [mathematical beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty). He took a very complex system and expressed it elegantly and simply. As a math ape, it literally brought a tear to my eye when I finally understood it. I'd highly recommend it to any other math apes.

**However**, I know most people and apes have a...*strained* relationship with math, **so I read all 73 pages of the paper so you don't have to!** I try to lay out his model as concisely as possible as to who the participants are and how the market behaves.

## Market Participants

### Informed Investor
- Informed investors do short sell, but do not engage in abusive or naked short selling. They locate, borrow and return shares on time.
- The informed investor has information advantage. They know if the true intrinsic value is high *(H)* or low *(L)*.
- Only shorts stocks that legitimately have low real intrinsic value *(L)*.
- Assume there is only one informed investor in this model.

### Manipulator
- The manipulator *(M)* has the information advantage as well. Through research or by observing the informed investor, they know the true intrinsic value of the stock and seek to manipulate the stock below that value.
- A manipulator can appear as an informed investor to other participants by copying the selling behavior of the informed investor.
- Manipulator can be a Market Maker (MM).

 &gt;Market makers have lower shorting costs since they can sell on a downtick and do not have to commit that they will be able to borrow shares before they sell short. Market makers are granted these exceptions to facilitate their market-making activities. A strategy a manipulator can employ to reduce its cost of shorting is to register as a market maker for the target stock. If naked shorting, there is zero cost. (Pg. 17, footnote 33)

- There is only one manipulator in this model.

### Active Traders
- Think of this group as regulation abiding MM's.
- They can short sell, but do not engage in abusive short selling.
- Active traders does not have as much information as the manipulator and informed investor. They do not know the true value of the stock.
 - They can interpret market signals and see what the informed investor does, which gives them information advantage over retail investors.
 - They mostly base their moves on what the informed investor does and only act after they do.
 - They don't know if the informed investor they are watching is actually a manipulator in disguise.
- There is more than one active trader.

### Uninformed Investors
- These are old type retail investors, not apes. 
- Uninformed investors have the ultimate information advantage, they have no idea how much the stock is really worth.
  - They always stand ready to buy more shares at lower prices than those currently prevailing, since they don't know the true intrinsic value of the stock.
  - This willingness to buy provides consistent cash flow (liquidity) to short sellers.
- Uninformed investors demand for shares is dependent on the supply of shares in their possession.
- There are many uninformed investors.

### Insiders and Long Term HODL'ers
- Passive group that does not take an active role in the market. They neither sell nor buy shares.
- They exist in the model so there are shares for the shorts to borrow and to set the initial market price.
- Assume they own all outstanding shares.

## Time Breakdown
The paper has a timeline/progression of how the market behaves. There are three points expressed as time *t*.

### *Time 0*
- This is right before anything happens and the model is at the initial conditions.
- All shares are held by insiders and long term investors who do not plan on selling.

### *Time 1*
- This is when the short sale can be initiated by the the informed investor or the manipulator or, depending on the situation, by both of them.
- Also during this time the active traders are observing the informed investor (or a manipulator posing as one) and current market signals. They do not act during this time.

### *Time 2*
- This is when the active trader takes action, they do what they saw the informed investor (or the manipulator posing as one) do.
- The short sellers from time 1 can short additional shares if they decide to.
- Market equilibrium forms at this time.
- The informed investor or the manipulator can sustain a short position until time 3 but it is less expensive to sustain it to time 2 (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

### *Time 3*
- This is when the stocks true intrinsic value is revealed to all market participants to be *H* or *L*.
- This represents the long run, and it may be very costly for the informed investor or the manipulator to maintain a short position (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).
- If the informed investor has not closed their short position already, this is were they cover.

## Market Equilibrium
At time 2, the market enters equilibrium. There are two basic forms of equilibrium: pooling and separating.

### Pooling
This type of equilibrium is when the manipulator wants to remain undetected so the other market participants mistake him as an informed investor.

The advantage to this is that the manipulator stands less of a chance of getting caught or squeezed. On top of this, active traders may pile on to short the stock as well when they see blood in the water. This causes the price to drop even lower, helping the manipulator. 

The disadvantage is that the manipulator loses profit to the extra competition and sole control over the price action.

### Separating
This is when the manipulator doesn't care if they are detected. In some cases, they want to be detected to scare off competition. The advantage is that this strategy maximizes their profit and they have full price control. The disadvantage is they have a greater chance of getting caught or squeezed.

---

# E. Demand Curves
## General Demand Curve
This whole model is governed by the uninformed investors demand, since they are the buyers. Their demand is highly dependent on the supply of shares. The uninformed traders willingness to hold *Q* shares at time *t* is summarized by the demand curve (Pg. 15):

[Fig. 1](https://imgur.com/EKSffe4)

- The function *D(Q)* represents the uninformed investors demand which is equal to the price at time *t* represented by *P(t)*. 

- *H* and *L* are the potential true values of the stock revealed to active traders and uninformed investors at time 3. 

- *A* is a constant representing the current market price.

- *B* is a constant representing the price at which uninformed investors buy, which is lower than the prevailing price. 

- Note that at time zero, all shares are in the hands of long term investors so *P(0) = A*.

## The Unravelling Problem
If the manipulator was not naked short selling, then they would have to cover at time 2 or at time 3 when the true price is revealed to everyone. This presents what the paper refers to as the unravelling problem.

This is the issue shorts face when covering their positions. Since retail knows the real price at time 3 their demand curve shifts. Buying to cover at the real price causes the price to increase. Both factors cut into profits.

### Problem When True Price = *H*
If true price is revealed to be *H* at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

https://imgur.com/7ZSZkeR

This is the worst case scenario for hedgies. Not only did they not suppress the price to *L* they now have to buy to cover. The number of shares retail holds *Q* goes to zero since hedgies have to buy them back, which will push the price to *H*.

### Problem When True Price = *L*
If true price is revealed to be *L*, at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

https://imgur.com/bZu6YyV

Not as bad as the previous case, but even covering at *L* will push price a little bit higher and cut into the hedgies' profits.

# F. Naked Short Selling
Naked short selling removes the unravelling problem at no cost to the manipulator. It's quite literally free money:

&gt;Naked short selling and manipulating the price downward provide cash returns to the manipulator, who can withdraw cash from his clearing firm account as the shorted shares are marked to market at progressively lower prices.

&gt;The clearing firm retains the cash proceeds from the short sale to secure the selling broker’s delivery obligation. The clearing firm releases cash equal to the reduction in value of the shorted shares as the price of the shares declines (or demands additional cash margin if the share price rises). (Pg. 34, footnote 51)

&gt;The daily trading volume could be quite high if the manipulator is rapidly turning over its short position, but the daily trading and settlement activity may appear to be normal market making because the dealer’s net position on the day does not change. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

In the ape case, the price increases. This is where the exponential/power function may come into play. I tried to find the rate of change by re-computing values using equations from earlier:

As with the last set of values, I wanted to examine the behavior of the ape curve between time 2 and time 3:

https://imgur.com/qghwg2t

It looks like the price increases by a third, then by 1.25 or 25 percent. I did the same process of scatter and fitting curve this time with the exponential.

Also, not sure if there's anything here, but the number 0.8 or 80 percent stood out to me.

# J. Impossible to Short to Zero

This time using the ape curve, I used the same process as earlier to find the amount of shares needed to drive the price close to zero:

https://imgur.com/Mwnnchh

**These expressions violate our general demand curve rules, because all elements cannot be negative:**

https://imgur.com/NkyUeJK

**This seems to imply that if apes continue their strategy the price cannot go to zero. It is mathematically impossible.**

# K. How Many Shares Are Shorted?
So far, we have equations that:

1. Relate *P(t)* to *Q*
2. Relate *P(t)* to *t* 

My goal is to find a expression that can relate *Q* and *t*.

## Hedgies' Curves
First, I set equal to each other:

# L. Yes, But What Does It Mean?
**What I can't figure out is what the asymptotic behavior represents in the model and what it implies.** 

- Is this the mathematical confirmation of what we've suspected all along, that it is no longer possible for hedgies to dilute the float meaningfully?

- Is this the stalemate that occurs when the shares are being bought at higher rate?

- Is this the amount retail holds?

I feel like this is significant, but I don't know how."

What I Hope to Prove

I hope to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that hedgies are indeed mathematically fucked, in that they have naked shorted \*\*AT LEAST\*\* the same amount of shares outstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

\# B. What I Attempt to Find

&amp;#x200B;

These are not topics I intend to prove, just theories I'd like to explore. I attempt to:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Try to guess hedgies' original trading algorithm and how apes fucked it up.

&amp;#x200B;

2. See if there's any link among the strange behavior of the exponential and logarithmic charts, the progressively weaker short attacks and the Pareto Principle.

&amp;#x200B;

3. \*\*Derive an equation that estimates total shares shorted in order to make more accurate estimates of short interest.\*\*

\# C. Primary Sources

\## Finnerty's Paper

&amp;#x200B;

u/atobitt's \[H.O.C. III\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house\_of\_cards\_part\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/)) mentions an \[academic paper\]([https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf)) titled \*""Short Selling, Death Spiral Convertibles, and the Profitability of Stock Manipulation""\* written March 2005 by John D. Finnerty, a finance professor.

&amp;#x200B;

In the paper, he lays out a model to examine naked short selling. In particular, he demonstrates that in order \*\*to drive a firms price very close to zero, a manipulator MUST naked short AT LEAST the same number of shares as there are shares outstanding, doubling the float.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## Pareto Principle

u/sososhibby posted \[a comment\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm3mtr/relevant\_af/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm3mtr/relevant_af/)) mentioning a couple things:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Pareto principle is 80 percent consequences from 20 percent of causes aka 80/20 rule.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;In this case you could drop price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need another 80 percent of shares shorted to drop the price the extra 20 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;TLDR Finnerty formula = Over time, it takes exponentially more shorts to drop the same delta in price.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;This explains how they were able to drop price down to 40 dollars, but haven't been able to get it back to there...They couldn't get the price to drop like that because they were too far the distribution curve to possibly generate a price drop like that...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;...makes so much fucking sense...why the log scale price chart fits the exponential curve. Basically, the log chart represents distance in deltas...Some part of the supply demand chain needs to get fucked up for the log chart to fit an exponential curve. This exponential increase in necessary naked shorts to drive price action explains that.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Charts

&amp;#x200B;

u/JTH1 discovered the equations of the \[exponential &amp; log charts\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvcwn5/0608\_update\_slightly\_more\_pimped\_gme\_exponential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvcwn5/0608_update_slightly_more_pimped_gme_exponential/)). The charts showed the curves were acting as a floor in both cases and fit each other, which is very strange.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# D. Market Rundown

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, Finnerty's paper is a thing of logical and \[mathematical beauty\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty)). He took a very complex system and expressed it elegantly and simply. As a math ape, it literally brought a tear to my eye when I finally understood it. I'd highly recommend it to any other math apes.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*However\*\*, I know most people and apes have a...\*strained\* relationship with math, \*\*so I read all 73 pages of the paper so you don't have to!\*\* I try to lay out his model as concisely as possible as to who the participants are and how the market behaves.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Market Participants

&amp;#x200B;

\### Informed Investor

\- Informed investors do short sell, but do not engage in abusive or naked short selling. They locate, borrow and return shares on time.

\- The informed investor has information advantage. They know if the true intrinsic value is high \*(H)\* or low \*(L)\*.

\- Only shorts stocks that legitimately have low real intrinsic value \*(L)\*.

\- Assume there is only one informed investor in this model.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Manipulator

\- The manipulator \*(M)\* has the information advantage as well. Through research or by observing the informed investor, they know the true intrinsic value of the stock and seek to manipulate the stock below that value.

\- A manipulator can appear as an informed investor to other participants by copying the selling behavior of the informed investor.

\- Manipulator can be a Market Maker (MM).

&amp;#x200B;

 \&gt;Market makers have lower shorting costs since they can sell on a downtick and do not have to commit that they will be able to borrow shares before they sell short. Market makers are granted these exceptions to facilitate their market-making activities. A strategy a manipulator can employ to reduce its cost of shorting is to register as a market maker for the target stock. If naked shorting, there is zero cost. (Pg. 17, footnote 33)

&amp;#x200B;

\- There is only one manipulator in this model.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Active Traders

\- Think of this group as regulation abiding MM's.

\- They can short sell, but do not engage in abusive short selling.

\- Active traders does not have as much information as the manipulator and informed investor. They do not know the true value of the stock.

 \- They can interpret market signals and see what the informed investor does, which gives them information advantage over retail investors.

 \- They mostly base their moves on what the informed investor does and only act after they do.

 \- They don't know if the informed investor they are watching is actually a manipulator in disguise.

\- There is more than one active trader.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Uninformed Investors

\- These are old type retail investors, not apes. 

\- Uninformed investors have the ultimate information advantage, they have no idea how much the stock is really worth.

  \- They always stand ready to buy more shares at lower prices than those currently prevailing, since they don't know the true intrinsic value of the stock.

  \- This willingness to buy provides consistent cash flow (liquidity) to short sellers.

\- Uninformed investors demand for shares is dependent on the supply of shares in their possession.

\- There are many uninformed investors.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Insiders and Long Term HODL'ers

\- Passive group that does not take an active role in the market. They neither sell nor buy shares.

\- They exist in the model so there are shares for the shorts to borrow and to set the initial market price.

\- Assume they own all outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Time Breakdown

The paper has a timeline/progression of how the market behaves. There are three points expressed as time \*t\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 0\*

\- This is right before anything happens and the model is at the initial conditions.

\- All shares are held by insiders and long term investors who do not plan on selling.

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 1\*

\- This is when the short sale can be initiated by the the informed investor or the manipulator or, depending on the situation, by both of them.

\- Also during this time the active traders are observing the informed investor (or a manipulator posing as one) and current market signals. They do not act during this time.

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 2\*

\- This is when the active trader takes action, they do what they saw the informed investor (or the manipulator posing as one) do.

\- The short sellers from time 1 can short additional shares if they decide to.

\- Market equilibrium forms at this time.

\- The informed investor or the manipulator can sustain a short position until time 3 but it is less expensive to sustain it to time 2 (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

&amp;#x200B;

\### \*Time 3\*

\- This is when the stocks true intrinsic value is revealed to all market participants to be \*H\* or \*L\*.

\- This represents the long run, and it may be very costly for the informed investor or the manipulator to maintain a short position (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

\- If the informed investor has not closed their short position already, this is were they cover.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Market Equilibrium

At time 2, the market enters equilibrium. There are two basic forms of equilibrium: pooling and separating.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pooling

This type of equilibrium is when the manipulator wants to remain undetected so the other market participants mistake him as an informed investor.

&amp;#x200B;

The advantage to this is that the manipulator stands less of a chance of getting caught or squeezed. On top of this, active traders may pile on to short the stock as well when they see blood in the water. This causes the price to drop even lower, helping the manipulator. 

&amp;#x200B;

The disadvantage is that the manipulator loses profit to the extra competition and sole control over the price action.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Separating

This is when the manipulator doesn't care if they are detected. In some cases, they want to be detected to scare off competition. The advantage is that this strategy maximizes their profit and they have full price control. The disadvantage is they have a greater chance of getting caught or squeezed.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# E. Demand Curves

\## General Demand Curve

This whole model is governed by the uninformed investors demand, since they are the buyers. Their demand is highly dependent on the supply of shares. The uninformed traders willingness to hold \*Q\* shares at time \*t\* is summarized by the demand curve (Pg. 15):

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""EKSffe4""&gt;&lt;a href=""[https://imgur.com/EKSffe4](https://imgur.com/EKSffe4)""&gt;View post on imgur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

\- The function \*D(Q)\* represents the uninformed investors demand which is equal to the price at time \*t\* represented by \*P(t)\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*H\* and \*L\* are the potential true values of the stock revealed to active traders and uninformed investors at time 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*A\* is a constant representing the current market price.

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*B\* is a constant representing the price at which uninformed investors buy, which is lower than the prevailing price. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Note that at time zero, all shares are in the hands of long term investors so \*P(0) = A\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\## The Unravelling Problem

If the manipulator was not naked short selling, then they would have to cover at time 2 or at time 3 when the true price is revealed to everyone. This presents what the paper refers to as the unravelling problem.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the issue shorts face when covering their positions. Since retail knows the real price at time 3 their demand curve shifts. Buying to cover at the real price causes the price to increase. Both factors cut into profits.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Problem When True Price = \*H\*

If true price is revealed to be \*H\* at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/7ZSZkeR](https://imgur.com/7ZSZkeR)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the worst case scenario for hedgies. Not only did they not suppress the price to \*L\* they now have to buy to cover. The number of shares retail holds \*Q\* goes to zero since hedgies have to buy them back, which will push the price to \*H\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Problem When True Price = \*L\*

If true price is revealed to be \*L\*, at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/bZu6YyV](https://imgur.com/bZu6YyV)

&amp;#x200B;

Not as bad as the previous case, but even covering at \*L\* will push price a little bit higher and cut into the hedgies' profits.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

\# F. Naked Short Selling

Naked short selling removes the unravelling problem at no cost to the manipulator. It's quite literally free money:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Naked short selling and manipulating the price downward provide cash returns to the manipulator, who can withdraw cash from his clearing firm account as the shorted shares are marked to market at progressively lower prices. Through naked shorting, the manipulator realizes these returns without investing any cash (provided the market price never rises above the sale price). (Pg. 34, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The clearing firm retains the cash proceeds from the short sale to secure the selling broker’s delivery obligation. The clearing firm releases cash equal to the reduction in value of the shorted shares as the price of the shares declines (or demands additional cash margin if the share price rises). (Pg. 34, footnote 51)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The daily trading volume could be quite high if the manipulator is rapidly turning over its short position, but the daily trading and settlement activity may appear to be normal market making because the dealer’s net position on the day does not change. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Pumping the trading volume also reduces the short interest ratio (short interest divided by the average daily trading volume) to help conceal the manipulation. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&amp;#x200B;

\-\*\*Remember naked shorting creates phantom shares which increases the float.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## True Shares Outstanding

Based on the original demand curve we can calculate the total shares outstanding at time 0. Since this is during the initial conditions, this is the true value of shares outstanding. Also, since uninformed investors are always willing to buy at a lower price and, hypothetically, if the long term investors decided to sell all outstanding shares \*Q\* to uninformed traders then price would fall to \*L\*:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/XvdyUdR](https://imgur.com/XvdyUdR)

&amp;#x200B;

\## Naked Short Selling in Pooling Equilibrium

\### When True Price = \*H\*

Using the previous equations we can find the amount of shares necessary to drive the final price at time 3 close to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/ajXUX57](https://imgur.com/ajXUX57)

&amp;#x200B;

\### When True Price = \*L\*

Same process with \*L\*:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/SFtQhxT](https://imgur.com/SFtQhxT)

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth noting,

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The manipulators profit depends on his ability to manipulate the firm's stock price and keep it depressed. The stronger the financial condition of the firm at time 3 (the higher \*L\* is), the greater the number of shares the manipulator has to sell short at time 3 to drive the price close to zero. (Pg. 45, par. 2)

&amp;#x200B;

\## More Shorted Shares than Outstanding

We have the true shares outstanding, we know the amount of shares needed to short an \*H\* valued company to zero, and the amount of shares needed to short a \*L\* valued company to zero.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/ARDbaTI](https://imgur.com/ARDbaTI)

&amp;#x200B;

\### When Value Is \*H\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Building a short position of \*H/B\* to drive \*P(3)\* to zero would involve naked shorting more shares than the firm has outstanding because \*H/B &gt; (A-L)/B\*. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The manipulator can not drive the share price close to zero unless he can naked short an extraordinary number of shares. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

So to drive the \*H\* company to zero hedgies have to naked short \*Q\_H\* shares. But remember our general equations governing the demand curve:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/s4sgfbA](https://imgur.com/s4sgfbA)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Proving that if hedgies want to short a company with a high intrinsic value to zero they must short more shares that are in existence.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\### When Value is \*L\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Even if the manipulator's short position is \*L/B\*, it might still exceed the entire number of shares the firm has outstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

If \*L=P(2)\* then the manipulator will naked short the same number of shares that the firm has outstanding. This next equation should look familiar:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/lOKPPaH](https://imgur.com/lOKPPaH)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So then if \*L&gt;P(2)\* then the manipulator will naked short more shares than firm has outstanding. By naked shorting the same number of shares that are outstanding, the manipulator has doubled the float. (Pg. 55, footnote 77)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## Naked Short Selling In Separating Equilibrium

In separating equilibrium, the manipulator scares the other participants away with unconcealed aggressive naked shorting. This maximizes profits by eliminating competition. Since the manipulator has price control it doesn't matter whether the time 3 price should be $H$ or $L$. The lack of competition also makes this strategy a bit more formulaic than the previous examples. The manipulator maximizes his short sale proceeds by naked shorting at time 1 (Pg. 48 par. 1, Pg. 54-55, par. 1):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/HdY6wSH](https://imgur.com/HdY6wSH)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;This has occurred with a huge volume of naked shorting and a precipitous decrease in share price that first cut the price in half and then reduced it close to zero. (Pg. 46, par. 2)

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# G. Inverted Demand Curve

First, lets put the original general demand curve into slope intercept:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/CNQn7f6](https://imgur.com/CNQn7f6)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, this is a line with a downwards slope of \*-B\*. Recall that B is the price that retail buys at which is always lower than the prevailing price. That means that as retail acquires more and more shares, the price/demand will decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/kS0jSte](https://imgur.com/kS0jSte)

&amp;#x200B;

With apes, however, it works the opposite way. Yes, we'll buy at any prices, but what I think fucked up the algorithm is we buy at higher and higher prices because ape and FOMO. In this case, demand and price increase as supply increases. Meaning that if apes got all the shares, the price would rise to \*H\* This changes the slope of the demand curve positive:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/xEI3qBB](https://imgur.com/xEI3qBB)

&amp;#x200B;

What I gathered from this is most of the hedgies' problem results from a simple change in sign. I take this a bit further and apply it to the exponential and log curves. I figure that the inverse of these functions is what fucked up what the algorithm originally intended.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# H. Exponential vs. Logarithmic

The following list has the floors calculated by u/JTH1 and the inverted version of the curve the hedgies originally had planned.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/62uNWKr](https://imgur.com/62uNWKr)

&amp;#x200B;

\## What Hedgies Were Expecting

Based on the inverse theory, I think this is more what the hedgies were expecting: (I tried to keep the scaling to a minimum, but I apologize for the the monstrosity of equations you might see):

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/undefined](https://imgur.com/undefined)

&amp;#x200B;

Red curve is (27) and blue curve is (28).

&amp;#x200B;

\## What Apes Did

And this is what apes did instead:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/2EkAx11](https://imgur.com/2EkAx11)

&amp;#x200B;

Blue is (29) and red is (30)

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if there's anything significant here, but laying lines tangent to curves got me thinking of \~\~calculus\~\~ \~\~simple calculus\~\~ math black magic, which helped me figure out formula to find outstanding shares later on, so I thought it was worth mentioning.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\# I. Pareto Principle

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The Finnerty formula follows a long tail distribution similar to the Pareto Principle...aka 80/20 rule. In this case, you could drop the price 80 percent with 20 percent of shares shorted. You would then need 80 percent of shares shorted to drop price the extra 20 percent.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;In business, the term long tail is applied to rank-size distribution often form power laws and are thus long-tailed distributions in the statistical sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Hedgie Case

I thought it was interesting that the author stressed throughout the paper, that price is reduced CLOSE to zero and not zero. Remember, in separated equilibrium naked shorting drops the price by a third, then halves it before it quickly drops close to zero. 

&amp;#x200B;

That sounded like asymptotic behavior, so I was curious to see the progression to zero so I kept it going and halved \*P(2)\* again and repeated the process with my result. I assume this is happening quickly between time 2 and time 3:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/k2GMNV3](https://imgur.com/k2GMNV3)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/wY6DR1Y](https://imgur.com/wY6DR1Y)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd take it further but you get the picture. So I took the points made a scatter plot. Didn't look like much. I got curious and wanted to see if I could fit  so I decided to see if I could fit the negative exponential curve. I had to use some scaling factors, but always try to base them as a proportion of 1.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/qpuHsWN](https://imgur.com/qpuHsWN)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/nr5bP1D](https://imgur.com/nr5bP1D)

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't look like much either, but the fact that it had asymptotic behavior at 0.2 or 20 percent, I figured it might be worth mentioning.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Ape Case

Remember, in the normal case of naked shorting in separating equilibrium the price is dropped by a third, then halved, then taken close to zero.

&amp;#x200B;

In the ape case, the price increases. This is where the exponential/power function may come into play. I tried to find the rate of change by re-computing values using equations from earlier:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/7Ck0TWa](https://imgur.com/7Ck0TWa)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/c1Vygtf](https://imgur.com/c1Vygtf)

&amp;#x200B;

As with the last set of values, I wanted to examine the behavior of the ape curve between time 2 and time 3:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/qghwg2t](https://imgur.com/qghwg2t)

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like the price increases by a third, then by 1.25 or 25 percent. I did the same process of scatter and fitting curve this time with the exponential.

Also, not sure if there's anything here, but the number 0.8 or 80 percent stood out to me.

\# J. Impossible to Short to Zero

&amp;#x200B;

This time using the ape curve, I used the same process as earlier to find the amount of shares needed to drive the price close to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*These expressions violate our general demand curve rules, because all elements cannot be negative:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*This seems to imply that if apes continue their strategy the price cannot go to zero. It is mathematically impossible.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\# K. How Many Shares Are Shorted?

So far, we have equations that:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Relate \*P(t)\* to \*Q\*

2. Relate \*P(t)\* to \*t\* 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to find a expression that can relate \*Q\* and \*t\*.

First, I set equal to each other:

&amp;#x200B;

\# L. Yes, But What Does It Mean?

\*\*What I can't figure out is what the asymptotic behavior represents in the model and what it implies.\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this the mathematical confirmation of what we've suspected all along, that it is no longer possible for hedgies to dilute the float meaningfully?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this the stalemate that occurs when the shares are being bought at higher rate?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is this the amount retail holds?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this is significant, but I don't know how."

Highest shorted stock and a small cap stock what else can I say.

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We   all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The   people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public   money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to   make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The   government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already   zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These   petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse   has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and   increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue   for companies.
5. Workhorse   has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with   their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and   charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of   commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery   step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to   deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes   after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any   retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think   about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets   for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie   Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately   (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has   since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that   is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten   beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her   funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called   Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers   unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially   short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I   couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider   nonetheless.
8. In   April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in   comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group   placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several   hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks   and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're   limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks   within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of  commodity  raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire  industry,  including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get  worked out as  it always does because every company wants to increase  their sales. In  addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with  Coulomb Solutions,  Inc. to supply their batteries. This company  distributes for the largest  EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric   trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so   Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing   that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed   up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter   &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter   has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction,   and assembly.
12. There   are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we   know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has   actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales   for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to   approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a   significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The   stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6   billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the   stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in.   This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This   one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor   does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS   or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6  billion  contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In  addition, the  USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the  direction of the  contract, is being investigated by the FBI for  possible fraudulent  activity. There is concern that he may have made  the decision based on  political contributions. Several Ohio Congress  members are also  requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured  that no political  influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of  granting it to  Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again  becomes up for  grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If  that happens,  watch out because the loss of this contract is what put  downward  pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about  GN-z11, the  furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied   volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive   option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a   big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There   are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold   and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE   recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are   even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities,   Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and   Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This   stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40%  of  its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out   there.

It's very   important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect   it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is   going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short   sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down   and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to   feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to   process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not   having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you   selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If   you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you   hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their   short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to   assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold   and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because   the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying   shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember   the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its   float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it   eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also,   understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than  you  or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't   make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money   from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They   make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers   to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous   studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts   randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform   the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve   distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the   natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS   fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research   analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE   recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

My 10 year anniversiary (LONG),https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/nvmilv/my_10_year_anniversiary_long/,bb12102,1,2021-06-09 11:49:30,17,/r/diabetes_t1/comments/nvmilv/my_10_year_anniversiary_long/,Other,"Hello everyone,

As of today I have officially been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes for ten years. I'm currently 25 and turning 26 in a couple weeks. I just wanted to write out my past ten years more for myself, but maybe it can help people on here that are worried about what is to come.

It all started in May of 2011 when my family went down to NYC for a long weekend. While I was there I had the classic being super thirsty and peeing all the time. We were walking across the Brooklyn bridge and were about half way across when I had a crazy urge to pee. With no toilets on the bridge, I could either pee off the side while tons of people walked around me, or I could run into Brooklyn just to take a pee. I chose the latter. I booked it across the bridge and only stopped when I found a bodega with a bathroom.

After we came back from Brooklyn, I was still super thirsty all the time and peeing constantly, and was looking thinner and thinner. I had gone to a buddy’s house and just randomly weighed myself on the scale in his bathroom. I noticed that I had lost around 15 pounds in about two weeks. I told my dad about it more as an “isn’t that interesting” sort of way rather than a “something is wrong” kind of way. He thought it might be serious so he booked a blood test for me a couple of days later.

Around that time in high school there was the yearly “Athletic Banquet” where everyone who was on a sports team got together.Awards were given out and we had a nice meal and dressed “fancy”. Well that night I was extra thirsty. I probably drank five cokes and a bunch of water. It was also a pasta meal and a pretty sweet dessert, but what did I know? I was just thirsty.

The next day at school two of my friends and I were getting prepped for a talent show(I was the guitar) that was happening that night around 6pm. Well, I get called down to the office around noon from my math class. I went down there thinking I was in trouble for something, but I wasn’t. The secretary said that my dad was on the phone and handed it to me. I spoke with him and he said that he was going to come and pick me up in about 30 minutes. He said that my doctor got my blood work back and called my house telling him that I needed to get to the ER as soon as I could because I had Type 1 Diabetes…. I didn’t really know what to think because I knew very little about diabetes other than the standard Type 2 Diabetes stereotypes. So, I walked back up to class and was just kind of quiet. I was sitting next to a really good friend in that class at the time so she asked me what was up and I told her. I put my head down and shed a single tear. I still remember my thought process,“Fuck, I don’t want to have to give myself needles. Oh well at least it isn't cancer”. I know, I know, diabetes can be super tough for some people based on my reading on reddit, that's how I was thinking and to be honest, that's sort of how I feel now... At the time I knew there were tons of people out there that were living fine with diabetes, andafter I thought that I was sort of okay with it all. I kinda knew that it may be reversible, but if it wasn’t, then I knew there was nothing I could do about it besides live with it and make the best of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I get picked up and we go to the ER. They tested my BG and it's so high that the meter can’t even recognize the number other than “HI”. I mean we’ve all been there before and it happens, whatever, but looking back on it I have zero doubts that it would have at least been at 40 (Canadian values). They took me in and I'm obviously really dehydrated so they put a needle in the top of my right hand and they started pumping two litres of saline into me. I'll never forget the weird feeling of ice cold liquid slowly coursing through my veins. Very surreal.

Remember that talent show that I was talking about earlier? Well to my 15/16 year old brain that's all that I cared about. So,I'm sitting there with a needle in my hand and im thinking “fuck, this needle is in the top of my strumming hand. Am I even going to be able to make it there tonight?”. I texted the people I was performing with and said that I might not be able to make it. So, during the whole time I was there, they gave me insulin to get my BG down to a readable letter and I kept hounding them that I needed to leave at some point to go play this show. They eventually relented and said that I could go, but I had to be back because they wanted me overnight in order to monitor me. It was pretty sweet, I went back to school at around 5pm and the performance was coming up shortly and we had been planning on practicing a ton after school, but now we were left with like 40 mins to get it all together. I still had the needle in my hand and it was uncomfortable but we still put on a good show. Some other friends tried to hug me when I first got to school and I had to back off because I had the needle in my hand, and didn’t want it all messed up. 

That was my first day as a Type 1 Diabetic, and that was the day I told a lot of my friends and teachers as well. I don’t know about you, but I think that's a kind of cool first day of being diabetic if you ask me! Everyone’s is memorable, but I think being able to go back and play gave me the confidence that I was going to be okay. It’ll be a learning curve for sure, but that's the only way to find out!

That first night in the hospital they woke me up every couple hours to check BG and gave me some insulin. Overall, it wasn’t that bad other than them being a little heavy handed with the lancet.

The next couple days were pretty much me and my family learning about T1D and how to manage it. The basics really: how to count carbs, what to avoid, how to give myself insulin and test. All that jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about two weeks later. I'm getting more comfortable with it all, I’ve gotten nothing but support from all my friends and family. I'm still in the honeymoon phase for my BG and my friends are getting more interested in the whole process as well. This all turned into people betting on what my BG would be at lunch every day and they would ask questions on what I’ve eaten that day and what my BG was when I woke up. It was pretty fun and it sure made light of the whole situation in a really awesome way. I always allowed anyone to give me insulin for lunch, I would obviously set the amount and instruct the new people on how to do it. So, I gave tons of people a unique opportunity for them to give someone a needle. It was pretty fun and never had any issues. It was ultimately just a part of being me going forward, so why not have some fun with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Having this lax view on my diabetes doesn’t mean that I was negligent with it. My A1C’s were always 7 or lower in that first year. I think that having a relaxed view on diabetes is a very healthy thing to do if you can because ultimately, there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. It’s sticking around no matter how much you want it gone, so it's best not to make it a huge part of your personality. 

Over the next year and a half I was on Lantus for continuous insulin and Novo Rapid for fast acting. My dad had heard about a study at a semi local university that was doing clinical research for getting the original Medtronic Enlite sensor approved in Canada. The program gave you a free Medtronic Paradigm pump, a year of pump sites,reservoirs, and six months or a year supply of the sensors for free. I was against it at first because I was fairly active and thought the pump would get caught on a bunch of stuff and be annoying to have on all the time. I did end up going through the program and let me tell you, moving to a pump is way better (for me at least). Conversely, that year when I was in the program was the absolute worst my diabetes was. My A1C maxed out at 9.8, and I attribute all of it to the first version of that sensor. I found it completely terrible, and my blood readings were constantly about 50% off. It was awful. I petitioned to stop using them, which they granted because they saw the bad results. That experience left a very bad taste in my mouth for CGMs for several years. I was able to keep the pump and I used it up until I had to upgrade to a 670G about two years ago.

I was around 17/18 at this time, but had been diagnosed just before my 16th birthday. Of course during that time in high school kids are wanting to experiment with a bunch of different things like drugs and booze. I was really worried about the effects that alcohol and cannabis would have on me. My mom had a boss with T1D that she had me sit down with and talk about alcohol and the effects it has on BG and the kind of drinks that he would order. It helped a bunch and made me feel more comfortable with drinking. I was still cautious though because I didn’t want to get caught drinking under age. I still partied a decent amount but I didn’t really start drinking until I was around 18. I had learned how my body reacts and how to deal with it as well.

I was really worried about cannabis more so because it was illegal rather than the effects it’d have on my BG. The Canadian diabetes center or something said that the effect cannabis has on diabetes was more so brought on by the munchies rather than smoking itself. I tried it a few times when I was 18 and kind of left it alone until I was about 22. I started smoking maybe once a week or less at that time and still smoke that much now . I find it very relaxing, and as long as I keep the munchies in check or have some low carb snack at the ready it's all good. I find being drunk much harder to manage BG than being high. Obviously your results may vary but that's what I find works for me.

I've just been living a semi-normal life. I went through college and worked for five years in finance. I learned a lot. I've had a couple of girlfriends in that time and they all have been understanding of diabetes and the small limitations/issues. My current GF I’ve been with for seven years and it's awesome having someone so ingrained in your life that gets how you react and is understanding of the issues that pop up from time to time. But I don’t rely on her or anyone else for support for my diabetes. It's awesome to have people to fall back on but at the end of the day, it is my issue that I need to deal with. If for whatever reason I didn’t have my GF, friends or family, or I had them and they weren’t supportive, I'd still have to deal with it. So that's sort of how I have taught myself to think about it and how I treat it as well. It's something that I can’t ignore, but I don’t let it take over my entire day. Sure it's in the back of my mind, but I don’t lose any sleep over it.

&amp;#x200B;

People ask me questions a bunch when they find out I have diabetes and I field all of their questions. I personally love talking to people about it! If they ask something that is misinformation, like the classic “did you get diabetes because you ate a lot of candy?”. I just correct them, it's no big deal that all their information comes from their grandparent that had T2, or comes from “diabetuus” memes. No need to be mean or rude responding back. Sure it can get annoying having the same question asked over and over, making it sound ignorant to you, but I love opening the dialogue up with people. I leave having made some kind of meaningful connection with a stranger I may never see again, and they left with some clarified information from a diabetic in the flesh! 

Embrace that you have diabetes, don’t get upset at people who have no knowledge of diabetes, because if you were like me, you didn’t really know what it was all about until diagnosis. People don’t know what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. I try to describe it as such, look at all of these various charity foundations around. There are a ton that you come across that are named after a person who died of cancer for example. All of the money that they raise goes into research because that family had to deal with the loss of someone they love and they want to help others in the future not have the same experience that they had. Now these families who started these charities probably only had a basic knowledge of cancer, for example, and they had to learn a lot about it and the variety of cancer now that it was in their world. So again, people don’t know about what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. Be a person who provides good information, try not to get frustrated. Sure it's easy to say that, but I have no issues. You can't fault someone for learning something new, can you?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that mental health can be greatly affected by having diabetes and the stress of it all. It may seem that I don’t have any stress, and my diabetes is just whatever, and there are a lot of people who wish they could have the outlook on it like I do, but if you’re reading this and are having mental health issues of any kind, diabetes related or not, talk to someone. Reach out to a therapist, a psychologist, a doctor, anyone who can help. It is worth it, trust me. I've had issues on how I see my future with my career and a lot of my stress came from my view on finances and how I was afraid to spend money. I had done some talking about life with my friends one on one in the past couple of years and that is great. You find out that everyone is uncertain and everyone has their issues, but your friends are close to you and the advice that family and friends, even though they may not intend for it to be, comes from what they may think is best for you. It doesn’t matter who they are(I don’t know if “ulterior motives” is the term to use), but they base answers on how they know you as a person and what they think would be best for you and possibly them. You really need a third party. I finally broke and decided to spend the money on a psychologist a couple of months ago and now I'm feeling great. I needed that push and insight from an uninvolved third party to give me the confidence in applying to new jobs, to actually accepting a job offer, and going into a really cool new industry. In all it was about five sessions that were bi-weekly.

You should try it out if it's possible and you’re having issues. It is not as weird and awkward as you think, trust me and I found its worth the money if you can afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's been an okay ten years, I think? I’ve learned a lot, I’ve met a lot of cool people, and I haven’t let diabetes rule my entire life. I do pretty much what everyone else does. I eat whatever I feel like, in moderation of course, and I just make prudent decisions without burdening myself. 

I guess what I want to say is to have people who are newly diagnosed or just struggling know that it's okay. It's something that needs to be dealt with and you can’t run away from it. It's okay to have high or low BG every once in a while. It's okay to feel stressed and frustrated about it but that's not an excuse to totally disregard it. It's okay to have bad days. But most importantly, be easy on yourself.

Anyways, ask questions if you made it this far. I know it's quite the wall of text, but I'm open to anything!

Why must Chartered Accountants learn Data science and other programming languages?,https://www.reddit.com/r/FAQ_WPURISE/comments/nvsi41/why_must_chartered_accountants_learn_data_science/,WPU_RISE,1,2021-06-09 18:26:34,0,/r/FAQ_WPURISE/comments/nvsi41/why_must_chartered_accountants_learn_data_science/,NaN,"Accounting has predominantly been the arena of analysing business transactions and thus needs analytical skills, which is quite similar to [data science](https://analyticsindiamag.com/not-everyone-can-become-a-data-scientist-says-prof-charanpreet-singh-of-praxis-business-school/). So the requirements in accountancy are pretty identical to what the data science domain necessitates; therefore, an accountancy knowledge for a professional can be highly beneficial to mark your niche in a competitive industry. Moreover, with a knowledge of finance and management, accountants can easily remain ahead of the curve for reading financial data, which is ever-expanding. 

Chartered Accountants are very well versed with finance and tax laws.

Most of the tasks that chartered accountants perform are repetitive and can be automated to reduce any extra burden. If you do not automate your task, someone else will do it. Being a CA is a very hardworking job and believe me, you will strengthen your productivity by automating most of your tasks. GST number verification, Project report preparation, Tax audit reports with a schedule can be fully automated.

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.
5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

Position: 5000 shares @ $11

My 10 year anniversary (LONG),https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/nvuy5z/my_10_year_anniversary_long/,bb12102,1,2021-06-09 20:39:36,3,/r/diabetes/comments/nvuy5z/my_10_year_anniversary_long/,Type 1,"Hello everyone,

As of yesterday I have officially been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes for ten years. I'm currently 25 and turning 26 in a couple weeks. I just wanted to write out my past ten years more for myself, but maybe it can help people on here that are worried about what is to come.

It all started in May of 2011 when my family went down to NYC for a long weekend. While I was there I had the classic being super thirsty and peeing all the time. We were walking across the Brooklyn bridge and were about half way across when I had a crazy urge to pee. With no toilets on the bridge, I could either pee off the side while tons of people walked around me, or I could run into Brooklyn just to take a pee. I chose the latter. I booked it across the bridge and only stopped when I found a bodega with a bathroom.

After we came back from Brooklyn, I was still super thirsty all the time and peeing constantly, and was looking thinner and thinner. I had gone to a buddy’s house and just randomly weighed myself on the scale in his bathroom. I noticed that I had lost around 15 pounds in about two weeks. I told my dad about it more as an “isn’t that interesting” sort of way rather than a “something is wrong” kind of way. He thought it might be serious so he booked a blood test for me a couple of days later.

Around that time in high school there was the yearly “Athletic Banquet” where everyone who was on a sports team got together.Awards were given out and we had a nice meal and dressed “fancy”. Well that night I was extra thirsty. I probably drank five cokes and a bunch of water. It was also a pasta meal and a pretty sweet dessert, but what did I know? I was just thirsty.

The next day at school two of my friends and I were getting prepped for a talent show(I was the guitar) that was happening that night around 6pm. Well, I get called down to the office around noon from my math class. I went down there thinking I was in trouble for something, but I wasn’t. The secretary said that my dad was on the phone and handed it to me. I spoke with him and he said that he was going to come and pick me up in about 30 minutes. He said that my doctor got my blood work back and called my house telling him that I needed to get to the ER as soon as I could because I had Type 1 Diabetes…. I didn’t really know what to think because I knew very little about diabetes other than the standard Type 2 Diabetes stereotypes. So, I walked back up to class and was just kind of quiet. I was sitting next to a really good friend in that class at the time so she asked me what was up and I told her. I put my head down and shed a single tear. I still remember my thought process,“Fuck, I don’t want to have to give myself needles. Oh well at least it isn't cancer”. I know, I know, diabetes can be super tough for some people based on my reading on reddit, that's how I was thinking and to be honest, that's sort of how I feel now... At the time I knew there were tons of people out there that were living fine with diabetes, andafter I thought that I was sort of okay with it all. I kinda knew that it may be reversible, but if it wasn’t, then I knew there was nothing I could do about it besides live with it and make the best of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I get picked up and we go to the ER. They tested my BG and it's so high that the meter can’t even recognize the number other than “HI”. I mean we’ve all been there before and it happens, whatever, but looking back on it I have zero doubts that it would have at least been at 40 (Canadian values). They took me in and I'm obviously really dehydrated so they put a needle in the top of my right hand and they started pumping two litres of saline into me. I'll never forget the weird feeling of ice cold liquid slowly coursing through my veins. Very surreal.

Remember that talent show that I was talking about earlier? Well to my 15/16 year old brain that's all that I cared about. So,I'm sitting there with a needle in my hand and im thinking “fuck, this needle is in the top of my strumming hand. Am I even going to be able to make it there tonight?”. I texted the people I was performing with and said that I might not be able to make it. So, during the whole time I was there, they gave me insulin to get my BG down to a readable letter and I kept hounding them that I needed to leave at some point to go play this show. They eventually relented and said that I could go, but I had to be back because they wanted me overnight in order to monitor me. It was pretty sweet, I went back to school at around 5pm and the performance was coming up shortly and we had been planning on practicing a ton after school, but now we were left with like 40 mins to get it all together. I still had the needle in my hand and it was uncomfortable but we still put on a good show. Some other friends tried to hug me when I first got to school and I had to back off because I had the needle in my hand, and didn’t want it all messed up. 

That was my first day as a Type 1 Diabetic, and that was the day I told a lot of my friends and teachers as well. I don’t know about you, but I think that's a kind of cool first day of being diabetic if you ask me! Everyone’s is memorable, but I think being able to go back and play gave me the confidence that I was going to be okay. It’ll be a learning curve for sure, but that's the only way to find out!

That first night in the hospital they woke me up every couple hours to check BG and gave me some insulin. Overall, it wasn’t that bad other than them being a little heavy handed with the lancet.

The next couple days were pretty much me and my family learning about T1D and how to manage it. The basics really: how to count carbs, what to avoid, how to give myself insulin and test. All that jazz.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about two weeks later. I'm getting more comfortable with it all, I’ve gotten nothing but support from all my friends and family. I'm still in the honeymoon phase for my BG and my friends are getting more interested in the whole process as well. This all turned into people betting on what my BG would be at lunch every day and they would ask questions on what I’ve eaten that day and what my BG was when I woke up. It was pretty fun and it sure made light of the whole situation in a really awesome way. I always allowed anyone to give me insulin for lunch, I would obviously set the amount and instruct the new people on how to do it. So, I gave tons of people a unique opportunity for them to give someone a needle. It was pretty fun and never had any issues. It was ultimately just a part of being me going forward, so why not have some fun with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Having this lax view on my diabetes doesn’t mean that I was negligent with it. My A1C’s were always 7 or lower in that first year. I think that having a relaxed view on diabetes is a very healthy thing to do if you can because ultimately, there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. It’s sticking around no matter how much you want it gone, so it's best not to make it a huge part of your personality. 

Over the next year and a half I was on Lantus for continuous insulin and Novo Rapid for fast acting. My dad had heard about a study at a semi local university that was doing clinical research for getting the original Medtronic Enlite sensor approved in Canada. The program gave you a free Medtronic Paradigm pump, a year of pump sites,reservoirs, and six months or a year supply of the sensors for free. I was against it at first because I was fairly active and thought the pump would get caught on a bunch of stuff and be annoying to have on all the time. I did end up going through the program and let me tell you, moving to a pump is way better (for me at least). Conversely, that year when I was in the program was the absolute worst my diabetes was. My A1C maxed out at 9.8, and I attribute all of it to the first version of that sensor. I found it completely terrible, and my blood readings were constantly about 50% off. It was awful. I petitioned to stop using them, which they granted because they saw the bad results. That experience left a very bad taste in my mouth for CGMs for several years. I was able to keep the pump and I used it up until I had to upgrade to a 670G about two years ago.

I was around 17/18 at this time, but had been diagnosed just before my 16th birthday. Of course during that time in high school kids are wanting to experiment with a bunch of different things like drugs and booze. I was really worried about the effects that alcohol and cannabis would have on me. My mom had a boss with T1D that she had me sit down with and talk about alcohol and the effects it has on BG and the kind of drinks that he would order. It helped a bunch and made me feel more comfortable with drinking. I was still cautious though because I didn’t want to get caught drinking under age. I still partied a decent amount but I didn’t really start drinking until I was around 18. I had learned how my body reacts and how to deal with it as well.

I was really worried about cannabis more so because it was illegal rather than the effects it’d have on my BG. The Canadian diabetes center or something said that the effect cannabis has on diabetes was more so brought on by the munchies rather than smoking itself. I tried it a few times when I was 18 and kind of left it alone until I was about 22. I started smoking maybe once a week or less at that time and still smoke that much now . I find it very relaxing, and as long as I keep the munchies in check or have some low carb snack at the ready it's all good. I find being drunk much harder to manage BG than being high. Obviously your results may vary but that's what I find works for me.

I've just been living a semi-normal life. I went through college and worked for five years in finance. I learned a lot. I've had a couple of girlfriends in that time and they all have been understanding of diabetes and the small limitations/issues. My current GF I’ve been with for seven years and it's awesome having someone so ingrained in your life that gets how you react and is understanding of the issues that pop up from time to time. But I don’t rely on her or anyone else for support for my diabetes. It's awesome to have people to fall back on but at the end of the day, it is my issue that I need to deal with. If for whatever reason I didn’t have my GF, friends or family, or I had them and they weren’t supportive, I'd still have to deal with it. So that's sort of how I have taught myself to think about it and how I treat it as well. It's something that I can’t ignore, but I don’t let it take over my entire day. Sure it's in the back of my mind, but I don’t lose any sleep over it.

&amp;#x200B;

People ask me questions a bunch when they find out I have diabetes and I field all of their questions. I personally love talking to people about it! If they ask something that is misinformation, like the classic “did you get diabetes because you ate a lot of candy?”. I just correct them, it's no big deal that all their information comes from their grandparent that had T2, or comes from “diabetuus” memes. No need to be mean or rude responding back. Sure it can get annoying having the same question asked over and over, making it sound ignorant to you, but I love opening the dialogue up with people. I leave having made some kind of meaningful connection with a stranger I may never see again, and they left with some clarified information from a diabetic in the flesh! 

Embrace that you have diabetes, don’t get upset at people who have no knowledge of diabetes, because if you were like me, you didn’t really know what it was all about until diagnosis. People don’t know what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. I try to describe it as such, look at all of these various charity foundations around. There are a ton that you come across that are named after a person who died of cancer for example. All of the money that they raise goes into research because that family had to deal with the loss of someone they love and they want to help others in the future not have the same experience that they had. Now these families who started these charities probably only had a basic knowledge of cancer, for example, and they had to learn a lot about it and the variety of cancer now that it was in their world. So again, people don’t know about what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. Be a person who provides good information, try not to get frustrated. Sure it's easy to say that, but I have no issues. You can't fault someone for learning something new, can you?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that mental health can be greatly affected by having diabetes and the stress of it all. It may seem that I don’t have any stress, and my diabetes is just whatever, and there are a lot of people who wish they could have the outlook on it like I do, but if you’re reading this and are having mental health issues of any kind, diabetes related or not, talk to someone. Reach out to a therapist, a psychologist, a doctor, anyone who can help. It is worth it, trust me. I've had issues on how I see my future with my career and a lot of my stress came from my view on finances and how I was afraid to spend money. I had done some talking about life with my friends one on one in the past couple of years and that is great. You find out that everyone is uncertain and everyone has their issues, but your friends are close to you and the advice that family and friends, even though they may not intend for it to be, comes from what they may think is best for you. It doesn’t matter who they are(I don’t know if “ulterior motives” is the term to use), but they base answers on how they know you as a person and what they think would be best for you and possibly them. You really need a third party. I finally broke and decided to spend the money on a psychologist a couple of months ago and now I'm feeling great. I needed that push and insight from an uninvolved third party to give me the confidence in applying to new jobs, to actually accepting a job offer, and going into a really cool new industry. In all it was about five sessions that were bi-weekly.

You should try it out if it's possible and you’re having issues. It is not as weird and awkward as you think, trust me and I found its worth the money if you can afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's been an okay ten years, I think? I’ve learned a lot, I’ve met a lot of cool people, and I haven’t let diabetes rule my entire life. I do pretty much what everyone else does. I eat whatever I feel like, in moderation of course, and I just make prudent decisions without burdening myself. 

I guess what I want to say is to have people who are newly diagnosed or just struggling know that it's okay. It's something that needs to be dealt with and you can’t run away from it. It's okay to have high or low BG every once in a while. It's okay to feel stressed and frustrated about it but that's not an excuse to totally disregard it. It's okay to have bad days. But most importantly, be easy on yourself.

Anyways, ask questions if you made it this far. I know it's quite the wall of text, but I'm open to anything!

This all turned into people betting on what my BG would be at lunch every day and they would ask questions on what I’ve eaten that day and what my BG was when I woke up. It was pretty fun and it sure made light of the whole situation in a really awesome way. I always allowed anyone to give me insulin for lunch, I would obviously set the amount and instruct the new people on how to do it. So, I gave tons of people a unique opportunity for them to give someone a needle. It was pretty fun and never had any issues. It was ultimately just a part of being me going forward, so why not have some fun with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Having this lax view on my diabetes doesn’t mean that I was negligent with it. My A1C’s were always 7 or lower in that first year. I think that having a relaxed view on diabetes is a very healthy thing to do if you can because ultimately, there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. It’s sticking around no matter how much you want it gone, so it's best not to make it a huge part of your personality. 

Over the next year and a half I was on Lantus for continuous insulin and Novo Rapid for fast acting. My dad had heard about a study at a semi local university that was doing clinical research for getting the original Medtronic Enlite sensor approved in Canada. The program gave you a free Medtronic Paradigm pump, a year of pump sites,reservoirs, and six months or a year supply of the sensors for free. I was against it at first because I was fairly active and thought the pump would get caught on a bunch of stuff and be annoying to have on all the time. I did end up going through the program and let me tell you, moving to a pump is way better (for me at least). Conversely, that year when I was in the program was the absolute worst my diabetes was. My A1C maxed out at 9.8, and I attribute all of it to the first version of that sensor. I found it completely terrible, and my blood readings were constantly about 50% off. It was awful. I petitioned to stop using them, which they granted because they saw the bad results. That experience left a very bad taste in my mouth for CGMs for several years. I was able to keep the pump and I used it up until I had to upgrade to a 670G about two years ago.

I was around 17/18 at this time, but had been diagnosed just before my 16th birthday. Of course during that time in high school kids are wanting to experiment with a bunch of different things like drugs and booze. I was really worried about the effects that alcohol and cannabis would have on me. My mom had a boss with T1D that she had me sit down with and talk about alcohol and the effects it has on BG and the kind of drinks that he would order. It helped a bunch and made me feel more comfortable with drinking. I was still cautious though because I didn’t want to get caught drinking under age. I still partied a decent amount but I didn’t really start drinking until I was around 18. I had learned how my body reacts and how to deal with it as well.

I was really worried about cannabis more so because it was illegal rather than the effects it’d have on my BG. The Canadian diabetes center or something said that the effect cannabis has on diabetes was more so brought on by the munchies rather than smoking itself. I tried it a few times when I was 18 and kind of left it alone until I was about 22. I started smoking maybe once a week or less at that time and still smoke that much now . I find it very relaxing, and as long as I keep the munchies in check or have some low carb snack at the ready it's all good. I find being drunk much harder to manage BG than being high. Obviously your results may vary but that's what I find works for me.

I've just been living a semi-normal life. I went through college and worked for five years in finance. I learned a lot. I've had a couple of girlfriends in that time and they all have been understanding of diabetes and the small limitations/issues. My current GF I’ve been with for seven years and it's awesome having someone so ingrained in your life that gets how you react and is understanding of the issues that pop up from time to time. But I don’t rely on her or anyone else for support for my diabetes. It's awesome to have people to fall back on but at the end of the day, it is my issue that I need to deal with. If for whatever reason I didn’t have my GF, friends or family, or I had them and they weren’t supportive, I'd still have to deal with it. So that's sort of how I have taught myself to think about it and how I treat it as well. It's something that I can’t ignore, but I don’t let it take over my entire day. Sure it's in the back of my mind, but I don’t lose any sleep over it.

&amp;#x200B;

People ask me questions a bunch when they find out I have diabetes and I field all of their questions. I personally love talking to people about it! If they ask something that is misinformation, like the classic “did you get diabetes because you ate a lot of candy?”. I just correct them, it's no big deal that all their information comes from their grandparent that had T2, or comes from “diabetuus” memes. No need to be mean or rude responding back. Sure it can get annoying having the same question asked over and over, making it sound ignorant to you, but I love opening the dialogue up with people. I leave having made some kind of meaningful connection with a stranger I may never see again, and they left with some clarified information from a diabetic in the flesh! 

Embrace that you have diabetes, don’t get upset at people who have no knowledge of diabetes, because if you were like me, you didn’t really know what it was all about until diagnosis. People don’t know what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. I try to describe it as such, look at all of these various charity foundations around. There are a ton that you come across that are named after a person who died of cancer for example. All of the money that they raise goes into research because that family had to deal with the loss of someone they love and they want to help others in the future not have the same experience that they had. Now these families who started these charities probably only had a basic knowledge of cancer, for example, and they had to learn a lot about it and the variety of cancer now that it was in their world. So again, people don’t know about what they don’t know until they have to, and that is okay. Be a person who provides good information, try not to get frustrated. Sure it's easy to say that, but I have no issues. You can't fault someone for learning something new, can you?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that mental health can be greatly affected by having diabetes and the stress of it all. It may seem that I don’t have any stress, and my diabetes is just whatever, and there are a lot of people who wish they could have the outlook on it like I do, but if you’re reading this and are having mental health issues of any kind, diabetes related or not, talk to someone. Reach out to a therapist, a psychologist, a doctor, anyone who can help. It is worth it, trust me. I've had issues on how I see my future with my career and a lot of my stress came from my view on finances and how I was afraid to spend money. I had done some talking about life with my friends one on one in the past couple of years and that is great. You find out that everyone is uncertain and everyone has their issues, but your friends are close to you and the advice that family and friends, even though they may not intend for it to be, comes from what they may think is best for you. It doesn’t matter who they are(I don’t know if “ulterior motives” is the term to use), but they base answers on how they know you as a person and what they think would be best for you and possibly them. You really need a third party. I finally broke and decided to spend the money on a psychologist a couple of months ago and now I'm feeling great. I needed that push and insight from an uninvolved third party to give me the confidence in applying to new jobs, to actually accepting a job offer, and going into a really cool new industry. In all it was about five sessions that were bi-weekly.

You should try it out if it's possible and you’re having issues. It is not as weird and awkward as you think, trust me and I found its worth the money if you can afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's been an okay ten years, I think? I’ve learned a lot, I’ve met a lot of cool people, and I haven’t let diabetes rule my entire life. I do pretty much what everyone else does. I eat whatever I feel like, in moderation of course, and I just make prudent decisions without burdening myself. 

I guess what I want to say is to have people who are newly diagnosed or just struggling know that it's okay. It's something that needs to be dealt with and you can’t run away from it. It's okay to have high or low BG every once in a while. It's okay to feel stressed and frustrated about it but that's not an excuse to totally disregard it. It's okay to have bad days. But most importantly, be easy on yourself.

Anyways, ask questions if you made it this far. I know it's quite the wall of text, but I'm open to anything!

TLDR: diabetes diagnosis story, some tidbits about life and its okay to have diabetes. "

Interest Rate Volatility and Inflation Hedge (IVOL ETF) by Quadratic Capital,https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nw6kh3/interest_rate_volatility_and_inflation_hedge_ivol/,amateurflaneur,1,2021-06-10 05:15:29,7,/r/Burryology/comments/nw6kh3/interest_rate_volatility_and_inflation_hedge_ivol/,Stock Pick - Current,"Hi folks, I thought I would share the [IVOL ETF \[Yahoo Finance\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IVOL/) ticker for anyone interested in a more 'defensive' financial instrument relating to Burry's *inflation* and *interest rate* thesis. 

*This is not necessarily the perfect instrument for the situation at hand, I see this as just another tool in your Burry toolbox.*

Holding IVOL is (a lot) less aggressive than Burry's call options positions in [TTT \[Yahoo Finance\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTT?p=TTT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) and [TBT \[Yahoo Finance\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TBT?p=TBT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)  (remember both are bets on falling 20+ year treasury bond index levels). IVOL is more like a hedge **within** an existing equities portfolio.

I'm not a fixed income connaisseur and only came across IVOL recently because I've been following [Nancy Davis \[LinkedIn\]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancyquadratic/) (who manages the IVOL ETF) ever since I saw her an [interview back in 2019 \[YouTube\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCFmya19Cs).

# About

&gt;IVOL seeks to protect purchasing power, mitigate inflation risk, profit from an increase in volatility and a steepening of the yield curve, and provide inflation-protected income. At the same time, the fund looks to provide investors with access to the OTC interest rate options market – a market largely not previously available to individual investors – to provide structured solutions that offer an attractive risk/reward profile.

Source: [IVOL Homepage](https://www.ivoletf.com/) 

&gt;• IVOL provides access to OTC rates which is the largest asset class and also provides the potential for differentiated performance from stocks and bonds.   
&gt;  
&gt;• IVOL’s OTC rates options provide **exposure to the shape of the yield curve, which is largely a result of inflation expectations**. Thus, **the options have the potential to increase in value with a normalization of inflation expectations and therefore function similar to options on inflation expectations.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Through its options, **IVOL is long OTC fixed income volatility, providing potential profit from market stress as volatility increases.**

# Performance

&gt;So far, the results have been positive, with IVOL posting a 12-month return of 18.17%, including 2.81% so far in 2021, while the bond market has sold off. Last year’s performance included a positive return during March’s meltdown, she points out. By comparison, the iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) returned a much lower 7.62% over the past 12 months and minus 0.94% year to date.

&gt;Why IVOL does not only own TIPS:   
&gt;  
&gt;• TIPS are set using CPI, and TIPS alone do not capture inflation expectations.   
&gt;  
&gt;• By adding fixed income options to the portfolio, IVOL gives investors a way to own inflation expectations.   
&gt;  
&gt;• It is these expectations which have a far more significant impact on the rate sensitivity of bond portfolios. IVOL gives investors another way potentially to profit from inflation rather than just waiting for their TIPS to reset.

# Correlation

&gt;• IVOL has had very low correlations with common asset classes.   
&gt;  
&gt;• More importantly, the correlation data tells us that, since inception IVOL was able to diversify a portfolio of stock and bonds.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

Shout out to u/sososhibby. One of their comments got me started down this rabbit hole and they were nice enough to give my work a quick check before I posted. They've also posted about this topic as well: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmaaaa/john_d_finnerty_excerpt_from_hoc_3_explained_pt1/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmdbzz/excerpt_from_hoc3_relevant_af_20_finnerty_fer/)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL:DR -&gt; Academic paper from finance professor proves mathematically that it is impossible to short a stock close to zero without naked shorting at least as many shares than there are outstanding.**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# A. What I Hope to Show

&amp;#x200B;

In this volume I hope to present work (by brains much more wrinkled than mine) that show beyond a reasonable doubt, something we all already know: that hedgies are indeed mathematically fuk, in that they have naked shorted **AT LEAST** the same amount of shares outstanding.

u/atobitt's [H.O.C. III](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/) mentions an [academic paper](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) titled ""*Short Selling, Death Spiral Convertibles, and the Profitability of Stock Manipulation*"" written March 2005 by John D. Finnerty, a finance professor.

In the paper, Finnerty lays out a model to examine naked short selling. In particular, he demonstrates that in order **to drive a firms price very close to zero, a manipulator MUST naked short AT LEAST the same number of shares as there are shares outstanding, doubling the float.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# B. Market Model Rundown

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, Finnerty's paper is a thing of logical and [mathematical beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty). As god tier mathematician Paul Erdős would say, ""[This one's from The Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty#Beauty_and_philosophy)"". Finnerty took a very complex system and expressed it elegantly and simply. As a math ape, it literally brought a tear to my eye when I finally understood it; which took me awhile (just because I like math doesn't make my brain any less smooth). There's no confirmation bias as sweet as mathematical confirmation bias.

&amp;#x200B;

**However**, I am quite aware of my autistic tendencies and  know most people and apes have a...*strained* relationship with math, **so I read all 73 pages of the paper so you don't have to!** I try to lay out his model as concisely as possible as to who are the participants, how the market behaves and why hedgies r thusly fuk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

MARKET PARTICIPANTS:

*Informed Investor*

* Informed investors do short sell, but do not engage in abusive or naked short selling. They locate, borrow and return shares on time.
* The informed investor has information advantage. They know if the true intrinsic value of the stock is high (*H)* or low *(L)*.
* This group only shorts stocks that legitimately have low real intrinsic value *(L)*.
* Assume there is only one informed investor in this model.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Manipulator*

* The manipulator has the information advantage as well. Through research or by observing the informed investor, they know the true intrinsic value of the stock and seek to manipulate the stock below that value.
* A manipulator can appear as an informed investor to other participants by copying the selling behavior of the informed investor.
* Manipulator can be a Market Maker (MM).

&gt;Market makers have lower shorting costs since they can sell on a downtick and do not have to commit that they will be able to borrow shares before they sell short. Market makers are granted these exceptions to facilitate their market-making activities. A strategy a manipulator can employ to reduce its cost of shorting is to register as a market maker for the target stock. If naked shorting, there is zero cost. (Pg. 17, footnote 33)

* There is only one manipulator in this model.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Active Traders*

* Think of this group as regulation abiding MM's.
* They can short sell, but do not engage in abusive or naked short selling.
* Active traders does not have as much information as the manipulator and informed investor. They do not know the true value of the stock.
   * They can interpret market signals and see what the informed investor does, which gives them information advantage over retail investors.
* They don't know if the informed investor they are watching is actually a manipulator in disguise.
* They mostly base their moves on what the informed investor (or the disguised manipulator) does and only act after they do.
* They don't know if the informed investor they are watching is actually a manipulator in disguise.
* There is more than one active trader.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Uninformed Investors*

* These are old type retail investors, not apes.
* Uninformed investors have the ultimate information disadvantage, they have no idea how much the stock is really worth.
* They always stand ready to buy more shares at lower prices than those currently prevailing, since they don't know the true intrinsic value of the stock.
* This willingness to buy provides consistent cash flow (liquidity) to short sellers.
* Uninformed investors demand for shares decreases as the amount they possess increases.
* Once this group knows the true price of the stock they will sell, providing shares to the shorts to cover.
* There are many uninformed investors.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Insiders and Long Term HODL'ers*

* Passive group that does not take an active role in the market. They neither sell nor buy shares.
* They exist in the model so there are shares for the shorts to borrow and to set the initial market price.
* Assume they own all outstanding shares.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TIME BREAKDOWN:

The paper has a timeline/progression of how the market behaves. There are three points expressed as time *t*.

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 0*

* This is right before anything happens and the model is at the initial conditions.
* All shares are held by insiders and long term investors who do not plan on selling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 1*

* This is when the short sale can be initiated by the the informed investor or the manipulator or, depending on the situation, by both of them.
* Also during this time the active traders are observing the informed investor (or a manipulator posing as one) and current market signals. They do not act during this time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 2*

* This is when the active trader takes action, they do what they saw the informed investor (or the manipulator posing as one) do.
* The short sellers from time 1 can short additional shares if they decide to.
* Market equilibrium forms at this time.
* The informed investor or the manipulator can sustain a short position until time 3 but it is less expensive to sustain it to time 2 (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Time 3*

* This is when the stocks true intrinsic value is revealed to all market participants to be *H* or *L*.
* This represents the long run, and it may be very costly for the informed investor or the manipulator to maintain a short position (unless the manipulator naked shorts and/or is a MM).
* If the legitimate shorts have not closed their short position already, this is were they cover.
* Most of the paper's focus is on what happens at  this time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

MARKET EQUILIBRIUM

At time 2, the market enters equilibrium. There are two basic forms of equilibrium: pooling and separating.

&amp;#x200B;

*Pooling*

This type of equilibrium is when the manipulator wants to remain undetected so the other market participants mistake him as an informed investor.

&amp;#x200B;

The advantage to this is that the manipulator stands less of a chance of getting caught or squeezed. On top of this, active traders may pile on to short the stock as well when they see blood in the water. This causes the price to drop even lower, helping the manipulator.

&amp;#x200B;

The disadvantage is that the manipulator loses profit to the extra competition and sole control over the price action.

&amp;#x200B;

*Separating*

This is when the manipulator doesn't care if they are detected. In some cases, they want to be detected to scare off competition. The advantage is that this strategy maximizes their profit and they have full price control. The disadvantage is they have a greater chance of getting caught or squeezed.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# E. Demand Curves &amp; The Unravelling Problem

&amp;#x200B;

*General Demand Curve:*

This whole model is governed by the uninformed investors demand, since they are the buyers. Their demand is highly dependent on the supply of shares. The uninformed traders willingness to hold *Q* shares at time *t* is summarized by the demand curve (Pg. 15):

&amp;#x200B;

[General Demand Curve](https://preview.redd.it/qq7ltye6p5471.png?width=1375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7903b6708c31b7856220cc7e43c5eae9ef1a6fd8)

&amp;#x200B;

* The function *D(Q)* represents the uninformed investors demand which is equal to the price at time *t* represented by *P(t)*.
* *H* and *L* are the potential true values of the stock revealed to active traders and uninformed investors at time 3.
* *A* is a constant representing the current market price.
* *B* is a constant representing the price at which uninformed investors buy, which is lower than the prevailing price.
* Note that at time zero, all shares are in the hands of long term investors so *P(0) = A*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*The Unravelling Problem:*

If the manipulator is not naked short selling, then they would have to cover at time 2, or at time 3 when the true price is revealed to everyone. This presents what the paper refers to as the unravelling problem.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the issue shorts face when covering their positions. Since retail knows the real price at time 3 their demand curve shifts. Buying to cover at the real price causes the price to increase. Both factors cut into profits.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Problem When True Price = H*

If true price is revealed to be *H* at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

[High Value Demand Curve](https://preview.redd.it/gy9psat1q5471.png?width=1406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8bb8df7c9eaeb9cedd22de43f4aaec67531bab3)

This is the worst case scenario for hedgies. Not only did they not suppress the price to *L* they now have to buy to cover. The number of shares retail holds *Q* goes to zero since hedgies have to buy them back, which will push the price to *H* cutting into their tendies.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Problem When True Price = L*

If true price is revealed to be *L*, at time 3 then the demand curve shifts to:

[Low Value Demand Curve](https://preview.redd.it/gm5nitrhq5471.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2de40e38c58e92dfd77a81bdfc1f1645ace328)

Not as bad as the previous case, but even covering at *L* will push price a little bit higher and cut into the hedgies' tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# F. Naked Short Selling

&amp;#x200B;

Naked short selling removes the unravelling problem at no cost to the manipulator and it's quite literally free money:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Naked short selling and manipulating the price downward provide cash returns to the manipulator, who can withdraw cash from his clearing firm account as the shorted shares are marked to market at progressively lower prices. Through naked shorting, the manipulator realizes these returns without investing any cash (provided the market price never rises above the sale price). (Pg. 34, par. 1)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The clearing firm retains the cash proceeds from the short sale to secure the selling broker’s delivery obligation. The clearing firm releases cash equal to the reduction in value of the shorted shares as the price of the shares declines (or demands additional cash margin if the share price rises). (Pg. 34, footnote 51)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some familiar signs of naked short selling:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The daily trading volume could be quite high if the manipulator is rapidly turning over its short position, but the daily trading and settlement activity may appear to be normal market making because the dealer’s net position on the day does not change. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Pumping the trading volume also reduces the short interest ratio (short interest divided by the average daily trading volume) to help conceal the manipulation. (Pg. 44, footnote 64)

&amp;#x200B;

Remember naked shorting creates phantom shares which increases the float.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*True Shares Outstanding:*

Based on the original demand curve we can calculate the total shares outstanding at time 0. Since this is during the initial conditions, this is the true value of shares outstanding.

So, since uninformed investors are always willing to buy at a lower price and, hypothetically, if the long term investors decided to sell all outstanding shares *Q* to uninformed traders then price would fall to *L*:

[True Shares Outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/jo6wfto0r5471.png?width=1302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec730cb71efebe71437d952851702b8e1760fcd)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Naked Short Selling in Pooling Equilibrium: Driving Price Close to Zero*

When True Price = *H*

Using the previous equations we can find the amount of shares necessary to drive the final price at time 3 close to zero:

[Shares needed to drive price close to zero](https://preview.redd.it/yru4w6xfr5471.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ffc8721e7813106b63dc2aebc5f2b16ad84e5c)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When True Price = *L*

[Shares needed to drive price close to zero](https://preview.redd.it/p9fhxeuvr5471.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bb3ace95102f25f0e1b885cfd019875ced25f12)

It is also worth noting,

&gt;The manipulators profit depends on his ability to manipulate the firm's stock price and keep it depressed. The stronger the financial condition of the firm at time 3 (the higher \*L\* is), the greater the number of shares the manipulator has to sell short at time 3 to drive the price close to zero. (Pg. 45, par. 2)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*More Shorted Shares than Outstanding:*

We have the true shares outstanding, we know the amount of shares needed to short an *H* valued company to zero, and the amount of shares needed to short a *L* valued company to zero:

[Share Counts](https://preview.redd.it/y8vwm4tcu5471.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbfbe93e72b1e83e408df1226917c0ea23fb47c1)

&amp;#x200B;

When Value Is *H*

&gt;Building a short position of *H/B* to drive *P(3)* to zero would involve naked shorting more shares than the firm has outstanding because *H/B &gt; (A-L)/B*. (Pg. 45, par. 1)  
&gt;  
&gt;The manipulator can not drive the share price close to zero unless he can naked short an extraordinary number of shares. (Pg. 45, par. 1)

So to drive the *H* company to zero hedgies have to naked short *Q\_H* shares. But remember our general equations governing the demand curve:

[Hedgies r fuk: High Value Edition](https://preview.redd.it/ugb483uru5471.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd45417234273c750f46bb1aed550faef0b5140d)

**Proving that if hedgies want to short a company with a high intrinsic value to zero they must naked short more shares than are outstanding.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When Value is *L*

&gt;Even if the manipulator's short position is *L/B*, it might still exceed the entire number of shares the firm has outstanding.  
&gt;  
&gt;The manipulators profit depends on his ability to manipulate the firm's stock price and keep it depressed. The stronger the financial condition of the firm at time 3 (the higher *L* is), the greater the number of shares the manipulator has to sell short at time 3 to drive the price close to zero. (Pg. 45, par. 2)

**If** ***L=P(2)*** **then the manipulator will naked short the same number of shares that the firm has outstanding.** This next equation should look familiar:

[Hedgies r fuk: Low Value Edition](https://preview.redd.it/ib5ueyoiv5471.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57eeb0c9e071cec383982402d54f8029d32fe2d4)

**So then if** ***L&gt;P(2)*** **then the manipulator will naked short more shares than firm has outstanding. By naked shorting the same number of shares that are outstanding, the manipulator has doubled the float. (Pg. 55, footnote 77)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What About Incremental Shorting?

Almost forgot this case, so I'll have to put it here at the end. I'm not gonna go too much into the math cause it just adds another layer of unneeded complexity.

Basically you just need to know this, Finnerty proves that unless the manipulator is naked shorting and/or is a MM, it is not profitable to incrementally short sell (i.e. shorting a little, then covering a little, repeat).

&gt;In a market equilibrium in which the informed investor sells the profit-maximizing number of shares, I show later in the paper that incremental short sales by the manipulator will not be profitable. (Pg. 16, footnote 29)

This shows how huge of a win the rule changes were. Had apes not gotten them, Shitadel would have continued to abuse their MM privileges and not had to worry about margin call. Now, they can't naked short as freely and its actually costing them to maintain short positions, and its only going to get worse.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# F. Conclusion &amp; What's In Vol. 2

&amp;#x200B;

So if the company is a company of high intrinsic value, they **MUST** short more shares outstanding. If the company is of low intrinsic value, they have to make sure to keep the price down to not short more shares than outstanding. This part is the key:

&gt;The stronger the financial condition of the firm at time 3 (the higher *L* is), the greater the number of shares the manipulator has to sell short at time 3 to drive the price close to zero. (Pg. 45, par. 2)

So even if GME was of low intrinsic value (lol) then I think its safe to say hedgies did not keep the price low enough to not have shorted **AT LEAST** the same number of shares outstanding.

The Money Market &amp; Synthetic Stablecoin platform.

**Key Features:**

● Borrow cryptocurrencies and stablecoins with no credit check and fast origination directly on Binance Smart Chain.

● Supply cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and earn a variable APY for providing liquidity the protocol that is secured by over-collateralized assets.

● Mint stablecoins from your supplied collateral that can be used at over 60 million locations worldwide through Decentralized platform and more.

● Controlled by the Juice Token, a governance token designed to be a fair launch distribution for the community.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uum6iolzkb471.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=260198bb24e7bddd19f19004106464f3e034e0ce

**Supplying Assets**

Juice Protocol users may supply various supported cryptocurrencies or digital assets on to the platform, which can be used as collateral for loans, supply liquidity and earn an APY, or to mint synthetic stablecoins.

Supplying assets such as cryptocurrencies or digital assets to Juice gives the users the ability to participate as a lender while maintaining the security of collateral in the protocol. Users will earn a variable-based interest rate depending on the yield curve utilization of that specific market. All user assets are pooled into smart contracts so that users can withdraw their supply at any time, given that the protocol balance is positive.

Users who supply their cryptocurrency or digital asset to Juice will receive a Juice Token, such as rBTC, which is the only token that can be used to redeem the underlying collateral supplied.

This will enable users to use these tokens to hedge against other assets or move them into cold storage wallets that support Binance Smart Chain.

Example: Depositing Collateral

Example: Withdrawing Collateral

**Borrowing Assets**

Users who want to borrow any of the supported cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or digital assets from Juice must pledge collateral that will be locked on the protocol. These assets must be over collateralized and will enable up to 75% of that collateral value borrowed. These collateral ratios are determined by the protocol and are controlled through the Governance process, which is documented in this Whitepaper.

Once these assets are supplied, you can borrow based on the collateral ratio of the asset.

Typically, collateral ratios are set anywhere from 40% to 75%. For example, if Bitcoin has a collateral value of 75%, that means you can borrow up to 75% of the value of your BTC. If the user has $100,000 in BTC supplied to the Juice Finance protocol, that means they can borrow up to 75% of the value. However, if a user’s collateral value drops below 75%, or whichever collateral ratio percentage that a certain asset has, it could cause a Liquidation event, which will be discussed later.

Users will have a compound interest rate that will be applied per block on these assets and have no monthly payment obligations. To return the collateral, the user must pay off their origination balance and compounded interest back to the protocol.

Market interest rates are determined by the specific yield curve that is designated in the contract. Depending on the market utilization, it will determine what the interest rate will be for that specified market.

Example: Borrowing on supplied collateral Synthetic Stablecoins

The Juice Finance Protocol, to start, will enable users to mint JUICE DOLLARS (JUSD), a synthetic stablecoin based on the price of $1 USD, by using the Juice Tokens (JUICE) from the underlying collateral that they have previously supplied to the protocol. Users can borrow up to 50% of the remaining collateral value they have on the protocol from their Juice Tokens (JUICE) to mint JUSD.

Stablecoins on the Juice Finance Protocol can be synthetically designed through Governance and added as a proposal. JUSD will be the protocol’s default stablecoin that can be minted by collateral already pledged in Juice.

These stablecoins will not have yielded curves that determine their interest rates, which in other protocols are known as stability fees. Interest rates will be determined by the Governance process within the Juice Protocol.

**Pricing Mechanisms**

Since no underlying fiat reserves are guaranteeing the value of the synthetic stable coin on the Juice Finance Protocol, it will rely on market forces, the basket of collateral, and safety mechanisms to maintain its peg to the fiat currency it is designed to synthesize. As an example, JUICE DOLLARS will originally maintain a peg of 1:1 per JUSD: USD.

The market is encouraged to maintain this peg so that programmatic mechanisms designed to protect the peg will not be initiated by the protocol.

If there becomes a point where JUSD or another synthetic stable coin loses its peg value, the protocol can use the Governance process to initiate the Price Adjustment Module. This module will enable the change of parameters within the stable coin system on Juice to dis-attach the peg and create a change in supply and demand to bring the stability back to its original peg.

This system will enable two main points. A benefit to hold/buy a synthetic stable coin, or mint/borrow a synthetic stable coin. This is determined whether the price peg has become negative or positive due to external market conditions.

**Stablecoin Parameters**

Users who have the protocols native tokens can create proposals to change specific parameters of the synthetic stable coins on the platform by utilizing the on-chain Governance system. These parameters are set up from a protocol-risk perspective to protect the interest of the users and the platform. The parameters that users can control are the following:

● **Max Supply:** This determines the maximum number of synthetic stable coins units can be minted at any given point to determine the synthetic stable coins maximum supply.

● **Interest Rate:** The interest rate parameter controls how much in interest fees the user pays for minting these synthetic stablecoins.These interest rates go directly into the Reserve Factor community funds.

● **Collateral Ratio:** Each synthetic stablecoin will be a liquidation price. These liquidation prices are controlled by the Collateral ratio for each synthetic stablecoin.

● **Penalty Ratio:** If a liquidation occurs, there will be a penalty percentage you must pay the protocol. This penalty ratio is set by the protocol.

**Stablecoin Redemption**

Synthetic stablecoins on the Juice Protocol are created by supplying and locking a single or basket of cryptocurrencies. Users can redeem jUSD for other assets by trading with them in the Trust Wallet platform. jUSD is exchangeable to all supporting assets, including USD, which can be redeemed directly to your bank account for verified users."

Hello Everyone! The number of PMs were overwhelming, so I decided to create a general guide to help you all. 

So what does it take to secure a high probability of landing an internship? It varies from major to major but typically prob a lot more than you imagined! Buckle up and get ready to read a wall of text. I wish I could say we are going to the moon here, but we are just going to your entry level internship/ fulltime job offer ranging anywhere from $40 - $80k/yr. But hey, you’ll be on top of the moon in spirit knowing you have a job lined up for you upon graduation! Yes, good internships typically lead you to full time offers!

For a lot of you who have tried in the past, you may just be unfamiliar with the process of it all, but it may have gone like this for you. You prepared your resume, made it top notch, then went on to various job/company sites (linkedin, Monster, UH portal etc.) and applied. Likely received zero calls and decided okay, lets step it up a notch. Now you’re thinking may be a cover letter and applying to 100 different internships and jobs will increase your chances. To your disappointment, you still may not have received any calls. But that’s okay because that is what would be expected!

I’m here to tell you that the process that I just mentioned is not really a process. It is in fact just one step of a long process.  

  

When I was involved with recruiting and was on the other side, I can tell you that the folks that landed the interview were ones which the recruiter/employer met and knew in person. Not just names on a resume submitted through a portal. Ever heard of “it’s all about who you know”? Well, if you know and connect with the right people, you will have a leg up on majority of the competition. 

In this guide, the focus will be on getting in front of employers, getting to know them, and connecting with them before the candidate screening process starts. If you can get in front of prospective employers enough times and be friendly/comfortable with them even before actual applications are reviewed, believe me, your chances of landing interviews are much greater. 

This guide should work for a lot of majors but let me start by listing a few of the popular majors. If I don’t mention yours, don’t panic, I’m only commenting on majors that I do know a little about. Feel free to comment or leave me a message asking about specific majors or educate me on them. 

You should not have trouble landing internships if you have one of the following majors: Accounting, Finance (this one is tricky depending on what your goals are, but still achievable), HR, Marketing, Supply Chain, MIS, CIS, IT (various majors, sorry for bucketing you guys like this), Computer Science, Engineering (Chemical, Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, and Petroleum), Economics, Math majors 

Now let’s get back to, how to get to know your employers!

1.  Join student organizations geared towards your major! Too often I hear, but there’s nothing to do on campus! Join student organizations and believe me, you will be plenty busy. Try to become an officer if you can handle additional responsibilities. You can judge a good student organization by a) Their level of activity b). Exclusiveness (i.e. GPA requirements, Major requirements etc.) and most importantly c) How connected they are to employers (i.e. How many company representatives actively recruit from the organization, employer meet &amp; greet events, Employer sponsored events etc.) A good example of a student organization geared   towards landing you internships/jobs is Beta Alpha Psi. Don’t just join a student organization, make sure you are active and at the very least attend 100% of the Employer related events. You want to skip out on something? Feel free to skip out on the bake sales. 

Here is an example of what a great employer focused events calendar looks like, this one is from Beta Alpha Psi (BAP): 

&amp;#x200B;

[February Professional Meetings Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/my0chotsmd471.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d359a413bb9b442a483e9fb100be5fe02326de0)

[March Professional Meetings Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/krghlp0umd471.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53561a034d6a3a2dcde071abc0341d9da26c4b5f)

  

Your first interaction with employers and face time will likely be here. Don’t wait for the career fairs! Find out which companies are in partnership with the student organizations and get ready to go after them. They are not partnering for fun, they are doing it so that they can have their pick of the best pool of students. Employers are on campus to compete for the best candidates. Believe it or not, you are not completely at their mercy. To be on the safe side though, we’ll pretend you are because that first internship is very special regardless of if it’s not exactly what you wanted.

Let’s talk about the advantages of these events. Approaching companies at events and career fairs is an art and to perfect it, you need to work on your craft. If you have social anxiety or in general feel anxious when you meet new people, you need to start working on this sooner than later. I can write a whole wall of text on how to effectively do this, but we’ll save that for another time (May be a part II?). 

Competitive Advantage

A) You get to become well-seasoned at professional events through this process.  B) You have exclusive access to these employers along with may be 50-60 other students in a more intimate setting. C) You are not out there at the mega career fairs with 1,000 other sweaty suits and meeting them for the first time, screaming at them because you can’t hear what anyone is saying with all the background noise.  

Now, let’s focus on how to prepare and interact with employers after you understand when and where to meet them through your student orgs. 

· Understand which companies will be coming to which events. Research the company beforehand. Figure out where their HQ is located, what product/services do they provide, how big is the company? is it public of private? what are the major on-going initiatives and strategic goals, who are their competitors etc. This research will allow you to discuss the company intelligently and showcase your interest level. It will show the recruiters that you are proactive and are well informed when you approach them. The research will also raise several questions that you can ask when you meet various company representatives and will provide some talking points. 

· Figure out what opportunities are available at the firm and research to see if you could see yourself working in those roles. This process is about being the right fit for both parties involved in the process. When you meet company reps, ask them details about their day to day roles. 

· Find out about how many interns a particular company hires and what their requirements are. Ask about the employers recruiting cycle. Some firms host events year-round but hire only in the Fall or only in the Spring or may be even just for the Summer. They really take the time to know their candidates. Imagine, hosting events year-round so they can just get to know their candidates by the next recruiting cycle. You want to have met the recruiters as many times as possible before the interviewees are selected. 

· Don’t ask about anything that you can easily find out about through a google search. This will just show that you were too lazy to even look them up or understand what they are all about. Additionally, you will come off as someone just willing to take anything. No! Be tactical in your search, find the job that most suits you and go after it! 

· Dress for success every time you meet them. Dress in a business professional manner at every event if possible. Unless it’s a baseball game or something, overdress! Be well groomed and look sharp. [Here](https://prioritystaffinggroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Business-Professional.png) are examples for both men and women.

· When you are done meeting each company representative, ask for their business card and hold on to it so that you can keep in touch through-out the semester/recruiting cycle! 

Again, I can go into a lot more detail, but let’s start with the basics mentioned and we can deep dive another time. 

2.  Go to every career fair! There’s one mega career fair on campus but there are often mini career fairs at each individual college (i.e. college of business career fairs, college of engineering career fairs etc.). Example of career fairs by college:  

https://preview.redd.it/bcge6safnd471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fc0f8e0553c8e06e0d9ffac83de61845f73a668

  

Here is the [link](https://uh.edu/ucs/employers/attend-events/#college-based). Took me 2 minutes to find this. If someone has a better link, pass it along and I can update. 

Guess what happens when you see the same companies showing up that you had already met at club events? That’s right, they know who you are and may be even remember you on a first name basis. You know what else? It’s much easier to interact when it’s the 5th, 6th and 7th time you are meeting them. Oh and guess what, your resume, if they don’t already have it will likely go on top of the pile or get marked by them. You might meet new reps from the same company, I suggest you meet all of them so that they can collectively advocate for you afterwards, and be sure to reference all the other team members you have already met! 

  

3. Company hosted events for university students. You can find out about company hosted events directly from employers at student org/club events or career fairs. This is another opportunity for you to meet them. A good example would be interview prep workshops hosted by some of the Big 4 Accounting firms (EY, Deloitte, KPMG and PWC). These will vary from company to company, but they are out there. Meet them and see them every way you can so they know what you are all about and you know what they are all about before you even apply! Here are examples of company web pages where you can find out more in detail about recruiting processes and where to meet and find company reps: PWC Example, Deloitte Example. This should also be part of your research process outlined in Step 1, bullet 1. 

4. Remember all those business cards you collected? When you are not meeting employers in person, be sure to send them a thank you note and follow up with them through out the year. An email or two per semester will keep you in their minds come recruiting/hiring time! 

  

I think there’s enough here to get everyone started on the right track. I can almost write separate guides on several topics that I mentioned here including professionalism, resume build up, interviewing, how to follow up, networking, what to discuss and how to approach etc. But for now, this should suffice. I anticipate I’ll certainly be getting this question so let me address it: When is the best time for me to start this process and apply for internships and is it too late for me? Here is a quick break out by level: 

· Freshman – It’s good to get your feet wet and join clubs and get the lay of the land. You can start early in your networking process and get comfortable approaching employers and such. Typically, it’s too early for employers to dedicate a spot for you, but if you’re one of the lucky ones and actually land an internship with a big firm at this time then you are way ahead of the curve. Not impossible but use this year to focus on your skills and learn/understand about industries, recruiting cycles, different job ops and employers. There may be some employers that leave slots for Freshman but, its rare in my opinion. 

· Sophomores – Ideally, you want to get started on the process during this year and line yourself up for an internship in your Junior year. If you happen to land it your sophomore year, you are doing phenomenal! Several companies have specific openings for individuals in their second year of college. This may vary by major and by industry. 

· Juniors – If you didn’t do anything your sophomore year, don’t worry, all hope is not lost. But you absolutely have to be working with a higher level of urgency. You MUST at the latest get started by this year and look to land an internship by end of year. Typically, in Accounting at least, you land an internship in your Junior year and will be out 1 – 1.5 years away from graduation. This is where the companies love to have you because they can get you signed up for a full time offer upon your graduation. Employers don’t want to wait more than 2 years to get you in the door. So they will try to lock you up 12 – 18 mo. out into a full time position. 

· Seniors – You’re late if you are just now thinking about internships and getting started. You can certainly land them, and I know people that have had success, but understand that the battle will be uphill for you. If this is the first time you are networking, interacting, and learning about clubs, and still learning to get over your social anxiety of going up to employers then you are certainly behind. If you follow all the steps in this guide, your chances will still be much higher than if you didn’t. On the bright side, at least you still have not graduated and are still considered an undergraduate. This isn’t a doom and gloom situation but just know you have to hustle a bit harder at this point. 

· Graduates – Congrats on graduating! Unfortunately, the internship opportunities will not be available to you. It’s not your fault, you just didn’t know what you didn’t know. Your only hope is full-time entry-level positions. The best firms as you have seen come look for you on campus, they are probably wondering why you have not landed anything in that process or interned with them. As some of you may have experienced, it’s way difficult to land your first job without internships and just cold calling and applying to firms. I would recommend connecting with headhunters. I can go in more detail here if there is demand but we can gauge that in the comments!

Final word: Coogs, I hope this guide helps you all. If you have questions, feel free to leave it in comments or message me privately if you don’t want to ask publicly. But take this opportunity to turn this into a mega thread where people can gather information and share relevant info as well. Let’s upvote the most useful and helpful information in the comments that people can lean on when they visit. 

Be kind to each other and help each other. Pay any help you receive forward to the next Coog or simply anyone in need of advice/help!

As you go out into the workforce, remember that you are not just competing with other Coogs for a full-time offer but also students from other Universities. Be the best that you can be and understand that you represent all the former and incoming Coogs. Use the time on campus to get ready for the real world, you have all the tools that you need on campus to succeed! You’ll get out what you put into this experience.

[Governance](https://preview.redd.it/366iqk38kf471.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4835b18ff2f64521a7f84c5f4a5d4a565725a70d)

Juice Finance has been designed to enable community control in its core. Since there are no pre-mines for the team, developers and founders, this means the protocol will be controlled by those who decide to mine Juice Tokens (JUICE). To create a proposal, a proposer will need 300,000,000 JUICE and the proposal must reach at minimum 600,000,000 JUICE quorum to be approved.

**Governance features include:**

● Adding new cryptocurrencies or stablecoins to the protocol

● Adjusting variable interest rates for all markets

● Setting fixed interest rates for synthetic stablecoins

● Voting on protocol improvements/proposals

● Delegate protocol reserve distribution schedules

**Interest Rates**

The protocol has interest rates that are designated per market from both the supply side and the borrowing side. Interest rates are also applicable for synthetic stablecoins that are created on the JUICE Finance protocol such as JUSD.

The interest rates provided for markets that can be borrowed or supplied are dynamic and have a yield curve that varies based on utilizations. These interest rates are also set from a floor to ceiling based on the Governance process of the protocol.

For synthetic stable coins, the interest rates to mint these are fixed. There is no variable interest rate design in these interest rates. However, through the Governance process, users are able to control.

**Reserve Factors**

Each Juice Token contract and underlying collateral will have a reserve factor from a basis of 0-90%.

This means there will be reserves that the protocol captures between the spreads of borrowing and supplying. These reserve factors are added to the protocol and can be used for community development, improvements, protections, and more. These Reserve Factor funds are controlled by the Governance process and can be used in a variety of protocol security distributions or rewards mechanisms."

&amp;#x200B;

Remember learning about compound interest in school? Compound interest occurs when interest earned gets added to the principal amount invested, and then the interest rate gets applied to the new (larger) principal. When you compound you earn interest on your interest, which results in exponential returns. This is not new, nor is it specific to DEFI or crypto. Compounding is the best magic in finance and the key to growing your funds year over year. 

&amp;#x200B;

In DEFI, a smart contract has to be called to distribute your earned rewards to you. This call has costs, it costs some gas to execute that transaction on the blockchain, and you have to go make this call every time you want to harvest your rewards and add them to your principal and enjoy compounding. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apescape is building autocompounding into every applicable product. Automation (that's the auto in autocompounding) handles all of the steps of compounding with maximum efficiency. Remember when we said Apes Together Strong? Each time anyone interacts with the contract, it will compound positions for everyone with positions in that pool. That's right, where a bank would maximize fees, we've batched together transactions for efficiency. What is good for one is good for all here. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can toggle autocompounding On and Off in the upper right of each farm, see how much has been converted for you, and a timer that shows you how long it has been since the last compound on each farm.

&amp;#x200B;

It all starts with $NTRO, a bonding curve token that can only be purchased on the Ape Escape website in the SWAP section. Once you buy $NTRO, you can stake it to either earn $BNB or $ROKT. 

&amp;#x200B;

With your $ROKT, you can either market sell it, market sell half into $BNB and provide liquidity, or you can stake it to earn $BNB.

&amp;#x200B;

If you provide liquidity, you can earn even more $ROKT and keep the compounding going.

&amp;#x200B;

While you’re staked, you’re earning $BNB through $NTRO and swap fees if you’re providing liquidity too. The rewards keep stacking and stacking. In the first month of Ape Escape, we’ve rewarded $NTRO holders $64,278 in $BNB. For a token with $254,408 market cap, that is HUGE.

&amp;#x200B;

Compound interest is magic that few understand.

&amp;#x200B;

APY is the % return annually if you were to compound daily: APY = (1 + r/n)n – 1

&amp;#x200B;

r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)

n = the number of times your product calculates compound interest in a year (e.g. 12 for monthly, or 4 for quarterly).

&amp;#x200B;

APR is the % return annually if you were to just accrue interest with no compounding. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example: $10,000 into the ROKT pool yields 22,393% APY and 545.62% APR

APR: $64,562 after 1 year

APY: $2,239,371.26 after 1 year

&amp;#x200B;

Would you rather buy a token and hope and pray it gets a 10x OR would you rather buy a token and compound it every day, sometimes multiple times per day, watching that 10x unfold before your eyes? Farming isn’t much, but its honest work and the math supports it. You’re much better off participating in a farm or multi token ecosystem where you’re managing exposure to just one asset. 

&amp;#x200B;

The end vision for Ape Escape is a DAO that is like pickle meets inverse finance. As we develop the ecosystem we’re going to roll out more autocompounding features like the ability to actively diversify your investment. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance on our farm right now, you can only autocompound your liquidity position. In the future you’ll be able to say I want to take 10% of the compounding every day and put that into $BNB or something else. Over time, you’ll balance your exposure and come out ahead. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are enormous gains to be made in defi because of this autocompounding magic, but first people have to understand that there is a lot more to life than buying $DOGE and hoping it gets to a dollar. That kind of hopium is toxic and we need to help spread the word that there are much larger opportunities in DeFi today. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was no premine or presale to $NTRO nor $ROKT. Everyone is in the same boat earning these tokens over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

$ROKT has a continuous issuance of 0.1 token per BSC block mined. The first year issuance will be about 1,314,000 tokens. There are about 175,000 $ROKT in circulation today. There are about 41,500 $NTRO in circulation today.

$NTRO is minted when you purchase it through the website. It is backed by staked BNB/CAKE that is farmed on every purchase, yield returns. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ape Escape has been live for a little over 1 month and so far our yields are holding strong. $NTRO is that fuel though. At this point if someone were to come by and just give it a little push, the ecosystem would take off and you’d see some serious yields. To date we have awarded $NTRO holders $65,278 in $BNB rewards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Buy $NTRO on the Ape Escape website to fuel the ecosystem. 

Stake your $NTRO to earn $ROKT or earn $BNB.

Stake your $ROKT to earn $BNB

Pool 2 staking available too.

&amp;#x200B;

$NTRO market cap today is $254,408

$ROKT market cap today is $165,122

&amp;#x200B;

ROKT can be earned by anyone who provides value to the network. The current ROKT issuance allocation is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

50x BNB/ROKT LP - Liquidity providers of ROKT and BNB.

25x DAO Treasury - Fully Controlled by ROKT token holders.

15x Core Team - The creators of the DAO.

5x NTRO Stakers - Users who stake NTRO.

Celer proposed a similar solution with its [Layer2.finance](https://Layer2.finance) platform, which is designed to make interacting with DeFi on Ethereum a far cheaper and more efficient task by providing a “DeFi Public Transportation System” of sorts. 

The platform uses a layer-2 rollup solution to allow users to easily split the cost of interacting with various DeFi DApps in a completely trustless, non-custodial manner.

In this context, Celer can be viewed as a scaling platform that is designed to help enable the creation of fast, secure and low-cost blockchain applications on a variety of blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polkadot, etc. Thanks to its scaling capabilities, the system is able to process easy, off-chain transactions for not only payment transactions, but also generalized off-chain smart contracts.

In fact, Celer recently launched a layer-2 rollup-based DeFi aggregator called Layer2.finance, allowing individuals to interact and utilize existing DeFi protocols while paying up to 100x lower transaction costs. Not only that, Layer2.finance offers seamless scaling opportunities to DeFi protocols without the need for chain migration. As a result of this, issues related to liquidity fragmentation and break composability can be greatly minimized.

[http://entm.ag/cfULOZ](http://entm.ag/cfULOZ)

To solve the underlying scalability issues, we do have promising Layer-2 scaling solutions like Celer Network that brings ultra-fast and low-cost transactions on Ethereum. Celer is a Generalized State Channel Network with advanced Rollup technology that reduces the transaction costs by 100X with its project called Layer2.Finance, which is quite a big leap considering the massive transaction volume on Ethereum, thanks to DeFi.

Layer-2 solutions don't just solve the scalability problem, but they go beyond the limitations of the underlying platform to provide different services that are not possible otherwise on Layer-1. A perfect example of this is Celer cBridge, which provides cross-chain asset transfer between Ethereum's main chain and any Layer-1 or Layer-2 platform in a blazing fast and secure manner."

IDK if any of this shit is even useful.*

 Also **I’d like to preemptively address the people who are going to hate this post:**

**“Pumping PSTH won’t work”** Yes, you’re probably right

**“Pumping is illegal”** We are simply ""advertising"" a stock we believe in, using verifiably true information

**“We don’t need WSB, WSB needs us”** Okay, look at their returns (on any one of the main meme stocks) and look at ours. 

And sure, lets say we agree on this statement. If they need us, we should tell them about us.

**“We don’t want apes because they’ll ruin this community”** Only one thing should matter: the price of the stock. We also just aren’t going to see a mass migration like that (we’re not that special).

**“we don’t want to seem desperate”** Yeah, so don’t be a thirsty hoe. Lots of people talk about stocks on WSB, they’re not all desperate. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Marketing 101 for Tontards: What is a successful campaign?**

If you look up the definition of a successful campaign in any marketing textbook, you’ll see it defined as thus: get some poor sap to hand over their money for your own personal gains. Anyway, on to the next point.

**Thicc Product Adoption: or how I learned to love the curve**

The **product adoption curve** is broken down into five phases but we only care about the **first three**: *innovators, early adopters, early majority*. In essence, we are currently hoping that we are on the 2nd stage of this curve. These stages have a unique relationship when looked at in the real world. Think of the iPhone for example, at first it was an outlier because it didn’t have a keyboard and only the *innovators* used it. Once the screen keyboard was optimized, the *early adopters* began to buy. This then gave the *early majority* the confidence to adopt the iPhone and the *late majority* is still buying them to this day. Between the early adopters and the early majority is what’s called *The Great Chasm*. It represents the hardest stage of progression on the curve but provides the **best opportunity**.  

In his book, *Contagious: Why Things Catch On*, author Jonah Berger highlights how this chasm, and in fact most every transition on the curve, is crossed. Mainly, Jonah highlights societies 'influencers'. 

**Think back** to when you **first heard about PSTH**, for me that was late last year when I saw a post by dhsmatt2, I’m guessing that you might have a similar journey although your connection may be moazzam0 or Yolo Capital or maybe you don’t remember the exact name of the person, but they served the same purpose. These 'influencers' can be friends, family, or even strangers on the internet that you find a connection with, but why are these influencers so effective? Well, within this unspoken *influencer network* there is an exchange. On one hand you have the influencers/innovators who take on the risk of trying new things. These people test and experiment, often through no formal structure, and in exchange receive attention, social capital, and influence from early adopters/early majority, who leverage the influencers mistakes/and successes without experiencing those mistakes themselves. 

So why did I write all that and why did you read it? Well, two reasons: I think it’s important to know where we are in the curve for the sake of crafting and transmitting a narrative AND I think it’s important to know that influencers are an extreme source of [power](https://youtu.be/Q_7KaMDHoGs?t=177).

In practical terms, we should leverage our influencers and get them on board or we're doomed. People like dhsmatt2 have a well-known reputation on different subreddits. Simply link to statements they have made and actions (positions) they’ve taken.

**Action Item:** Compile a list of PSTH influencers, their posts and popular DD. Have these things readily available to reference and to share.

*As I’ve said before, there are key tenets that help to improve the chances that your campaign will be successful, these tenets are also often implemented naturally by influencers.*

[**""Stay on target. stay on target""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnP5iDKwuwk)

Know your target audience. A target audience is a particular group at which an advertising campaign etc., is aimed. Here are two subreddits: r/wallstreetbets and r/investing. While there is undoubtedly some overlap, the users on average are drastically different. This can easily be demonstrated by creating what is called an [avatar](https://www.coolest-homemade-costumes.com/real-life-avatars-halloween-couples-costumes/) (this has nothing to do with the blue aliens that made me pop a boner in the local Regal theater when I was a teen). A customer avatar (sometimes referred to as a buyer persona, marketing persona, or customer profile) is a representation of your ideal customer. Think of an average WSB user: Ape like, r\*tarded, high risk looking for high reward, wants instant gratification, low cognitive load, easily entertained, low attention span. Now think of an r/investor user: a fucking square, idk, that sub is boring, and I’d rather lose my money on FD’s.  
 

**The point being**, you wouldn’t try and transmit a high cognitive load message to WSB but you might for r/investing.   
 

Sun Tzu once said: [know your consumer and you finna be hella rich, bitch](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/17976-if-you-know-the-enemy-and-know-yourself-you-need)

**Marketing: Bustin’ Loads**

We talked about low cognitive load in the previous section, so what is it? Cognitive Load refers to the amount of working memory used in a task. It can be used in marketing to ensure the consumer understands and retains your message. Different target audiences will have different levels of cognitive capacity. In other words, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple stupid. In the age of tiktok you have a very short window of opportunity to make an impression on someone. In advertising the standard is that you have around 2-3 seconds to grab some one’s attention and good luck keeping it for more than 30 seconds. Think of iconic campaigns such as “got milk?” “Just do it” and “I like the stock” “420.69 is not a meme” and “if he’s in, I’m in”. Each message should be self-contained, easy to understand, take minimal effort to transmit or receive and be stimulating.   
 

**Action item:** Compile low cognitive load messaging that can be easily transmitted. Examples include, “I like the sock” “Grandma squeeze” idk, any of the other funny shit ya’ll say that’s caught on.

**What do desirable benefits and your mom have in common?**&gt;! Both are easy!&lt;

People want easy, timely and significant benefits. &lt;que boomer quote from [Warren Buffett](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/vzsuk/ping_pong_level_warren_buffett/) about patience = money&gt;. There is a reason most people lose their shirt on the stock market: we’re impatient as hell. I don’t give a shit about [amazon workers](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2055439-amazon-warehouse-workers-urinating-in-bottles), I want my package delivered ASAP. You think I’m not going to go full [karen](https://youtu.be/Uv7LwFPp3SY?t=34) when my In-N-out takes too long? Think again. [NOW NOW NOW](https://youtu.be/TRTkCHE1sS4?t=54). You get the point. People only commit to longtime investing once they’re holding the bag and are forced to (suddenly they all become Charlie 'dick' Munger). So, it’s important to attach a short timeframe to campaign. This also taps into the concept of timeliness and best of all (my marketing boner rises just thinking about it) the concept of scarcity. 

One of the brilliant things about the GME squeeze what that, at its core, it was about scarcity. Scarcity triggers something deep down inside us. Back when we all were having **cave orgies** (sounds like a fun time tbh) scarcity often meant death and that stamped a lasting tattoo on our *smooth smooth* brains. When this imprint gets tickled, we get [TRIGGERED](https://giphy.com/gifs/triggered-wen-yoo-oCdScruZnEHfy). Companies use scarcity as a motivator all the time. Think of amazon saying “there are only two more of this item in stock!” yeah.. bullshit, and we know it’s bullshit but it still works. Or Apple only being able to deliver “limited new iPhones and you can only buy two!” Also bullshit. These are just superficial examples of scarcity. Another example: The scarcity of GME shares due to the over shorting of the stock. Scarcity can both be an outcome of low supply or high demand. If you want a prime example of scarcity, think about what happened with toilet paper earlier this year. Think about the very real emotions you had when you thought about the possibility you might have to scoop dingle berries out of your hairy ass with your digits.   
 

And with that colorful mental image, we’ve arrived at our next topic: 

**You’re an emotional bitch (and I am too)**  
 

Emotions are our chief motivators, we do things because of emotions. We think we are doing things because we are being logical but we’re not. that is a lie your brain tells yourself because you are an emotional bitch who needs to be coddled by your own brain. Bla bla bla, I could post studies on how much of your decision making is decided by emotion but instead I’ll just cut to the chase and tell you a cheat code. The best emotions to manipulate… err I mean use to “advertise”… are happiness, sadness and fear with a side of anger. 

Think about one of the most iconic commercials of our generation: [The Dawn Duckling/Oil Spill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfARTSdO2Eg) commercial. It’s great, because on one hand I’m like “aw nice, that duck is cute as hell” and “ooh that looks satisfying when they clean that dirty dirty duck (let’s just not think about the fact that they definitely dunked that duck in oil for the sake of filming the commercial)” and then on the other side I’m like “fuck exon mobile/shell/BP for spilling that oil! I’m so emotionally destabilized by my anger and that’s going to help make a lasting impression on me which will later influence recall when making a decision on which dish soap I should buy!”   
 

I think it’s important to also mention that avoidance of certain emotions is the other side of the coin. Why do we listen to influencers? In part, because we want to avoid the fear of the unknown while searching for happiness.  
 

One more example; Again, let’s talk about why GME continues to be such a fascinating case study. First off, it’s obvious with price targets of 420.69, $1000 and even higher, that one of the chief motivational emotions is search for happiness/reward. There are also elements of fear/fomo, but the other biggest emotional motivator (and possibly the most important) is anger. People really don’t like hedge funds and it feels extremely good to have an outlet for that anger (even if it’s not actually effective). I remember in the early days, when the numbers for Melvin Capital losses were coming in, it felt like crack.   
 

Unfortunately, with PSTH, we don’t really have an outlet to stoke anger. In fact, Bill Ackman being a “hedgie” who “profited off of fear mongering and shorting during the last crash” is somewhat of a liability. In the SWAT analysis, we would see that this is a weakness which means we would combat it with an opportunity. I have some ideas on that, but the best idea is simply use the troll method. A successful internet troll get’s the targeted party to expend more energy and resource investment which leads to them “winning” through attrition. Simply put, if someone accuses our Daddy Ackman of doing something bad, put the burden of proof on them. Currently, there is a narrative that has some key inconsistencies that, when pointed out, serve to nullify its effect.   
 

Anyway, I spent too long talking about that last point. **Mainly, we should be focusing on two things:** the pursuit of happiness (easy, timely and significant benefits). While avoiding fear and uncertainty and triggering fomo.  
 

**Action Item:** Gather the most compelling PT’s and benefits and craft them into an appealing message using the previously talked about tenets.  
   
 

**Everyone is a submissive c\*ck who wants to be told what to do (that’s only a slight exaggeration)**

Successful campaigns usually contain CTA’s or Call to Actions. These can be on a spectrum of explicitness. Think about Nike’s “just do it”. This is, in a way, a call to action but many call to actions are more explicit. Think “buy now!” “Watch now” “buy and hold” “buy shares”. Call to actions should be clear and easy to follow ([because people are stupid as hell](https://twitter.com/mathematicsprof/status/1270119912418181120?lang=en)). People are not going to devote a big fat cognitive load to figure out what the next step is. You have to hold the consumers hand every single step of the way. Remember, K.I.S.S.. For influencers, the best calls to action are related to one’s own actions because **examples are extremely easy to follow.** “I’m buying 22.50c Sept 17 Calls on PSTH and you should too” or “Just buy shares of PSTH. I own 11 million dollars’ worth” or “buy shares to get full PSTH benefits”

**Marketing is like sex: you want penetration frequently and it’s probably going to get noisy**

An important campaign takes into account penetration (lol) and frequency. Before we dive into what those are, I want you to think of an old CRT TV. Imagine a screen full of static, its small pixels all winking in and out of existence creating an almost homogenous grey background. **This is noise**. Now imagine you’re a pixel and you want to get noticed. You can flicker in and out as much as you want, but the chances of a watcher focusing, or even noticing on your pixel, are slim to none. You are simply screaming into the void. &gt;!Life is pointless!&lt;…. Anyway, what do you do? Well, first you must create a pattern that differs from the rest of the noise. Would it help if suddenly your pixel was the only pixel that had color? How about if you winked in and out at a higher frequency than all the others? Or maybe slower? What if you got a group of your pixel buddies to all wink at the same time, creating a discernable pattern. If you get noticed, congrats on popping your cherry, you have successfully penetrated your target market. But once you start, you can’t stop. Time to talk about frequency.

Frequency is the number of times you penetrate you target market on average. The goal is to be a serial penetrator. Each penetration increases your odds of a successful campaign. The industry standard is to penetrate your customer at least 3 times before moving on with the sales process. 7 is also a magic number within the industry and greatly improves brand recall.

Let’s talk about the lie of “facebook” (and WSB). Within the industry there is a lie about the ease of advertising now in the digital age. That, because you can accurately define and isolate your target market, it’s as simple as clicking a button, putting your product in front of your target market, and suddenly you’re off to the races. Too many people believe this lie and it has created an online mire of noise. Every college grad and oblivious CEO believes throwing money at advertising giants like google and facebook is a comprehensive marketing plan. This lie also lives within the stock market under a different form. Go to any bagholder stock on StockTwits or yahoo finance and you’ll notice a common theme. Each one of them has a desperate group of people who ‘know’ that if they just got their stock onto WSB it would moon! Like the lie of facebook, this does not take into consideration that there are millions of bag holders that all have the same idea. Think of new parents. they think about how amazing their new baby is, but it’s just like every other baby and no one else really gives a shit about it.

**There are hot leads in your area and they want YOUR penetration.**

One way to help maximize penetration (lol) is to target hot leads. A hot lead is simply a lead that has expressed interest in your service or product or who is at a decision point (that’s right, in marketing our standards are low because we’re all thirsty as hell). An example would be someone commenting on WSB, “what stock should I get for easy 30% returns”. A cold lead is simply anyone who does not fit the above criteria but fits within you target market.  
   
[**Competition**](https://youtu.be/oomCIXGzsR0?t=100)

It’s also important to research the competition within the market. You could do a PESTEL or SWAT analysis but that would take a lot of time and is annoying. Instead, I’ll be lazy and just highlight a few of our strengths that do make us ""competitive"" within the market:  
 

We have a lot of users

We have a lot of material and memes

We have a definable bull case

We have a potential easy, timely and significant benefit

Yo, We got Da Baby!

In all honesty, getting any discernible effect from “advertising” PSTH is unlikely but it is a fun exercise, and you never know… 

# TLDR 

Advertise the benefits of PSTH (making money in a short timeframe) instead of PSTH itself. 

(K.I.S.S.) Advertise PSTH with short, easily digestible statements

Advertise PSTH by referencing authority, influencers, and examples

Advertise PSTH by having fun and inviting others to do so

My step by step strategy for “advertising” PSTH would be

&amp;#x200B;

* **1) Standardize**
   * a. Decide on a collective and cohesive “optimistic” PT
   * b. Decide on a unified call to action (buy shares)
   * c. Pick the #1 top feature to advertise along with the benefit
   * d. Don’t overly complicate it. While we’re excited about SPARCs and shit, that will be an instant pass for people. Waaay too high of a cognitive load. Instead, we can use those as “closers” further down the “sales” process.
   * e. Create list of subreddits to target
   * i. Create strategy for each (primarily, the rest of this plan deals with WSB and WSB’s analogs)
   * f. Gather a list of “marketing material”
* **2) Start spamming... I mean ""advertise"" with great frequency... a list of the top ten or so** r/PSTH **saying/phrases** 
   * a. Find a frequency that appears someone natural while being adequate
      * i. Adopt this policy: Comment a about PSTH then comment on something unrelated. Rinse and repeat
   * Examples:
      * b. Let’s goooooo!  👉😬👈 $UMG
      * c. We got da baby! 👉😬👈 PT (insert price target)
      * d. Trust the Sock (Insert PT by x date) UMG
      * e. Bill ‘big dick’ Ackman (Insert PT by x date)
      * f. Big pp energy UMG PT (insert PT) 
      * g. 200% in PSTH (Insert PT by x date)
      * h. (Insert PT) by (x date) UMG
      * i. Buy UMG shares for full benefits
      * j. (Insert banks) valuation puts UMG at (insert PT) BULLISH!
      * k. Etc. etc.
* 3) As users begin to engage (positively OR negatively) I’d fire a salvo of 2nd level marketing material
   * a. Immediately comment on any hot leads you see
      * i. If someone asks for a stock pick, comment and share PSTH, even if others have already done so
      * ii. If not enough people are asking for stock picks, create supply for the rest of the PSTH “advertisers” by asking yourself
   * b. Influencer positions
   * c. DD
   * d. The sock video (probably one of our greatest pieces of marketing material)
   * e. Bills tweets
   * f. Bank valuations of UMG
   * g. Plug r/PSTH whenever applicable
* 4) Narrative
   * a. Use the previous steps to help outline a predetermined cohesive narrative.
   * b. This narrative (I’ve attached an example of a narrative framework that could be worked off at the end) must contain aspects of
      * i. Timeliness
      * ii. Scarcity
      * iii. Reward
      * iv. Fomo
      * v. Simplicity
* 5) Closing the sale
   * a. Advertise anything past the shares of post merge UMG as a “FREE benefit”. The human brain loves the word free. This also maybe help us avoid calculating exact value for all this extra shit. Remember, don’t say that you get free stuff. Instead, say that for free you get valuable stuff. A subtle but important distinction. You don’t want to devalue the added perks.
   * b. I’d be pushing them to participate in r/PSTH because we’re a complete echo chamber and echo chambers are great for getting people to do stuff &lt;insert modern theory of cult marketing&gt;. Obviously, we are going to have people on r/PSTH that will hate that but that’s great! Remember, exclusivity and scarcity is good. 

**The overarching narrative (theoretical example):**

PT: “based off my calculations and speculation I have a personal PT of over 100%. I think it’s feasible given an increase in popularity and other major catalysts. That said, there is a lot of open interest in options which could lead to a gamma squeeze. I’ve seen similar stocks go +400% because of gamma squeezes and that could very well happen here”

“(call to action/catalyst/benefit) You must buy PSTH now because the merge is happening and it’s going to go to (PT). (Finite opportunity) The price was momentarily depressed because of a leak that led to uncertainty. (Catalyst for benefit) But we can confidently say that the deal will almost certainly pass. (call to action) Now is a great time to buy shares. (elimination of fear/appeal to authority) When merge happens, we very could well shoot up to (PT) based off of (secondary marketing material). I’m buying even more now because soon everyone is going to want shares and that’s going to drive the price up. If you buy now you also get a lot of FREE benefits associated with the stock like PSTHr, PSTH2 and SPARCs.“ This narrative is not meant to be used verbatim, but simply is a framework to keep your specific advertising efforts within a planned structure.

They are at record highs right now, but there is no reason to believe that they will experience a significant drop in the future, actually the opposite is more probable. The big surge in steel prices started in the middle of last year, cuz companies that work  in the automobile industry,infrastructure, manufacturing etc. managed to start operating at full capacity, way faster than most material producers( steel included). However, this trend should continue in the future, cuz demand is simply outpacing the supply due to several macroeconomic factors. We are witnessing a manufacturing and infrastructure boom in the whole world, especially in Asia where governments are spending huge money for infrastructure projects and with Biden's 3 trillion plan it seems that America is trying to catch up. Also, the largest steel manufacturer in the world China is trying everything it can to suppress steel exports ( on May 1st they removed the tax rebate on steel exports) due to the large domestic demand. Furthermore, China is trying to become a more environmentally friendly country and may be forced to close some steel plants( chinese and indian steel plants are technologically behind U.S ones and pollute way more) especially with the 2022 Olympics knocking on the door. When it comes to the U.S, the situation is not very different and it does not look like Biden will remove the tariffs on steel imports imposed by Trump any time soon. I mean we need to protect( get the votes of) the rust belt workers, right?

Another reason why steel prices might continue to surge is simply due to the consolidation in the steel industries in Europe and U.S . After CLF bought the Arcellor Mittal steel business in the U.S, the four  biggest steel manufacturers are responsible for more than 80 percent of the steel production in America. When there are less players in an industry they have more control of the price. Also, they have the ability to operate only their newest plants, which are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.  Shipping costs are also through the roof this year, so if you are an american company it is probably better to buy domestic.

&amp;#x200B;

Why CLF is a good bet? CLF is a fully vertically integrated primary steel producer. They not only produce the steel, but they also mine the Iron Ore needed to create steel. That means that they have better margins that most competitors and with the sky-high steel prices they are literally printing money. They have a large portfolio of different steel products and even sell to other steel manufacturers. Also their plants are very high-tech ( faster production, lower cost, less emissions).  

Now let's take a look at the company's financials.  In the last quarter they reported revenue of 4 billion, compared to 359 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 513 million compared to 23 million. Yes, Covid definitely affected the performance in 2020, but even compared to 2019 the results are monstrous. CLF also has forward P/E ratio of 3.51 which is lower than the industry average and PEG ratio of 0.18 ( I have never seen a company with so low PEG) . Their debt to equity ratio is bigger than the industry average for now , but that is not  necessarily a bad thing. In finance class they teach you that if your  internal rate of return is higher than the interest rate then you are good. CLF probably bought the AM steel business at the best time and it comes as no surprise  that they plan to payback debt aggressively this year. I also think that some investors undervalue the company and do not see its true potential due to the fact that it became a vertically integrated steel producer pretty soon. The CEO-Goncalves had something to say about that in the last earnings call:  

“Q1 was just the first full quarter for Cleveland-Cliffs as a fully transformed business, and we have already accomplished a lot. This being said, and with all the operational and commercial actions we have been implementing, the best will come through during the balance of 2021.""

Mr. Goncalves added: “As the year progresses, it will become abundantly clear that the pricing environment we are in - and will continue to benefit from going forward - is not a consequence of luck. Our expectation of $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the full-year is predicated on conservative pricing expectations relative to today’s pricing and the current forward curve. This will allow us to generate record levels of free cash flow and pay down a substantial amount of debt, allowing us to reach leverage of less than 1x by the end of the year."""

Due to crappy rates, I tried to withdraw and put it in a more centralized finance (blockfi/celsius/nexo). But to unstake, I need to pay approx $20 twice, and an additional $200+ for unstaking!?

This is ridiculous. $200 to unstake?? This makes me feel as though DeFi is only for rich people and very large transactions, and regular people can only use centralized solutions with free withdrawals.

This $200 is when gas fees is only at 12 gwei and ETH prices is just $2300. I guess I should have been prepared to lose 10% of my investment just in fees.

DeFi apps should really have put an estimate somewhere regarding how much it costs to deposit &amp; stake, and withdraw and unstake. Had I have known that the withdraw/unstaking costs like 3x the my deposit fees, I would have never approved my deposit.

Hope this post warns future DeFi curious people to look up deposit &amp; withdraw fees. I have withdrew USDC from AAVE earlier in the day @ 12 gwei and it only costs like $20 once."

&amp;#x200B;

Highest shorted stock and a small cap stock what else can I say.

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.
2. We    all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The    people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and  public   money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is  aiming to   make and FORCE this to happen.
3. The    government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already    zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These    petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse    has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and    increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue    for companies.
5. Workhorse    has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with    their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and    charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of    commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery    step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to    deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes    after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any    retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think    about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets    for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie    Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately    (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has    since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something  that   is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have  gotten   beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks  ago. Her   funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called    Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers    unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially    short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I    couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider    nonetheless.
8. In    April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in    comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group    placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several    hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks    and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're    limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are  bottlenecks   within the global supply chain and offshore shipping  delays of  commodity  raw materials and components. This has impacted  the entire  industry,  including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and  will get  worked out as  it always does because every company wants to  increase  their sales. In  addition, Workhorse now has a supply  agreement with  Coulomb Solutions,  Inc. to supply their batteries. This  company  distributes for the largest  EV battery manufacturer in the  world.
11. Electric    trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so    Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing    that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed    up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter    &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter    has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction,    and assembly.
12. There    are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we    know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has    actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales    for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to    approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a    significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The    stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6    billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the    stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in.    This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This    one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor    does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS    or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6   billion  contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In   addition, the  USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the   direction of the  contract, is being investigated by the FBI for   possible fraudulent  activity. There is concern that he may have made   the decision based on  political contributions. Several Ohio Congress   members are also  requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured   that no political  influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of   granting it to  Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again   becomes up for  grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If   that happens,  watch out because the loss of this contract is what put   downward  pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about   GN-z11, the  furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied    volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive    option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a    big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There    are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold    and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE    recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are    even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities,    Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and    Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This    stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40%   of  its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock  out   there.

It's very    important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect    it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager  is   going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The  short   sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock  price down   and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're  accustomed to   feeling fear because they deal with it every day.  They've learned to   process this emotion and not act upon it. However,  they count on you not   having the experience to deal with fear. They're  counting on you   selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of  greed (the top). If   you wait them out, they will eventually give in  because every day you   hold they lose money on the interest that they  pay when borrowing their   short shares. Also, the people lending them  shares will not want to   assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line  is that you have to hold   and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money  calls also helps because   the market makers who sold you the naked  calls need to cover by buying   shares to protect themselves as the  stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember    the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its    float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it    eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also,    understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than   you  or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't    make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money    from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people.  They   make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their  customers   to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the  Dow. Numerous   studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey  throwing darts   randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few  that do outperform   the market can be explained by the normal outliers  of a bell curve   distribution. The same distribution happens with us in  WSB as it is the   natural order of things. Look it up if you don't  believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS    fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research    analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE    recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

I'll also be using equations from [u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/)'s (aka ""exponential floor guy"") works.

# A. Quick Review

&amp;#x200B;

In [Volume 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8281/math_black_magic_vol_1_why_it_is_mathematically/), I break down an academic finance paper by John Finnerty. In it, he mathematically proves that **it's impossible to short a stock to zero without naked shorting AT LEAST as many shares as there are outstanding, doubling the float in the process.**

&amp;#x200B;

In [Volume 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwy0oz/math_black_magic_vol_2_the_limit_does_not_exist/), I lay out how I think apes fucked up hedgies' algos initially, make conjecture on rates of change in our exponential graphs and show (through Finnerty's theories) that, **at this point, the number of shares needed to short $GME to zero does not mathematically exist.**

&amp;#x200B;

# B. Goal of This Volume

&amp;#x200B;

So far we an equations that relate *P(t) to Q*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And equations that relate *P(t)* to *t*

&amp;#x200B;

[Thanks to Exponential Floor Guy](https://preview.redd.it/j2vdkh7cgu471.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f27f8d220bb288937c388e6d32e89f861d82401b)

&amp;#x200B;

# My goal is to find an equation that can relate Q and t. That equation can possibly be used to find the real short interest.

# C. Hedgies' Curves

&amp;#x200B;

*Case 1* 

The hedgies' curves are the second equation in each list. First, I tried setting them equal to each other:

&amp;#x200B;

[No new information here](https://preview.redd.it/8xr7dbtuiu471.png?width=1289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ae5032792440214363242a29e88f9d59d687833)

&amp;#x200B;

But, this doesn't really help me cause of I don't know *B*, so ~~I tried a little calculus~~  ~~did a little simple calculus~~ I had a math séance. Cover your eyes and skip to the next section if math horrifies you. I will begin the ritual with the traditional chant \*ahem\*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 76u4fk2aku471...*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've completed the ritual and the dark gods have gifted us an equation lets plot that bad boy and find the amount of shares:

&amp;#x200B;

*Case 2*

For such a huge number, I figured I should try the calculation again with a value of 40 dollars and see what I got:

# D. Ape's Curves

&amp;#x200B;

I will now perform part two the the math seance, by repeating the process above for the ape curve:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Now this is what things get VERY interesting, check out that asymptote:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm not sure what the asymptote implies or represents, but I feel that its significant.**

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# E. Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for coming to my APE Talk. Constructive criticism is always welcome!

# TL:DR -&gt; Hedgies have naked shorted, at most, about 1.4 trillion shares and, at least, about 837 million shares.

TA:DR -&gt; Hedgies have pissed off math gods. Hedgies r fuk.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# F. Questions I Could Use Help With

&amp;#x200B;

* **What does that asymptote represent?** Is this when it no longer becomes possible for hedgies to dilute the float meaningfully? Is this the stalemate that occurs when the shares are being bought at higher rate?
* **Have I calculated how many shares have been naked shorted or how many shares retail holds?** The way Finnerty frames it, I believe the shares I calculate are the amount of shares naked shorted. However, the demand curve equation says it describes how many shares retail investors hold. I think it can describe both, but I'm sure what context the results of my calculations are in."
Is business Coaching For You,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EthiqueAdvisory/comments/nyar2i/is_business_coaching_for_you/,EthiqueAdvisory,1,2021-06-13 00:37:44,0,/r/u_EthiqueAdvisory/comments/nyar2i/is_business_coaching_for_you/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/aap543xi4v471.jpg?width=1028&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e1877c34aeca73d83af3706db010e0036304e1)

Businesses that do not have a business coach is because they often believe it to be a costly relationship, one they feel they cannot afford. The truth is, this is one relationship that they CANNOT DO without. Whether the venture is small or big, it is the Entrepreneur's vision that drives the business, makes them stretch, take the leap to push towards success. No doubt, both time &amp; blunders have sharpened their intuition and managing skills. Their mistakes have been their biggest mentor. But what if they could have accelerated the learning curve without the expense of the mistakes they made?

Providentially, there is now a service, where business owners can receive counselling customised to their needs that will help them find answers to the challenges they encounter as they guide their organization to success – Business Coaching. Business coaches come armed with priceless experience and expertise, offer an objective view while making their clients accountable.

They enable companies to achieve their short-term goals effectively while helping them build up competencies and capabilities to achieve their long-term vision. 

A common misconception is that business coaching is only for entrepreneurs who are struggling or faltering in businesses. While Business Coaches are adept at getting faltering businesses back on track, there is a wide assortment of different scenarios where coaches can assist business owners.

Business Coaches offer great support to new businesses, advising executives and owners as they go through the procedure of establishing their business, defining the mission and goals, and commencing both long-term and short-term strategies. They are equally adept at assisting business owners who have hit a plateau and challenged to scale their growth.  Along with improving the operations and driving growth, coaches lighten the Entrepreneur's load, making their journey a lot more enjoyable.

**Ways your business coach can**  **help boost your revenue**

**Creating owner accountability**

“*If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.* 

*If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.”*

A business coach is not a consultant. They do not do the work for their clients. Instead, they keep the entrepreneurs focused on the results and prompt them to keep to their commitments. To draw a quick parallel, just as a football coach, does not run laps of the field for his/ her team, a business coach does not work *in* the business, rather *on* the business. The coach monitors and measures the progress that a businessperson may avoid recording if he//she is in a solitary state. When the journey is transparent, it makes the person in charge more accountable.

**Customising creative strategies**

After getting alignment on where an entrepreneur might want wishes to take his/her business, a business coach helps design techniques that will enable the business to edge closer to its goal.

A business coach provokes the entrepreneur to think out of the box, extend his/ her limits. Every entrepreneur dreams big, however bouncing ideas off an objective person with expertise, gives one significant insight and clarity. Somebody with an extraordinary, yet demonstrated, fortitude for the technique will push the entrepreneur harder while simultaneously keeping him/her on course.

**Expand your enterprise**

*“It’s not important where you are now,*

*as long as you're sure about where you're going.”*

A coach addresses all areas of the business needed to ensure the client's focus on overall development. Perhaps the element that keeps one focused is the need to be accountable to someone. That someone for an entrepreneur is the Business Coach. The coach becomes the accountability accomplice, assisting them to overcome obstacles to cross the finish line.

The business environment persistently changes more. In response, the key challenges inevitably change. Hence, one needs to adapt &amp; change how one manages the business on an ongoing basis.

Managing change is never easy. If one wishes to stay in the race, they need to be open to seeking help along the way. 

**Make the best use of Technology**

Technology is a consistent and ever-increasing part of any venture today. It is also the fastest-changing component of the business environment. It can be hard to keep up. It is critical for enabling companies to communicate effectively with their workers &amp; clients; improve operational efficiency and thus, gain a competitive advantage. Coaches come armed with strategies to enable the successful adoption of apt technology.

**Provide marketing advice**

In the formative years of the business, the Entrepreneur has to wear multiple hats. Right from marketing, sales, finance, HR to procurement. It no surprise that their thoughts often get muddled. Coaches provide an impartial perspective to see the unseen adding clarity; to clarify the vision. A seasoned business coach who has insight on branding, marketing strategy, and tactics help grow sales and prevent them from expending efforts on what does not work. 

**Hone your administration abilities** 

Coaches help improve management and leadership skills. As a business develops, the entrepreneur moves away from the front-line to the more noteworthy and prominent administrative side. Business Coaches help clients tackle troublesome business issues. Thus, reading the establishment early on to inculcate the ability to face the unavoidable executive storms that lie ahead.

It might come as a surprise to know that even some of the world's most renowned entrepreneurs and business visionaries have turned to business coaches at some point to help them meet their objectives including but not limited to the Reliance Group, Tata Group of Hospitality, Amazon India, Hindustan Unilever and DLF - among organizations; and Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey - among individual visionaries. From entrepreneurs to athletes to famous personalities, coaching is an asset that all of them swear by, not just to help one achieve goals but to help one formulate a plan for success going forward.

The biggest mistake one can make as an entrepreneur is thinking that they know everything. The best plan of success is knowing when to pull in an expert. To quote Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, ""everybody needs a coach"".

Running a business, small or large, can far too often feel like fumbling around in the dark hoping you find what you are looking for. In this analogy, though, a business coach serves as your flashlight.

"The case for why Workhorse (WKHS) may moon, UPDATED - u/edar29",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyikgf/the_case_for_why_workhorse_wkhs_may_moon_updated/,michealrwiley94,1,2021-06-13 06:37:14,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyikgf/the_case_for_why_workhorse_wkhs_may_moon_updated/,DD,"My first post received a lot of media attention so I'm posting an update.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.

2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.

3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.

4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.

5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?

6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase. 

7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.

8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.

9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:

1. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.

2. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter &amp; Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.

10. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.

11. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.

12. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.

13. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.

14. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us. 

15. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.

16. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen &amp; Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research. 

17. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.

18. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.

19. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.

2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.

3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.

2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.

3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.

4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.

5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

I am not a financial analyst. I am a physician with a love of finance. I do not give financial advice. This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong. You can lose all of your money on this stock or any stock for that matter. You must do your own homework and research before buying any stock. I personally love this stock and I own over 10,000 shares of it.

Curve.Finance (CRV) is massively undervalued. CRV is the second largest ETH token by Total Locked Value (10B) after AAVE (12B).

**What is Curve Finance?**

CRV Finance is one of the most paradoxical and innovative new DeFi protocols on the crypto market today. It launched in January 2020 with subsequent launch of a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/DAO)) in August 2002. CRV is the in-house token of the DAO. The DAO uses the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)\-based creation tool, Aragon, to connect multiple [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) used for users’ deposited liquidity.

CRV is the token of Curve Finance. It is a stable coin-only (DAI, USDT, and USDC) decentralized exchange (DEX) which (like Uniswap) uses an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) to manage [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity). 

Curve Finance has experience exponential growth since the second half of 2020 with month over month user growth. As of June 12th, 2020, it has become the largest DEX in terms of TLV, exceeding both AAVE and Compound with 8.3B in locked value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is CRV undervalued in regards to Market Cap to TVL ?**

First, we have to understand some fundamentals regarding defi metrics. The total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked into a DeFi platform. On a platform that does borrowing and lending, the TVL would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto the platform, which other users can then borrow. TVL is also being used as a metric to measure growth. If the TVL of a platform increases it generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it is growing.

Like market caps, the TVL can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire DeFi space. On [www.defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/), you can view the TVL for the total DeFi space as well as individual platforms.

The market cap to TVL ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the amount of funds locked on the platform. It can be easily found on [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/). Since the TVL can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly. To calculate the market cap to TVL ratio simply divide the market cap by the TVL. Any value less than 1 means that a platform’s TVL is higher than their market cap. CRV has a ratio of less than 1. Specifically, their Market Cap to LVL Ratio demonstrates an ultra low ratio of .07572 as of 6/12/21.

**Understanding DeFi Risks and Impermanent Losses:**

Defi is at the cutting edge of blockchain technology. As with all new technology, risks are inherent and cannot be completely eliminated. Curve Finance has attempted to mitigate risk with code and platform audits to promote transparency. Audit partners noted on their website include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Mix Bytes. 

[Bug Bounties and Frequent Audits support Protocol Security](https://preview.redd.it/firkmjcp60571.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dc9493a25df39dc5b564adad129036cf35e5874)

If you have ever provided liquidity to a liquidity pool just to realise that some of your coins have gone missing, then you have experience impermanent loss. In essence, impermanent loss is a temporary loss of funds occurring when providing liquidity. It’s very often explained as a difference between holding an asset versus providing liquidity in that asset. Impermanent loss is usually observed in standard liquidity pools where the liquidity provider (LP) has to provide both assets in a correct ratio, and one of the assets is volatile in relation to the other. Although impermanent loss is lessened significantly in a stable coin pool, it is still present and should be accounted for when providing liquidty because Curve Finance (like Uniswap) uses a constant product market maker to maintain a correct ratio of tokens in the pool. 

You can estimate potential losses and returns by using the Baller App, [https://baller.netlify.app/](https://baller.netlify.app/), a nifty program which is designed to estimate impermeant losses when providing pool liquidity. 

**Network Usage &amp; Sentiment:**

Curiously, most retail users are not talking about the Curve.Fi DEX despite the fact that CRV contains more stablecoins than any other exchange except Binance AND it has had month over month user growth with an exponential increase in total locked volume (TLV). 

[Credit: https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheShual\/status\/1401482416523550722?s=20](https://preview.redd.it/ucqebugx60571.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff48bad265b235d99740e829f7991d0275d86fa0)

I suspect the reason for CRV flying under the radar to date is that it’s user interface has the appearance of a 1990s era Windows 3.1 platform. The UI does not engender confidence in the system or provider for a user-friendly experience. 

Fortunately, this is expected to soon change with unofficial discord confirmation that an alternative UI is in the works; ETA not specified at this point. 

**Curve Finance V2** 

The V1 version of [Curve carved a niche](https://www.coindesk.com/pancakeswap-uniswap-sushiswap-crypto-defi-exchange) for itself as a place to trade stablecoins by creating a new automated trading model with extremely low slippage, even on very large trades.

On June 10th, 2021, Curve Finance launched v2 on ETH Polygon; it reflects a model in which greater liquidity could be achieved on a pool of volatile assets by [using a dynamic peg](https://curve.fi/files/crypto-pools-paper.pdf). 

The V2 version of Curve.Fi is built on [Ethereum layer 2 Polygon](https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-bitcoin-ether-crypto-market-rebounds). The Ethereum version contains [$USDT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click), and the Polygon version contains am3Crv, [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click). 

Curve V2 is analogous to a more automated version of Uni v3.  To wit: under Uniswap v3, liquidity providers were able to define the prices at which they were willing to trade. This was powerful because it allowed the AMM to have much more funds available within the prices people were likely to want to trade. Previously, a large trade could move an AMM so far out of line with the market that traders might trade less than they wanted. 

This Uniswap v3 approach requires very active management on the part of LPs. Curve v2 proposes automating roughly the same system. Basically, it identifies an internal price peg based on trading on Curve and concentrates the liquidity around that peg. The peg can move, but it will only do so if moving doesn’t cause liquidity providers to incur too much loss. Stable coin trading pools will remain the same from V1 to v2. 

Defi Dividends noted an example of how Curve performs against Uni V3 in stable coin trading pairs of varying amounts. Notably, CRV performed better in ALL ranges for every stablecoin tested.

&amp;#x200B;

**Locked Value and Defi Metrics:**

Curve has $7.2 billion in total value locked on it now versus $6.4 billion on Uniswap, according to [DeFi Pulse](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-pulse-decentralized-finance-data-site-tvl). It should be noted that Curve has an active [liquidity mining](https://www.coindesk.com/video/what-is-yield-farming-defis-hot-trend-explained) program to incentivize participation and Uniswap does not.

Curve has had [$124 million in trade volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/) over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Uniswap has seen $1.5 billion in trade volume over the same period between [version 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and [version 3](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/).

In terms of DEX, Curve Finance is the #1 provider of liquidity and locked value with remarkable staying power on the Defi Pulse Index.

As of June 9th, Curve Finance reported that DefiPulse Volume was underreporting. https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1401832224161423363?s=20

They noted that they had 10 billion in total pool deposits plus daily volume with another 900million on Polygon. The platform sees an average daily trading volume of +$166,000,000. Compare this to Uniswap V2 on the same day with total liquidity of 4.8 billion and 599 million

TDLR [Curve.Fi](https://Cure.Fi) Summary:

\-Curve.Fi  is a highly profitable and growing stablecoin DEX with low slippage and automated market makers

\-Curve.Fi has more stablecoins than Coinbase, or another other DEX/centralized exchange, except Binance

\-CRV has 10B in locked value (more than sushi AND uni combined). This makes CRV the second most valuable ETH token by total locked value after AAVE

\-High yields can be generated using the CRV token for staking and liquidity/yield farming

\- Market Cap to TVL ratio is an incredible .07 at present! 

\- Curve.Fi.v2 launched 2 days ago and permits pooled use of non-stablecoin crypto with more automation than uni v3 with better value, especially on large (&gt;10M) volume

\- Late '90s JAVA style UI may have limited retail awareness to date. It is being replaced in the near future with an alternative UI

\- Polygon, 1inch, Fanton support. May be ported on equilibrium when PolkaDot launches after Kusama's first 5 parachain auctions

\- Unprecedented month over month exponential growth despite the recent slump in crypto. The current price of CRV does not reflect its recent  5x TVL since Jan 2021 and 2x growth in TVL since the May 19th liquidity collapse (unlike most other currently stagnant DEXs).

Remember learning about compound interest in school? Compound interest occurs when interest earned gets added to the principal amount invested, and then the interest rate gets applied to the new (larger) principal. When you compound you earn interest on your interest, which results in exponential returns. This is not new, nor is it specific to DEFI or crypto. Compounding is the best magic in finance and the key to growing your funds year over year. 

&amp;#x200B;

In DEFI, a smart contract has to be called to distribute your earned rewards to you. This call has costs, it costs some gas to execute that transaction on the blockchain, and you have to go make this call every time you want to harvest your rewards and add them to your principal and enjoy compounding. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apescape is building autocompounding into every applicable product. Automation (that's the auto in autocompounding) handles all of the steps of compounding with maximum efficiency. Remember when we said Apes Together Strong? Each time anyone interacts with the contract, it will compound positions for everyone with positions in that pool. That's right, where a bank would maximize fees, we've batched together transactions for efficiency. What is good for one is good for all here. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can toggle autocompounding On and Off in the upper right of each farm, see how much has been converted for you, and a timer that shows you how long it has been since the last compound on each farm.

&amp;#x200B;

It all starts with $NTRO, a bonding curve token that can only be purchased on the Ape Escape website in the SWAP section. Once you buy $NTRO, you can stake it to either earn $BNB or $ROKT. 

&amp;#x200B;

With your $ROKT, you can either market sell it, market sell half into $BNB and provide liquidity, or you can stake it to earn $BNB.

&amp;#x200B;

If you provide liquidity, you can earn even more $ROKT and keep the compounding going.

&amp;#x200B;

While you’re staked, you’re earning $BNB through $NTRO and swap fees if you’re providing liquidity too. The rewards keep stacking and stacking. In the first month of Ape Escape, we’ve rewarded $NTRO holders $64,278 in $BNB. For a token with $254,408 market cap, that is HUGE.

&amp;#x200B;

Compound interest is magic that few understand.

&amp;#x200B;

APY is the % return annually if you were to compound daily: APY = (1 + r/n)n – 1

&amp;#x200B;

r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)

n = the number of times your product calculates compound interest in a year (e.g. 12 for monthly, or 4 for quarterly).

&amp;#x200B;

APR is the % return annually if you were to just accrue interest with no compounding. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example: $10,000 into the ROKT pool yields 22,393% APY and 545.62% APR

APR: $64,562 after 1 year

APY: $2,239,371.26 after 1 year

&amp;#x200B;

Would you rather buy a token and hope and pray it gets a 10x OR would you rather buy a token and compound it every day, sometimes multiple times per day, watching that 10x unfold before your eyes? Farming isn’t much, but its honest work and the math supports it. You’re much better off participating in a farm or multi token ecosystem where you’re managing exposure to just one asset. 

&amp;#x200B;

The end vision for Ape Escape is a DAO that is like pickle meets inverse finance. As we develop the ecosystem we’re going to roll out more autocompounding features like the ability to actively diversify your investment. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance on our farm right now, you can only autocompound your liquidity position. In the future you’ll be able to say I want to take 10% of the compounding every day and put that into $BNB or something else. Over time, you’ll balance your exposure and come out ahead. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are enormous gains to be made in defi because of this autocompounding magic, but first people have to understand that there is a lot more to life than buying $DOGE and hoping it gets to a dollar. That kind of hopium is toxic and we need to help spread the word that there are much larger opportunities in DeFi today. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was no premine or presale to $NTRO nor $ROKT. Everyone is in the same boat earning these tokens over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

$ROKT has a continuous issuance of 0.1 token per BSC block mined. The first year issuance will be about 1,314,000 tokens. There are about 175,000 $ROKT in circulation today. There are about 41,500 $NTRO in circulation today.

$NTRO is minted when you purchase it through the website. It is backed by staked BNB/CAKE that is farmed on every purchase, yield returns. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ape Escape has been live for a little over 1 month and so far our yields are holding strong. $NTRO is that fuel though. At this point if someone were to come by and just give it a little push, the ecosystem would take off and you’d see some serious yields. To date we have awarded $NTRO holders $65,278 in $BNB rewards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Buy $NTRO on the Ape Escape website to fuel the ecosystem. 

Stake your $NTRO to earn $ROKT or earn $BNB.

Stake your $ROKT to earn $BNB

Pool 2 staking available too.

$NTRO market cap today is $254,408

$ROKT market cap today is $165,122

&amp;#x200B;

ROKT can be earned by anyone who provides value to the network. The current ROKT issuance allocation is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

50x BNB/ROKT LP - Liquidity providers of ROKT and BNB.

25x DAO Treasury - Fully Controlled by ROKT token holders.

15x Core Team - The creators of the DAO.

**What is Curve Finance?**

CRV  Finance is one of the most paradoxical and innovative new DeFi  protocols on the crypto market today. It launched in January 2020 with  subsequent launch of a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/DAO)) in August 2002. CRV is the in-house token of the DAO. The DAO uses the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)\-based creation tool, Aragon, to connect multiple [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) used for users’ deposited liquidity.

CRV  is the token of Curve Finance. It is a stable coin-only (DAI, USDT, and  USDC) decentralized exchange (DEX) which (like Uniswap) uses an  automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) to manage [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity).

Curve  Finance has experience exponential growth since the second half of 2020  with month over month user growth. On  June 12th, 2020, Coinmarketcap  noted that Curve&gt;Fi was the largest DEX in terms of TLV, exceeding  both AAVE and Compound with 8.3B in locked value.  Of note, LTV of the  two two platforms is noted to fluctuate and rankings may change from day  to day until one of these two platforms furthers it's net growth enough  to pull away as the leader.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is CRV undervalued in regards to Market Cap to TVL ?**

First,  we have to understand some fundamentals regarding defi metrics. The  total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked  into a DeFi platform. On a platform that does borrowing and lending, the  TVL would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto  the platform, which other users can then borrow. TVL is also being used  as a metric to measure growth. If the TVL of a platform increases it  generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it  is growing.

Like market caps, the TVL can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire DeFi space. On [www.defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/), you can view the TVL for the total DeFi space as well as individual platforms.

The  market cap to TVL ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the  amount of funds locked on the platform. It can be easily found on [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/).  Since the TVL can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can  be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly.  To calculate the market cap to TVL ratio simply divide the market cap by  the TVL. Any value less than 1 means that a platform’s TVL is higher  than their market cap. CRV has a ratio of less than 1. Specifically,  their Market Cap to LVL Ratio demonstrates an ultra low ratio of .07572  as of 6/12/21.

**Understanding DeFi Risks and Impermanent Losses:**

Defi  is at the cutting edge of blockchain technology. As with all new  technology, risks are inherent and cannot be completely eliminated.  Curve Finance has attempted to mitigate risk with code and platform  audits to promote transparency. Audit partners noted on their website  include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Mix Bytes.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bug Bounties and Frequent Audits support Protocol Security](https://preview.redd.it/2r59if8j73571.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c3897e05b63c65f7661f87b0d7c43639bede0fc)

&amp;#x200B;

If  you have ever provided liquidity to a liquidity pool just to realise  that some of your coins have gone missing, then you have experienced  impermanent loss. In essence, impermanent loss is a temporary loss of  funds occurring when providing liquidity. It’s very often explained as a  difference between holding an asset versus providing liquidity in that  asset. Impermanent loss is usually observed in standard liquidity pools  where the liquidity provider (LP) has to provide both assets in a  correct ratio, and one of the assets is volatile in relation to the  other. Although impermanent loss is lessened significantly in a stable  coin pool, it is still present and should be accounted for when  providing liquidty because Curve Finance (like Uniswap) uses a constant  product market maker to maintain a correct ratio of tokens in the pool.

You can estimate potential losses and returns by using the Baller App, [https://baller.netlify.app/](https://baller.netlify.app/), a nifty program which is designed to estimate impermeant losses when providing pool liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Network Usage &amp; Sentiment:**

Curiously,  most retail users are not talking about the Curve.Fi DEX despite the  fact that CRV contains more stablecoins than any other exchange except  Binance AND it has had month over month user growth with an exponential  increase in total locked volume (TLV).

&amp;#x200B;

I  suspect the reason for CRV flying under the radar to date is that it’s  user interface has the appearance of a 1990s era Windows 3.1 platform.  The UI does not engender confidence in the system or provider for a  user-friendly experience.

Fortunately,  this is expected to soon change with unofficial discord confirmation  that an alternative UI is in the works; ETA not specified at this point.

**Curve Finance V2**

The V1 version of [Curve carved a niche](https://www.coindesk.com/pancakeswap-uniswap-sushiswap-crypto-defi-exchange)  for itself as a place to trade stablecoins by creating a new automated  trading model with extremely low slippage, even on very large trades.

On  June 10th, 2021, Curve Finance launched v2 on ETH Polygon; it reflects a  model in which greater liquidity could be achieved on a pool of  volatile assets by [using a dynamic peg](https://curve.fi/files/crypto-pools-paper.pdf).

The V2 version of Curve.Fi is built on [Ethereum layer 2 Polygon](https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-bitcoin-ether-crypto-market-rebounds). The Ethereum version contains [$USDT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click), and the Polygon version contains am3Crv, [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click).

Curve  V2 is analogous to a more automated version of Uni v3.  To wit: under  Uniswap v3, liquidity providers were able to define the prices at which  they were willing to trade. This was powerful because it allowed the AMM  to have much more funds available within the prices people were likely  to want to trade. Previously, a large trade could move an AMM so far out  of line with the market that traders might trade less than they wanted.

This  Uniswap v3 approach requires very active management on the part of LPs.  Curve v2 proposes automating roughly the same system. Basically, it  identifies an internal price peg based on trading on Curve and  concentrates the liquidity around that peg. The peg can move, but it  will only do so if moving doesn’t cause liquidity providers to incur too  much loss. Stable coin trading pools will remain the same from V1 to  v2.

Defi Dividends noted an  example of how Curve performs against Uni V3 in stable coin trading  pairs of varying amounts. Notably, CRV performed better in ALL ranges  for every stablecoin tested.

&amp;#x200B;

**Locked Value and Defi Metrics:**

Curve has $7.2 billion in total value locked on it now versus $6.4 billion on Uniswap, according to [DeFi Pulse](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-pulse-decentralized-finance-data-site-tvl). It should be noted that Curve has an active [liquidity mining](https://www.coindesk.com/video/what-is-yield-farming-defis-hot-trend-explained) program to incentivize participation and Uniswap does not.

Curve has had [$124 million in trade volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/)  over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Uniswap  has seen $1.5 billion in trade volume over the same period between [version 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and [version 3](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/).

In  terms of DEX, Curve Finance is the #1 provider of liquidity and locked  value with remarkable staying power on the Defi Pulse Index.

As of June 9th, Curve Finance reported that DefiPulse Volume was underreporting. [https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1401832224161423363?s=20](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1401832224161423363?s=20)

They  noted that they had 10 billion in total pool deposits plus daily volume  with another 900million on Polygon. The platform sees an average daily  trading volume of +$166,000,000. Compare this to Uniswap V2 on the same  day with total liquidity of 4.8 billion and 599 million

**Tokenomics:**

There are a total of 3.03b CRV to be entered into circulation. The distribution is as such:

· 62% to community liquidity providers

· 30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting

· 3% to employees with 2 years vesting

· 5% to the community reserve

**The initial supply of around 1.3b (\~43%) is distributed as such:**

· 5% to pre-CRV liquidity providers with 1 year vesting

· 30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting

· 3% to employees with 2 years vesting

· 5% to the community reserve

TDLR [Curve.Fi](https://cure.fi/) Summary:

\-Curve.Fi  is a highly profitable and growing stablecoin DEX with low slippage and automated market makers

\-Curve.Fi has more stablecoins than Coinbase, or another other DEX/centralized exchange, except Binance

\-CRV  has 10B in locked value (more than sushi AND uni combined). This makes  CRV the second most valuable ETH token by total locked value after AAVE

\-High yields can be generated using the CRV token for staking and liquidity/yield farming

\- Market Cap to TVL ratio is an incredible .07 at present!

\-  Curve.Fi.v2 launched 2 days ago and permits pooled use of  non-stablecoin crypto with more automation than uni v3 with better  value, especially on large (&gt;10M) volume

\-  Late '90s JAVA style UI may have limited retail awareness to date. It  is being replaced in the near future with an alternative UI

\- Polygon, 1inch, Fantom support. May be ported on equilibrium when PolkaDot launches after Kusama's first 5 parachain auctions

\-  Unprecedented month over month exponential growth despite the recent  slump in crypto. The current price of CRV does not reflect its recent   5x TVL since Jan 2021 and 2x growth in TVL since the May 19th liquidity  collapse (unlike most other currently stagnant DEXs).

The Curve team discovered a bug in the CRV. Finance Factory contracts that Notes. Finance use. Funds have not been lost and there is no theft-based exploit but we recommend all users to unstack and withdraw funds from notes. finance now.

Going forward Curve is building a new factory contract that:

1. Prevents the bug found today and

2. Will be further optimized for CoinFLEX’s Note Tokens and their interest payments.

We expect this process to be quick.

We are really glad to be working with the Curve team, they’ve handled this issue extremely professionally and we look forward to our relationship becoming closer over time.

I've been really good at my previous ISOM classes, and while Finance is really difficult, I've been studying really hard and developed a solid understanding. In ISOM, I understand the material just by going to class. I thought maybe I'd get an 'A' in each class and provide myself a buffer for next year's classes. 

Unfortunately, my finance class's grade is based entirely on 4 tests. I got a 97 on the first one, 10 points higher than the average, much to my surprise. On the second test, I thought I understood the material much better than the first test. Then I got a 61%, the worst grade in the class. 

That was a horrifying moment, especially since the class is graded on a curve, but I soon realized that I didn't upload a page of my test worth 20% of the grade. My professor is very reasonable, and typically somewhat lenient about test grading, so I'm praying he might accept the missing page now and I can get partial credit, but I'm just frustrated. I can beat the class average by a little (5 points) assuming I get a perfect score on the missing section and he doesn't take points off the top for forgetting it. 

I'm just frustrated that I studied 15 hours for that test, only to make a stupid mistake like forgetting to upload one of the 7 pages and now I'm in this situation. I'm trying SO hard and it's just not working out.

On top of that, one of my group assignments for ISOM got a 62% and I can't believe it. It was supposed to be a simple assignment about a concept we entirely understand, but the prompts told us to write 2-3 sentences for each question, which we did, but then the TAs left a bunch of comments about how we didn't include ""enough detail."" I just want to scream. They're grading us off a rubric that we didn't get to see until after the assignment was graded, for NO reason. And HOW do you include detail in 2-3 sentences??

I've sent emails to both professors trying to get my missing test page graded in the first and to get my assignment looked at by the professor instead of a TA in the second. I'm just so tired though. Why is the school system like this? Why can you work really hard and understand the material, but then make a mistake or two and have no chance to fix things? Why does the class format make it impossible to recover from a mistake or misunderstanding? Why do I feel like I've kicked a puppy or committed a crime because I messed up in a class? It creates this sinking hole of anxiety in my chest and even though I have so much work to do today, I can't focus on it because I'm so miserable.

I really gave up half of my summer for this."

I was so sad because I love the pods and hearing their ignorance was disappointing. Then I perked up at the realization that, honestly, this is just a reflection of how early we really are. I think it’s easy for us (at least me) to believe my echo chamber of the books I read and subs I follow are reflective of a larger consensus than it actually is. Talk to you parents, grandparents, siblings, coworkers; look at mainstream media; this is more reflective of reality. The massive majority of people are either (1) totally clueless, or (2) grossly misinformed. I just like these reminders from time to time that while I’m not wayyy ahead of the curve (and that can often be a dangerous place to be), I am still well in front of it.

Lets be honest here... The rates on IRON-USDC are so high on Polygon that all of us have Yolo'd way too much money into it. The last week the rates went absolutely crazy. Every autocompounder deposits into Iron Finance and receives rewards in TITAN. TITAN went up about 10x over the last week, which is why we have all seen the rates go crazy. Part of the reason that TITAN is because TITAN is used to create more IRON, 20% of each IRON is TITAN and 80% is USDC.

But for anyone else that doesn't want all of their stablecoin farming in the somewhat crazy IRON-USDC world, here are some other places to take a look at.

I'm exploring defi options on Ethereum and started playing around with apps on Polygon (I know gas is low now but I remember trying to do things in April/May and couldn't justify gas at that time). I moved some USDC and deposited into Aave and in my wallet are aUSDC. On Curve I see there is an option to deposit aTokens. Am I really able to do this? I was going to keep adding to my USDC pool in Aave over time taking out small loans to put into Curve &amp; Sushiswap stablecoin pools but if I can utilize my aTokens in Curve this would be amazing. Also, what are the inherent risks of using my aTokens outside of loss of peg?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still very blown away by Defi and what it can do for people, this is seriously the future for everyone to earn passive income and savings since traditional finance is pitiful. I just hope the space can continue to grow. Thanks in advance"

I recently turned 25 and life has thrown another curveball into my midst. Some very brief background: I was raised welfare poor, shelters, no real family, adverse circumstances, etc. I worked my way up to making 6 figures a year and broke the poverty cycle (somewhat) in a HCOL city before turning 24. 2 years ago, I embarked on starting my associates degree from which I graduated last week as well. Now I have a good job with great benefits and retirement, not career per-say, but a job that makes me happy, 5 years of work experience, and an associates. I feel comfortable with attaining a similar job in a similar pay range down the line. 

Attaining an undergrad is a huge part of my life goals as I would be a first gen college grad in my family. The original plan was to do this at a local city school (CUNY) after getting my associates. This was the plan until last week. I was accepted into the city school and had 56 credits left to complete. I would be paying for school by myself and gradating without debt. This felt really great, I have awesome skills, I'd have a degree, and be able to move jobs without people scoffing at my lack of undergrad on my resume. 

Until I got accepted into an Ivy last thursday. Columbia GS to be exact. After reviewing my financial aid package, I would have to make up about 30k a year in tuition costs. I've also gotten a curve ball that a portion of my credits won't transfer, so I'll be committed to about 72 more credits until graduation. The plan is to attend part time but after speaking to admissions, it was recommended that I quit my job and go full-time in my last year because there are very few classes available in the morning/evening and none on the weekends. (Completely different from the city school which I can do while saving and maintaining my job). 

I know the decision comes down to me and what I want out of life but I would love some outside perspective. I work in finance and all of my coworkers think the potential $90k in debt upon graduation and potential time off is worth it for future earning potential. That's assuming I even decide on a career (hello, I'm 25, I don't know what I want to be doing and I wasn't stressed about it until now). 

At what point is the decision my poverty mentality trying to achieve social status? At what point do I stop proving that I can achieve things and just live my life because columbia feels like another thing to tack on to my list of ""Well I overcame x by y""? Most importantly, and I'm hoping for some sage advice, as a person of a no-income background who managed to find some kind of stability in the world and not be unhappy, is there even a point on to take on debt from an ivy? Potentially go through years of repayment...? I have no debt now and that main goal was to go to college without debt, but the \*IVY\* just threw things into a different perspective. EEK!

Post-Titan and post-AAVE promo rates, I've been looking to move around liquidity and am considering Quickswap. My understanding is that Quickswap is a fork of Uniswap where they claim to have only changed a few lines of code. With Titan PTSD, I'm kind of worried about potential bugs / issues that may arise if adapting Ethereum code to that of Polygon Network will introduce problems. I'm curious if anyone has done a deeper dive on Quickswap or their dev team; part of me worries that they're well-intended folks who may not totally grasp what they're doing (which is the same as my impression of the Iron Finance team).

FYI, my risk tolerance isn't too high. I've been paranoid of anything beyond AAVE and Curve. Even Sushiswap is a bit worrisome to me (though I'm open to being convinced about both Sushi and Quick!).

This isn't FUD, but I just want to hear someone defend Quickswap before I move some LP. "

I'm a business intelligence analyst and have been contacting for the past 2/3 years in London. I've just received two job offers and it's so hard to tell which one to pick so thought I would ask here.
Basically, there are two roles, one permanent, one maternity leave contract.
Perm is with a massive telecoms company but through a consultancy firm (based in India). The contract is with a small boutique finance company.
I've been diversifying my experience in different markets with the aim to eventually build my own consultancy firm in process analysis and BI. Since returning to the UK for 7 years in China, I've found it difficult to readjust into London life and a few roles I've had didn't end well but were great learning curves. As time had gone on I've gotten more adjusted and better at delivering results in jobs in London though I've had thoughts of wanting a more permanent role from time to time as I worry I don't know if I'm growing fast enough to justify continued contracting. This has made the decision even harder because either choice will take me on a different journey but both have prospects.

Perm role details: data analyst (telecoms)
Standard pay for my skills, 
consulting role (though with Indian consultancy firm so not the same perks and also, I do feel a little like I did in China. Hired more for being a native westerner than for my skills, but still, my skills will be used), 
uses Qlik sense which I've had 5 years experience in and may want to continue to brush up on. 
There's support from the consultancy firm but it's very hands off management as well from the telecoms company which I think may be a good mix potentially.

Contact role: lead data analyst (finance)
Better pay (Inc car allowance; 20% better, excluding car allowance: 10%),
First finance opportunity I've been offered which will help diversify my portfolio of experience,
Boutique size means my voice can be heard more (potentially),
Another crucial aspect is this role is a lead data analyst role, leading the weekly scrum meetings so it's a slight step up for me with a lot to learn.
It will use power BI which I have less experience in (just 1 year) but it seems more popular here with SMEs and it's easier to use (I think).
They talk about possible extension once maternity leave is over but I doubt it.
Possibly good learning curve with hand over period

Both are working from home so no worries there.

I need to make the decision by end of today potentially (at maximum push, Monday 21st) so it's killing me because both are excellent opportunities, but which is best to move forward in my career?! I know it's down to me but anyone with thoughts and inputs, I would highly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance all :)"

Capitalism is not a bad thing. Nor is it a bad word. IF AND ONLY IF we all started at the same starting point.

The problem with capitalism today is that some people are simply born more fortunate and that puts them significantly ahead of the curve.

As capitalism suggests, it requires capital. There are 2 ways we make a living today — using capital to earn wages or using labour to earn wages. For example, allowing your land to work for you by receiving rental on land (capital) or using your time to work for you by receiving wages on time basis (labour).

# Evolution of Capital

While we think of capital as land, money or other fixed assets, the good news is that capital is about to change.

The capital of the future lies in **digital capital**. It could be digital tools like algorithms, quant-finance models or machine learning tools. Hence, going down this path, you'd realise that the evolution of capital tend towards those with existing capital to begin with.

The amount of capital, resources, time and skills required to build a quant-finance model is not something you can find on the street. Thus, this becomes disadvantageous to people exchanging labour for wages.

&gt;This enhances the inequality that we see today.

# Open-source Web 3 to the rescue

This is where tokens, web3 and open-sourced system come into the picture.

&gt;In short, we are making these digital capital available for everyone

How? The code, mechanisms, math, algorithm, general smart contract code are all open-sourced and available to use. This levels out the playing field and allows everyone to start on the same point.

Instead of struggling to get the digital capital, the digital capital is open-sourced and available for anyone to use.

&gt;The key now becomes ""how do I use these resources available?""

In the book, we guide you through the economic principles to be considered and how the various mechanisms are used in DeFi. Together, they form the foundation to use these digital resources available and build a robust internal economy.

More specifically, read chapters 2 and 3 for the evolution of economics and understand the new ways of coordination and incentives in a tokenised economy.

Capitalism is not a bad thing. Nor is it a bad word. IF AND ONLY IF we all started at the same starting point.

The problem with capitalism today is that some people are simply born more fortunate and that puts them significantly ahead of the curve.

As capitalism suggests, it requires capital. There are 2 ways we make a living today — using capital to earn wages or using labour to earn wages. For example, allowing your land to work for you by receiving rental on land (capital) or using your time to work for you by receiving wages on time basis (labour).

# Evolution of Capital

While we think of capital as land, money or other fixed assets, the good news is that capital is about to change.

The capital of the future lies in **digital capital**. It could be digital tools like algorithms, quant-finance models or machine learning tools. Hence, going down this path, you'd realise that the evolution of capital tend towards those with existing capital to begin with.

The amount of capital, resources, time and skills required to build a quant-finance model is not something you can find on the street. Thus, this becomes disadvantageous to people exchanging labour for wages.

&gt;This enhances the inequality that we see today.

It’s a DEX specialized for swapping between stablecoins as well as tokenized versions of stablecoins. It acts as a liquidity aggregator, where people add liquidity to different liquidity pools and in return, earn fees.
Michael Egorov (CTO of Nucypher) is the CEO of Curve Finance. It has a total of 17 pools available on the platform. Here, the fees are determined by the DAO. The fees on all pools are 0.04%, out of which 50% of it goes to the liquidity providers and 50% goes to DAO members holding veCRV tokens.
It may not be easy and simple for crypto newbies who have used only CEX’s but there are many resources online where one can get an idea of how to use the platform and understand the basics of it.

**Canadian Overseas Petroleum**

Ticker: XOP.CN - CSE &amp; COPL - LSE

Outstanding Shares: 14B



**About XOP.CN**  

Canadian Overseas Petroleum is an international oil and gas exploration, development and production company actively pursuing opportunities in the United States through the acquisition of Atomic Oil and Gas LLC with operations in Converse County Wyoming, and in sub-Saharan Africa through its ShoreCan joint venture company in Nigeria, and independently in other countries.  

**Atomic Oil &amp; Gas Acquisition**   

In December of 2020 XOP began talks with a Wyoming based oil producer, Atomic Oil &amp; Gas,  a single shareholder company that had become financially distressed due to the rock bottom price of oil during COVID. A purchase deal was negotiated and closed on March 16th 2021, with XOP receiving 100% ownership of Atomic and  backdated revenues to December 2020 (to be recognized as of Mar 16th for accounting purposes) when the discussions began. This represents a step-change in XOP’s fortunes as it immediately turns them into a tier 2 producer overnight! Facts about the deal:  


* This deal was signed at $39/bbl and is currently over $63 representing a 61.5% immediate return on investment on the purchase of atomic.
* This deal is unique in that most Oil &amp; Gas assets that get sold are either aged (declining production curve) or have other financial/production issues.
* Atomic has majority ownership of two young, oil producing fields the Barron Flats Shannon Miscible Flood Unit (57.7% ownership) and the Cole Creek Unit (66.7% ownership). Also one unitized exploration area—the Barron Flats Federal Unit (55.56% ownership). 
* With the deal, COPL acquired 31.1 MMboe (24.7 MMboe net after royalties) of proved and probable reserves (2P) of WTI grade oil.
* Atomic began flooding of the Shannon unit in late 2019/early 2020 and was producing 1,400 BOPD at the gas injection rate they were utilizing (5 MMCF/d)
* When the injection rate is increased to the maximum engineered rate of 10 MMCF/d, production is forecast to increase to 7,000 BOPD (possibly more), this process began in early April and production should be stabilizing soon.
* Cole Creek was described as a duplicate of the Baron Flats Shannon field, and is ready for miscible flooding. Some oil must be drawn from the well to create room in the well for injection, which will also add some immediate incremental production.
* Once Cole Creek has been miscible flooded, combined production from Cole Creek and Shannon could reach 10,000 BOPD.
* Because these fields are so new in their operating life they have production incline curves, not decline curves.
* The majority of the wells needed for production have already been drilled, so no immediate drilling is needed.
* Fields are in the oil friendly state of Wyoming, with no legacy abandonment or reclamation costs. 
* The facilities on these sites are brand new and modern. It is a fairly green field as there is zero gas flaring, gas is captured, re-compressed and re-injected into the well. Also all of the equipment is electric and the electricity is drawn from a nearby wind farm.
* As part of the deal XOP will retain the technical team of Atomic, who will join their own technical team. Atomic’s technical team has the experience designing, installing and running the gas injection equipment, which needs to be duplicated at Cole Creek. It also has been mentioned by CEO Arthur Millholland that a project they are working on in West Africa would also use the same techniques and the technical team could be leveraged for that as well.
* Atomic has two affiliates: The Southwestern Production Corp., the operating entity; and PipeCo, a midstream company holding the pipeline and facility assets (owning the pipeline the pump their oil through).
* The other two interested parties are the operating partner and a JV partner of the original owner. XOP is likely to be able to consolidate to 100% ownership as the operating partner is in severe financial distress and the JV partner is a Chinese national corporation who has been informed by the US treasury they are required to liquidate their US assets.
* As part of the credit facility XOP received an option 20M more then needed to purchase Atomic, which could be used in conjunction with their recent 13M capital raise to fund the purchases to consolidate ownership of the fields.
* The credit facility used to finance the Atomic deal is structure to either mature in 2022 and be paid off, but has an option to be restructured, which the CEO has said may allow them to start paying a **dividend**.

**Other XOP Upsides**

* They are 50% owners in a JV called Shorecan, which has partial ownership of OPL226 which is offshore in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. This represents an opportunity nearly 10x as big as atomic.
* The reserves from OPL226 are in relatively shallow water and have been proven with previous drilling.
* There is estimated to be over 1B barrels of oil in the reserves covered by OPL226. And an estimated medium  term production of 60,000 BOPD, and upwards of 450,000 BOPD long term.
* Essar (the operating partner in OPL226), recently began updating their website regarding OPL226, and the Nigerian senate recently announced that they will be passing their updated petroleum development legislation in May.
* The net effect on XOP on the Shorecan/Essar ownership structure is that COPL owns 10% of the production from OPL226 with an option to buy an additional 20%.

**Other XOP Facts**

* Canadian Overseas Petroleum also trades on the LSE in the UK under the ticker COPL, it is currently under suspension as the Atomic purchase represents a RTO under their rules, and they must submit a prospectus for a re-list. The average volume for COPL on the LSE is 180M shares per day.

**Year End Report Discussion and Analysis**

Disclosure: Although I will do my best in this section to highlight my concerns as well as positives, I am generally bullish on the company so my analysis will likely reflect that bias.  


*UK re-list*  

This is likely to be one of the biggest factors in price movement of both XOP and COPL (barring any massive news on OPL226). It is set to re-list there by end of June. They were forced to suspend trading as the Atomic deal classified as an RTO under their rules. With their massive volume, the share price moves more easily there and will lift XOP with it.

**Atomic Acquisition**  

This represents breathing new life in the company. Unless the situation with COVID happens, XOP never even gets a look at this privately held asset, let alone at the insanely good (in hindsight) price of $39/bl. This is a young asset at the beginning of its 40 year operating life.

  
*Shannon Flats Miscible Flood Unit*  

This is their current money maker, by the end of April this field will be receiving maximum inputs of gas injection and will begin to raise production to predicted peak of 5,000 BOPD or more, so this production increase will begin to really show up on the books in Q2, and will continue to be a low cost revenue centre for them as all they are doing is injecting the gas and collecting the oil, at what is expected to be a very low cost (we should get more clarity on that in Q1 2021 financials due in June). Lastly because the official date for the sale is Dec 1 2020, but the accounting date of record is Mar 16th, XOP will be banking 4 months of revenue for Q1 2021 with the backed revenues from December.

  
*Hedging*

As stipulated by their lender, they took out hedging contracts for gas and oil. The contracts for 2022 constitute only \~20% of the Shannon field’s production, so I feel that it leaves lots of room to take advantage of oil prices rising. The hedging also increase each year, 21-23, which to me shows confidence by the lender and the company that they will be able to hit their production increase targets. Lastly from what I can tell they got decent prices for their hedging.  
*Reserve Report*  
I’ll be honest, this one is a bit over my head technically, but what I can glean from it is that everything is on par from what they thought when they were looking to buy Atomic, so confirmation of the asset is a big plus of this report.  
*Upside of Cole Creek*  
Cole Creek currently has enough wells and the equipment to begin miscible flooding, some oil must be drained first before gas can be injected. This is estimated to produce 3,500 BOP,. because the fields are stacked reserves. They wi;; able to use horizontal drilling and other techniques to operate the Fields off of a much smaller number of wells as they essentially ‘connect’ the different parts of the reserve with drilling  and continue injecting gas (this may be a bit simplistic, but is my understanding of it). This means increased production comes at a relatively low cost.  
Reporting in USD

One other small tidbit I noted, which might be nothing, or might be a bread crumb to the future. I doubled checked to see, but essentially all of the major Canadian oil companies report their financials in CAD (even TC, who has pipelines in Mexico and the US). XOP chose to report their financials in USD, now this may be to simplify the reporting accounting because their production is in the US, or it may be be an indicator of where they would like to see the company listed in the future.  

**Nigeria Updates**  

*Ownership restructure*

Notably XOP was able to settle their dispute with their operating partner in the OPL226 project, which resulted in the company having a carried position in which they will incur no costs until after the first well is drilled, and their position was increased from 5 % to 10%, and they retained their right to purchase an addition 20% stake.

*License risks*

There is still a real risk that the license for OPL226 does not get approved and they never get to drill for oil. The mitigating factor against this are that the president has shown his commitment to getting oil production in that country moving forward (he personally had a company’s license reinstated after there was backlash it had been unfairly taken away), as well as the incoming PIB legislation which will remove the current problematic regulatory body in Nigeria.

*Production upside*

This is where the long term future of XOP lies. The fields that directly surround OPL226 have recently begun producing oil (i believe they are OPL 83-85). One in particular has 18 wells on it’s prospect, and to give you an idea of the scale of OPL226, it has 9 **prospects** that could potentially reach that level of production. If even a portion of this potential is realized it is massive, the oil is in relatively shallow water and is believed to be of fairly high quality, and is low cost to get out of the ground. The low cost of production leads me to another interesting piece of information not in this year end report.  

*LOI on production boat*

In an interview the CEO explained the LOI that had signed for a boat to drill and pump oil for them at OPL226. It is a brand new boat that is currently having it’s controls certified (or it may be finished, the interview is a bit dated now), and because it is a new boat XOP has not be responsible for the commissioning costs (which can be quite substantial and usually need to be paid up front), and are only responsible for delivery costs (which is fuel to drive it from port to site at OPL226). This is an indication that once they receive approval for drilling, production will happen quickly.  
**General Risk Analysis**

*Negative history*

I’ll take these few points to rain on the parade a bit, first point being that the management does not have a history of running a producing oil company or delivering production from the deals they sign. That situation has at least somewhat changed as they have closed on the atomic purchase. The thing that gives me even more confidence that the management risk is reduced is that the major US lender that they used to secure their credit facility is said to have O&amp;G experience and seem to be leveraging the loan to influence XOP’s operations and decisions. For two examples: the lender was the one who required the hedging contracts before giving the loan and of the 65M facility, 45M was for Atomic and the other 20M are for expenditures to be approved “solely at the discretion of the lender” which to me signals they have their fingers on the pulse and will be watching their investment. Which i believe should reassure shareholders.

*Dilution*

There is an absolute ton of outstanding shares. They have added 10b of the 14b shares this year to capitalize to buy atomic. This is obviously less than ideal but I feel this is mitigated by a few things. This trades on the LSE, and volumes on COPL (their UK ticker) have gotten into the hundreds of millions of shares, also on Friday it did 10M volume on the CSE and another 6M on the ATS for a total of 16M, so XOP’s shares are extremely liquid. I would also hope that in the future they would use some of their new found shares to help remedy the dilution dilemma.

My final thoughts are that there is a very bright future for this company in the short and medium term and their long term fortunes will hinge on both OPL226 and how well they manage the proceeds of their excellent acquisition. I’m really looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks and what other info people have found that i missed!"

# 1. Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops Ahead of Looming ‘Death Cross’

&gt;***Bitcoin’s ‘death cross’ could increase selling pressure into the weekend.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin declined about 5% over the past 24-hours as the price broke below $36,000 support. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is still up about 23% year-to-date, although some traders are concerned about the looming ‘death cross,’ which could indicate a shift from a bullish to bearish price trend.  
The death-cross is defined by a cross of the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average, which could occur over the weekend.  
Still, some analysts remain bullish on bitcoin relative to equities.  
“When the equity tide pulls back someday, we expect bitcoin and gold to be the primary beneficiaries,” wrote Mike McGlone, commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence in a Friday report.

## Latest prices

&gt;Cryptocurrencies:  
Bitcoin (BTC) $35469, -5.92%  
Ether (ETH) $2166.02, -7.15%  
Traditional markets:  
S&amp;P 500: 4166.45, -1.31 %  
Gold $1769.37, -0.19%  
10-year Treasury yielded 1.437%, versus 1.52% on Thursday  
Technical backdrop weakens  
“The recent stabilization just isn’t sufficient to suggest buying dips,” wrote Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors told us.  
Newton’s cycle work points to continued weakness this year. “For those who are aggressive traders, any break of 30k should lead down to 20–25k and that should be a better area to consider buying dips for a bounce,” Newton wrote.  
And for ether, Newton expects a volatile decline over the next one or two weeks given the break below prior lows.

# 2. Bitcoin Remains Relatively Resilient Post-Fed as Fiat Currencies Drop Against Dollar

&gt;***Bitcoin remains relatively resilient, having priced in the Fed’s hawkish tilt in advance.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin is trading in familiar ranges even as the U.S. dollar gains ground in currency markets on the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate outlook.  
While the top cryptocurrency has dropped 5% to $38,000 since Wednesday’s Fed rate guidance, it remains locked in a multi-week range of $30,000 to $40,000.  
In contrast, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against the euro, pound, yen and other major currencies, rose above 92.00 early today, reaching its highest level since April, according to TradingView data. Gold and base metals have also taken a beating since Wednesday, pushing commodity currencies like the Australian dollar lower.  
The U.S. dollar’s rally follows an unexpected hawkish tilt at the Fed. On Wednesday, the central bank brought forward projections for the first post-pandemic interest-rate hikes into 2023, challenging the consensus for a weaker dollar for the rest of the year.  
One possible explanation for bitcoin’s resilience could be that the cryptocurrency was relatively oversold heading into the Fed’s announcement, as QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.

# 3. Grayscale Brings 13 More Tokens With DeFi Focus Under Consideration

&gt;***The 13 include 1inch, Bancor, Curve, Polygon and 0x.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Crypto-asset manager Grayscale has added 13 tokens to those under consideration for investment products, most of which are concerned decentralized finance (DeFi).  
The 13 include 1inch, Bancor, Curve, Polygon and 0x (ZRX, -3.38%), Grayscale announced in a tweet Thursday.  
The additions bring the total assets being considered to 31, following from an initial list announced in February.  
Grayscale stressed that not all will be turned into investment products, which requires a significant due process and would be subject to custody arrangements and regulatory considerations.  
Five from the February list have led to the creation of investment products: Basic Attention Token, Chainlink, Decentraland, Filecoin and Livepeer.

# 4. Bitcoin Bounce Falls Short at Resistance, Support at $30K-$34K

&gt;***BTC buyers struggled near $40K resistance this week. Upside appears to be limited.***  
&gt;  
&gt;The relief rally from the June 8 low of about $31,000 was short-lived as buyers struggled near $40,000 resistance this week. Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a monthlong consolidation phase and could face downside pressure into the weekend.  
The daily price chart shows a series of lower price highs since April, which suggests sellers are in control. Initial support is seen at $34,000 and then at $30,000, although upside appears to be limited given the downward sloping 50-day moving average.  
Bitcoin was trading around $37,900 at press time and is down about 3% over the past 24-hours.  
The consolidation phase lacks upside momentum, which, at this moment, does not confirm a decisive bottom in bitcoin.  
The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from an initial oversold reading on May 19. However, the weekly RSI is not yet oversold, which could keep sellers active toward lower support levels.  
Bitcoin’s long-term trend remains intact, although a significant loss of momentum over the past few months suggests an extended period of drawdowns similar to the previous bear market in 2018.

# 5. The Infinite Tomato Economy

&gt;***A satirical tweet about the compounding return on planting tomatoes reveals a lot about contemporary tech culture.***  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s been another wild week, so let’s ease back to talk about something entertainingly dumb: This tweet from Thursday about how to turn $50 into $3.9m in two years by planting tomatoes.  
It’s very hard to know where to start with this. It’s a kind of nth-dimensional object melding hustle-culture brain rot and venture capital pitch-deck anti-math. It encapsulates some of the most pernicious ideas of our economic era, particularly the fetishization of “scale” and a total, unexamined contempt for actual labor. The author’s unrestrained self-importance and manifest ineptitude at real-world business thinking, all while trying to sell himself as a business and investing coach, would be completely at home in the most shameless corners of the crypto hype machine.  
Obviously the proposal itself doesn’t make a lick of sense, starting with the fact that you can’t sell most tomatoes for a dollar. Twitter user [@keewa](http://twitter.com/keewa) was even more incisive, writing that the scheme assumes “infinite growth within a finite system.” In other words, this makes sense only if you assume you don’t need anywhere to plant the tomatoes, or anyone to pick them, or really any inputs whatsoever except seeds.

$2,000/month expendable income

Buying a $96,000 car

Should I use the 48,000 in savings to lower the loan total to $48,000 financed?

Should I finance the full $96,000 and use the savings to make large initial payments to advance myself along in the principal/interest curve of the loan so I’m paying less interest per payment?

Should I get as short of a loan as possible using the maximum amount of my $2,000/month expendable income?

Curve Finance 🔵,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/o45ypu/curve_finance/,subwaybooligan,1,2021-06-20 21:45:06,2,/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/o45ypu/curve_finance/,Polygon (MATIC),"Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum (like **Uniswap**) designed for (1) extremely efficient stablecoin trading (2) low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.

Curve allows users (and smart contracts like **1inch**, **Paraswap**, **Totle** and **Dex.ag**) to trade between DAI and USDC with a bespoke low slippage, low fee algorithm designed specifically for stablecoins and earn fees. Behind the scenes, the liquidity pool is also supplied to the **Compound** protocol or **yearn.finance** where it generates even more income for liquidity providers.

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I trade on Curve?

Before trading, you’ll have to approve Curve to interact with your stablecoin balance, similar to most DeFi applications.

On the exchange page, select the asset you would like to convert (e.g. USDC), and the quantity (e.g. 1,000) - the exchange rate, and quantity that you will receive (including and all slippage and fees) will be displayed. The exchange rate might surprise you - that’s the power of Curve.

### Fees

Fees and pool parameters are decided by the Curve DAO.  
Currently, the fee on all pools is 0.04%, of which 50% goes to liquidity providers, and 50% to veCRV holders (members of the DAO).

### How do I provide liquidity to Curve?

Curve uses **cTokens**, or **Ytokens** assets for lending while market making, as the liquidity pool - this ensures that assets are always being put to work.

You can deposit plain stablecoins - DAI/USDC/USDT/TUSD/BUSD/sUSD which will get converted underneath to cTokens for compound pool or yTokens for **pax**, **y**, **busd** pools or you can click the ""Deposit wrapped"" option to deposit cTokens or yTokens if you have them.

You can also deposit Bitcoin ERC20s - renBTC, WBTC, sBTC in the **ren** and **pools**

### What's ""Use maximum amount of coins available""?

This means using all USDC and DAI in your wallet. This way is recommended only if you have much less coins than currently in liquidity pool.

### What's ""Infinite approval - trust this contract forever""?

This means that you preapprove the contract to be able to spend any amount of your coins when you interact with it. This means that you won't be asked every time to approve the amount of coins you want to transfer to the contract.

### How to withdraw liquidity I provided?

Go to the withdraw page. If you want to withdraw some percentage of your liquidity (the preferred way), type that percentage in the top field. You can, however, withdraw in a form of individual coins (USDC, DAI, ...), having the exchange happening for you, if you type amounts in lower fields. You'll get charge with the exchange fee in the latter case."

DeFi: what it is and how it works

The term “Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) covers financial services carried out on a blockchain. DeFi are financial services with no central authority. It involves taking traditional elements of the financial system and replacing the middleman with a smart contract. We can also describe it as the merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology, in layman’s terms.

So, for DeFi to work, it needs a decentralized infrastructure to run on. This is where the Ethereum blockchain comes into play. The Ethereum blockchain is a DIY platform for decentralized applications (DApps).

Most DeFi protocols operate on the Ethereum blockchain, although a few have migrated to other competing blockchains to enjoy greater speed and scalability.DeFi: what it is and how it works

The term “Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) covers financial services carried out on a blockchain. DeFi are financial services with no central authority. It involves taking traditional elements of the financial system and replacing the middleman with a smart contract. We can also describe it as the merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology, in layman’s terms.

So, for DeFi to work, it needs a decentralized infrastructure to run on. This is where the Ethereum blockchain comes into play. The Ethereum blockchain is a DIY platform for decentralized applications (DApps).

## DeFi’s top applications — and notable protocols 

Now, that we know what DeFi is, let’s look at some of its notable applications.

**1. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**

Decentralized exchanges are exchanges that operate without an intermediary. They are not as popular as their centralized counterparts. 

With DEXs, users can connect directly with one another to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in a trustless environment. Assets traded under DEXs are never held in an escrow or third party wallet, as is done with centralized exchanges. Some top DEXs include Uniswap, Curve and SushiSwap. 

Centralized exchanges, on the other hand, are trading platforms operated by a central authority. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase are popular examples of centralized exchanges. They are custodial in nature. In other words, the buyers and sellers trust the central authority to keep their digital assets safe.

**2. Lending Platforms**

DeFi proponents say the decentralized lending platforms are democratizing the lending ecosystem. These platforms use smart contracts in place of intermediaries like banks — allowing borrowers and lenders to participate in an open system. Lenders can earn interest on their crypto assets by loaning them out, while borrowers can access liquidity without selling off their assets. 

With the traditional financial system, you need to offer collateral before you can access loans from the bank. This is similar to what happens in DeFi. Borrowers have to over-collateralized their loans by offering assets more valuable than the loan value. Some of the top DeFi lending platforms include Maker, Compound, and Aave.

**3. Prediction Markets**

A prediction market allows participants to make bets on the outcomes of future events. These platforms function like traditional prediction markets — but with blockchain functionality, which eliminates intermediaries. Examples of DeFi prediction markets are Augur, Gnosis and FTX. Crypto powered prediction markets flourished during the 2020 U.S. presidential elections. Augur recorded a milestone volume of over $8 million. Other platforms like Polymarket and Predictit also saw significant election volumes.

**4. Yield farming**

Yield farming is the process of locking up cryptocurrencies in exchange for a reward. It’s the hottest new term in the DeFi space. Money markets Compound and Aave are two major platforms to farm DeFi yields. Yield farmers stake popular coins like ether, dai, tether and others.

## DeFi benefits 

**1. Permissionless**

Traditional banks are expensive to run and bureaucratic in nature. They take too long to process transactions and have cut many people out of the financial system due to their stringent requirements. DeFi came to solve many of these issues. Here are some of its benefits.

DeFi opens everyone to the financial system irrespective of income, race, wealth, culture or geographic location. All a user needs is a mobile phone or computer with internet access.

There is a significant number of unbanked people globally. The World Bank estimated in 2018 that 20% of the world’s population lack access to banking services. One reason for this is that most of the unbanked lack much-needed know-your-customer (KYC) documents like state-issued I.D. cards.

Several DeFi platforms allow users to function without any of this. You can take out a Maker loan, for instance, without any identification or credit score.

**2. Interest rates for investors**

Beyond keeping your wealth like a savings account, DeFi also allows you to earn income. Platforms like Aave and Compound allow you to deposit assets and lend them out to borrowers. At an agreed-upon time, you get your interest and can plow your capital back into the system. 

Compound offers up to 4.3% interest on deposits from some tokens, while Aave is paying out as much as 5.73%. Compared to the 0.6% to 0.7% currently offered by traditional banks for savings accounts, it’s not difficult to see why some people are shifting their assets to DeFi. 

**3. Control over your own finances**

With DeFi platforms, you remain in control of your finances. While you have to deposit your funds into the platform, you decide what happens to them. Instead of trusting human intermediaries to qualify you for a loan or decide how to manage your investments, a smart contract does that.

No one can ban you from a DeFi protocol. The underlying smart contract is law, and it operates blindly. 

**4. Heightened transparency**

DeFi enables a greater level of openness and accessibility. Since most DeFi protocols are built on the blockchain — a public ledger — all activities are available to the public. Anyone can view transactions, but these accounts are not tied to anyone directly as is the case with traditional banks. Instead, accounts are pseudo-anonymous, listing only numerical addresses. Users with programming knowledge can also access most DeFi products’ source code to audit or build upon since they’re open source. Open-source codes are far more secure and of higher quality than proprietary software, thanks to community interaction.

## DeFi drawbacks and security risks 

**1. Security issues with smart contracts**

Smart contracts form the backbone of any DeFi protocol. But they are susceptible to manipulation. 

By default, smart contracts are open-source. This design allows prospective users to review them before investing in the DeFi protocol. Most DeFi protocols give their smart contracts to security firms to audit. This is where the problem begins. It’s not unusual for humans to miss flaws in these contracts, which could be exploited in the future. 

Take The DAO, for example. The digital “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” was an investor-directed venture capital fund of sorts that launched in April 2016 and grew quickly to become the biggest crowdfunding platform, managing about $120 million. However, by June that same year, hackers found a vulnerability in the smart contract and stole about a third of its funds. They moved the funds into a “child DAO,” which had the same structure as the parent protocol. Users couldn’t access their funds for weeks, making this perhaps the largest hack in crowdfunding history.

There have been several refunds since then, allowing investors with residual DAO tokens to get some compensation. However, the incident sparked an awakening in the DeFi space. Now, developers who build protocols ensure that their smart contracts go through multiple audit rounds 

**2. Data feed centralization**

Blockchain protocols can’t access off-chain data. To remedy this, many of them use oracles — third-party services that provide access to external information. Oracles serve as bridges between blockchains and the outside world, relaying information to smart contracts for them to utilize. 

The major issue with oracles is creating a central point of trust into trustless and decentralized setups. This centrality provides a vulnerability for the entire smart contract. When an oracle broadcasts the wrong information, the consequences could be dire. 

Take the case of Synthetix — a DeFi asset issuance platform. On June 25, 2019, an oracle transmitted false price feed data to the platform’s smart contract. A user’s trading bot took advantage of this and inflated the user’s balance. This allowed the user to convert this balance to about 37 million Synthetic ETH (sETH) tokens (worth $70 million at the time). Synthetix confirmed that they reached out to the user, who agreed to reverse the transaction in exchange for an unspecified bug bounty. 

**3. Bad actors**

In September, the top crypto exchange KuCoin confirmed that it had suffered a hack that saw $150 million in bitcoin and ERC-20 tokens transferred from its hot wallets. Days after the event occurred, blockchain intelligence software Elliptic crunched the numbers and found that the exchange had actually lost about $281 million. 

The report added that the hackers had been laundering the funds through DeFi protocols Uniswap, Kyber Network and others. As Elliptic explained, many centralized exchanges had frozen the hackers’ accounts, preventing them from moving their funds. However, in DEXs, the hackers found the perfect conduits — platforms with no central authorities to freeze their funds.

TLDR: **DeFi** are financial services with no central authority. It involves taking traditional elements of the financial system and replacing the middleman with a smart contract. We can also describe it as the merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology, in **layman's terms**."

# 0. Preface

I am not a financial advisor. I do not provide financial advice. Many thoughts here are my opinion, and others can be speculative. 

I'm personally happy to see that there is a shift from GME DD to macro-economics DD. Because it provides a much wider insight into how the market is behaving, and how GME would **NOT** be the cause of a market crash. Everything has been a pressure cooker over the past decade, ready to burst, and the new DD provides insight on when things might go down. 

The new DD also diverges from the expectations of things to shoot up in price every week, where everyone is watching T+21/T+35/Net Capital cycles. It gives a general ""MOASS will most likely occur when everything falls due to liquidation of defaulting Banks / Hedge Funds / Financial Institutions"". 

It gives me peace of mind, because I do not watch for specific dates around GME to cause the surge. I watch the economy at the macro scale to understand when things could blow. 

**And to any skeptics - yes, it is possible that GME could never blow up. Do I think it will blow up? Sure I  do. But I encourage YOU to read this post, disregarding GME, and to instead understand what is going on with the economy on the macro scale.** 

**Even if the GME play is wrong in your eyes, it is good to understand how the economy could crash harder than it did in 2008. I don't care if you don't believe in GME. I care about you, and don't want YOU to be hurt.**

# 1. Before We Begin: An Overview of Repo And Reverse Repo

Repo and Reverse Repo might be a bit confusing. You probably saw on this subreddit or in news that the reverse repo market has been blowing up, and it's a bit concerning.

It's not too complicated if you just imagine it between two entities: the Federal Reserve and Banks.

For both Repo and Reverse Repo, it is an agreement between two parties for one of them to sell some security for a price, and they agree to buy that security back at a later date at a higher price based on some interest rate (usually). This is called a ""Repurchase Agreement"", where ""Repo"" is a standard ""Repurchase Agreement"" and the ""Reverse Repo"" is a ""Reverse Repurchase Agreement"", the inverse of a ""Repo"".

The length of these Repurchase Agreements can be various lengths. Such as overnight, one month, three month, etc.. But what we're seeing is **short-term** **overnight Reverse Repos**. The parties swap, and then the next trading day they swap back. **It is not a permanent extraction of the underlying security. It is an overnight swap. A permanent extraction comes from Quantitative Easing or Quantitative Tightening, both of which I will discuss later.**

* **Repo (Repurchase Agreement)** \- This is where the bank swaps collateral (such as US Treasuries) for cash. This is used when the banks have too much collateral and not enough cash, or when the banks want to generate profit off of giving loans to other parties in the repo market.
* **Reverse Repo (Reverse Repurchase Agreement)** \- This is where the bank swaps cash (liquidity) for collateral (such as US Treasuries). This is used when the banks have too much cash (liquidity) and not enough collateral. The main reason behind this behavior is to pump balance sheets for the night.

Below is a diagram I made which might make this more clear. It is between the Fed (left) and Banks (right):

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Quantitative Easing Can-Kick of 2008, Slowly Draining Collateral From The Market

Note: If you want an overview of what led to the 2008 crash, check out [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy/the_bigger_short_how_2008_is_repeating_at_a_much/) which has a summary of the documentary ""Inside Job (2010)"". It also describes where we're probably headed based on SLR, the DTC, ICC, OCC, NSCC rules, and mortgage default protections expiring June 30th, 2021.

Zoom back in time to 2008. The economy took a massive dump due to Wall Street's abuse of derivatives and leverage. They created a bunch of toxic CDOs mostly consisting of [subprime Mortgages](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprimeloan.asp) to create an economic apocalyptic scenario around Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). Everything was overleveraged and was a massive balloon of bets based on the performance of the MBS's. 

Currently, there's evidence of Wall Street doing the same abuse of toxic CDO's but this time with Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS). \[See above linked post for this detail\]

The economy was hurting pretty bad from the 2008 crash, and it was going to continue going into a complete death spiral until the Federal Reserve (Fed) introduced Quantitative Easing (QE):

&gt;The Fed announced QE1 on November 25, 2008. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announced an aggressive attack on the financial crisis of 2008. **The Fed began buying $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $100 billion in other debt**. QE supported the housing market that the subprime mortgage crisis had devastated. - [Source](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-qe1-3305530) 

If you're still scratching your head on what QE is, here's the Wikipedia overview definition, as well as (hopefully) a more simplified definition.

[Quantitative Easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing) (QE) -  is a monetary policy whereby a central bank purchases at scale government bonds or other financial assets in order to inject money into the economy to expand economic activity. 

* This is what the Fed will do to extract collateral (including US Treasuries) from the economy in order to push in liquidity. The Fed started doing this in 2008 to extract toxic collateral from the market and encourage economic growth because it allowed more cash flow in the economy. 
* This pulls out collateral from the economy, and pushes cash (liquidity) in.
* **It was a ticking timebomb ever since it started, because it extracts collateral from the market, slowly creating a collateral shortage issue.**

Check out the effects of QE on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI):

[DJI Before And After Quantitative Easing Begins](https://preview.redd.it/cktjwttu8k671.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e23f2e54e6204d8c56323d7e6bc8772c1a02535)

It was helping the economy reverse the death spiral, and it has been pumping the economy ever since the introduction of QE. The problem is, of course, that collateral would continue to be sucked out of the market through the mechanics of QE.

**And QE can't continue forever**, because collateral is a fundamental part of the repo market which allows cash to flow in the economy. When you don't have collateral, you can't post the collateral in the market for cash from banks, and thus the flow of cash basically shuts down. You cannot perform a normal repo transaction between a Bank / Hedge Fund / Financial Institution.

The Fed tried to stop QE after a while. Instead of pulling collateral out of the economy, they needed to try to push collateral back into the economy. In order to stop QE, they tried what was, in essence, the ""reverse"" of QE called Quantitative Tightening (QT).

[Quantitative Tightening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening) (QT) -  (or quantitative hardening) is a contractionary monetary policy applied by a central bank to decrease the amount of liquidity within the economy. The policy is the **reverse of** **quantitative easing** **(QE)**, aimed to increase money supply in order to ""stimulate"" the economy.

* This is what the Fed will do to extract liquidity from the economy in order to push in collateral. It is used to attempt to reverse the effects of QE, to try to regain balance in the economy.
* This pulls out cash (liquidity) from the economy, and pushes collateral in.
* **The Fed attempted QT in 2018, but it proved to have very bad consequences on the economy. So, they went back to QE in 2019, continuing to can-kick the effects of the 2008 crash.**

This is a chart showing the Fed's ""Total Assets"", where collateral is an asset for the Fed. So when collateral was extracted from the economy through QE, it went onto their ""Assets"" side of their balance sheet.  When collateral was pushed back into the economy through QT, it was extracted from their ""Assets"" side of their balance sheet.

1. At the start of QE in 2008, there is a surge of assets due to the buying up of MBS's and treasuries. 
2. Around 2018 the assets began to decline because the Fed attempted QT by pushing collateral back into the economy and sucking liquidity out.
3. Around September 2019 the assets began to increase again because the Fed went back to QE after realizing the negative effects it was having on the economy due to causing a liquidity shortage.

So... what happened in September of 2019? **Why did QT fail after a decade of QE**?

# 

# 3. Quantitative Easing Cannot Be Reversed. The Can-Kick Continues Until The Economy Crashes

Despite pumping in a bunch of liquidity into the market through QE, the economy was **still lacking liquidity**. When the Fed started to reverse QE through QT, the liquidity in the market tightened and thus the negative effects on the economy began to surface in September of 2019.

[https:\/\/blog.pimco.com\/en\/2019\/09\/repo-rate-spike-a-tail-of-low-liquidity](https://preview.redd.it/9sd32gdxdk671.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ee9d749419bc2b6c0a84682f6f9b0b886ceca93)

**Less than a year after starting QT**, a liquidity crisis emerged on September 15th, 2019, when the repo rate spiked up severely. This was a clash of events surrounding the lower liquidity issue.

&gt;Banks’ “reporting” dates are known inflection points in the short-term funding markets and typically fall at the end of the month, quarter, and of course the year. **But periodically, the 15th of the month is also a pressure point**. Such was the case this past Monday when a short-term funding rate that had been hovering around 2.21% soared as high as 10%.  
&gt;  
&gt;The funding market succumbed to a trifecta of pressures:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Payments on corporate taxes were due on 15 September, leading to high redemptions of more than $35 billion in money market funds.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Cash balances increased by an additional $83 billion in the U.S. Treasury general account, which reduces excess reserves and simultaneously acts to reduce the aggregate supply of overnight liquidity available in funding markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Dealers needed an additional $20 billion in funding to finance the settlement of recent scheduled U.S. Treasury issuance.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;On September 15, **as so many institutions needed funding**, **repo rates climbed well above the fed funds upper-end target at the time of 2.25% to briefly touch 5%.** **The following day, cash repo markets traded as high as 10% for those looking to finance agency mortgage positions overnight**. **Later that morning, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acknowledged the pressures and conducted its first Open Market Operation (OMO) in more than a decade to add reserves to the funding markets that were clearly in need of the liquidity**. Subsequently, after its meeting Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a cut in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) of 0.30% – five basis points more than its cut in the fed funds rate – providing some relief to the upper bound of money-market yields.  - [Source](https://blog.pimco.com/en/2019/09/repo-rate-spike-a-tail-of-low-liquidity)

Due to the reduced liquidity from QT, because it sucks out liquidity and pushes in collateral, the markets hit a critical point where there was too much cash that was needed and not enough to supply those who needed the cash. There was huge amounts of strain on the economy. 

This was most likely due to continued large leverage + derivatives abuse stemming from what led to the 2000-2007 Housing Market Bubble. The Fed realized that QT could not continue because of the liquidity shortage that was arising. **They had to stop QT and continue QE in order to continue to pull out collateral and pump in liquidity. And thus, the collateral shortage time bomb continued ticking.**

Below is the figure of when the repo rate shot up to \~10% within a day. This was awful, because it was much more expensive for loans to go out. The repo market would have shut down from nobody wanting to spend 10% on a repurchase agreement to get cash for the day. How would ANYONE get 10% return **overnight** to pay for these loans? The flow of cash was about to halt.

# 4. COVID Initiated A Liquidity Crisis In The Banks, Which Now Fights With The Collateral Shortage

QE continued on until 2020, when suddenly, COVID came in. Nobody expected it.

And boy, **oh boy**, did COVID wreak havoc on the economy and the financial world. While the Fed was slowly approaching a collateral crisis through QE, COVID exacerbated the issue due to the sudden impact it had on liquidity. COVID increased liquidity, and when you have a sudden surge of liquidity, you need to balance it with collateral. The economic balance was tipping as of March of 2020.

This does not even take into account the effects of many people losing their jobs, being unable to pay rent/mortgages, and other issues that arose from COVID. Those all apply to another ticking time bomb: the CMBS issue, equivalent to the MBS bubble of 2000-2007, which I discussed in my other post.

The COVID pandemic caused a surge of money being printed from stimulus packages in the US. When you print a bunch of money into the economy on a whim, you risk driving inflation of the currency itself. What does inflation encourage? Less spending from companies, due to the higher price. This leads to less loaning of cash in the repo market, and banks obtaining an ever-surplus of cash.

COVID caused a sudden surge of trillions of dollars worth that the economy couldn't handle naturally. Compare the treasury balance versus the deposits over time, and the surge that occurred in 2020 in response to the pandemic. The COVID stimulus bills pumped in a **massive** amount of money into the economy at the risk of inflation. And we're already seeing the effects of inflation occur on the [supply chain](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-supply-shortages-economy-inventory-chips-lumber-cars-toilet-paper-2021-5):

[https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/monetarypolicy\/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://preview.redd.it/amwahlvykk671.png?width=877&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e343c265451a1b2d6754a4d04971bb445e58f43)

Stimulus checks were sent out to retail. Companies were bailed out. Unemployment increased, resulting in more unemployment benefits going out due to the relief bills. More money printed. More money deposited at banks.

There was a ton of cash (liquidity) being pumped into the economy over the past year from March 2020 to June 2021. Because of this, due to inflation and an excess of cash, banks began to get a surplus of cash deposited. People had more cash. They didn't need to spend money on rent/mortages. Companies didn't want to spend more due to fears of inflation. So, bank deposits went up. 

**The main problem with this is that the cash deposited with the banks became a liability on their balance sheets. When you have a surplus of liabilities on your balance sheet, you need to 'balance' it out with assets, such as US Treasuries.**

The banks were now in trouble because they had way, way too many deposits. They were at risk of defaulting due to their SLR requirements. Here is a figure showing how deposits (liabilities) of banks increased over time. It mushroomed during the COVID pandemic:

[https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/a5e165f7-a524-4b5b-9939-de689b6a1687](https://preview.redd.it/6dm07sa3oj671.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9acce6ceb03841c64828198eefff21eb06b1e310)

To combat this issue, the Fed decided to introduce a relief program for banks regarding SLR because of the massive increase of liquidity due to the uppercut that COVID created on the financial world.

&gt;The supplementary leverage ratio (**SLR**) is the US implementation of the Basel III Tier 1 leverage ratio, **with which banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure**. Large US banks must hold 3%. Top-tier bank holding companies must also hold an extra 2% buffer, for a total of 5%. The SLR, which does not distinguish between assets based on risk, is conceived as a backstop to risk-weighted capital requirements. - [Source](https://www.risk.net/definition/supplementary-leverage-ratio-slr)

In more of a simplified summary, SLR is a requirement of total equity that a bank must hold compared to their total leverage exposure. If they are exposed to leverage, they need to hold enough capital for that position otherwise they are at risk of defaulting. In this case, they only need to hold a measly 3%-5%, dependent on how large of a bank they are. Just like in 2008 - these banks can have massive leverage and SLR is to ""help protect the economy"" from them abusing leverage. 

But hey, the Fed put in place some protections for the year to help these banks since they were obviously overleveraged to begin with. These protections expired on March 31st, 2021.

[https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2021\/03\/29\/the-fed-is-ending-one-of-its-pandemic-relief-progr\/](https://preview.redd.it/14pa4yngtj671.png?width=1433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=534726bcf83b0bf40ede7b196191d66c29094d6e)

&gt;**The Fed's relief program last year allowed banks to exclude U.S. Treasuries and central bank reserves from the SLR calculation**. The relief program was a response to the many non-banking institutions selling Treasuries to raise cash, and coincided with other measures, including the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which resulted in even more Treasuries being sold into the market. - [Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/29/the-fed-is-ending-one-of-its-pandemic-relief-progr/)

**Right after the expiration of the protection plans of SLR, the Reverse Repo market began to blow up because the banks had way too much liquidity and not enough treasuries on their balance sheets.**

The argument that the banks were ""parking their money at the Fed"" was a reasonable explanation at first. Though, with 0% ROI from the RRP at the time, the banks would literally get no return on their investments. So for that argument, all of their other investments would have had to yield negative in order for RRP to be more enticing. Does this make sense to you that they'd use 0% RRP to be an 'investment'?

The fact that the RRP began to ramp up and then explode after the SLR protections lifted makes this look like a collateral shortage issue. And of course, with QE occurring over the past decade, makes it more likely, because collateral was sucked out of the economy and onto the Fed's balance sheet over the years.

**That was of course questionable on whether it was a liquidity or collateral issue, until, the RRP rate dropped negative in March of 2021, as well as in April of 2021.**

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Reverse Repo Rate Flips Negative; Warnings Of Collateral Shortage

Think about it quite simply in a supply/demand factor and the reverse repo when the RRP rate dropped negative. 

You are a bank. You want to get Collateral from the Fed to balance your sheets. The Fed says they'll give you a small amount of interest for borrowing their collateral overnight. But now, imagine that the supply of collateral is too low and demand is too high. The Fed will no longer want to pay you for borrowing its collateral so it will shift the interest rate down. If demand really outweighs supply, then the Fed would then want cash from YOU in order for YOU to borrow the collateral.

[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-bonds-repo-explainer\/explainer-u-s-repo-market-flirts-with-negative-rates-as-fed-seeks-to-absorb-excess-cash-idUSKBN2C32AI](https://preview.redd.it/eysh9mx9ok671.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d9d1695922b01651eae06c6bcc2753ad0f5b789)

This was just one of the warning signs that a collateral issue was arising. The RRP rates were already at 0%, so the only way for them to move was either up or down. An increase in treasury demand could shift it down, into the negatives, which it did. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. The Fed Is Fudging The Numbers And Hiding A Collateral Shortage

The drop in RRP interest rates to the negative **came after** the Fed increased the total borrowing amount of counterparties in the RRP from $30 Billion to $80 Billion.

[https:\/\/finadium.com\/fed-increases-rrp-limits-from-30-billion-to-80-billion-to-ensure-supply-at-near-0-rates\/](https://preview.redd.it/by2ftlpopk671.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=747f50e2fb63aabaedb6e9e947aa117f6c75f91b)

Why did they do this? Think of it again as a supply versus demand issue. For simple math, imagine the Fed has 50 members. 

* At a limit of $30 Billion per member, that is a total of $30B \* 50 = $1.5 Trillion that can be borrowed.
* At a limit of $80 Billion per member, that is a total of $80B \* 50 = $4 Trillion that can be borrowed.

What is this doing? Why did the Fed increase the limit?

**It's artificially inflating the total ""supply"" of treasuries that can be borrowed by counterparties in the RRP. It is attempting to keep the interest rate positive because there is so much demand for collateral and not enough supply in the markets and on the Fed's balance sheet. The RRP was already at 0%, there was nowhere for it to go besides negative, which as you know implies a shortage of collateral and a red flag for the financial world.**

Not only did they artificially inflate the total supply to combat the demand by increasing the total borrow amount, **the Fed decided to not affect the assets side of its balance sheet during these RRP transactions**. **This effectively leaves the supply of treasuries on the Fed's balance sheet the same.** This is another method to can-kick to avoid interest rates going negative and flashing a collateral issue.

&gt;When the Desk conducts RRP open market operations, it sells securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) to eligible RRP counterparties, with an agreement to buy the assets back on the RRP’s specified maturity date. **This leaves the SOMA portfolio the same size**, as securities sold temporarily under repurchase agreements continue to be shown as assets held by the SOMA in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but the transaction shifts some of the liabilities on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet from deposits held by depository institutions (also known as bank reserves) to reverse repos while the trade is outstanding. - [Source](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_faq/rrp-faq-archive/rrp-faq-200715)

We can see this visually from the Fed's balance sheet that they're not affecting their assets during the RRP. They're allowing counterparties to borrow treasuries **WITHOUT** affecting the supply - desperately trying to get away from the rising demand for treasuries and avoid treasury yields from snapping down (and likewise the price of treasuries up):

[https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/monetarypolicy\/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://preview.redd.it/evxua80crk671.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a925b05e7a460b252457923ca97c730c511da6b)

**On top of this, the Fed showed their hand ONCE AGAIN of fudging the numbers on June 16th when they bumped up the RRP rate to 0.05%. The short-term treasury yields briefly went BELOW the RRP interest amount of 0.05% on June 17th when the new RRP ROI was in effect.**

**This is a BAD sign because now overnight RRP had a higher return than 2-month and 3-month treasury bonds.** 

**The Fed is fudging the numbers trying to hide the treasury bond shortage.**

The Fed cannot keep this up. They're trying to keep the T-bill yield curve propped up despite the treasury shortage. They're not affecting their balance sheet, and they also artificially increased the amount of treasuries in their ""supply"" by increasing the counterparty borrow limit from $30 Billion to $80 Billion.

The Fed is also planning on increasing interest rates. This starts to scare the economy, which is most likely why we're now seeing the dump of the stock market over the past few days and the dump leading into the week of June 21st. This is **bad for the markets** because it means it's going to cost more for the economy to function (e.g. what happened in 2019 when Repo Rates spiked to 10%). Companies have to spend more to hire, produce, etc. **It costs the economy more to function.** 

**The Fed is pinned between a collateral issue from QE sucking out collateral, and a liquidity issue and COVID pumping in too much liquidity for the banks to handle.**

# 7. Quarter Ends Explode The Reverse Repo. The Next Quarter End Is June 30th, 2021.

This is not a date to look forward to for GME potentially rising. This is a date of ""Holy shit. **The RRP could explode to the point where treasury supply vs demand is unable to take it any more**"".

About 3-4 days prior to quarter ends, the RRP explodes up in the amount of collateral that is borrowed from the Fed. This is because of the underlying plumbing of the financial markets, identified in Section 3 above, causes additional strain on the financial markets. The banks need more collateral to prop up their balance sheets for the night of the quarter-ends.

The RRP borrowed amount can shoot up almost **2-4x the current levels.** The amount of RRP at the moment is $747 Billion. **The RRP could explode 2-4x the amount it is at upon June 25th, 2021**. What if it's $1 Trillion by then due to the massive amount of collateral needed by the banks? More?

**Can the Fed handle it?** 

**Can they still prop the yield curve up?** 

**Will the short-term treasuries dip below the RRP amount once more due to this shortage and flash red flags to the world of financial instability in the US?**

[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/nylihz\/previous\_rrp\_behavior\_on\_quarter\_ends\_massive\/](https://preview.redd.it/63daa1s8gk671.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04d4a6b577152d26d6f7ea6e0c31f05f7ce80dc)

If the US Treasury yield curve snaps down from this instability and the Fed no longer able to prop up the yield curve, then it can drive treasury prices up. 

If /u/atobitt's ""[Everything Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)"" is true and they're actually shorting treasuries, then that can lead to banks defaulting due to the price of treasuries shooting up. When they default, they'll be forced to buy up all the treasuries that they've shorted into the market.

**And it is very possible that they are shorting treasuries.** 

When performing RRP of 0%, the repo market was most likely shut down due to nobody needing cash loaned out. The banks only profitable move was to perform the RRP with the Fed and then **short** treasuries into the market, **rehypothecating** the treasuries to other parties. This would have also helped prop up the market by artificially increasing the supply of treasuries (collateral) in the market.

If it's true, and they have truly been performing the ""Everything Short"", then it could initiate a Global Financial Crisis equivalent to The Great Depression.

Do I want that to happen? **No**. But is there a chance? **Yes, there is**.

Is GME going to squeeze? Is the DD just false hopium? I don't think it's just hopium. I believe in the DD. 

But some users might think otherwise and not believe in GME or the DD. Hello users outside of /r/superstonk! If you're reading this, check out the DD on the subreddit!

Even if there's a **slight** chance of a GME squeeze in **your** eyes, and all of these signs are pointing to a market crash...

The first stages of hyperinflation begin slowly, and as this is an exponential process, most people will not grasp the true extent of it until it is too late. I know I’m going to gloss over a lot of stuff going over this, sorry about this but I need to fit it all into four posts without giving everyone a 400 page treatise on macro-economics to read. Counter-DDs and opinions welcome. This is going to be a lot longer than a normal DD, but I promise the pay-off is worth it, knowing the history is key to understanding where we are today.

TL/DR: We are at the end of a MASSIVE debt supercycle. This 80-100 year pattern *always* ends in one of two scenarios- default/restructuring (deflation a la Great Depression) or hyperinflation (a la Weimar Republic). The United States has been abusing it’s privilege as the World Reserve Currency holder to enforce its political and economic hegemony onto the Third World, specifically by creating massive artificial demand for treasuries/US Dollars, allowing the US to borrow extraordinary amounts of money at extremely low rates for decades, creating a [Sword of Damocles](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+sword+of+Damocles+hangs+over+head) that hangs over the global financial system. The massive debt loads have been transferred worldwide, and sovereigns are starting to call our bluff. Systemic risk within the US financial system (from derivatives) has built up to the point that collapse is all but inevitable, and the Federal Reserve has demonstrated it will do whatever it takes to defend legacy finance (banks, broker/dealers, etc) and government solvency, even at the expense of everything else (The US Dollar). 

I’ll break this down into four parts. ALL of this is interconnected, so please read these in order:

**Preface:**

Some terms you need to know:

[Inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp): Commonly refers to increase in prices (per Keynesian thinking). However, Inflation in the truest sense is inflation (growth) of the money supply- higher prices are just the RESULT of monetary inflation. (Think, in normal terms, prices really only rise/fall, same with temperatures. (ie Housing prices rose today). The word Inflation refers to a growth in multiple directions (quantity and velocity). Deflation means a contraction of the money supply, which results in falling prices.

[Dollarization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarization.asp#:~:text=Dollarization%20is%20the%20term%20for,due%20to%20hyperinflation%20or%20instability.) (Weaponization of the Dollar): The process by which the US government, IMF, World Bank, and other elite organizations force countries to adopt dollar systems and therefore create indirect demand for dollars, supporting its value. (Think Petrodollars).

[Central Banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp): Generally these are banks that control/monitor the monetary policy of the country they reside in. They are usually owned by private financial institutions (large banks/bank holding firms). They utilize open market [operations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openmarketoperations.asp#:~:text=Open%20market%20operations%20(OMO)%20refers,out%20to%20businesses%20and%20consumers.) to stabilize and set market rates. They are called the “Lender of Last Resort” as they are supposed to LEND (not bailout/buy assets) to other banks in a crisis and help defend their currency’s value in international forex markets. CBs are beholden to the “[dual mandate](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate)” of maintaining price stability (low inflation) and a strong job market (low unemployment)

[Monetary Policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp): The set of tools that central bankers have to adjust how money moves through the financial system. The main tool they use is quantitative tightening/easing, which basically means selling treasuries or buying treasuries, respectively. \*A quick note- bond prices and interest rates move inversely to one another, so when Central banks buy bonds (easing), they lower interest rates; and when they sell bonds (tightening), they increase interest rates.

[Fiscal Policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp): The actions taken by the government (mainly spending and taxing) to influence macroeconomic conditions. Fiscal policy and monetary policy are **supposed** to be enacted independently, so as not to allow massive mismanagement of the money supply to lead to extreme conditions (aka high inflation/hyperinflation or deflation) \*cough Yellen cough\*

# Prologue:

In their masterwork tapestry entitled “[Allegory of the Prisoner’s Dilemma](https://loloro.com/artwork/3552148-Allegory-of-the-Prisoner-s-Dilemma.html)” (pictured in the title image of this post) the artists Diaz Hope and Roth visually depict a great tower of civilization that rests upon a bedrock of human cooperation and competition across history. The artists force us to confront the fact that after 10,000 years of human civilization we are now at a cross-roads. Today we have the highest living standards in human history that co-exists with an ability to destroy our planet ecologically and ourselves through nuclear war. We are in the greatest period of stability with the largest probabilistic tail risk ever. The majority of Americans have lived their entire lives without ever experiencing a direct war and this is, by all accounts, rare in the history of humankind. Does this mean we are safe? Or does the risk exist in some other form, transmuted and changed by time and space, unseen by most political pundits who brazenly tout perpetual American dominance across our screens?

# The Bretton Woods Agreement

[Money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money.asp), in and of itself, might have actual value; it can be a shell, a metal coin, or a piece of paper. Its value depends on the importance [that people place on it](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-money/)—traditionally, money functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of measurement, and a storehouse for wealth (what is called the three factor definition of money). Money allows people to trade goods and services indirectly, it helps communicate the price of goods (prices written in dollar and cents correspond to a numerical amount in your possession, i.e. in your pocket, purse, or wallet), and it provides individuals with a way to store their wealth in the long-term. 

Since the inception of world trade, merchants have attempted to use a single form of money for international settlement. In the 1500s-1700s, the Spanish silver peso (where we derive the [$ sign](https://www.lexico.com/explore/what-is-the-origin-of-the-dollar-sign)) was the standard- by the 1800s and early 1900s, the British rose to prominence and the Pound (under a gold standard) became the de facto world reserve currency, helping to boost the UK’s military and economic dominance over much of the world. After World War 1, geopolitical power started to shift to the US, and this was cemented in 1944 at [Bretton Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system), where the US was designated as the WRC (World Reserve Currency) holder. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Bretton Woods](https://preview.redd.it/gw3dze1plm671.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270e50cd07607e6e8c2f0254d954849cdb443c82)

In the early fall of 1939, the world had watched in horror as the German blitzkrieg raced through Poland, conquering the entire territory in 35 days. This was no easy task, as the Polish army numbered more than [1,500,000 men](https://www.ww2-weapons.com/polish-armed-forces/), and was thought by military tacticians to be a tough adversary, even for the industrious German war machine. As WWII continued to heat up and country after country fell to the German onslaught, European countries, fretting over possible invasions of their countries and annexation of their gold, started sending massive amounts of their [Gold Reserves to the US](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2020/changing-relationship-trade-americas-gold-reserves). At one point, the Federal Reserve held over 50% of all above-ground reserves in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

[US Trade Balance](https://preview.redd.it/40yylu9qlm671.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57a4cfabc73c8b074da57f68980467e834055f62)

In a global monetary system restrained by a Gold Standard, countries HAVE to have [gold reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_reserve) in their vaults in order to issue paper currency. The Western European powers all exited the Gold standard via executive acts in the during the dark days of the Great Depression (in Germany’s case, immediately after WW1) and build up to War by their respective finance ministers, but the understanding was they would return back to the Gold standard, or at least some form of it, after the chaos had subsided. As the war wound down, and it became clear that the Allies would win, the Western Powers understood that they would need to come to a new consensus on the creation of a new global monetary and economic system. Britain, the previous world superpower, was marred by the war, and had seen most of her industrial cities in ruin from the [Blitz](https://www.britannica.com/event/the-Blitz). France was basically in tatters, with most industrial infrastructure completely obliterated by German and American shelling during various points of the war. The leaders of the Western world looked ahead to a long road of rebuilding and recovery. The new threat of the USSR loomed heavy on the horizon, as the Iron Curtain was already taking shape within the territories re-conquered by the hordes of Red Army. Realizing that it was unsafe to send the gold back from the US, they understood that a post-war economic system would need a new World Reserve Currency. The US was the de-facto choice as it had massive reserves and huge lending capacity due to its untouched infrastructure and incredibly productive economy. 

At Bretton Woods, the consortium of nations assented to an [agreement](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/bretton-woods-agreement/) whereby the Dollar would become the WRC and the participating nations would [synchronize monetary policy](https://ies.princeton.edu/pdf/E106.pdf) to avoid competitive devaluation. In summary, they could still redeem dollars for Gold at a fixed rate of $35 an oz, a hard redemption peg which the[ U.S would defend](https://www.thebalance.com/gold-price-history-3305646). Thus they entered into a quasi- Gold standard, where citizens and private corporations could NOT redeem dollars for Gold (due to the [Gold Reserve Act ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act), c. 1934), but sovereign governments (Central banks) could still redeem dollars for gold. Since their currencies (like the Franc and Pound) were pegged to the Dollar, and the Dollar pegged to gold, all countries remained connected indirectly to a gold standard, stabilizing their currency conversion rate to each other and limiting local governments’ ability to print and spend recklessly.

&amp;#x200B;

[US Gold Reserves](https://preview.redd.it/6pqkimnwlm671.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2d3e71f7fe4462d7157d0a54e45c2f5f63b8e51)

For a few decades, this system worked well enough. US economic growth spurred European rebuilding, and world trade continued to increase. Cracks started to appear during the Guns and Butter era of the 1960’s, when Vietnam War spending and Johnson’s Great Society programs spurred a new era of fiscal [profligacy](https://www.thebalance.com/president-lyndon-johnson-s-economic-policies-3305561). The US started borrowing massively, and dollars in the form of Treasuries started stacking up in foreign Central Banks reserve accounts. 

Then-French President [Charles De Gaulle](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-de-Gaulle-president-of-France/Return-to-public-life) did the calculus and realized in 1965 that the US had issued far too many dollars, even considering the massive gold reserves they had, to ever redeem all dollars for gold (remember naked shorting more shares than exist? -same idea here). He laid out this argument in his infamous [Criterion Speech](https://www.usagold.com/cpmforum/favorite-web-pages-degaulle/) and began aggressively redeeming dollars for gold. The global “run on the dollar” had already begun, but the process accelerated after his seminal address, as every large sovereign turned in their dollars for bullion, and the US Treasury was forced to start massively exporting gold. Backing the sovereign government's actions were fiscal and monetary strategists getting more and more worried that the US would not have enough gold to redeem their dollars, and they would be left holding a bag of worthless paper dollars, backed by nothing but promises. The outward flow of gold quickly became a deluge, and policymakers at all levels of Treasury and the State department started to worry.

[Nixon ends Bretton Woods](https://preview.redd.it/n2o4uz5ylm671.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02ce74f1d61b5fa8c920db23af4c87bff8e2e2d2)

Nearing a coming dollar solvency crisis, Richard Nixon [announced](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/gold-convertibility-ends) on August 15th, 1971 that he was closing the [gold window](http://triplecrisis.com/a-first-default-closing-the-gold-window/), effectively barring all countries from current and future gold redemptions. Money ceased to be based on the gold in the Treasury vaults, and instead was now completely unbacked, based solely on government decree, or [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp). Fixed wage and price controls were created, inflation skyrocketed, and unemployment spiked. 

Nixon’s speech was not received as well internationally as it was in the United States. Many in the international community interpreted Nixon’s plan as a unilateral act. In response, the [Group of Ten](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/groupoften.asp) (G-10) industrialized democracies decided on new exchange rates that centered on a devalued dollar in what became known as the [Smithsonian Agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smithsonian-agreement.asp). That plan went into effect in Dec. 1971, but it proved unsuccessful. Beginning in Feb. 1973, speculative market pressure caused the USD to devalue and led to a series of [exchange parities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parity.asp).

Amid still-heavy pressure on the dollar in March of that year, the G–10 implemented a strategy that called for six European members to tie their currencies together and jointly [float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp) them against the dollar. That decision essentially brought an end to the fixed exchange rate system established by Bretton Woods. This crisis came to be known as the “[Nixon Shock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nixon-shock.asp)” and the DXY ([US dollar index) began to fall](https://www.macrotrends.net/1329/us-dollar-index-historical-chart) in global markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

[DXY](https://preview.redd.it/jioirg70mm671.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e81e3ab7724a05947925e436657a05e8d5ed6c5e)

This crisis came out of the blue for most members of the administration. According to [Keynesian](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/KeynesianEconomics.html) economists, stagflation was literally impossible, as it was a violation of the [Philips Curve](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PhillipsCurve.html) principle, where Unemployment and Inflation were inversely correlated, thus inflation should [theoretically](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened) be **decreasing** as the recession worsened and unemployment climbed through [1973-1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%931975_recession#:~:text=The%201973%E2%80%931975%20recession%20or,World%20War%20II%20economic%20expansion.). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Phillips Curve](https://preview.redd.it/865d1fr1mm671.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee8be1d79e2323da9f0f19ecc39c0da0a3360511)

MONKE-SPEK: Philips Curve Explained

* Low Unemployment&gt;Lots of jobs/high demand for labor. 
* Thus, more workers are employed, and wages rise&gt;putting more money in more people’s pockets. 
* These people go out and buy beanie babies, toasters, and bananas (what economist John Maynard Keynes called [aggregate demand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp)) and this higher demand leads to higher prices for goods and services. This shows up as inflation.
* Consider the opposite- high unemployment&gt;fewer jobs&gt;less money for people
* Less demand for goods and services&gt; lower inflation

Keynesian economists treated this curve as a law of nature, rather than a general rule. We see exceptions to this rule everywhere- Argentina is a prime example, where they have [persistently](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316703/unemployment-rate-in-argentina/) high unemployment AND high [inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi). This phenomenon is called [stagflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp), and is evidence of inflationary pressures so strong that they overcome the deflationary force of high unemployment. These economists were utterly blindsided by the emergence of stagflation.

After the closing of the gold window in 1971, the crisis spread, inflation kept climbing, and other sovereigns began contemplating devaluing their currencies as their only peg, the US dollar, was now unmoored and looked to be heading to disaster. US exports started climbing (cheaper dollar, foreigners could now import stuff to their countries), straining export economies and sparking talks of a [currency war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_war). Knowing they had to do something to stop the bleeding, the Nixon administration, at the direction of Henry Kissinger, made a secret deal with [OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC), creating what is now called the Petrodollar system. This [article](https://greatpowerrelations.com/great-powers/status-of-great-powers/key-drivers-of-economic-capabilities/dollar-and-de-dollarization/birth-of-petrodollar/) summarizes it best:

&amp;#x200B;

[PetroDollar system](https://preview.redd.it/m5a1v6a4mm671.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8ff7945a9bbe8924be32f157864c67a0db4cb41)

[Petrodollars](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/petrodollars.asp) had been around since the late 1940s, but only with a few suppliers. Petrodollars are U.S. dollars paid to an oil-exporting country for the sale of the commodity. Put simply, the petrodollar system is an exchange of oil for U.S. dollars between countries that buy oil and those that produce it. By forcing the majority of the oil producers in the world to price contracts in dollars, it created artificial demand for dollars, helping to support US dollar value on foreign exchange markets. The petrodollar system creates surpluses for oil producers, which lead to large U.S. dollar reserves for oil exporters, which need to be recycled, meaning they can be channeled into loans or direct investment back in the United States.

It still wasn’t enough. [Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), like many things, had inertia, and the oil shocks caused by the Yom Kippur War and other geo-political events continued to strain the economy through the 1970’s.

&amp;#x200B;

[PCE Index](https://preview.redd.it/l89uq1v5mm671.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3673060f2a7a4492bafae2ef07d0a33f3442f649)

Running out of road, monetary policymakers finally decided to employ the nuclear option. [Paul Volcker](https://www.thebalance.com/who-is-paul-volcker-3306157), the new Federal Reserve Chairman selected in 1979, knew that it was imperative to break the back of inflation to preserve the global economic system. That year, inflation was spiking well above 10%, with no end in sight. He decided to do something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

[Volcker Doctrine](https://preview.redd.it/ytyvtld7mm671.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0be2afbd5e646ee7afa70c4bac738796029ff97)

By hiking interest rates aggressively, consumer credit lending slowed, mortgages became more expensive to finance, and corporate debt became more expensive to borrow. Foreign companies that had been dumping US dollar holdings as inflation had risen now had good reason to keep their funds vested in US accounts. When the Petrodollar system, which had started taking shape in ‘73 was completed in March 1979 under the [US-Saudi Joint Commission](https://www.legistorm.com/reports/view/gao/6895/The_U_S_Saudi_Arabian_Joint_Commission_on_Economic_Cooperation.html), the dollar finally began to stabilize. The worst of the crisis was over. 

Volcker had to keep interest rates elevated well above 8% for most of the decade, to shore up support for the dollar and assure foreign creditors that the Fed would do whatever it takes to defend the value of the dollar in the future. These absurdly high interest rates put a brake to US government borrowing, at least for a few years. Foreign creditors breathed a sigh of relief as they saw that the Fed would go to extreme lengths to preserve the value of the dollar and ensure that Treasury bonds paid back their principal + interest in real terms.

&amp;#x200B;

[10yr US treasury yields](https://preview.redd.it/8wmho589mm671.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7af6f7393d964baeabd3ff69eeb876ef70bace1e)

Over the next 40 years, the United States and most of the developed world saw a prolonged period of economic growth and global trade. Fiat money became the norm, and creditors accepted the new paradigm, with it’s new risk of inflation/devaluation (under the gold standard, current account deficits, and thus inflation risk, was self-stabilizing). The Global Monetary system now consisted of free-floating fiat currencies, liberated from the fetters of the gold system.

I have already got a job in one of the top MNCs BNP Paribas but the job profile (risk control- mid office) is not what I was looking for... I took the job amidst the panic of the pandemic.It's been just month since I've started. 

I also received a job offer from OCWEN financial services. This is a role of a research associate and I'm more keen towards research. The difference between the salary is not much. But I think there is a better learning curve here. Since it's a much smaller company.

What do you guys think?
Should I continue the job I have at hand or try for another job?"

Personally am very fortunate to have been offered both of my top choices and have been my dream job for a while. Now I'm in a dilemma on which to choose as I begin weighing my future prospect and the respective exit opportunities should I decide to leave in the future.   


Being a firefighter has always been my passion. The passion to serve and help others. Having self-fulfillment when I get the job done.   
Similarly being in the audit industry having intern there before. The non-existence work-life balance is off-putting but the learning curve is something that I'm looking forward to. I believe that having the experience as an auditor in the big4 under my belt would be beneficial for my future in the accounting and finance industry. 

As far as pay wise. Being an SCDF officer is definitely more than what I could earn from being an auditor by more than 1k+. However, I'm not very sure about it as I progress up the ladder in the respective field. Would love to hear some insights regarding this. 

Any Officer in SCDF would like to share about their experience of 5 to 10 years being in the force? Any regrets on joining the force rather than the corporate world?

Similarly, for auditors or just the corporate world in general we often hear that after a few years as junior associates we rise up the rank? Any seniors would love to share their regrets or joy for taking this route. Worth it?   


If being presented with this option for you what other aspect will you be considering when deciding which to take up?"

&amp;#x200B;

H-Tokens aims to solve the lack of mainstream crypto assets in DeFi market. By issuing H-series assets based on the ERC20 standard, the value of quality crypto assets is transferred to Ethereum, which injects liquidity and stability into the Ethereum ecosystem. H-Tokens adopt 1:1 ratio of assets as collateral to make their value consistent with those on the main chain, avoiding problems that may occur in synthetic assets. Through H-Tokens' bridge between the centralized market and the DeFi market, transactions between quality assets and ERC20 standard digital assets have become simple and convenient in DeFi market."

Looking to get a discussion going and a little advice. I am starting a new job shortly in CRE finance as a commercial loan broker. 

The firm I am starting with does a lot of multifamily financing (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, HUD), along with insurance company loans, commercial banks, &amp; CMBS originations. 

I have been in banking for 7ish years and most recently as a commercial banker working on C&amp;I loans but also some smaller CRE deals. 

The market I will support is much larger now and I will have a pretty big learning curve with the new products. I do have a number on contacts and current clients that I can still work with, but I will need to start networking big time and looking for larger CRE deals. 

Any thoughts on getting started and finding deals? Have any of you worked with a mortgage broker in the past? What made them good or bad? How can I stand out &amp; win business?

I love the industry and I’m very excited to get to work in it, but have no doubts it will take some time to get established.

Ps - PM if you have a deal to finance, lol ;)

Thanks!"

Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi ?! :O,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/o660z3/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-23 13:03:28,2,/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/o660z3/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,NaN," 

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### [Notional Finance](https://notional.finance/)

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### [UMA's yUSD](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-yield-dollar-on-uma-3a492e79069f)

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

**TLDR:**

&gt;Economics of tokenisation and ecosystem is free weekly in your inbox. Please share it with anyone that can benefit from this knowledge.

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.

Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product."

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### [Notional Finance](https://notional.finance/)

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### [UMA's yUSD](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-yield-dollar-on-uma-3a492e79069f)

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### [UMA's yUSD](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-yield-dollar-on-uma-3a492e79069f)

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi ?! :O,https://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/o661an/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-23 13:04:02,0,/r/shamelessplug/comments/o661an/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,NaN," 

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

5 Secluded Tips To Learn Statistics for Data science with Ease,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Snoo36930/comments/o68l7x/5_secluded_tips_to_learn_statistics_for_data/,Snoo36930,1,2021-06-23 16:22:43,1,/r/u_Snoo36930/comments/o68l7x/5_secluded_tips_to_learn_statistics_for_data/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sngeqojd6z671.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b84d25fca7c7f6fa489c7ad1d9d1f32b38d59c5

The study of statistics is hard, like tracking to the peak of Everest. Yes, no one can deny this fact. Yet, even about 60% of data science aspirant skip their plan to head into the AI and ML from basic data analytics role due to the panic of advanced mathematical complexity. This article will tell you five secluded tips that will ease your learning path for statistics for data science. 

## 1. Realize the contribution of statistical concept in data science

We are living in the womb of statistical development. Every moment of our daily lives is subject to the consequences of statistical estimation. For example, tomorrow, you have a job interview. Will you get the job? The evaluation of the answer to this question is based on complex probability calculations, which itself is a part of statistics. Even whatever we search on the internet, the ultimate results come from statistical evaluation. It may be the top 5 restaurants around you for simple reports like the GDP growth of India.

Now the field of data science is aimed to solve all of our real-life obstacles. Therefore, data science and statistics becomes two integral entity. 

Whatever development in data science has been evaluated, all are standing based on statistical strengths. 

Being overstuffed with mathematical nations, signs, and numbers, most aspirants find statistics a boring and stressful subject. But once you become successful in realizing its daily life application, you are bound to find additional interest in statistics. This is very crucial to making your statistical learning easier. 

## 2. Get familiar with the Randomly used statistical terms

Before you dive into your complex online course session, introduce yourself with the key terms of statistics. Below is a small list of the most widely used statistical terms in the data science discipline. 

● Probability

● Mean, median, and mode

● Normal and Gaussian distributions

● Regression

● Standard deviation

● Bell curve

These are the terms that you will hear for lakhs of time throughout your data science course. So, before you head up to the core **data science course syllabus** of statistics, clear any kind of doubts about the above terms. Doing so will ease your learning path to a\[\[recoable extend. 

## 3. Start streaming interesting online videos on statistics.

You may find it a bit crazy. But you heard right. I am telling you to watch several statistical video courses. I know it's not like learning Python, HTML, or Tableau. Still, to gather self-interest and learn about the practical applications of statistical concepts, video course holds a substantial volume of significance. This will certainly make your learning trajectory simpler. 

At this stage, the best option is that you choose learning videos on 

● Business analytics

● [Simple programming based on linear regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2DPc9BtyFU)

● A comparative video like choosing the best-fit statistical test. 

## 4. Start reading or listening to a few of top rated books on statistics

While it comes to statistics, nothing can be the best reference for books. I know most people are now allergic to reading books, and if you belong to the same group, why not try e-books with a read-a-loud option?

To study the step-by-step derivation of statistical formula, earning in-depth knowledge about conventional statistical concepts like

● Linear algebra

● Coordinate geometry of graphs

● Foundational level formula and concepts of integral and differential calculus 

● Fundamental of matrix and probability, etc.

Nothing can be the best option other than the books. 

\[Read the blog [Top 7 Books Every Data Science Aspirants Should Read in 2021](https://medium.com/learnbay-blogs/top-7-books-every-data-science-aspirants-should-read-in-2021-learnbay-8d9e4f5afd74?source=collection_detail----1e5db2039d61-----0-----------------------) to know about the best books on statistics for data science.\] 

## 5. Self-access your statistical knowledge advancement against your daily life experience

These are the most promising tips for making your statistics learning path interesting and easier. Once you start applying your statistical knowledge to solve your daily-life problem, this harsh subject will become fun for you. For example, you can try to apply statistics to the following.

● Managing a profitable ratio of your earnings and expenditure

● Practice analyzing the statistical aspects of several hot and happening incidents roaming around the internet and newspaper related to sports, finance, etc.

● Raise queries to every remarkable incident to face and try to explore and analyze every possible, probable solution to your queries. 

● Download some necessary statistical tools like [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/products/spss-statistics), tableau, etc. and use them for analyzing for daily collected data.

**SERIES (Parts 1-4) TL/DR: We are at the end of a MASSIVE debt supercycle. This 80-100 year pattern** ***always*** **ends in one of two scenarios- default/restructuring (deflation a la Great Depression) or inflation (hyperinflation in severe cases (a la Weimar Republic). The United States has been abusing it’s privilege as the World Reserve Currency holder to enforce its political and economic hegemony onto the Third World, specifically by creating massive artificial demand for treasuries/US Dollars, allowing the US to borrow extraordinary amounts of money at extremely low rates for decades, creating a** [**Sword of Damocles**](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+sword+of+Damocles+hangs+over+head) **that hangs over the global financial system. The massive debt loads have been transferred worldwide, and sovereigns are starting to call our bluff. Governments papered over the 2008 financial crisis with debt, but never fixed the underlying issues, ensuring that the crisis would return, but with greater ferocity next time. Systemic risk (from derivatives) within the US financial system has built up to the point that collapse is all but inevitable, and the Federal Reserve has demonstrated it will do whatever it takes to defend legacy finance (banks, broker/dealers, etc) and government solvency, even at the expense of everything else (The US Dollar).** 

I’ll break this down into four parts. ALL of this is interconnected, so please read these in order:

# Preface:

Some Terms you need to know:

[Derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp): A derivative is a financial [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an **underlying** asset or group of assets—a benchmark. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties, and the derivative derives its price from fluctuations in the underlying asset. The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. 

[Normalized Curve Distribution](https://www.simplypsychology.org/normal-distribution.html) (Bell Curve): The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean, so the right side of the center is a mirror image of the left side. The area under the normal distribution curve represents probability and the total area under the curve sums to one. (We’ll go over this more in-depth later).

[Value-At-Risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp) (VaR Distribution): Value at risk (VaR) is a statistic that measures and quantifies the level of financial risk within a firm, portfolio or position over a specific time frame. This metric is most commonly used by investment and commercial banks to determine the extent and occurrence ratio of potential losses in their institutional portfolios. Risk managers use VaR to measure and control the level of risk exposure. 

[Rehypothecation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp): Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. Clients who permit rehypothecation of their collateral may be compensated either through a lower cost of borrowing or a rebate on fees.

[Exchange-Traded (Listed) Derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-derivative.asp): An exchange-traded derivative is merely a derivative contract that derives its value from an underlying asset that is listed on a trading exchange and guaranteed against [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) through a clearinghouse. Due to their presence on a trading exchange, ETDs differ from over-the-counter derivatives in terms of their standardized nature, higher [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp), and ability to be traded on the [secondary market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp).

[Over the Counter Derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052815/what-overthecounter-derivative.asp): An over the counter (OTC) derivative is a financial contract that does not trade on an asset exchange, and which can be tailored to each party's needs. Over the counter derivatives are instead private contracts that are negotiated between counterparties without going through an exchange or other type of formal intermediaries, although a broker may help arrange the trade. 

# Part Two: Derivatives, Systemic Risk, and Nitroglycerin- “The Ouroboros”

# Prologue:

“The [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros), a Greek word meaning “tail devourer”, is the ancient symbol of a snake consuming its own body in perfect symmetry. The imagery of the Ouroboros evokes the concept of the infinite nature of creation from destruction. The sign appears across cultures and is an important icon in the esoteric tradition of Alchemy. Egyptian mystics first derived the symbol from a real phenomenon in nature. In extreme heat a snake, unable to self-regulate its body temperature, will experience an out-of-control spike in its metabolism. In a state of mania, the snake is unable to differentiate its own tail from its prey, and will attack itself, self-cannibalizing until it perishes. In nature and markets, when randomness self-organizes itself into too perfect symmetry, order becomes the source of chaos, and chaos feeds on itself.”- ([Artemis Capital Research Paper](https://artemiscm.docsend.com/view/2b34894bzsaqsbcx)\- extra credit reading, but warning, this is ADVANCED finance- you’ll pop a lot of wrinkles reading it)

# Random Walks and Portfolio Insurance

In financial markets, traders have long looked for mathematical relationships between and within assets, to aid in speculation and price prediction. As data aggregation improved, and information became more widely distributed in the 1930s and 1940s, Financial analysts quickly realized that the [stock market as a whole](https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-distribution-of-stock-market), as well as individual securities, followed [Bell Curve](https://www.simplypsychology.org/normal-distribution.html) Distributions, at least in most time periods. The performance of individual securities on a single day was essentially random, but their overall performance in a time period could be graphed, as seen below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Bell Curve Distribution fitted to Market Returns](https://preview.redd.it/pakm4imk28771.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9122a8c28e8a204bafeba369c958efdd042467c)

This flowed logically from the concept of random events that [Brownian motion](http://web.mit.edu/8.334/www/grades/projects/projects17/OscarMickelin/brownian.html) described. In the mid- 1800s, scientist [Robert Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) saw that particles in a fluid sub-domain bounced around randomly, with their individual movements being essentially unpredictable- these movements were completely random. Drawing on Brownian motion, mathematicians had created [Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), which could estimate the given probability (not certainty) of a set of outcomes. As an analogy, predicting the result of an individual coin toss accurately every time is essentially impossible, but if you do it 100 times, Probability theory will tell you that you have a very high probability of 50 heads and 50 tails, or something close to it (45/55 or 53/47 for example). The likelihood of 95 heads and 5 tails, an extreme outlier, would be very close to 0. This is because there is a 50% probability of either heads or tails- and thus the distribution of 100 coin flips should roughly match this probability. This theory of randomness of prices as it applied to finance came to be known as the [Random Walk Theory](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/what-is-the-random-walk-theory/)\- and predicted that prices were basically completely unpredictable.

Understanding this concept, traders in the 1960s observed that the probability was great that returns on a single equity security would hover between some set performance range, like -10% and +10%. Rarely did the return hit the extreme ends of the curve. It didn’t matter what the time period was, 1 day, 1 month, or 1 year, the traders always had trouble reliably predicting a single future movement (like predicting heads/tails on a single coin toss), but could reliably say what the probability of variance over time (outcome of 100 coin tosses) would be, and map this mathematical distribution on a bell curve. 

These Bell Curve distributions, after being modified for applications in financial markets, came to be known as [Value At Risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp) (VaR) models. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, these [models](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/VAR.pdf) came to be [widely used](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Courses/434/434Context/RiskManagement/VaRHistlory.pdf) in the asset management industry. Essentially what these VaR models could do was provide a statistical technique used to measure the amount of [potential loss](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/value-at-risk-var/) that could happen in an investment portfolio over a specified period of time. Value at Risk gives the probability of losing more than a given amount in a given portfolio.

[Value-at-Risk Model](https://preview.redd.it/mrqixcou38771.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c452ed7175c8bec851f2e4547e80df68ac31119)

You can see from the above that these models have “skinny tails”, that is to say, they predict the likelihood of extreme events (standard deviation of 3 or more) happening as very low- especially on the downside (see above). Outlier events were thus coined “[tail risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tailrisk.asp#:~:text=Tail%20risk%20is%20a%20form,shown%20by%20a%20normal%20distribution.)”, occurrences that only show up on the far tails of the distribution. These models were built using the recorded historical prices of thousands of commodities, equities, and bonds. For earlier markets, they would even plug in estimates created by econometricians (i.e. Corn prices in 1430) to arrive at a large enough data set. With this data, asset managers could feel safe utilizing leverage and complex derivatives in risky investments, as these models told them that the likelihood of severe losses (-30% for example) in a single day was near-zero. 

At the same time, [Eugene Fama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama), an American economist freshly minted with a PhD from the University of Chicago, developed his [Efficient Markets Hypothesis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) in early 1970. Drawing on the random walk theory, Fama posited that since stock movements were random, it was impossible to “beat the market”. Current market prices incorporated all available and future information, and thus buying undervalued stocks, or selling at inflated prices, was not feasible. [Making consistent profits was impossible](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/efficient-markets-hypothesis/)\- if you made money, you just got “lucky” as the market randomly moved in your favor after you made the trade. The price, therefore, was always “right”.

[Efficient Market Hypothesis](https://preview.redd.it/ktn8rya048771.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fc831830ca80cc77b339c94874abd26d5932283)

This further emboldened investors and whetted their risk appetite. Armed with these two theories, they started making statistical algorithms that modeled the stock market, and loaded themselves up with more risk. Starting in the early 1980s, [portfolio insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolioinsurance.asp) started to gain traction within the industry. This “insurance” basically was an automated system that [short-sold S&amp;P 500 Index futures](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-black-monday-stock-market-crash-1987.asp) in case of a market decline. This concept was invented by [Hayne Leland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayne_Leland) and Mark Rubinstein, who started a business named Leland O’Brien Rubinstein Associates (LOR) in 1980, and was developed into a computer program commonly referred to by the same acronym. They were successful in marketing this product, and by the mid-1980s, hundreds of millions of dollars of Assets Under Management ([AUM](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp)) from institutions ranging from investment banks to large mutual funds were protected by this new-fangled product. 

LOR was a program that [dynamically hedged](https://www.glynholton.com/notes/dynamic_hedging/), i.e. would observe market conditions, and understanding it’s own portfolio risk, would actively adjust in real time. Today, dynamic hedging is used by derivative dealers to hedge gamma or vega exposures. Because it involves adjusting a hedge as the underlier moves—often several times a day—it is “dynamic.”  The founders of LOR touted it as a program that would actively work to protect a portfolio, a “fire and forget” approach that would allow portfolio managers and traders to focus on [alpha-generation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) rather than worrying about potential losses. 

Smoothbrain summary:

* No one can accurately predict the future (ie the outcome of a single coin toss). But, you can predict the probable outcomes of a series of coin-tosses. 
* Using this theory of the probability of outcomes, you can build a bell curve of probabilities of returns. Adapting this to financial markets, it comes to be called the Value-At-Risk model.
* This Value At Risk model tells you that the likelihood of a severe adverse event happening (large losses in a single day) is very low. Thus you feel safe leveraging your portfolio and buying derivatives.
* The Efficient Markets Hypothesis tells you that it is near impossible to consistently beat the market. Prices are always “right” and already incorporate all known and knowable information, so fundamental (and technical) analysis is completely useless. Thus the best way to juice returns is to load up on leverage and derivatives.
* Two experts in the fields of finance and economics create a new product called LOR, which was ‘portfolio insurance’ that promised to limit downside losses in case of a market collapse. Hundreds of institutions, banks, and hedge funds buy and implement LOR’s dynamic hedging into their portfolio. This program short-sold S&amp;P 500 futures in the event of a market decline.

# Black Monday- October 19, 1987

Stock markets raced upward during the first half of 1987. By late August, the [DJIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) (Dow Jones) had gained 44 percent in a matter of seven months, stoking concerns of an asset bubble. In mid-October, a storm cloud of news reports undermined investor confidence and led to additional volatility in markets. The federal government disclosed a larger-than-expected trade deficit and the dollar fell in value. The markets began to unravel, foreshadowing the record losses that would develop a week later. Beginning on October 14, a number of markets began incurring large daily losses. On October 16, the rolling sell-offs coincided with an event known as “[triple witching](https://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/what-is-triple-witching/),” which describes the circumstances when monthly expirations of options and futures contracts occurred on the same day. By the end of the trading day on October 16, which was a Friday, the DJIA had lost 4.6 percent. The weekend trading break offered only a brief reprieve; Treasury Secretary James Baker on Saturday, October 17, publicly threatened to de-value the US dollar in order to narrow the nation’s widening trade deficit. Then the unthinkable happened.

&amp;#x200B;

[DJIA \(Tradingview\) - Historical Realized Volatility on the bottom scale](https://preview.redd.it/39kpennd48771.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05033a945abf9b7cfd4f245e6b2502e048619f40)

Even before US markets opened for trading on Monday morning, stock markets in and around Asia began plunging. Additional investors moved to liquidate positions, and the number of sell orders vastly outnumbered willing buyers near previous prices, creating a cascade in stock markets. In the most severe case, [New Zealand’s stock market fell 60 percent](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/indepth/business/1987-stock-market-crash/), and would take years to recover. Traders reported racing each other to the pits to sell. Author Scott Patterson describes the scene: 

[The Quants, pg 51](https://preview.redd.it/1wcf5o2o48771.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbd254a4bd9fd41753c282d73cb2916af5a5891e)

Traders on the floor of the NYSE reported seeing ticker numbers spinning so fast that they were unreadable. Liquidity vanished completely from the market. Sell orders flooded in so fast the infrastructure to record them started malfunctioning. At one point, [specialists](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-market-maker-and-how-do-they-make-money-4053753) (individual market makers, and at this time were people on the floor representing a firm) simply stopped picking up the phone, which was ringing with dozens of institutions begging them to sell. Dozens of stocks were frozen in time. Those that weren’t were hit with massive volume. At one point, Proctor and Gamble was trading for $0.03. It had ended trading the previous Friday at $6.09. Market makers were trading off the stock prices that were recorded an hour ago, since the infrastructure was so backed up.

In fact, just go subscribe to their show and start listening from the beginning, they have one of the best finance podcasts out there).

In the United States, this collapse quickly came to be known as “[Black Monday](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200713/200713pap.pdf)”, with the DJIA [finishing down 508 points, or 22.6 percent](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1987.asp). ""There is so much psychological togetherness that seems to have worked both on the up side and on the down side,” Andrew Grove, Chief Executive of technology company Intel Corp., said in an interview. “It’s a little like a theater where someone yells 'Fire!’ (and everybody runs for the exit)”.

“It felt really scary,” said Thomas Thrall, a senior professional at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who was then a trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. “People started to understand the interconnectedness of markets around the globe.” For the first time, investors could watch on live television as a financial crisis spread market to market – in much the same way [viruses move through human populations and computer networks](https://www.wired.com/story/how-fast-does-a-virus-spread/).

Black Monday represented a catastrophic rebuttal to the mathematicians and economists who created the Random Walk Theory and Value- At- Risk models. **These probability theorists had stated that events like this were improbable- so improbable in fact that their models predicted Black Monday was IMPOSSIBLE. Thus, no one in the market had hedged or expected an event as extreme as this.** In fact, some theoreticians started to doubt the validity of the previously iron-clad Efficient Market Hypothesis itself. Patterson continues: 

[The Quants, pg 53](https://preview.redd.it/egil7fww48771.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f5cf4b457207185aec4c4392e87bf118a8bbf90)

Black Monday also represented a fascinating case study in the devastating effects of derivatives on financial markets. The Index Arbitrageurs, buying the S&amp;P 500 futures being sold by portfolio insurance, had raced to short sell the underlying stock to stay net neutral. This was because by owning the S&amp;P 500 futures, they effectively owned a small piece of every stock in the index. To [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/#:~:text=Hedging%20is%20a%20risk%20management,as%20options%20and%20futures%20contracts.), they had to quickly short the underlying, so that any large loss in the index futures they owned would be offset by a gain on a short position in the individual stocks. However, the S&amp;P 500 index itself was calculated based on the prices of the underlying securities. Thus, after Portfolio insurance sold the arbs futures, the Index arbs short sold billions of dollars worth of stock, the S&amp;P future market tanked, and LOR, seeing the massive volatility and downward pressure on the market, sold more and more futures, which caused the Arbs to short more and more stock. This was the unwelcome discovery of a vicious [positive feedback loop](https://biologydictionary.net/positive-feedback/), a “shadow risk” that existed beneath the surface of the market, unbeknownst to the investors who traded in it. **The Ouroboros had been awakened. These feedback loops, once initiated, continued until the underlying factors have been diminished or until the agents in the system are self-destroyed.**

## 3 Key Takeaways

1. The US Government has over $28 Trillion in Debt
2. Much of the debt is short-term, making it extra sensitive to higher rates
3. Higher Interest Rates would immediately start putting strain on the Federal Budget

## Introduction

The US has over $28 Trillion dollars in debt and it continues to grow at an alarming rate. Even before COVID-19, the problem was becoming unwieldy. Ironically, despite adding $4T+ in debt over the last year, the pandemic may have given the US Government short-term reprieve as it gave the Federal Reserve a green light to drop rates back to zero.

First and foremost, this took pressure off the Treasury as it refinanced the ballooning short-term debt outstanding at lower rates. However, even more relief occurred as the Federal Reserve absorbed +90% of the long term debt issued since last March. This allowed more room in the private markets to purchase the issuance of new short-term Treasury Bills. Because the Fed pays interest revenue back to the Treasury, and since interest rates on Treasury Bills are sitting at 0%, this has effectively given the Treasury a **$4.5T loan at 0% interest** in 15 months!

While this sounds like a great deal, it comes with major risks and has now put the Fed in a box. This will be explained in detail over two articles. Part 1 will explain why the Fed can no longer raise interest rates, and Part 2 will show how the Fed is unable to taper and may even need to increase Treasury purchases to maintain control over the long end of the yield curve.

## $28 Trillion and Growing

The US Government cannot stop spending money. Spending is now far in excess of what is being collected in tax revenues. The US economy continues to experience nominal increases in growth, which has increased Federal Tax receipts, but Federal Spending is growing far faster. Figure 1 below, shows this clear trend.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q7rekcmn19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=149364e8e2095daba4a2df751e039eeb1d248c81

Excess spending has to be paid for using debt. This massive excess in spending has led to proliferate borrowing by the Federal Government resulting in over $28T in total debt outstanding. See figure 2 below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nrekxgmo19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e144298fa0a09b0b56c88893c506ba358e27946e

 

For anyone struggling to wrap their mind around the size of $1T, please see this great [visual](http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/index.html). Now, multiply that by 28!

For most governments, this would be unsustainable as interest rates would rise. This puts pressure on a borrower to bring down spending. The US Government has benefited from three major advantages that are not available to most governments. First, it has the exorbitant privilege of issuing the global reserve currency (for now), which creates far more demand for dollars than would otherwise be the case. The [petro dollar](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/petrodollars.asp) should have its own dedicated article, so that will be skipped in this analysis.

It is important to highlight two other key facts that have allowed spending and borrowing to continue unabated. It has been able to borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund, and the Federal Reserve has absorbed a large chunk of debt issuance in recent years. Not only does this equate to $11T in interest free loans (as all interest payments return back to the Treasury), but it has prevented the private markets from absorbing all new debt issuance keeping interest rates lower. As Figure 3 below shows, since Jan 2010, the private markets have “only” had to absorb $9T of the $14.5T issued.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i1mprb2q19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc85810701e309940b56bd3787bf769b348f1798

Since Jan 2020, the numbers are even more stark. The Treasury has issued $4.5T, of which the Fed has taken on $2.6T (*Note: The Fed balance sheet has expanded by greater than $4T, but not all of this was Treasury Debt*). Looking deeper into the numbers shows the Fed had an even bigger appetite for longer dated maturities. With Short Term rates at 0%, the Treasury can sell Treasury Bills to the private sector and still have interest free loan. Thus, it has been critical for the Fed to absorb almost all (\~90%) the long term debt issued by the Treasury to keep interest payments low! 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h2aav62s19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ba47ac1dfc85266856fc27d7a161da3fb14fb5

 

## The Treasury has so far avoided higher interest payments

Zooming back out, the three charts below show why the maneuvers over the last year have been so important. Take one more look at the US Debt load, this time categorized by vehicle. Non-Marketable is debt the government owes itself, Notes represent 1-10 year maturity, Bills less than 1 year, and Bonds &gt;10 years. The two charts below show both the absolute growth in debt and how the makeup of the debt has changed. Since 2008, Notes have experienced the largest growth increasing from 25% of total outstanding to 42%. Non-Marketable went the other way, shrinking from 45% to 25% as the Social Security Trust Fund is no longer a source to borrow from.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1z4sc7gt19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1bceeab6ced3ffd748cf2592f7fed8b4b97343

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bibksa0u19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25801931a3e0fdb1046b5ba7f05c8a5ea2dba23f

 

It is important to notice the growth in Treasury Bills above. Bills are the highest risk to the Treasury because higher interest rates will affect Bills within months, so it is important to note that in 2015 during the last rate hike cycle they accounted for only $1.4T but now make up $4.3T. This means every .25% rate hike will almost immediately add $10B to Federal spending. The chart below clearly shows the impact of the last interest rate hike cycle. The Pink line shows how Bills followed the Fed hike cycle topping out near 2.25%.

If the Fed attempted to raise rates in a similar fashion it would immediately add $100B to Federal Spending on ONLY interest due for Treasury Bills. In a scenario where the Fed shrunk its balance sheet back to $1T (no more interest free loans) AND raised interest rates back to 4%, the Treasury would incur an extra $160B in interest rates for Treasury Bills and a whopping $290B on Treasury Notes! This would not factor in any new debt added over that time, which now includes an extra $.5T a year just on interest payments!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/afd0rw8v19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1e1e4a340012cbfde4e7e0cc7aa73f2398b0751

 The chart below shows a much clearer impact of how falling interest rates have kept debt payments relatively stable for nearly 20 years. The chart shows the average weighted interest rate and the annualized monthly interest payments. The orange line (average weighted interest rate) is moving in direct opposition to the growth in debt seen above. In the last rate tightening cycle, the chart shows just how quickly higher interest rates increased the debt burden ($150B). The Fed owns very few Treasury Bills ($320B), so those interest payments are NOT returning to the Treasury. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/brh4gmcw19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf1ccaeae27ee1ae178f34f00fd4d05ebb86c34

 One final chart to consider. How do these interest payments compare to tax revenue collected by the IRS? In this context, it becomes very clear how much impact the 2015 rate cycle increases had on debt payments. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nirn4jdx19771.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b75d870494b7744913c1990b42509dc31d53285

 

## Wrapping Up

Nothing in this article should be surprising to anyone who even closely watches the US Debt situation or follows financial markets. The charts and graphs attempted to show the trends and put hard numbers behind what most people already know anecdotally. This article does not even touch on how devastating higher interest rates would be on the housing market, corporate debt market, and consumer debt market. Instead it only focuses on the Treasury, which just so happens to be run by the old chair of the Federal Reserve (Janet Yellen).

None of this math is overly complex, and all the data is freely available on the Treasury and Fed website. This begs the question, does the Fed realize interest rates cannot go up or are they only looking in the rear-view mirror and assuming that an increase to 2.25% will be similar to 2015 which was “only” derailed by COVID-19? To reiterate, the drop in interest rates gave the Treasury *relief* from the higher interest payments. Next time they might not even get halfway to 2% with the added debt burden. Unfortunately, for the Fed, their box is tighter than most realize. If the Fed hasn’t figured it out by now, even before they fail to raise interest rates, they will be unable taper Quantitative Easing (debt monetization) much less shrink their balance sheet, without serious consequences. That data will be reviewed in Part 2. Stay tuned!

# People Misunderstand Leveraged Investing Strategies 

I'll get this out of the way as I'm sure it'll come up. [Yes I did blow up an account for 1.4 million.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flhb0d/i_failed_my_portfolio_margin_call_final_damage/) I'm not at liberty to talk any more about that experience. Eventually I will be able to talk about this experience. 

I did a lot of reflecting from that experience. It was a real eye opener. I did not understand leverage based strategies at the time. I do now after writing a lot of www.quantconnect.com code to thoroughly understand this portfolio and the associate leverage.  

Let's visit someone else who likewise blew up an account - [Market Timer over at Bogleheads.](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934)

Market Timer was following a popular Yale paper at the time - Mortgage your Retirement and the later book [Lifecycle Investing.](https://smile.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performance-Retirement/dp/B005X4I7ZI) The premise of Lifecycle investing is you start off with an aggressive 200% equities allocation while you're young. Essentially instead of saving $10,000 per year, if you invest with 2x leverage it's like you're saving $20,000 a year. You're borrowing time from the future and smoothing out sequence of risk returns. If the market tanks 50% in one year, an young investor can withstand a $5,000 50% loss. An older investor near retirement with $2 million can't withstand a $1 million loss. 

Eventually with Lifecycle Investing you'll reach a point where you start to de-risk your leverage ratio essentially borrowing a ""constant"" portfolio of your expected retirement each year. Then as you get closer to retirement you glidepath into an 80/20 or 75/25 bond allocation. On average his strategy historically gets you to retirement 10 years faster at a 15-25% savings rate than traditional retirement would in 100% stocks. 

The key thing Market Timer missed is the paper calls for **monthly reset** of the 2x leverage. If you monthly reset SPY [you would not have been margin called in 2008.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=200&amp;symbol2=CASHX&amp;allocation2_1=-100)


It's incredibly hard to do monthly reset of leverage intuitively, but it is critical to do so if you're following this paper. It is literally buying more stocks when the price of stocks is high, and selling your stocks to pay down your margin loan when stocks crash. It is a brainfuck strategy.

Let's say you have $100k you want to put at 2x leverage. That means you're buying an additional $100k of stocks on margin. So you now have a $200k position with a $100k margin loan backing it. If you sell this position you're left with $100k, your equity. So your leverage ratio is $200k position / $100k equity = 2x leverage.

Now, what happens if stocks double from here? What is your new leverage? 

Your position is now $400k, you still have $100k of a margin loan, and your equity is $300k. Your leverage is now $400k/$300k = 1.33x leverage ratio. You now absolutely have to buy more stocks at the top of the market to maintain your desired 2x leverage ratio. 

Ok, now let's do the other case, what if stocks drop 25% instead? (50% will result in a margin call).  What is your new leverage if stocks drop 25%? 

Your $200k position is now $150k, you still have a $100k margin loan, and your equity is $50k. Your leverage ratio greatly increased! It's now $150k position / $50k equity = 3x. You better sell down some shares with the market being in the bottom as now you're way more risky than 2x leverage. Further percentage losses will be even worse.

On Reg-T your maintenance margin is 25% equity. You're currently at 33% equity - 50k equity/150k position. TD Ameritrade's house maintenance margin is 30%. **You're 3% away from getting a margin call to wire in funds or sell down your position.**  IBKR is getting ready to auto liquidate you at their maintenance margin! 

So as you can see a trading strategy on margin you literally buy high and sell low. It's very hard for people to do in practice.

# Enter Leveraged ETFs

Since managing leverage yourself is a brainfuck calculation, instead it's better to invest with a leveraged fund like 2x for SSO, or 3x - UPRO. This is why UPRO and SSO daily reset their leverage! It's providing you the most safety and the most return!

In my code with quantconnect daily reset = monthly reset. There is no additional volatility decay from daily reset. You're going to have the same volatility decay even if you manage monthly reset of leverage on your own. 

UPRO has a 0.75% management fee and with $2.2 billion of AUM they're getting **institutional** borrow rates. IBKR marks up their margin interest rates by 75 basis points. In my code on quantconnect.com UPRO and TMF are identical to SPY and TLT on portfolio margin after adjusting for actual margin interest paid. Unfortunately on portfolio visualizer's CASHX variable does no margin markup so SPY and TLT look misleading compared to UPRO and TMF. 

You're getting an excellent deal for the leverage UPRO and SSO provide. You can run these funds in a cash account, in retirement accounts, and so on. I'm running Hedgefundie's portfolio in all my accounts - taxable, Roth IRA, pre-tax solo 401k (rolling 100% over to the roth ira in the 22% marginal bracket), and a HSA account.

This last back test is why I'm 100% invested in this portfolio. I could *possibly* achieve $1.3 billion dollars nominally. I have a chance to hit that figure at age 62 if history repeats itself. 

Yes its $555 million inflation adjusted to 1987 dollars, and that $62m of the S&amp;P 500 is $25m in 1987 dollars. And yes, past performance is no predictor of future returns. 

# Why does Hedgefundie's Portfolio make so much money?

It's due to several factors. Currently the [efficient frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier) of these two asset classes is 55% stocks and 45% bonds. The unlevered portfolio has about a 8% return and a 15% drawdown during 2008. The 2x leveraged portfolio has a 16% return and 30% drawdown, and 3x roughly 24% return for a 60% drawdown risk. 

100% stocks has 50% drawdown risk, which was my previous portfolio. I'm comfortable with 10% more drawdown risk.

Second, because we are adding leverage, we are still maintaining the [tangency portfolio but getting more return for the same amount of risk vs 100% stocks.](https://i1.wp.com/earlyretirementnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beat-the-market-Chart03.png?resize=863%2C627&amp;ssl=1) Credit goes to Early Retirement Now for this graph. With the 3x leverage we're going past 100% stocks and our risk is 27% standard deviation along that same tangency line. 

Many people try to get more return by mixing in riskier assets like Venture Capital, international funds, and so on. Instead Hedgefundie's Portfolio is Modern Portfolio Theory taken to the extreme.  

We are getting more return from having a large insurance component being heavily weighted to bonds. They saved the portfolio a lot in 2008 and in 2020 during Covid. Another quite surprising fact is we are actually profitable on this insurance too. 

Finally, Hedgefundie's portfolio deploys a well oiled correlation trading strategy that produces a crap ton of extra yield via quarterly rebalancing vs annual or monthly rebalancing. The rebalancing period is correlated to when earnings reports are minimal in the stock market. Essentially each quarter you're making a 55/45 bet on the market having great earnings or disappointing earnings. 

# How correlation trading strategies work

Let's say we have two assets that are **perfectly inverse correlated.** Let's say asset A has a 50/50 chance of either doubling or losing 50%, and asset B likewise has the opposite chance?  Can you think of any trading strategy to take advantage of these facts?

Let's say we have $100k to invest with. One strategy is to throw 50% on A and 50% on B - $50k each. After some point in time let's say A doubles to $100k. B will halve to $25k. Now our portfolio is valued at $125k - a 25% gain! So now we rebalance both to $75k A and B.

I was asked this question on a phone interview with a well known quant firm in exploring a quant software engineer job with them. I first gave them the answer above. I then gave them a second answer that impressed them so much they sent a job offer before even inviting me onsite as no other candidate has provided this answer:

I told them the above answer isn't optimal. If we add some leverage on it then it would be more optimal.

So instead of taking $100k to invest with, we borrow an additional $100k with our equity. We now have $100k on A and $100k on B. After one year we have $200k on A, and $50k on B. We have a $250k position and owe $100k. Subtract $100k and our equity is $150k. 

Since our equity is $150k we now have a 50% gain. The 2x leverage doubled our return.

The firm was absolutely blown away from my second answer.

Bringing this back to Hedgefundie's portfolio it's a well oiled correlation trading strategy machine with a ton of leverage. Now you see why that 55/45 bet every quarter is paying off! It doesn't matter if earnings are bad or good, **we still profit.**  We do expect more good earnings it being the stock market and growth, so that's why we're weighting our bets a bit for the optimal growth. ;) 

# 40+ year bond bull market - aren't you worried about rising interest rates?

No, I am not. Most the return comes from the 165% equities, with TMF acting in the nick of time for crash insurance. [If we plot out simulated UPRO and TMF you see simulated TMF doubles then draws down 50% all the freaking time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=Simulated+100%25+UPRO&amp;portfolioName2=Simulated+100%25+TMF&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=300&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_2=300&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200&amp;allocation3_2=-200)  We see UPRO trending. Again, we are seeing the correlation trading strategy I just discussed about in action!


Then for rising interest rates, bond funds operate differently than an individual bond does! That is because bond funds have [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). TLT happens to sell the 20 year bond to buy the 30 year bond at auction! So if interest rates raise slowly, say no more than 0.25% - 0.50% per quarter, then soon you'll start profiting with the higher interest rate! 

Then there are many strategies that you actually want to go LONG on 20+ year treasuries in a rising interest rate environment, such as the [Barbell Strategy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy)

&gt; In finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long- and short-duration bonds, but does not invest in intermediate-duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value

Right now TMF is mooning as thanks to the Feds statements there are less inflation fear in the 20+ year treasury market. So now yields are dropping which causes bonds to rise. The yield curve is flattening as bond investors are trying to get the risk free rate regardless of the duration of the bonds due to the positive outlook.

If TMF keeps it up it will be the first time I'll have to sell TMF to buy some UPRO! I got really tired of having to buy TMF all throughout Covid. I'm sitting on some nice gains having to buy TMF at $22! It's about time to back up the truck a bit on more UPRO shares! 

Many people in the Hegdefundie Bogleheads thread also simulated random 1-6% randomly rising interest rates using a monte carlo situation and the portfolio holds just fine under those conditions. 

If you look closely at the backtests the last ten years have been the highest gains vs earlier on in 1987. We're investing in these bonds not for their income but for their capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 10% to 9% is not going to produce much capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 2% to 1% is going to have tremendous capital gains. 

Again the purpose of these bonds are stock-market crash insurance. Most of our return is coming from the 165% equities position. The future predicted low interest rate environment is very favorable for the bond component of this portfolio. Again, this portfolio makes great use of a correlation trading strategy so we **want** interest rates to raise and fall and have it be **inversely correlated** with the stock market! We want to keep those low interest rates! Let's keep that money printing machine going! 

# Why I'm not worried about another 1970-1980 stagflation era

This is the worst drawdown period for Hedgefundie's portfolio. It has a 75% drawdown over this decade. I completely discount this era due to one critical reason: [US Treasuries were CALLABLE until 1985!](https://www.sapling.com/7796395/treasury-bonds-callable)  No one in the right mind would be running a leveraged treasury portfolio in 1970!

Callable bonds are bonds that can be called at face value at any time! Let's say the treasury issued bonds at 12% in one year then the next year rates dropped to 6%. The treasury's call feature let them stop interest payments and they were called at face value. 

So you have large NAV losses when interest rates rise, and you don't get any upside when interest rates drop! 

Now, just because historically these treasuries had a call feature doesn't mean that the US treasury exercised it. So I went to my local library and viewed old WSJ articles from the 70s on microfiche. Sure enough there are huge lists of US treasuries that got called every single month in these articles! It would not make any logical sense to run a leveraged bond portfolio in this era! 

This entire portfolio is a play that US treasuries are no longer callable and I would stop trading this portfolio if they ever become callable again in the future. It's also a play on the current Fed policy remaining the same - doing quantitative easing and dropping interest rates in future stock market crashes just like they did for 2008 and Covid! 

# Taxable account performance and Tax loss harvesting

With my code using www.quantconnect.com and calculating all the PnL on the quarterly trades, then computing actual LTCG and STCG taxes on these trades, the federal tax drag is 1.5% for an account at my current level for the historical last 10 years. For a $10+ million account it's 2.0%. Living in California adds another 1.0% state tax drag.  So if you're getting 24% CAGR in a tax-advantage account you're getting a 22% CAGR in taxable for federal tax drag (21% in California).

In my original simulations when I started this portfolio I paid $300k in federal taxes for 10 years with UPRO/TMF, and I paid $600k in taxes over 10 years with SPY and TLT on portfolio margin. Buying 2x dividends really sucks.

UPRO and TMF are excellent tax dodges as the vast majority of their return is total-return swaps with the banks. So instead of realizing dividends, the swap pays those dividends into the fund as part of the total return index and the NAV of the fund grows! So when you sell UPRO and TMF you realize your dividends then! 

It turns out if your hold period is less than 30 years with a 2% federal tax drag, you're best in a Roth IRA, followed by Taxable, followed by pre-tax 401k. After 30 years the order is: Roth IRA, Pre-Tax 401k, Taxable. It turns out paying 40% in ordinary income taxes in the pre-tax case is worse before 30 years, but after 30 years it has a higher after-tax value thanks to dodging the tax drag.  

UPRO and TMF holds about 80% unrealized gains across my simulations, and mostly throw off LTCG gains when major re-balances happen too. You'll want to use specific identification to sell shares that have the lowest possible tax cost. 

You can also take advantage of tax loss harvesting which I did not write code to evaluate for. URPO's tax loss harvest pair is SPXL, another 3x ETF. So my 2% federal tax drag is a **worst case estimate.**

TMF has no other 3x 20+ year treasury ETF, so it's tax loss harvest pair is [Synthetic Long Stock](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-long-stock.aspx) on TLT at 3x delta. So if you have a $45,000 position in TMF and want to harvest all losses in your $45,000 position, and TLT is trading at $143.64, then this is the formula:

3 * (45,000 / 143.64) =  939 delta of synthetic stock.

So you will buy 9 ATM call options and sell 9 ATM naked puts on TLT for 31+ days to keep your position in TMF, then you will want to close the synthetic stock and rebuy TMF with the left over cash.  Again using quantconnect.com this is the most accurate model I can get to TMF. It turns out bond futures are a terrible replacement for TMF and it brings me to the next topic.

I personally did the synthetic stock trade to tax loss harvest TMF in February 2021 and I was able to buy back the same number of shares of TMF. It works wonderfully. 

If you're on Portfolio Margin just save your time and commissions and buy 939 shares of TLT. [Use Box Spreads to Refinance your margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegqz0/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) instead of paying your broker's usury margin rates unless you're on IBKR. Unfortunately if you're on Reg-T you won't have the margin available to buy 939 shares of TLT and why you have to do the synthetic stock trade above.

# Futures suck for Hedgefundie's portfolio

In a taxable account futures are **marked to market.** You realize your PNL every year as of Dec 31st. In my above simulations /ES and /UB futures costed me $2.8 million in federal taxes. Talk about an insane tax drag!

Futures are only worthwhile in a retirement account, which brings us to the next problem. There are no micro futures for /UB and /ZB. Each /UB future is currently $180k notional value. You need a $1-$2 million+ retirement account to get fine grained leverage on these futures, otherwise your leverage will swing from 2x to 4-6x depending on if you round nearest or round down your number of contracts! 

Finally, I cannot get any mix of /UB and /ZB to replicate TMF's fund testing with quantconnect. Convexity strikes again! It turns out reviewing the actual deliverable of these future contracts its a basket of bonds that is EITHER the 25 year or the 30 year bond. So you're only trading one bond! The future traders will deliver the 25 year bond as it's the cheapest to deliver if interest rates are below 6%. They will deliver the 30 year bond if interest rates are above 6%!  Only if interest rates are **exactly** 6% are any of the 25-30 year bonds deliverable! 

So the bond futures are less than ideal for leverage with this portfolio. They either add too much risk or not have enough risk. /ES futures track UPRO very accurately though. 

# Tail Risks

People point out if **BOTH** stocks and bonds go down 33% **in one day**, this portfolio would go to $0. Quite honestly it'd take an irresponsible Fed to raise interest rates so high that it'd piss off the entire market to sell off like this in one day. I don't think that will ever happen. I would not be 100% invested if I thought this was at all a realistic scenario. 

Then yes, UPRO can, and has gotten near to 0% (historically simulated UPRO had a 98% drawdown in this portfolio!) but we're hoping TMF will moon hard to save the portfolio instead. 

Then right now with the [S&amp;P 500 circuit breakers](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp) it's impossible for UPRO to go to $0 in a day, although the drawdown will be gnarly.  UPRO has roughly 220% of swaps and the rest are S&amp;P 500 futures. So even if the swaps can't be adjusted this day UPRO can probably unload enough futures on the market to cover in a drawdown.

This is also why I'm staying the hell away from TQQQ. Normal QQQ had an 80% drawdown in the 1999 tech stock crash. Granted, all these tech companies are a lot more mature on the NASDAQ, but I personally have no interest in tilting or having an allocation to TQQQ. 

# Securities Lending for Hedgefundie's Portfolio

Sadly PALs and the like don't lend for a portfolio of 3x leveraged ETFs. Your only option is on Portfolio Margin where you'll unlock roughly 70% buying power for this portfolio. IE you can withdraw 70% of it in cash and keep your position as long as you don't lose one dollar on the position. It's 30% initial and maintenance margin at IBKR.

TD Ameritrade no longer allows any leveraged ETFs to be eligible for portfolio margin. They just shut it down instead of fixing their software. Despite them letting you go currently 6.6x on SPY and 14x on TLT, they let you go 1x on UPRO and 1x on TMF.  2.2x leverage on UPRO and 4.6x on TMF would be equivalent positions to SPY and TLT! 

So if you want to borrow at TDA you'll have to be SPY and TLT instead at 2x tax drag and monthly reset your leverage every month. IBKR correctly understands UPRO is 3x SPY and so they multiply their 10% S&amp;P 500 risk array by 3x and you get 30% initial and maintenance margin! IBKR lets you go 10x on spy and thus you can go 3.333x on UPRO. 1/.30 = 3.333x. Your mileage may vary at other brokers offering portfolio margin. 

One thing to be aware of I was checking [IBKR's margin calculator](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=24176) during Covid. It appeared they may have made 3x leveraged ETFs non-marginable for portfolio margin and were only giving 2.8x leverage on SPY and TLT. I didn't have an account at the time and I don't know how they would handle someone borrowing conservatively in this case. So there is some possible risk of auto liquidation of any margin loan on UPRO and TMF at IBKR in another stock market crash despite being able to borrow conservatively. 

Ultimately you can borrow on this portfolio but it depends on your future outlook of the max drawdown. If it's only going to be 60% in the future then possibly up to 20% on margin is safe. You'll be in a rough spot if 75% drawdown repeats itself. 

Let's work out some math. $10 million on hedgefundie's portfolio. You borrow $2 million - 20%. If it draws down 60% your $10 million position is $4 million, you owe $2 million, you're at $2 million equity, and you're still fine to carry this position in portfolio margin as they will allow you 70% of buying power and you're at 50% buying power. 

If it draws down to 75% the position is now worth 2.5 million, you owe 2 million, your equity is $500k, 1-.5/2.5 million = 80% buying power, you'll be margin called on portfolio margin and have to sell down to a $1.666 million position to meet minimum buying power requirements. 

15% is the max you can borrow indefinitely on this portfolio and not be margin called under the 75% historical drawdown on portfolio margin. Your position is now 2.5 million as before, you owe 1.5 million, and your equity is 1 million. You're at 60% buying power:  1-1/2.5 million = 60%. If you lose any more dollars you'll start getting portfolio margin calls.   

I feel comfortable borrowing up to 10% on margin indefinitely on Hedgefundie's portfolio. I'm on the fence with 15-20% given the historical vs future outlook of this portfolio. Definitely borrowing past 20% on margin is irresponsible.

# Aren't you too optimistic?

Why yes, yes I am. However I'm 28 years old with $600k riding on this portfolio with an excellent track record that since 1987 goes to $1.3 billion in nominal dollars. It's my only shot in the world to be a billionaire in nominal dollars and I'm taking it. :)

# Is this portfolio right for me?

Ultimately it comes down to your willingness and ability to take risks. It may not be right for you. Even Hedgefundie is only risking $100k on this for a good chance of it turning into $10 million over 20 years. 

I'm following a lifecycle investing philosophy of investing while young. My financial situation is very unique. 

You need to have the balls to sell TMF for UPRO in a stock market crash even if UPRO has drawdown 85% or more. In 2008 UPRO had a 85%-90% drawdown for the 60% of the portfolio's drawdown. If UPRO repeats its historical 98% simulated drawdown you need to be backing up the truck with TMF and buying those shares on a fire sale! 

You absolutely need to be mechanical about rebalancing every quarter and not have any second thoughts about doing so. 

Feel free to invest at a lower leverage too. You can do 2x with SSO and UBT. Or 2x with [PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst)

Or you can drop down to 1.5x. One [popular investment is NTSX.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/efficient-core/ntsx) It is the ONLY leveraged fund allowed over at Vanguard as so far it's beating VTSTAX's return with a lot lower risk! NTSX is intermediate treasuries though so it's not quite a direct replacement. 

Finally, [good old 1.0x leverage does pretty well.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=55&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=45)

You can also use Hedgefundie's portfolio strategically. For instance, start a Coverdell ESA account for someone who's a baby and [by the time they're age 18 it's grown to $875k.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=2000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=2000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=3&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=165&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=135&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200) It's quite impressive for investing $2k a year! You just gifted $875k from $2k of annual gifting - excellent for estate tax purposes! 

You can get around the income limits by making contributions from a trust or corporation: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc310

&gt; Organizations, such as corporations and trusts can also contribute regardless of their adjusted gross income.

My sister just had a child.  I started a Coverdell ESA account for her child at TD Ameritrade. They allow UPRO and TMF and individual stocks to be invested for benefit of the child. Yup it's 100% invested in 55% UPRO and 45% TMF. 

Ultimately you don't have to be 100% in this portfolio and many people aren't. It's incredible how much growth just $2k a year turns it into if you hold it for long enough. 

# Useful tools

It tells you how many shares you need to buy and sell. It also supports tax efficient cash rebalancing too. I personally invest in it's current allocation but doing simulations on both it doesn't matter much in the long run. It also tells you how many shares of SPXL to sell if you tax loss harvest this portfolio. 

Then it also tells you your percentage ownership of the two ETFs. I may have to file 13Gs/13Ds in the future for this portfolio. You can see how a $3m portfolio is already owning 0.63% of TMF.

DAO face offs good for DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOScapital/comments/o7tef7/dao_face_offs_good_for_defi/,NOScapital,1,2021-06-26 02:22:09,0,/r/NOScapital/comments/o7tef7/dao_face_offs_good_for_defi/,NaN," Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange for stablecoin trading, is one of the world's largest decentralized self-governing associations (DAOs), with $6.5 billion in stores. However, last week, one of its symbolic holders made an uncommon proposition:  


The Ethereum-based DAO ought to ""engage competent counsel"" — both in the United States and other significant wards — to forestall other DAOs from the ""discount duplicating"" of its product code.  


For what reason is this surprising? In the open-source decentralized finance (DeFi) world, legitimate activity against another DAO for protected innovation (IP) encroachment simply isn't finished. For this situation, Curve said it is ""99% certain"" that Saddle Finance, a fresher and more modest DAO, has disregarded the permit on its agreements.  


Actually, DAOs aren’t even legal entities. Additionally, recruiting a law office to ensure its protected innovation is part of the DeFi ethos, which regularly avoids anything associated with attorneys, copyrights, courts or permits operating, and where open-source programming is considered  a common benefit.  


Yet, here Sam Miorelli, a lawyer, was proclaiming on Curve's governance forum that ""IP infringement is not only wrong, it’s value-destructive both for the infringer — who wastes time copying instead of creating — and the infringed, who loses value of creation."" Moreover, funding firms that put resources into other DAOs that purloin code should be advised ""that decentralization does not mean that VC’s get to steal from communities."" Saddle is upheld by various VC firms, some of them unmistakable in the field.  


Miorelli's post had 3,200 perspectives as of June 24 and released a scaled down storm via online media. Robert Leshner, CEO of Compound — an Ethereum-based DeFi loaning stage and the third-biggest DAO in absolute worth bolted with $5.5 billion, simply behind Curve — cautioned: ""Crying to meatspace courts deeply undermines the ‘code is law’ principles that DeFi was founded on. This is a slippery slope that ends with the end of DeFi.""  


In the interim, Adam Cochran, overseeing accomplice at Cinneamhain Ventures, added, ""it’s all nonsense, greed driven by people who can’t compete on innovation and build the type of horrible walled gardens that this space was built to replace in the first place.""  


Another poster on the Curve administration discussion, in the interim, stressed that by going into fiery permit authorization, Curve would ""turn off"" the most skilled software engineers ""who are ‘in it for the tech.’ Would Satoshi and Hal contribute to Curve if they were around? I expect not.""  


Yet, others upheld Miorelli. A survey on the discussion, for example, was running 66% (67%) for the proposition ""to affirm Curve's IP rights against infringers."" Elsewhere, Gabriel Shapiro, accomplice at law office Belcher, Smolen and Van Loo, expressed that the ""code is law"" mantra is fraudulent in this unique circumstance, saying:  


""‘Code is law’ is a byword for users of a particular smart contract or system agreeing to defer to the results of that code rather than resorting to the costly and inefficient legal system. Curve never opted into a smart contract or other code system for determining its intellectual property rights, and in fact, no such code exists.""  


A statement of IP rights with respect to a DAO could even be beneficial for decentralized finance — another sign it entered the financial standard, some declared. ""I think the Curve community’s interest in enforcing IP rights is indeed a sign of the DeFi sector maturing,"" said Shapiro.  


Miorelli himself appeared satisfied with the reaction, revealing to Cointelegraph that the sheer reality that such a conversation is currently occurring was positive, adding:  


""Not only does it show that DeFi is maturing, but it also shows that the communities which have formed around these revolutionary projects are truly thinking long term.""  
Saving ""the value of their network""  
Shapiro further clarified that administration tokens like Curve's CRV are portions of value in an organization or computerized center, saying, ""Just like TSLA stockholders would want Tesla to defend Tesla’s IP rights in batteries or software to prevent value leaking from TSLA stock, so, too, the holders of CRV would want to maximize and preserve the value of their network equity."" He further explained he wasn't remarking on the benefits of these specific IP claims — only that the ""motivation"" to save network value esteem was both reasonable and unsurprising.  


In Miorelli's post, he illustrated some of what was in question: Curve pays ""bug bounties,"" initiates representatives, and spends significant capital growing new items. ""Since CRV is the currency of this, if something damages the value of CRV, it damages this work.""  


Asked whether DAOs would need to act more like customary organizations to secure their protected innovation, Wulf Kaal, a teacher at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, said:  


""Once DAOs are jurisdictionally recognized, they will likely replace significant portions of existing business constructs. With this development, it is possible that intellectual property issues under existing law will resurface in the DAO context.""  
""A remarkable issue""  
One spot where DAOs will before long be ""jurisdictionally perceived"" is Wyoming, which in March passed the primary state law tending to administration issues for DAOs, compelling as of July 1, 2021. As clarified in a new National Law Review article, ""regulators have been slow to respond because DAOs present a unique problem: Who is responsible when something goes wrong?""  


The new law perceives DAOs ""as a distinct form of the limited liability company,"" as indicated by the article, with the different advantages trademark to LLCs, ""including limited liability for its owners, a more flexible management structure than is permitted in other corporate forms, and potentially advantageous default rules.""  


The bill also gives that a DAO can be defined in two distinct ways — as ""member managed"" or algorithmically managed — adding: ""An algorithmically managed DAO, which would truly be decentralized, may only form if the underlying smart contracts are capable of updates or modifications.""  


One assumes that a ""member managed"" DAO like Curve may make some simpler memories declaring IP rights in a scene like Wyoming where DAOs are destined to be joined to a bigger legitimate and administrative structure — however one can't make certain, at any rate not yet.  


In the meantime, the IP debate is still fraught, since none of the issues have been tested in the courts. Many foundation issues stay, as per Shapiro, like the contrasts between DAO projects supported by conventional investors versus those that are more open from the beginning. ""We need new taxonomies to grasp the issues — for instance, a ‘vampire attack’ against a VC-funded project is very different from a ‘zombie attack’ against a non-VC-funded project. Neither is inherently bad or good, but it’s important to understand incentives and social networks and how they are affecting these nascent disputes.""  


Miorelli, as far as concerns him, attempted to place this all in a bigger setting. ""IP has a controversial history in the software development world"", he said.  


In truth, it works contrastingly under various general sets of laws. In any case, Miorelli explained that large numbers of the misconceptions emerge ""because the legal profession has not done a very good job historically at educating the public and participants in the software and crypto space."" He added further, ""I don’t think my proposal got a ton of attention because I’m an IP law luminary. It got a lot of attention because I started an important conversation."" Miorelli said he trusted his proposition would in the long run progress to in any event one formal DAO vote.  


Kaal revealed that claims will unavoidably turn out to be more ordinary as the beginning DeFi industry develops, and indeed, they may prohibitively affect advancement. ""It depends on the legal constructs in DAOs as to how far the lawsuits can change the landscape."" A legitimate development is something presented via law or agreement, like a right.  


""I definitely think we will see more legal action and threats of legal action by and on behalf of DAOs,” said Shapiro, adding further, “Whether this specific situation will set a precedent — only time will tell.""  


""IP protection is an important and valid part of any maturing organization, regardless of how it’s organized,"" Miorelli stated, adding on a placating note:  


""My hope is that my proposal and any future actions related to it shows that lawyers can contribute to the growth of DeFi \[...\] sharing their expertise on the same collaborative basis that the devs do."""

Let's jump right in to leverage! 

# People Misunderstand Leveraged Investing Strategies 

Let's visit someone who blew up an account - [Market Timer over at Bogleheads.](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934)

Market Timer was following a popular Yale paper at the time - Mortgage your Retirement and the later book [Lifecycle Investing.](https://smile.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performance-Retirement/dp/B005X4I7ZI) The premise of Lifecycle investing is you start off with an aggressive 200% equities allocation while you're young. Essentially instead of saving $10,000 per year, if you invest with 2x leverage it's like you're saving $20,000 a year. You're borrowing time from the future and smoothing out sequence of risk returns. If the market tanks 50% in one year, an young investor can withstand a $5,000 50% loss. An older investor near retirement with $2 million can't withstand a $1 million loss. 

Eventually with Lifecycle Investing you'll reach a point where you start to de-risk your leverage ratio essentially borrowing a ""constant"" portfolio of your expected retirement each year. Then as you get closer to retirement you glidepath into an 80/20 or 75/25 bond allocation. On average the Lifecycle Strategy historically gets you to retirement 10 years faster at a 15-25% savings rate than traditional retirement would in 100% stocks. 

The key thing Market Timer missed is the paper calls for **monthly reset** of the 2x leverage. If you monthly reset SPY [you would not have been margin called in 2008.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=200&amp;symbol2=CASHX&amp;allocation2_1=-100)


It's incredibly hard to do monthly reset of leverage intuitively, but it is critical to do so if you're following this paper. It is literally buying more stocks when the price of stocks is high, and selling your stocks to pay down your margin loan when stocks crash. It is a brainfuck strategy.

Let's say you have $100k you want to put at 2x leverage. That means you're buying an additional $100k of stocks on margin. So you now have a $200k position with a $100k margin loan backing it. If you sell this position you're left with $100k, your equity. So your leverage ratio is $200k position / $100k equity = 2x leverage.

Now, what happens if stocks double from here? What is your new leverage? 

Your position is now $400k, you still have $100k of a margin loan, and your equity is $300k. Your leverage is now $400k/$300k = 1.33x leverage ratio. You now absolutely have to buy more stocks at the top of the market to maintain your desired 2x leverage ratio. 

Ok, now let's do the other case, what if stocks drop 25% instead? (50% will result in a margin call).  What is your new leverage if stocks drop 25%? 

Your $200k position is now $150k, you still have a $100k margin loan, and your equity is $50k. Your leverage ratio greatly increased! It's now $150k position / $50k equity = 3x. You better sell down some shares with the market being in the bottom as now you're way more risky than 2x leverage. Further percentage losses will be even worse.

On Reg-T your maintenance margin is 25% equity. You're currently at 33% equity - 50k equity/150k position. TD Ameritrade's house maintenance margin is 30%. **You're 3% away from getting a margin call to wire in funds or sell down your position.**  IBKR is getting ready to auto liquidate you at their maintenance margin! 

So as you can see a trading strategy on margin you literally buy high and sell low. It's very hard for people to do in practice.

# Enter Leveraged ETFs

Since managing leverage yourself is a brainfuck calculation, instead it's better to invest with a leveraged fund like 2x for SSO, or 3x - UPRO. This is why UPRO and SSO daily reset their leverage! It's providing you the most safety and the most return!

In my code with quantconnect daily reset = monthly reset. There is no additional volatility decay from daily reset. You're going to have the same volatility decay even if you manage monthly reset of leverage on your own. 

UPRO/TMF has a 0.75% management fee and with $2.2 billion of AUM they're getting **institutional** borrow rates. IBKR marks up their margin interest rates by 75 basis points. In my code on quantconnect.com UPRO and TMF are identical to SPY and TLT on portfolio margin after adjusting for actual margin interest paid. Unfortunately on portfolio visualizer's CASHX variable does no margin markup so SPY and TLT look misleading compared to UPRO and TMF. 

You're getting an excellent deal for the leverage UPRO and SSO provide. You can run these funds in a cash account, in retirement accounts, and so on. I'm running Hedgefundie's portfolio in all my accounts - taxable, Roth IRA, pre-tax solo 401k (rolling 100% over to the roth ira in the 22% marginal bracket), and a HSA account.

# People Misunderstand Leveraged ETFs

[Volatility decay is a myth.](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php) This article explains it a lot better than I can. You can buy and hold leveraged ETFs for long term! 

I just showed you how leverage works. The market is a lot more trending/momentum based over a period of 10-20 trading days. You're not going to see a daily gain of 10% followed by a loss of 10% each and every day. Yes the Leverage ETF prospectuses is scary with math of the VIX being 75+ for an **entire year** of having substantial losses but they're writing it as if **every day** in the market followed the same gain 10% and lose 10%. In COVID the VIX spiked to 85 then quickly normalized to 25.

This last back test is why I'm 100% invested in this portfolio. I could *possibly* achieve $1.3 billion dollars nominally. I have a chance to hit that figure at age 62 if history repeats itself. 

Yes its $555 million inflation adjusted to 1987 dollars, and that $62m of the S&amp;P 500 is $25m in 1987 dollars. And yes, past performance is no predictor of future returns. 

CASHX is modeling actual interest rates. It's the 1-month Treasury Bills from 1972+. No 0.75% markup though which IBKR and UPRO/TMF have.

# Why does Hedgefundie's Portfolio make so much money?

It's due to several factors. Currently the [efficient frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier) of these two asset classes is 55% stocks and 45% bonds. The unlevered portfolio has about a 8% return and a 15% drawdown during 2008. The 2x leveraged portfolio has a 16% return and 30% drawdown, and 3x roughly 24% return for a 60% drawdown risk. 

100% stocks has 50% drawdown risk, which was my previous portfolio. I'm comfortable with 10% more drawdown risk.

Second, because we are adding leverage, we are still maintaining the [tangency portfolio but getting more return for the same amount of risk vs 100% stocks.](https://i1.wp.com/earlyretirementnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beat-the-market-Chart03.png?resize=863%2C627&amp;ssl=1) Credit goes to Early Retirement Now for this graph. With the 3x leverage we're going past 100% stocks and our risk is 27% standard deviation along that same tangency line. 

Many people try to get more return by mixing in riskier assets like Venture Capital, international funds, and so on. Instead Hedgefundie's Portfolio is Modern Portfolio Theory taken to the extreme.  

We are getting more return from having a large insurance component being heavily weighted to bonds. They saved the portfolio a lot in 2008 and in 2020 during Covid. Another quite surprising fact is we are actually profitable on this insurance too. 

Finally, Hedgefundie's portfolio deploys a well oiled correlation trading strategy that produces a crap ton of extra yield via quarterly rebalancing vs annual or monthly rebalancing. The rebalancing period is correlated to when earnings reports are minimal in the stock market. Essentially each quarter you're making a 55/45 bet on the market having great earnings or disappointing earnings. 

# How correlation trading strategies work

Let's say we have two assets that are **perfectly inverse correlated.** Let's say asset A has a 50/50 chance of either doubling or losing 50%, and asset B likewise has the opposite chance?  Can you think of any trading strategy to take advantage of these facts?

Let's say we have $100k to invest with. One strategy is to throw 50% on A and 50% on B - $50k each. After some point in time let's say A doubles to $100k. B will halve to $25k. Now our portfolio is valued at $125k - a 25% gain! So now we rebalance both to $75k A and B.

Now, what happens if we add leverage to this trade?

So instead of taking $100k to invest with, we borrow an additional $100k with our equity. We now have $100k on A and $100k on B. After one year we have $200k on A, and $50k on B. We have a $250k position and owe $100k. Subtract $100k and our equity is $150k. 

Since our equity is $150k we now have a 50% gain. The 2x leverage doubled our return.

Bringing this back to Hedgefundie's portfolio it's a well oiled correlation trading strategy machine with a ton of leverage. Now you see why that 55/45 bet every quarter is paying off! It doesn't matter if earnings are bad or good, **we still profit.**  We do expect more good earnings it being the stock market and growth, so that's why we're weighting our bets a bit for the optimal growth. ;) 

# 40+ year bond bull market - aren't you worried about rising interest rates?

No, I am not. Most the return comes from the 165% equities, with TMF acting in the nick of time for crash insurance. [If we plot out simulated UPRO and TMF you see simulated TMF doubles then draws down 50% all the freaking time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=4&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=Simulated+100%25+UPRO&amp;portfolioName2=Simulated+100%25+TMF&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=300&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_2=300&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200&amp;allocation3_2=-200)  We see UPRO trending. Again, we are seeing the correlation trading strategy I just discussed about in action!


Then for rising interest rates, bond funds operate differently than an individual bond does! That is because bond funds have [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). TLT happens to sell the 20 year bond to buy the 30 year bond at auction! So if interest rates raise slowly, say no more than 0.25% - 0.50% per quarter, then soon you'll start profiting with the higher interest rate! 

Then there are many strategies that you actually want to go LONG on 20+ year treasuries in a rising interest rate environment, such as the [Barbell Strategy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy)

&gt; In finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long- and short-duration bonds, but does not invest in intermediate-duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value

Right now TMF is mooning as thanks to the Feds statements there are less inflation fear in the 20+ year treasury market. So now yields are dropping which causes bonds to rise. The yield curve is flattening as bond investors are trying to get the risk free rate regardless of the duration of the bonds due to the positive outlook.

If TMF keeps it up it will be the first time I'll have to sell TMF to buy some UPRO! I got really tired of having to buy TMF all throughout Covid. I'm sitting on some nice gains having to buy TMF at $22! It's about time to back up the truck a bit on more UPRO shares! 

Many people in the Hegdefundie Bogleheads thread also simulated random 1-6% randomly rising interest rates using a monte carlo situation and the portfolio holds just fine under those conditions. 

If you look closely at the backtests the last ten years have been the highest gains vs earlier on in 1987. We're investing in these bonds not for their income but for their capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 10% to 9% is not going to produce much capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 2% to 1% is going to have tremendous capital gains. 

Again the purpose of these bonds are stock-market crash insurance. Most of our return is coming from the 165% equities position. The future predicted low interest rate environment is very favorable for the bond component of this portfolio. Again, this portfolio makes great use of a correlation trading strategy so we **want** interest rates to raise and fall and have it be **inversely correlated** with the stock market! We want to keep those low interest rates! Let's keep that money printing machine going! 

# Why I'm not worried about another 1970-1980 stagflation era

This is the worst drawdown period for Hedgefundie's portfolio. It has a 75% drawdown over this decade. I completely discount this era due to one critical reason: [US Treasuries were CALLABLE until 1985!](https://www.sapling.com/7796395/treasury-bonds-callable)  No one in the right mind would be running a leveraged treasury portfolio in 1970!

Callable bonds are bonds that can be called at face value at any time! Let's say the treasury issued bonds at 12% in one year then the next year rates dropped to 6%. The treasury's call feature let them stop interest payments and they were called at face value. 

So you have large NAV losses when interest rates rise, and you don't get any upside when interest rates drop! 

Now, just because historically these treasuries had a call feature doesn't mean that the US treasury exercised it. So I went to my local library and viewed old WSJ articles from the 70s on microfiche. Sure enough there are huge lists of US treasuries that got called every single month in these articles! It would not make any logical sense to run a leveraged bond portfolio in this era! 

This entire portfolio is a play that US treasuries are no longer callable and I would stop trading this portfolio if they ever become callable again in the future. It's also a play on the current Fed policy remaining the same - doing quantitative easing and dropping interest rates in future stock market crashes just like they did for 2008 and Covid! 

# TMF is a Yield-Curve Play on Long Term 20+Year US Treasuries

Right now the 20+ year US treasury is trading at 1.5%. TMF is borrowing on total-return swaps with the overnight rate effectively 0%, with 80% of the fund being TLT itself. You're getting 1.5% * 3x leverage = 4.5% of interest on TMF before lending expenses. After TMF's 0.75% management fee it's a 3.75% APR return. If you're 55%/45% then this portfolio is getting 1.68% APR in a low-volatility sideways market. Since TMF is borrowing on total-return swaps the dividend gets paid into the fund and the NAV grows! 

Again, yes TMF is taking a 0.75% management fee, and doing the same trade with IBKR on portfolio margin you're paying a 0.75% markup on the overnight rate if you want to buy TLT directly. 

Again, we are using TMF for protection and insurance, but it's nice to have something that's profitable vs buying puts, calls on the VIX, going long on VIX futures or VIX ETFs. I'm very happy to keep holding TMF throughout post covid. 

# Taxable account performance and Tax loss harvesting

With my code using www.quantconnect.com and calculating all the PnL on the quarterly trades, then computing actual LTCG and STCG taxes on these trades, the federal tax drag is 1.5% for an account at my current level for the historical last 10 years. For a $10+ million account it's 2.0%. Living in California adds another 1.0% state tax drag.  So if you're getting 24% CAGR in a tax-advantage account you're getting a 22% CAGR in taxable for federal tax drag (21% in California).

In my original simulations when I started this portfolio I paid $300k in federal taxes for 10 years with UPRO/TMF, and I paid $600k in taxes over 10 years with SPY and TLT on portfolio margin. Buying 2x dividends really sucks.

UPRO and TMF are excellent tax dodges as the vast majority of their return is total-return swaps with the banks. So instead of realizing dividends, the swap pays those dividends into the fund as part of the total return index and the NAV of the fund grows! So when you sell UPRO and TMF you realize your dividends then! 

It turns out if your hold period is less than 30 years with a 2% federal tax drag, you're best in a Roth IRA, followed by Taxable, followed by pre-tax 401k. After 30 years the order is: Roth IRA, Pre-Tax 401k, Taxable. It turns out paying 40% in ordinary income taxes in the pre-tax case is worse before 30 years, but after 30 years it has a higher after-tax value thanks to dodging the tax drag.  

UPRO and TMF holds about 80% unrealized gains across my simulations, and mostly throw off LTCG gains when major re-balances happen too. You'll want to use specific identification to sell shares that have the lowest possible tax cost. 

You can also take advantage of tax loss harvesting which I did not write code to evaluate for. URPO's tax loss harvest pair is SPXL, another 3x ETF. So my 2% federal tax drag is a **worst case estimate.**

TMF has no other 3x 20+ year treasury ETF, so it's tax loss harvest pair is [Synthetic Long Stock](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-long-stock.aspx) on TLT at 3x delta. So if you have a $45,000 position in TMF and want to harvest all losses in your $45,000 position, and TLT is trading at $143.64, then this is the formula:

3 * (45,000 / 143.64) =  939 delta of synthetic stock.

So you will buy 9 ATM call options and sell 9 ATM naked puts on TLT for 31+ days to keep your position in TMF, then you will want to close the synthetic stock and rebuy TMF with the left over cash.  Again using quantconnect.com this is the most accurate model I can get to TMF. It turns out bond futures are a terrible replacement for TMF and it brings me to the next topic.

I personally did the synthetic stock trade to tax loss harvest TMF in February 2021 and I was able to buy back the same number of shares of TMF. It works wonderfully. 

If you're on Portfolio Margin just save your time and commissions and buy 939 shares of TLT. [Use Box Spreads to Refinance your margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegqz0/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) instead of paying your broker's usury margin rates unless you're on IBKR. Unfortunately if you're on Reg-T you won't have the margin available to buy 939 shares of TLT and why you have to do the synthetic stock trade above.

# Futures suck for Hedgefundie's portfolio

In a taxable account futures are **marked to market.** You realize your PNL every year as of Dec 31st. In my above simulations /ES and /UB futures costed me $2.8 million in federal taxes. Talk about an insane tax drag!

Futures are only worthwhile in a retirement account, which brings us to the next problem. There are no micro futures for /UB and /ZB. Each /UB future is currently $180k notional value. You need a $1-$2 million+ retirement account to get fine grained leverage on these futures, otherwise your leverage will swing from 2x to 4-6x depending on if you round nearest or round down your number of contracts! 

Finally, I cannot get any mix of /UB and /ZB to replicate TMF's fund testing with quantconnect. Convexity strikes again! It turns out reviewing the actual deliverable of these future contracts its a basket of bonds that is EITHER the 25 year or the 30 year bond. So you're only trading one bond! The future traders will deliver the 25 year bond as it's the cheapest to deliver if interest rates are below 6%. They will deliver the 30 year bond if interest rates are above 6%!  Only if interest rates are **exactly** 6% are any of the 25-30 year bonds deliverable! 

So the bond futures are less than ideal for leverage with this portfolio. They either add too much risk or not have enough risk. /ES futures track UPRO very accurately though. 

# Won't you have Liquidity Problems on your trades?

No I won't. ETFs have [authorized participants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp) that help with liquidity in ETFs. Also ETFs are required to post their [indicative Net Asset Value (iNAV) every 15 seconds.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicative_net_asset_value.asp) You can look to see what the quotes are vs the most current iNAV.

In February I decided to tax loss harvest TMF and I sold down my entire position slowly at a time as level two quotes were showing 700 shares offered. I was a bit fearful as I know TMF is a bit illiquid at $200m AUM and I had a huge position. I switched to synthetic stock on TLT.

Then I wanted to test the reality of buying back all my shares, which I had $132,000 remaining in cash at the time in my taxable account. At $22 a share it'd be my biggest trade - 6,000 shares. I was sweating bullets. I still only had quotes of 700 shares on L2 quotes. I was about to buy 6,000 shares all at once with a marketable limit order of $0.01 spread on TOS over TMF's iNAV. TMF had a $0.01 premium - works for me! I'm doing it for science. I had coded an entire algorithm at Quant Connect to sell TMF and UPRO randomly in 200-700 round lots using IBKR's API instead if this portfolio got so huge out of the concern of the L2 quotes I was seeing.

For the next 30 seconds TOS played sound after sound of order filling. I filled my entire limit order, then the spread widened to $0.05-$0.10 for the next 30 seconds after I was filled, then it narrowed back down to $0.01 and TMF was $0.10 higher iNAV wise. I had an instant profit of $600 on my position. Soon the iNAV went back down to what it was before my trade. I had discovered a lot more people in the order book than those 700 shares!

Finally, if you do have a large enough position you need to re-balance from that an Authorized Participant will take - the process is simple. [Make a phone call to your brokerage's block trading desk and they'll help you out.](https://www.tdainstitutional.com/offerings/investing-wealth-management/trading-services/block-desk.html)

TDA Ameritrade and Fidelity both offer block trades for free to high net worth clients! Both TDA and Fidelity Block Desks can place trades with the authorized participants so I will definitely get NAV of TMF when my account grows this large! 

# Tail Risks

People point out if **BOTH** stocks and bonds go down 33% **in one day**, this portfolio would go to $0. Quite honestly it'd take an irresponsible Fed to raise interest rates so high that it'd piss off the entire market to sell off like this in one day. I don't think that will ever happen. I would not be 100% invested if I thought this was at all a realistic scenario. 

Then yes, UPRO can, and has gotten near to 0% (historically simulated UPRO had a 98% drawdown in this portfolio!) but we're hoping TMF will moon hard to save the portfolio instead. 

Then right now with the [S&amp;P 500 circuit breakers](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp) it's impossible for UPRO to go to $0 in a day, although the drawdown will be gnarly.  UPRO has roughly 220% of swaps and the rest are S&amp;P 500 futures. So even if the swaps can't be adjusted this day UPRO can probably unload enough futures on the market to cover in a drawdown.

This is also why I'm staying the hell away from TQQQ. Normal QQQ had an 80% drawdown in the 1999 tech stock crash. Granted, all these tech companies are a lot more mature on the NASDAQ, but I personally have no interest in tilting or having an allocation to TQQQ. 

# My De-Risking Strategy 

I have a de-risking strategy that helps me sleep at night. I will be selling a portion of my portfolio to invest in 100% VTSAX (or the 2x spy/tlt leverage version) at every milestone I hope to achieve:

* $12.5m - $25m NW - I'll be selling $2.5m to lock in a FIRE lifestyle.      
* $110m NW - I'll be selling an additional $7.5m to lock in a $10M Fat Fire lifestyle       
* $1.1 billion NW - I'll be selling an additional $90 million to lock in a rich $100m Whale Fire lifestyle      
* $4 billion - $10 billion - $20 billion NW - I'll be selling 25-50% of my portfolio to go into wealth preservation, lock in billionaire status and let the rest ride.       

I'm projecting each milestone is 10 years of my life. Selling 10% over 10 years is roughly a 1% unlevered allocation.

I may transfer the amount I de-risk into an asset protection trust so I'd feel comfortable if I want to borrow on this portfolio in the future.

# Securities Lending for Hedgefundie's Portfolio

Sadly PALs and the like don't lend for a portfolio of 3x leveraged ETFs. Your only option is on Portfolio Margin where you'll unlock roughly 70% buying power for this portfolio. IE you can withdraw 70% of it in cash and keep your position as long as you don't lose one dollar on the position. It's 30% initial and maintenance margin at IBKR.

TD Ameritrade no longer allows any leveraged ETFs to be eligible for portfolio margin. They just shut it down instead of fixing their software. Despite them letting you go currently 6.6x on SPY and 14x on TLT, they let you go 1x on UPRO and 1x on TMF.  2.2x leverage on UPRO and 4.6x on TMF would be equivalent positions to SPY and TLT! 

So if you want to borrow at TDA you'll have to be SPY and TLT instead at 2x tax drag and monthly reset your leverage every month. IBKR correctly understands UPRO is 3x SPY and so they multiply their 10% S&amp;P 500 risk array by 3x and you get 30% initial and maintenance margin! IBKR lets you go 10x on spy and thus you can go 3.333x on UPRO. 1/.30 = 3.333x. Your mileage may vary at other brokers offering portfolio margin. 

One thing to be aware of I was checking [IBKR's margin calculator](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=24176) during Covid. It appeared they may have made 3x leveraged ETFs non-marginable for portfolio margin and were only giving 2.8x leverage on SPY and TLT. I didn't have an account at the time and I don't know how they would handle someone borrowing conservatively in this case. So there is some possible risk of auto liquidation of any margin loan on UPRO and TMF at IBKR in another stock market crash despite being able to borrow conservatively. 

Ultimately you can borrow on this portfolio but it depends on your future outlook of the max drawdown. If it's only going to be 60% in the future then possibly up to 20% on margin is safe. You'll be in a rough spot if 75% drawdown repeats itself. 

Let's work out some math. $10 million on hedgefundie's portfolio. You borrow $2 million - 20%. If it draws down 60% your $10 million position is $4 million, you owe $2 million, you're at $2 million equity, and you're still fine to carry this position in portfolio margin as they will allow you 70% of buying power and you're at 50% buying power. 

If it draws down to 75% the position is now worth 2.5 million, you owe 2 million, your equity is $500k, 1-.5/2.5 million = 80% buying power, you'll be margin called on portfolio margin and have to sell down to a $1.666 million position to meet minimum buying power requirements. 

15% is the max you can borrow indefinitely on this portfolio and not be margin called under the 75% historical drawdown on portfolio margin. Your position is now 2.5 million as before, you owe 1.5 million, and your equity is 1 million. You're at 60% buying power:  1-1/2.5 million = 60%. If you lose any more dollars you'll start getting portfolio margin calls.   

I feel comfortable borrowing up to 10% on margin indefinitely on Hedgefundie's portfolio. I'm on the fence with 15-20% given the historical vs future outlook of this portfolio. Definitely borrowing past 20% on margin is irresponsible.

# Are you worried about the strategy if leveraged ETFs are shut down?

No I'm not. The SEC made a final decision in October 2020 to keep leveraged ETFs. They're limited to borrowing 2x directly with margin but can go up to 4x with derivatives. 3x UPRO and TMF are safe. 

If they ever go away then I'll be running this portfolio using SPY and TLT on portfolio margin in a taxable account.

# Aren't you too optimistic?

Why yes, yes I am. However I'm 28 years old with $600k riding on this portfolio with an excellent track record that since 1987 goes to $1.3 billion in nominal dollars. It's my only shot in the world to be a billionaire in nominal dollars and I'm taking it. :)

# Is this portfolio right for me?

Ultimately it comes down to your willingness and ability to take risks. It may not be right for you. **Even Hedgefundie is only risking $100k on this for a good chance of it turning into $10 million over 20 years.** 

I'm following a lifecycle investing philosophy of investing while young. My financial situation is very unique. 

You need to have the balls to sell TMF for UPRO in a stock market crash even if UPRO has drawdown 85% or more. In 2008 UPRO had a 85%-90% drawdown for the 60% of the portfolio's drawdown. If UPRO repeats its historical 98% simulated drawdown you need to be backing up the truck with TMF and buying those shares on a fire sale! 

You absolutely need to be mechanical about rebalancing every quarter and not have any second thoughts about doing so. 

Feel free to invest at a lower leverage too. You can do 2x with SSO and UBT. Or 2x with [PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst)

Or you can drop down to 1.5x. One [popular investment is NTSX.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/efficient-core/ntsx) It is the ONLY leveraged fund allowed over at Vanguard as so far it's beating VTSTAX's return with a lot lower risk! NTSX is intermediate treasuries though so it's not quite a direct replacement. 

Finally, [good old 1.0x leverage does pretty well.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=55&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=45)

You can also use Hedgefundie's portfolio strategically. For instance, start a Coverdell ESA account for someone who's a baby and [by the time they're age 18 it's grown to $875k.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=2000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=2000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=3&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=165&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_1=135&amp;symbol3=CASHX&amp;allocation3_1=-200) It's quite impressive for investing $2k a year! You just gifted $875k from $2k of annual gifting - excellent for estate tax purposes! 

You can get around the income limits by making contributions from a trust or corporation: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc310

&gt; Organizations, such as corporations and trusts can also contribute regardless of their adjusted gross income.

My sister just had a child.  I started a Coverdell ESA account for her child at TD Ameritrade. They allow UPRO and TMF and individual stocks to be invested for benefit of the child. Yup it's 100% invested in 55% UPRO and 45% TMF. 

Ultimately you don't have to be 100% in this portfolio and many people aren't. It's incredible how much growth just $2k a year turns it into if you hold it for long enough. 

# Useful tools

I made [a spreadsheet you can use that pulls in quotes from Google Finance to easily re-balance this portfolio.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CKG4e7Y-0k0Fxbc6-hLqKYpdccczGEDN6Yabb_mP5Co/edit?usp=sharing) Please make a COPY and don't request edit access. 

It tells you how many shares you need to buy and sell. It also supports tax efficient cash rebalancing too. I personally invest in it's current allocation but doing simulations on both it doesn't matter much in the long run. It also tells you how many shares of SPXL to sell if you tax loss harvest this portfolio. 

Then it also tells you your percentage ownership of the two ETFs. I may have to file 13Gs/13Ds in the future for this portfolio. You can see how a $3m portfolio is already owning 0.63% of TMF. 

# Further Reading that helps understand this portfolio

[Hedgefundie over at Bogleheads.](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=272007) Read every single post before you decide to invest all in.

Is Bitcoin A Ponzi Scheme? A Detailed Analysis.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/o7v5xs/is_bitcoin_a_ponzi_scheme_a_detailed_analysis/,AmericanScream,1,2021-06-26 03:53:53,426,/r/CryptoReality/comments/o7v5xs/is_bitcoin_a_ponzi_scheme_a_detailed_analysis/,Analysis,"By American Scream - Technology Ethicist

Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?  How close is it to the traditional definition?   Let's look at the facts.

First let's start with various formal definitions:

#Definition of ""Ponzi Scheme""

Webster's Dictionary - arguably the primary source of what things mean for close to 200 years, and the standard for education in US and around the world:

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Ponzi%20scheme

**Pon·​zi scheme** | \ ˈpän-zē-

&gt;: **an investment swindle in which some early investors are paid off with money put up by later ones in order to encourage more and bigger risks**

Encylopedia Brittanica:

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ponzi-scheme

&gt;Ponzi scheme, fraudulent and illegal investment operation that promises quick, easy, and significant returns on investments with little or no risk. A Ponzi scheme is a type of pyramid scheme in which the operator, at the pyramid’s top, acquires a small group of investors that is **initially provided with tremendous investment returns via funds secured from a second group of investors. The second group, in turn, is paid with funds obtained from a third group of investors, and so on until the number of potential investors is exhausted and the scheme collapses.** The operator may either appropriate a portion of incoming investments as the scheme progresses or wait until the operation is about to collapse before absconding with the funds.

Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme

&gt;A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒnzi/, Italian: [ˈpontsi]) is a form of fraud that **lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.** The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g., product sales or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. **A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds**, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own. 

&gt;With little or no legitimate earnings, **Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes tend to collapse.** As a result, most investors end up losing all or much of the money they invested. In some cases, the operator of the scheme may simply disappear with the money.

Here's the SEC's page on Ponzi schemes:

https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme

&gt;Ponzi Scheme

&gt;A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that **pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.** Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk. But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters do not invest the money. Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may keep some for themselves.

&gt;With little or no legitimate earnings, **Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes tend to collapse.**

&gt;Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who duped investors in the 1920s with a postage stamp speculation scheme.


#How Ponzi Schemes Actually Work

If we distill all the various definitions of Ponzi down to a basic set of characteristics, here's what we get:

1.  A scheme where the primary source of money comes from recruiting new people
2.  A scheme where people who buy in earlier, get paid from people who buy in later.
3.  A scheme that involves misleading the people who are buying into the scheme 
4.  A scheme that requires constant recruitment of new buyers in order to sustain itself
5.  A scheme that naturally collapses when either too many early buyers try to exit/cash out, or the income from new buyers dries up and the scheme is exposed.

The above five primary characteristics define what a Ponzi is.  

I'm going to add a *sixth* characteristic that becomes obvious during the course of this analysis:

\6.  **A scheme that is often ignored as being a scam as long as it continues operating and paying off people.** It's not acknowledged as a Ponzi until a significant portion of investors lose their money.

This 6th characteristic, while not a requirement, is clearly pronounced in both the original scheme involing Charles Ponzi, and the largest Ponzi ever, Bernie Madhoffs.  More details will be provided later on in this document.

There are various other ""red flags"" which are *not exclusive or required* but are often associated with Ponzis, according to the SEC:

&gt;Many Ponzi schemes share common characteristics. Look for these warning signs:

&gt;* High returns with little or no risk. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be highly suspicious of any “guaranteed” investment opportunity.
* Overly consistent returns. Investments tend to go up and down over time. Be skeptical about an investment that regularly generates positive returns regardless of overall market conditions.
* Unregistered investments. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that are not registered with the SEC or with state regulators. Registration is important because it provides investors with access to information about the company’s management, products, services, and finances.
* Unlicensed sellers. Federal and state securities laws require investment professionals and firms to be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.
* Secretive, complex strategies. Avoid investments if you don’t understand them or can’t get complete information about them.
* Issues with paperwork. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds are not being invested as promised.
* Difficulty receiving payments. Be suspicious if you don’t receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying put.

#Let's cite some common established Ponzi schemes

**Charles Ponzi's original scheme**

Details: https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/behind-the-badge-case-histories-scams-and-schemes/ponzi-scheme

In the early 1900s an Italian immigrant named Charles Ponzi noticed that there were differences in the exchange rate for postal stamps between Europe and America.  He surmised that if he could buy stamps from one area and sell them in another, he could profit.  And if he scaled this operation enough, the profits would be substantive.  The base premise seemed believable and he managed to acquire a few investors to begin.  *He promised a 50% profit within 45 days.**

In reality, there's no evidence Ponzie ever bought/sold stamps in large quantities.  Instead, he paid earlier investors with money he acquired from 
later people who bought into the scheme.  

From the Smithsonian Institution:

&gt;*Ponzi was good to his word at first, using funds from new investors to pay off the old. As his popularity and number of investors grew, postal inspectors became suspicious of how he was able to ensure the returns he promised. Their investigation showed that worldwide International Reply Coupon sales were not nearly high enough to support Ponzi’s story about trading in them to make a profit. Inspectors were sure that he was doing something illegal, but despite the fact that he sent messages to his investors through the mail, they could not arrest him for fraud, because at that point no one was complaining of being cheated. These early funders were still flush with money pouring in from new investors.*

&gt; Following the publication of a newspaper article that questioned the validity of his operations, Ponzi went on the offensive. He called a meeting with federal, state, and local authorities on Monday, July 26, 1920 during which he suggested they audit his books. Also at his own suggestion, Ponzi agreed to stop taking investments during the audit in order to make the job easier. In this attempt to reassure the public, Ponzi caused his own demise. The next day angry investors crowded his office to demand their money—they feared that Ponzi was about to close up shop.

&gt;Ponzi was able to pay back a few of these investors, again trying to reassure the rest. Many continued to withdraw their money until Monday, August 9, when Massachusetts Bank Commissioner Joseph Allen told the Hanover Trust Company to stop honoring Ponzi’s checks, and three people, who had deposited with Ponzi, filed a petition in court to declare Ponzi bankrupt. Unable to pay back these investors, Ponzi was charged with using the mails in a scheme to defraud, and in November pled guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.

&gt;After being found not guilty in two state trials, Ponzi was found guilty of additional charges in a February 1925 trial and sentenced to another seven to nine years. While free on bail, Ponzi headed to Florida where he returned to his old tricks and was sentenced to a year in jail for violating Florida’s securities laws before he disappeared while awaiting an appeal. Found a few months later, Ponzi was sent back to Boston to serve out his remaining sentence there, and after being released in February, he was deported to Italy on October 7, 1934.

It's quite revealing that Ponzi appeared so certain he was not doing anything wrong that we was willing to submit to an audit, but people recognized that would be a great time to exit-scam and called him on it and he was found out.   Even after being convicted, he continued to scam people.

**Bernie Madhoff's Ponzi Scheme**

To date (not including the Crypto market, which is even larger) [Bernie Madhoff is credited with operating the largest Ponzi scheme](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-bernie-madoffs-ponzi-scheme-worked-2014-7) ever, defrauding people of over $65B.

Madhoff's scheme was similar to Ponzi's, but instead of stamps, the scheme involved investing in his fund which supposedly engaged in elaborate options trading based on the ebb and flow of blue chip stocks.   From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal):

&gt;Madoff's sales pitch was an investment strategy consisting of purchasing blue-chip stocks and taking options contracts on them, sometimes called a split-strike conversion or a collar.[38] ""Typically, a position will consist of the ownership of 30–35 S&amp;P 100 stocks, most correlated to that index, the sale of out-of-the-money 'calls' on the index and the purchase of out-of-the-money 'puts' on the index. The sale of the 'calls' is designed to increase the rate of return, while allowing upward movement of the stock portfolio to the strike price of the 'calls'. The 'puts', funded in large part by the sales of the 'calls', limit the portfolio's downside.""

&gt;In his 1992 ""Avellino and Bienes"" interview with The Wall Street Journal, Madoff discussed his supposed methods: In the 1970s, he had placed invested funds in ""convertible arbitrage positions in large-cap stocks, with promised investment returns of 18% to 20%"", and in 1982, he began using futures contracts on the stock index, and then placed put options on futures during the 1987 stock market crash. A few analysts performing due diligence had been unable to replicate the Madoff fund's past returns using historic price data for U.S. stocks and options on the indexes. Barron's raised the possibility that Madoff's returns were most likely due to front running his firm's brokerage clients.

Madhoff was so good at his scheme, he would actually generate bogus ""investment reports"" outlining how profits had come by pretending he had made certain investments prior to stocks changing valuation - he fabricated these reports later, as if he had anticipated the price movements. In reality he made no such investments.  

Many examining his claims found his ability to predict and time the market, bordering on supernatural.  Early critics questioned whether he was being honest and suspected he was operating a scheme.

*But*, like with Charles Ponzi's scheme, **as long as people were making money, no action was taken**.  It's only when the scheme starts to implode, that authorities begin to seriously investigate.  As long as the later investors don't know they've been defrauded yet, everybody thinks... or more importantly **wants to believe** that the scheme is legitimate.

#Staying Intellectually Honest - No Fallacious Responses

Before we even get into the analysis/arguments, it's important to note, don't bother trying to argue using common fallacies.

Specifically, arguing ""If Bitcoin is a Ponzi, so is fiat/stocks/etc.""   -- DO NOT DO THAT -- IT'S A FALLACY AND A DISTRACTION

This is called the [Tu Quoque fallacy](http://bsalert.com/fallacies/tu_quoque.html), or ""Appeal to Hypocrisy"", often characterized as ""Two wrongs make a right.""   YOU CAN'T USE THAT ARGUMENT.  IT'S PHONY.

We're not here to talk about whether anything else is a Ponzi. Whether fiat is also a Ponzi is a separate argument you can bring up later.  It has no bearing on the discussion here.  This is also a test to see who has actually read this article.  I predict a bunch of people will throw out this fallacious argument despite being told it's invalid -- and it may get you banned, so don't.

With that out of the way, let's move on...


#Comparing Bitcoin/Crypto Investing To Ponzi Schemes

Ok, let's get down to the details here.

First off, it's important to qualify where Cryptocurrencies seem to intersect with the idea of Ponzi Schemes.   **Not every implementation of crypto currency looks Ponzi-like**, but certain uses and use-cases cross into this area, and we're going to make some distinctions:

**Crypto as a technology is not a Ponzi.  It's just a technology/tool.**

The concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain says nothing about ""investments"" or ""profit.""   It's just a prototype of a type of technology that allows data to be reliably stored across a network of computers.  *Blockchain itself has no malicious intent or design.*  Bitcoin as a concept has no malicious intent or design.

Likewise, we can't blame the postal stamp industry for Charles Ponzi's original scheme, or the New York Stock Exchange for Bernie Madhoff's scam.  

**The actual scam was taking these concepts and misrepresenting them, and using misleading and inaccurate information about the markets to entice people to buy in to a scheme that was unsustainable.**

So any attempt to defend Bitcoin as not being a Ponzi based on an analysis of the underlying technology is irrelevant.

**NOTE:** We're going to talk about Bitcoin, but much of this discussion can apply to all other crypto currencies, including ETH and others.  In some cases, certain types of cryptos or crypto-related schemes (such as De-Fi) are arguably even more Ponzi-like and may be noted.

Bitcoin was originally created as a proof-of-concept.  Then it was implemented by people as a digital currency.    Then later it was re-branded as ""digital gold"" and an ""investment.""

This later stage, which is now the dominant method of using Bitcoin and other crypto currencies (as an investment security) is what we're going to compare with Ponzi schemes.

It's important to know that there are fundamental differences between currencies and investment securities.  This is a separate issue that is worthy of its own lengthy article but it's important to recognize that **fiat currency was not designed, nor intended to ever be an ""investment.""**  *Dollars or Euros are simply tokens recognized by the state that represent a transfer of value.  If currency was an investment, it would encourage hoarding, which is the opposite of what it was intended to do: currency is supposed to be circulated, not saved.*  This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is not particularly good at either being a currency or an investment - you can't do both well.  You ideally should be one or the other.

If you ask a dozen crypto enthusiasts why they're into it and what they want out of it, you're likely to get a dozen diverse responses, from ""wanting to change the world"" to ""wanting to get rich"" and everything in between.  It's amazing how many different narratives people in the crypto community have, *many of which are in direct conflict with each other*.  This is one of the big problems and we'll tackle this characteristic first:

#[PONZI ELEMENT] Is The Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency Industry Misleading?

Characteristic \#3 of a Ponzi is:  *A scheme that involves misleading the people who are buying into the scheme*

So we're going to address this characteristic first, becuase it really is one of the more arguable points.

I'm going to break this down into a few key elements:

**The Conflict Between Crypto-Currency and Crypto-Investment**

Some people say the objective is to ""HODL"" Bitcoin until it becomes a currency used by everybody.   While others constantly measure the value of Bitcoin in fiat (dollars or euros).  Adherents fall into one or both of these categories: either you want the price to go up, then you cash out and get rich, or you hope the number goes up, and then you can spend Bitcoin directly for things.  Because beyond those two options, *there's nothing you can do with Bitcoin* - it doesn't otherwise represent any tangible material asset.  It has to be traded for something, either goods &amp; services, or fiat to trade for goods and services.  **That's its only utility**

The problem is, if [Bitcoin is a currency](https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/markets/what-is-the-problem-with-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/), it needs to be traded to be viable, but [if Bitcoin is an investment](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/17/10-reasons-bitcoin-is-a-terrible-investment/), it should be hoarded and not traded, so it can't really do both.  You have to pick one.  You can't have it both ways.  Likewise, currency trading is dangerous and speculative and not really considered ""investing"" - it's just gambling.  The same applies to Bitcoin.  You either use it as a currency and it needs to be stable without price fluctuations, or you use it as an inestment, in which case to get anything out of it, *you have to convert it into fiat*.

This is basically how crypto works.  Can we all agree on that?

Also comparing crypto to gold or silver is a separate discussion.  There are strong arguments for gold and silver making poor investments as well.

So right away, there is confusion in the crypto community over whether Bitcoin is a currency or an investment.  In order to appeal to both camps, Bitcoin would never be very good at either.  

**This is one of the first and most distinctive misrepresentations of Bitcoin: That it can successfully function as both a currency and an investment.  It is good at neither.**  For more references on that, see [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/lq6xpq/the_defacto_list_of_cryptocurrencyblockchain/).  You can't have it both ways.  Currencies need to be stable.  Investments need to go up.   People who think Bitcoin can do both **have been misled**.

**The Crypto Industry Is Largely Un-Regulated - This Presents A Serious Misinformation Problem.**

Yes, there are plenty of risky, speculative investments in other areas: OTC, commodities, options trading, forex, etc.   The difference between these industries and the crypto industry is that there are established institutions overseeing these industries and lots of rules and regulations.  The agencies in these industries are licensed.  They pay fees and taxes which support an infrastructure that endeavors to ""keep the industry honest and lawful.""  Of course no system is perfect, but in the traditional finance world, at least there is a system; there are rules and there are authorities who are tasked with enforcing those rules.

This is **not** the case in the Crypto industry.  Being such a new area, created to hide slightly outside the traditional regulatory boundaries, there aren't many ""checks-and-balances"" when it comes to crypto exchanges and trading systems.  

If you sign up for a traditional brokerage account, you're likely to be presented with various disclaimers required by law to educate consumers on the risks associated with the market.  This is neither mandated nor guaranteed to be told to those interested in getting into cryptocurrencies.

In fact, the dominant discussion on crypto is ""number go up"" - an almost rabid fixation on the value of Bitcoin is $, which itself seems ironic.  If Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation of the dollar, why compare it to the dollar?  The inability of people to see the logical inconsistencies here is more evidence of propaganda and misinformation.

**The Crypto Industry Is Anything But Objective**

The dominant narrative in crypto, among the majority of its users is overwhelmingly positive and sensationalist.  It's all how awesome Bitcoin is and how it's going to change the world.  There's very little debate in most social media circles.  Communities are almost exclusively dedicated to boosting the reputation of crypto, and [very little](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ki6b39/seems_ive_been_banned_from_r_cryptocurrency_is/) [tolerance is allowed](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) for critical/skeptical viewpoints.    You'll be hard pressed to find any content in the major crypto subreddits critical of the subject matter.  It's easy to get banned if you don't toe the established line.

**Overwhelming Amounts Of Misinformation In the Crypto Community**

It's really hard to get a straight answer from most crypto institutions regarding the ""adoption"" of this technology by the mainstream.

For example, an article on a crypto forum about how a particular company is 'accepting Bitcoin' will not point out that in most cases, the company in question is not actually accepting crypto, but instead partnering with an [intermediary exchange](https://bitpay.com) who will accept crypto, convert it to fiat, and then pay the company.  This is also the case with Paypal.  They're lauded as now allowing people to buy/sell crypto, but in reality, [they've simply partnered with a third party who will do all the crypto exchanging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2020/12/17/paypals-cryptocurrency-partner-paxos-raises-142-million/) and they're merely getting fees and commissions. Also, Paypal's third party implementation of crypto utilizes their own private ledger that is separate from the public blockchain.  These omissions are some of the many examples of misinformation commonly floating around in the industry.  It's less involving ""adoption"" as it is ""exploitation.""

El Salvador for example, is now being held as a ""model"" for Bitcoin's success.  Its military leader rammed through a bill legitimizing Bitcoin as so-called legal tender, [despite only half the residents of the country having access to the Internet](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-el-salvador) - that latter element you will not find listed in any pro-crypto social media circles.  

**The Crypto Industry Vilifies The Status Quo To Make Its Own System Look Better**

The crypto industry routinely promotes a number of rather egregious, highly subjective, highly debatable narratives in order to prop itself up.  Talking points like: 

* ""Fiat inflation is out of control""
* ""the government is totally corrupt""
* ""buying power is going to collapse any minute""
* ""centralization is bad""
* ""banks are bad""
* ""regulation is bad""
* ""taxation is 'theft'""

and a variety of other not very accurate, not very rational talking points designed to scare people.  I unpack and dissect most of these false claims [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/o3myr6/the_rcryptoreality_ten_commandments_of_crypto/).  

Crypto enthusiasts claim that the anonymous, math-driven, distributed blockchain network is a better way to conduct business than dealing with the ""evil"", ""centralized"", ""corrupt"" government institutions.  *Despite the fact that virtually everything we depend upon runs reliably under that infrastructure, including the Internet and communications networks upon which Bitcoin depends!*

This is the real ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that is being propagated in this industry: That the system that reliably runs our lives can collapse at any moment and we need to jump ship to this new system that [has yet to prove itself better at anything.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/lq6xpq/the_defacto_list_of_cryptocurrencyblockchain/)

Another common way to mislead people is to cite various unstable third-world countries as examples of where Crypto can flourish: Zimbabwe, Venezuela, El Salvador, etc.  These incredibly atypical, unstable nation-states are held as examples of where Bitcoin can thrive?   They're also held up as cautionary tales of what's going to happen to America if we don't stop the ""out-of-control government.""  This kind of absurd propaganda is rampant.

**People lose their money on a regular basis thinking crypto is as ""safe"" as other financial systems**

One of the biggest misconceptions among retail ""investors"" is this notion that investing in crypto is similar to investing in stocks or other securities.  This is a common argument made, and it's completely false.  There are various laws that protect consumers from fraud, like the [Fair Credit Billing Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fair-credit-billing-act-fcba.asp). Traditional banks and brokerage houses also have their client accounts [FDIC insured](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/) against losses. There are *no such protections* in the crypto industry.

On top of that, most crypto transactions are one-way and non-reversable, making them exceptionally appealing for criminal activities. It's also much more complicated to set up a crypto wallet and do transactions than using traditional means like debit and credit cards. There are [thousands](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/) of new ways to be [defrauded using crypto](https://www.zdnet.com/article/2020s-worst-cryptocurrency-breaches-thefts-and-exit-scams/) that newbies won't even be aware of until its too late.  And these are not things that are told to people signing up. But once defrauded, the [victims are accused](https://medium.com/stakefish/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-fad3d43c2713) of being irresponsible.


**The Crypto Industry Ignores Its Own Serious Problems**

Proponents of crypto love to complain about the problems and inflation in the traditional economy.  But when confronted with [clear evidence of phony crypto currencies and wash trading](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal) they look the other way.

As of this writing, there's more than $56 Billion of one stablecoin itself: USDT, aka ""Tether"" floating around in the crypto market being used to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies, [pumping the market](https://bitfinexed.medium.com/bitfinex-and-tether-is-unauditable-why-they-will-never-do-a-real-audit-3324e002b185), for which [there's never been any reliable evidence is properly asset-backed](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-confirms-relationship-auditor-dissolved)

The infamous ""Tether Scam"" is so egregious and out of control, it's become a symbol of how it's virtually impossible to tell scammer from victim in the cryptocurrency market.  Virtually nobody who has money ""in play"" seems to care that there's [lots of evidence](https://micky.com.au/wash-trading-entire-tether-supply-was-traded-5-times-yesterday/) that there's a lot of illegal [wash trading](https://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-transparency-institute-64-of-tether-is-used-for-fake-trading/) going on.

**But** just like with Charles Ponzi's original scheme and Bernie Madhoff... *as long as enough people are making money, everybody looks the other way and ignores all the serious warning signs..*

#So is there deception in the cryptocurrency industry?  

**There's overwhelming evidence it's *rampant*.   And most importantly, it's not regulated to be nearly as open and responsible as the traditional finance networks, so where is the motivation for any of these organizations to act contrary to their self interests and let their customers know how [risky](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/learn-cryptocurrencies/what-are-the-risks) the [market](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/09/what-experts-say-about-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-concerns.html) actually is?**

I took on Chracteristic #3 because in my opinion, it's the only truly ""debatable"" element of Ponzi schemes where one might argue, if someone is aware of the risks, then they're not being misled.   But the problem is, it's really, really difficult to find anybody who is into crypto who will acknowledge how risky and speculative the industry is.  And the reason for this is because of the other elements: the need to constantly recruit others.

For example, if I buy stock in Apple.  Whether I go around telling people Apple is awesome, doesn't have much bearing on their bottom line.  They make their money creating useful products.  While reputation can certainly affect the value of a company's stock, the real base value is determined their fundamentals: income assets and liabilities.   But with crypto, *reputation is EVERYTHING*.  As a result, it's almost impossible to get a straight, honest, objective answer from players in this industry.

Now, let's move on to the other Ponzi elements:

#[PONZI ELEMENT] Does Bitcoin's Income Come From Later Investors?

Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are merely symbolic digital tokens.  They have no intrinsic value.  They only have symbolic value based on what people will pay for them.  As a result **the only revenue generated by Bitcoin comes from people buying in at a higher price**.  If you sell Bitcoin at a loss, you've lost revenue.  If you sell Bitcoin at a profit, you gain revenue.  These are the *primary* ways to create value in the system.

There are a few exceptions to this, and they truly are exceptions:

* Miners create Bitcoin out of nothing - This is true, operating a mining rig has the potential to create a dividend of crypto.  *However* mining isn't free, and costs money to operate, so in effect, mining is still ""buying Bitcoin"".  It's just you're paying for it with electricity, time and other resources that cost money instead of money directly.  If you do it right, you can mine Bitcoin at a rate below the resale value and create a little profit.  But if the resale price of BTC drops, mining becomes a loss leader.  There's not much incentive to mine if you can't sell and cover your expenses (this becomes more important when we examine how the Ponzi scheme collapses).

* Miners (those who manage the blockchain) get fees for handling transactions - This is similar to basic mining, and supposedly once all the supply of Bitcoin is mined, miners will be motivated to continue operating their networks in return for transaction fees.   This is still consuming resources you have to pay for, in return for getting crypto.  So you're still ""buying"" it.  

In short, all crypto valuation comes from those who buy in later.   Crypto by itself does not create value.  The only value attributed to crypto is (primarily) by popularity (supply &amp; demand) and cost to service.  

**Use-Case Example**:

Person A decides to acquire some Bitcoin.  The market price is, say, $30,000/BTC.   Person A sets up an account at an exchange or finds someone willing to sell them 1BTC for $30kUSD.  Assuming the transaction goes down properly (which shouldn't always be assumed) and assuming there are no other fees (which again, is unlikely but for the sake of this example we'll keep things simple).  Person A now has 1BTC and Person B has $30k and sold their 1BTC.

Person A is now the ""later investor"".  Person B is the ""earlier investor"" and got paid by the later investor.  That's the *only* way people typically profit from crypto.

Now, Person A looks at the price of bitcoin and it says on some web site the price is now $40k/BTC.   Person A *thinks* they're up $10k.  But in reality, Person A still has $0.   This is where the principal: *Not your fiat, not your value* comes into play.  It's not any different from one of Bernie Madhoff's clients seeing a monthly statement showing their portfolio is worth $40k.  Until they cash out.  IF they can cash out, they don't have that $40k.

If Person A wants to see a profit, they have to sell their 1BTC.  They hear this is relatively easy to do.  And depending upon the health of the exchange and the network, it may not be a problem to sell and collect your profit, but again, when you do that, now there's a Person C, who paid $10k more, and has to find Person D before they can see a return.

This cycle is supposed to continue indefinitely, but can you see that it's mathematically impossible for that to happen?  Eventually you run out of people or money.  And if more people want to sell than want to buy, the price of BTC drops, then more people lose their money -- but actually they already lost their money, they just don't know it yet because they couldn't find a ""greater fool"" (later investor"") to pay more.

#[PONZI ELEMENT] A scheme that requires constant recruitment of new buyers in order to sustain itself

Which brings us to this element.   Bitcoin really only works if its price continues to go up.  Since it has no other utility (unlike stocks which can create value, unlike real estate which can be used or rented out, unlike gold which can be worn or used in industrial applications), crypto has no use other than to be held until traded.  Because of this, the crypto as an investment model will begin to collapse if it doesn't continually increase in price.  If the market drops or stagnates, people will want to pull their investments out.  But because of the growth curve and previous investors taking their cash out, there's only a limited amount of liquidity in the market.  Just like in any other Ponzi scheme, if too many investors try to cash out, the whole scheme collapses.  There isn't enough money to even a fraction of the people in the scheme -- the extent of how bad it is depends upon how big the payouts were to the early investors.  All Ponzi schemes work this way, and this is how Bitcoin works too.

It's no secret how obsessive crypto enthusiasts are.  They know, they have to get more people to ""invest"".  It's the *only* way they see a profit.  The later you get in, the more people need to buy in, higher after you.  If this doesn't happen, we get to our last element:

#[PONZI ELEMENT] Does The Market Collapse If There Isn't Constant Growth?

As mentioned, the only way to create revenue from crypto is to sell it to someone later, for more.  This model requires a constant influx of new buyers.

What happens when we run out of new buyers?

The price stagnates.   If everybody who is holding crypto still decides they won't sell, the market could just sit there.  But that's unlikely.  

Imagine if Bernie Madhoff told clients the returns weren't there?  How long do you think his clients would keep their money in their accounts?  At some point they'd want it back.  If there is no growth, there's no incentive for anybody to be ""invested"" in the scheme.

The problem is, everybody who's been paid already has taken the liquidity out of the market.   So there isn't enough money to pay the people who might want to cash out.  

That's when the house of cards crumbles.

And obviously, with Bitcoin just like with all Ponzi schemes, the people who bought in later, lost the most.   It's possible early adopters could have made out like bandits.   Although in the crypto space, there's an even more common reaction:  [Exit Scams](https://cryptosec.info/exit-scams/).

In the crypto world, it's a lot easier to abscond with everybody's money than it is in the traditional financial world.  That's due to the unique characteristics of crypto being able to be instantly transferred anywhere in the world.  So rather than be outed as a Ponzi, most of the existing crypto-based Ponzis were characterized merely as ""fraud"" with people either stealing money and disappearing, or in some cases [faking their own deaths](https://www.businessinsider.com/gerald-cotten-quadriga-cx-lawyer-letter-faked-death-2019-12) or [claiming they were hacked](https://selfkey.org/list-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks/).  Either way, it's a convenient, efficient way to shut down the Ponzi scheme and avoid getting caught.


#Summary: Crypto as an investment 'ticks all the boxes' matching a Ponzi, but as long as ""number go up"" most people, most journalists, most media, and most enforcement agencies, like in the past with similar schemes, won't acknowledge what's really going on.

Time will tell.   Time is the enemy for these things.

Bernie Madhoff's scheme lasted longer than Bitcoin so far.   Just because it hasn't collapsed yet, doesn't mean it won't.

Invest if you want, but know the risks.  Know the ""math"" too."

Curve is an increasingly popular finance company founded in the UK offering various prepaid debit cards. An interesting thing about the Curve Card is that it allows you spend money from various Bank Accounts when you connect them to the app.

In addition to that, it carries benefits which are much better than a typical bank account such as cheap foreign ATM withdrawals (with your first £200 being completely free) and extremely cheap foreign spending when using the card.

I have had my curve card and account with them now for almost 2 years and I am pretty knowledgeable about how the card works, referral bonuses etc.

Curve still have their £5/5 EUR referral bonus offer with their free debit card when you sign up with a referral code. In addition to this, I am also offering £10/10 EUR paid through Paypal upon completion of the offer.

Here are the steps to follow below...

**Step by Step Guide**

1. Comment $bid below and PM me for my referral code
2. Register and verify your identity
3. Link your bank card and make 3 curve card transactions totalling £20 within 21 days
4. You will then instantly see £5/5 EUR added to your account
5. Then, within 14 days the other referral bonus will be received
6. Once you have completed all the steps above, PM me and I will send you the remaining £10

Always feel free to message me if you have any questions on the offer and I will be happy to help!"

I was wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they began the Novel Coronavirus narrative and started in with 15 days to slow the curve, I really didn’t think humanity would be dumb enough to buy it.  I was wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they announced the vaccine, developed in a few months, skipping animal testing, and using a new technology that isn’t really a vaccine, I thought maybe humanity won’t be dumb enough to take it.  I was wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;Peter Schiff, who I’m pretty was dumb enough to take the vaccine, says the markets just haven’t figured out that inflation isn’t transitory yet.  Give it more time.  They will, and when they do, gold and silver are going to the moon.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know there’s plenty of evidence that silver and gold are completely manipulated.  The LBMA accidental miscount that coincided with the mass buying of SLV at the start of the silver squeeze seems obvious to me, especially when combined with the CFTC’s “tamp down” statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;But… there’s one thing that isn’t reconciling with the notion that the Fed, thru it’s banks, is creating dollars out of thin air to intentionally short paper futures contracts and keep the prices of gold and silver artificially low, in an effort to make the dollar look better.  
&gt;  
&gt;When people like myself see this inflation coming, we don’t only buy physical.  We also buy miners.  If we are right in our theory that gold and silver prices are being kept artificially low thru shorting, then shouldn’t we also conclude that the miners would also have to be kept artificially low thru shorting as well?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yahoo Finance shows that only 15 million shares are short on Barrick, out of 1.7 billion shares outstanding.  
&gt;  
&gt;Personally, I trust Yahoo as far as I can throw it, but if they are reporting Barrick’s short interest honestly, what does that mean for our theory that gold and silver prices should be much higher were it not for manipulation?  If Yahoo isn’t lying to us about the short interest in Barrick, why hasn’t the stock taken off despite gold and silver stagnating?"

Hey guys, I’m 0xViper, lead dev &amp; founder of Viper. VenomDAO is intended to be a multi-product cross-chain protocol

We’re currently on Harmony and we launched March 8th when we launched ViperSwap - one of the first DEX:es on Harmony, the first one with incentives/farming on Harmony

1)So what’s new ? 
What are you personally currently working on ??

ANS: We’re still very focused on our DEX but hoping to start working on additional products very soon. Looking forward to Chainlink finally launching on Harmony Mainnet, something that can enable a lot of new applications we want to build

2)Are you worried that (as cool as it is) that the name Viper will limit the marketability of the Dex as you try to expand to more mainstream audiences? It's a very agressive and masculine name.

ANS: I didn’t really pay that much attention to it when the product was initially launched. I wanted something that wasn’t a food item and I played around with a few different concepts. I liked Viper and the potential branding for it, so I just went with it

3) Sounds very exciting - we’re all looking forward to that :) I can’t wait to see what comes next …..

ANS: It’s very exciting times - Sushi rolling out more products on Harmony will definitively bring more attention to Harmony as a DeFi platform. It also means that the other dApp devs (like us) will have to bring our A game 😛

4) Yeah that I like Yet I have no doubt you guys will bring your A game ! Anything “secret” you can share with us ??

ANS: NA 

5) Viper is de-fi project with a limited amount of supply. Hence, what kind of improvements may on the table to incentive the usage of Viper?

ANS: We’re currently in the beginning of our “Snake Month” where emissions are ramping up and will finally reach 128x - so there will be plenty of incentives during snake month for new participants to provide liquidity

6) @zeroxViper  Since including TokenJenny, Does VIPER see itself acting as a kind of stock exchange for Harmony ONE based projects? where new project will launch and sell DAO on Viper? and how could validation that these tokens are who they say they are? (because anyone can create any token w/ any token Handle)...

ANS: We’re decentralized and permissionless - anyone can come and build and list their tokens on our DEX.

TokenJenny is a fantastic product. It’s truly amazing seeing the creatitivity that gets unlocked by a tool like TokenJenny, paired with a permissionless DEX on a 2-second finality, fast &amp; low cost chain 🙂

7) @zeroxViper is there an ETA for venom DAOs next product?

ANS: Not an official ETA unfortunately. Make sure to follow our announcement channels for more details, we’ll post there

8) still much more to innovate on stablecoins and cross-chain liquidity. i really like the projects liquidty and frax. you guys?

ANS: Frax has proven to be very reliable, their team seems to be top notch.  What’s interesting is that Iron Finance (on Polygon) was almost a 1:1 fork of Frax yet things turned out the way they did.

Algo/partially collateralized stable coins are difficult to get right. We’re actively looking into multiple approaches for it.

Personally I like OUSD’s approach (even though they initially got exploited due to a re-entrancy attack) - they generate ROI using AAVE, Compound and Curve and holders supply will automatically get inflated in relation to the generated yield based on the original deposits


9) really glad you are on top of all good defi projects. our p-ops rachit is looking into liquidity as well. let’s chat and see how to bring all to one

ANS: Sure thing

10) @zeroxViper I've heard Terra usd has done well have you looked into their stable coin model

ANS: That’s also a very decent team &amp; product, and yeah, also looking into their approach

11) @zeroxViper how large is the development team? Are you plannt to bring more folks on?

ANS: Right now I’m the main developer, actively looking to hire more. It’ll be one of the main priorities going forward

12) so hard to get security and economics incentives right. we are engaging the firm slowmist and other security researchers on retainer. anything else we can help on that?

ANS: Sure, we can have a discussion about it and discuss some ideas 🙂

13) @zeroxViper I've heard rumors that you are a blockchain developer by trade, if it's true has that helped you in anyway to develop viperswap?

ANS: Yep, I’ve been doing dev stuff in the blockchain space for a couple of years. Been doing all kinds of things, building dApps and writing Solidity has been a part of that. So it has for sure been benficial when it came to launching ViperSwap etc

14) @zeroxViper What is viper/venomdaos main focus or focuses right now?

ANS: Lately we’ve been focusing on sorting out relevant data and API:s for certain platforms to use for listing our DEX and our staking pools/farms.

We’ll circle back to the DEX very soon again and the new features that will be coming to it.

15) Do you agree that Venom has early adopter advantage by using Harmony ?

@zeroxViper

ANS: Yes - a part of the reason for launching on Harmony first was the potential for getting a first-mover advantage. Not sure how much it has actually helped, but I saw an opportunity and wanted to capitalize on it

16) Anything in the talks for a Sushi x Viper Collab?

ANS: Not right now, but we’re obviously open to it 🙂

17) @zeroxViper What is the most exciting thing, from the dev team's perspective, for the future of Viper, +harmony, +blockchain?

ANS: I’m actually very excited about the Harmony x Sushi partnership - it’s one of the things Harmony needed to do to establish itself as a DeFi platform.

Sushi is a super well known brand in DeFi and that partnership will probably bring a lot of new eyeballs and TVL to Harmony. All DEX:es on Harmony will benefit from this

Stephen Tse adds: “indeed. still much more defi innovations (fixed income products, nft collaterals, regional stablecoins…) to come. it’s open dev so everyone benefits from connecting to each other. stay close to the good builders – it’s the people that matter over long term”

DeFi is still in it’s initial stages. We’ll probably see a merger of DeFi, Fintech and Cross-border remittances over the coming years. So much stuff will be built, it’s going to be amazing"

We’re currently on Harmony and we launched March 8th when we launched ViperSwap - one of the first DEX:es on Harmony, the first one with incentives/farming on Harmony.

***stephen tse | harmony***

***Absolutely! many more defi logos to build on.***

***Bernhard***

***Any hints which products this might be?***

0xViper

I’m a DeFi degenerate myself and I started out with stable coins when I was a DeFi virgin last summer. I want to build products similar to Aave/Compound &amp; Curve - but whichever comes first and when I can’t say right now.

***stephen tse | harmony***

***So glad to hear! yes, lots of middlewares, analytics, cross-chain api, api node scaling… to be done, hence the opportunities of 10 dao .Look forward to integrating viper with 1wallet soon.***

***2bit***

***What is the most exciting thing, from the dev team's perspective, for the future of Viper, +harmony, +blockchain?***

0xViper

I’m actually very excited about the Harmony x Sushi partnership - it’s one of the things Harmony needed to do to establish itself as a DeFi platform.

Sushi is a super well known brand in DeFi and that partnership will probably bring a lot of new eyeballs and TVL to Harmony. All DEX:es on Harmony will benefit from this

***stephen tse | harmony***

***Indeed. still much more defi innovations (fixed income products, nft collaterals, regional stablecoins…) to come. it’s open dev so everyone benefits from connecting to each other. stay close to the good builders – it’s the people that matter over long term***

0xViper

DeFi is still in its initial stages. We’ll probably see a merger of DeFi, Fintech and Cross-border remittance tech over the coming years. So much stuff will be built, it’s going to be amazing.

***CataLyst***

***Do you agree that Venom has early adopter advantage by using Harmony ?***

0xViper

Yes - a part of the reason for launching on Harmony first was the potential for getting a first-mover advantage. Not sure how much it has actually helped, but I saw an opportunity and wanted to capitalize on it

***James***

***Anything in the talks for a Sushi x Viper Collab?***

0xViper

Not right now, but we’re obviously open to it 🙂

***James***

***What is your favorite part about viper/venomdao?***

0xViper

I gotta say the permisionless and unrestricted creativity that is enabled by TokenJenny, Viper and Harmony.

Anyone can create a token, pool it on Viper and everyone can trade said token - all while settling near instantaneous transactions onchain and paying almost no transaction fees for it.

***2bit***

***This is also what is most exciting for me, The idea of future projects/companies listing their custom token on the DEX and basically ICO-ing their DAO... would that work how I think it would? If people got behind the brand that was building it? or am i missing something?***

**0xViper**

We are actively looking into expanding the amount of features that new tokens can utilize on the DEX to promote their tokens/projects. PCS Syrup-style pools is something we’ve been thinking about for a while, and it’d be a pretty logical feature to introduce on the DEX

**Avi**

**Viper Boss, any plans to add more guides for people who create tokens, like what should be the percentage they should put in one exchange, what might be a good starting price etc**

We’re working on adding more content - we’ve recently switched over to using a Medium publication ([https://medium.com/venomdao](https://medium.com/venomdao)) where we’ll post a lot of general DeFi content about swapping, LP:ing, bridging etc.

A [Harmony&lt;&gt;BSC bridge video](https://youtu.be/KRJsokZZ-2M) was added just a couple of days ago.

***With the addition of the new beta explorer do you believe harmony is now on par with other leading protocols in terms of contract and transaction visiblity***

0xViper

The new explorer is an improvement - but personally I’ve got a soft spot for Etherscan-style explorers. I personally keep the majority of my DeFi funds on chains with Etherscan-style explorers. And I’m guessing a lot of other DeFi participants are feeling the same way.

I guess it has become so intertwined with DeFi at this stage people just kinda expect Etherscan explorers when it comes to DeFi.

The new explorer is for sure an improvement, but personally hoping for an Etherscan-style explorer sometime in the future.

***is there any plans to make the UI show rug pull warning for tokens or whale warning, so new users dont get into unnecessary coins and troubles 😅***

0xViper

There are already warnings in the UI when adding custom tokens - so that should hopefully inform some users about the potential risks.

But adding extra labels on top off that (for e.g. whale alerts) could be an option. We’re currently pulling rich list/holder data for a lot of tokens so technically it can be done.

***Coach Kent***

***Have you given more thought into hosting your own rpc for viperswap?***

0xViper

We are actually hosting RPC:s, but currently only used for internal testing while we stress test them and see how reliable they are. As soon as they seem to hold up to certain standards we’ll announce them.

***2bit***

***Is there any chance that the team could work with the team over at RugDoc.io ? They're doing great work protecting people by manually reviewing contracts but currently they haven't started focusing on Harmony DEX's yet.***

0xViper

Yep, Rugdoc is something we’re looking into. No ETA tho.

***kratos.crazy.one***

***Thank you 0xViper, great to have you here and thanks for sharing insights, keep up the great work. 💝***

Thanks for having us guys - it was a pleasure 🙂"
Coinbase CEO: We Will List All “Legal” Cryptocurrencies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/oa3w9y/coinbase_ceo_we_will_list_all_legal/,lucy41092,1,2021-06-29 16:11:09,0,/r/CryptoMoon/comments/oa3w9y/coinbase_ceo_we_will_list_all_legal/,NaN,"# Coinbase CEO: We will list all “legal” cryptocurrencies

**Brian Armstrong**, CEO of **Coinbase**, said that the exchange plans to list every **“legitimate”** cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, he also added that **Coinbase** does not want any cryptocurrencies to receive special treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO also suggested that in the future **Coinbase** will introduce a way for users to rate or rate each cryptocurrency.  In theory, this provides more information to other users, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

 This exchange has certainly picked up the pace when it comes to listing new cryptocurrencies.  In 2017, **Coinbase** only offered 4 cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

&amp;#x200B;

 At the time, the **Coinbase** listing was seen as a momentous occasion.  The price of a cryptocurrency will often skyrocket when it is announced to be “uploaded” to **Coinbase**.  Many people call this the **“Coinbase Effect”**.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, **Coinbase** exchange has listed 63 cryptocurrencies, ranging from stablecoins like Tether (USDT) to well-known coins like Cardano (ADA).  There are even lesser-known coins like NKN (NKN) – which is ranked 166 on **CoinMarketCap.**

&amp;#x200B;

 In January 2021, **Coinbase** said it was looking at 44 cryptocurrencies that it could add to its listing.  This category currently adds a few names, including Ankr (ANKR), Curve (CRV) and Skale (SKL).

&amp;#x200B;

 On June 26, the leading US cryptocurrency exchange continued to add more tokens to its listing, such as Bonded Finance (BOND), Quant (QNT) and Livepeer (LPT).  However, there are still thousands of other tokens on the market.  Therefore, there is still a long way to go for **Coinbase** to list every cryptocurrency."

SeaScape Info,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScavengerGroup/comments/oa45wj/seascape_info/,marklm725,1,2021-06-29 16:33:41,0,/r/CryptoScavengerGroup/comments/oa45wj/seascape_info/,NaN,"👉Seascape is a gaming platform using gamification, DeFi, and of course, NFTs to create an incentivized ecosystem for gamers, developers, and influencers to come together and create this ecosystem of value within gaming. 

&amp;#x200B;

👉The platform will enable the production of really awesome blockchain-based games with rewards for gamers paid out either in the native Seascape token, CWS, or NFTs.

&amp;#x200B;

🔥KEY FEATURES

&amp;#x200B;

✅Game Chains - Any game released on the Seascape Platform will have the option to create their own blockchain with its own set of rules.

&amp;#x200B;

✅Cross Chain Bridge - Cross-chain interoperability solution with heavy focus on games. Keep all assets connected to major chains such as Ethereum and Algorand. 

&amp;#x200B;

✅NFT &amp; Token DEX - Decentralized cross-chain bonding curve market to allow seemless price discovery of digital assets for users and projects.

&amp;#x200B;

✅NFT Standard - The ultimate cross-chain NFT standard based on Substrate. Designed to optimize usage, trading and gamified DeFi features.

&amp;#x200B;

✅Game Store - User-facing game store built with DeFi in mind. Any user can serve as a PoS validator. Monthly gamepasses for users, no fees for game devs. 

&amp;#x200B;

✅DeFI Gamified - Implement gamified aspects of DeFi and traditional finance into games as part of core gameplay. In-game staking, CDP's and more! 

&amp;#x200B;

🔥CROWNS

&amp;#x200B;

💎Crowns Token - Crowns is a token designed to reward all key stakeholders of the gaming ecosystem. It will be introduced via BLOCKLORDS, as a way to reward all players who prove themselves worthy. This token will be the way for most players to experience the power of DeFi gaming in a fun, user-friendly way. Various ways to stake, borrow, and utilize Crowns will be released periodically to players as the ecosystem grows.

&amp;#x200B;

💎PayWave - Every player who owns Crowns will receive PayWave drop. The Paywave supply is taken entirely from the spent amounts of tokens in the Seascape Network ecosystem and game platform. This Paywave function makes it easy to create a passive way to increase stacks of Crowns holders, further pushing growth of its community.

BLOCKLORDS, Seascape’s flagship game, is serving as the proof of concept for all of these features, with examples being Title Airdrops,  Crowns Staking, Item CDPs, as well as a brand-new concept: the Player Created Coin (PCC) that clever players will be able to implement when they want to create their own in-game currency. These are all ways for the players to not only increase their in-game power, but also earn real profits while they have fun with the game.

The first step in making NFTs a truly vital part of the DeFi economy is to ensure that they can generate earnings for their holders. With the possibility of collateralizing NFTs to take out debt, renting them out for set or variable rates, and trading them on an open exchange, the potential use cases within BLOCKLORDS and future games are endless.
