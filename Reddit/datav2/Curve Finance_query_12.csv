"Breaking down 'to good to be true' Defi rates – where's the money from, is it sustainable, and what's the catch?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5qjk5/breaking_down_to_good_to_be_true_defi_rates/,M00OSE,1,2021-12-01 00:05:54,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5qjk5/breaking_down_to_good_to_be_true_defi_rates/,MARKETS,"Money doesn't just grow on ~~trees~~ blockchains, not even *magic internet money*. And yet some defi applications are offering astronomical rates. For this post, I'll break down three common types of protocols and answer the following questions: *where's the money from? Is it sustainable? And what's the catch?*

# Lending and Borrowing

Examples; Aave, Anchor, Geist, Solend

Typical rates: Less than 10% net

**Where's the money from?** Similar to a bank, users deposit money into the protocol, which is then used by borrowers. To borrow money, users have to pay an interest rate and also deposit collateral into the protocol. The main source of revenue is sourced from the interest borrowers have to pay. Some protocols also stake the collateral that users deposit and earn extra income from that.

**Is it sustainable?** Most lending rates aren't actually that high (2% to 20%) and are usually balanced out by the borrowing rates at an equivalent rate. So the main question here is, *why are people lending/borrowing?*

Beyond earning deposit fees, people lend because the majority of defi requires users to hold assets that they would otherwise not want to hold.  If a user wanted to use defi while holding the assets that they prefer to hold like BTC and ETH, they would deposit their assets as collateral and borrow against it.

People borrow because they can earn a yield higher than the rate they're paying to borrow. You could for example, borrow a stablecoin at a 10% borrow rate and then deposit the borrowed funds into a stablecoin liquidity pool that earns you 20%. You keep the extra 10%.

**What's the catch?** If you're not borrowing, the rates are oftentimes very low and you're likely better off staking an asset than lending or even using Cefi. For example, the largest lending/borrowing dapps are Aave, Compound, or Cream and they only offer **&lt;3%** for ETH whereas ETH Cefi rates are **\~6%**.

If you are borrowing, there's no bank to hold your hand and no bailouts. If your collateral falls below a certain amount, the protocols deems you ineligible to pay off your loan and you get liquidated. This can happen if the market falls and you're not watching your funds. However, there are protocols that now allow for liquidity-free lending/borrow. 

# Liquidity Pools (LPs)

Examples: Uniswap, Curve, Serum, Raydium, TraderJoe, SpookySwap, Quickswap

Typical rates: 20% to 40% net (for stablecoins, BTC, and ETH)

**Where's the money from?** When you use decentralize exchanges (dexes), there are liquidity provider fees that typically charge 0.25% of trades. The trading fee is the main source of income for LPs.

**Is it sustainable?** At its current state, most LPs are not sustainable. While the demand for LPs like ETH-DAI is pretty straightforward, demand for LPs with, sometimes obscure, protocol or farm tokens are not as clear. Oftentimes, they rely on circular dependencies, ie *finance for the sake of finance.*

As an example, let's take a look at how degen yield farming typically happens:

1. Protocols offer a 1,000% rate for FARM-DAI LP providers
2. Higher rates mean higher inflation, which means the value of the FARM token tend to decrease
3. But the high rate creates demand for the FARM token as users have to buy FARM to join the LP
4. The high demand pumps the price of the FARM token and offsets the high inflation
5. But as the LP participants grow, the rates decrease
6. Lower rates cause lower demand, which means prices are no longer getting pumped
7. At some point, the farm reaches a stage where both prices and rates are going down
8. And when that happens, degens who are merely looking for quick money, tend to leave
9. More and more people leaving and selling the token causes the price to drop

You can actually visualize this bubble-esque patterns in [charts](https://imgur.com/a/2oVulQY) for a number of farm tokens. Prices spike early making the LP seem more profitable than it actually is and then high inflation does its thing to prices slowly but surely fall.

Protocols can avoid this by providing a legitimate use case for the FARM token beyond just earning a high yield. For pure LP protocols, the use cases are typically governance, which is not very appealing for retail who couldn't care any less about how some protocols are governed.

**What's the catch? E**ven if the LP rates are very high, a drastic enough drop in price can offset the gains earned from the reward rate. This is especially true for users who were late and were not able to accumulate the rewards. This is why it's often recommended to look into the price action and avoid making decisions based off of rates alone.

LPs, specifically low liquidity ones, are also especially vulnerable to whales who can often cause spikes–both in the upside, when buying, and the downside, when selling. And large spikes can cause a domino effect of mass selling and whoever is left holding the bag gets rekt.

Beyond this, impermanent loss (IP) is the most obvious catch. Participating in LPs typically requires you to split your assets meaning you may be exposed to undesired price action. But there are several ways to avoid or mitigate IP such as participating in stablecoin LPs or LPs with relatively low volatility, ie BTC or ETH. In addition, there's a lot of work going into new protocols to limit the impact of impermanent loss.

# Reserve Currencies

Examples: Olympus DAO, Wonderland, KlimaDAO

Typical rates: 6,000% to 8,000% (current)

**Where's the money from?** Reserve currencies are brought at a premium that's worth several magnitudes (8-10x) more than the intrinsic value of the token. New tokens are minted at an extremely high rate and then distributed as a reward to stakers. A combination of selling at a high premium and minting at a high rate leads to the high APYs. 

But, similar to how LPs work, high distribution –&gt; high inflation –&gt; lower prices. At the same time, high rates –&gt; high participation –&gt; lower rates. The expectation is for both rewards to slowly decrease to a target rate of 1,000%. The goal is to accumulate long-term participants because long time horizons would ensure that staking rewards eventually offsets price action.

**Is it sustainable?** Under the hood, the economics are designed similar to LPs. But LPs are often subject to the notion of *finance for the sake of finance* because the only product is often the high yields offered. Reserve currencies have a secondary revenue generating product: bonds, which are means for protocols to accumulate their own liquidity. So the question to be asked here is *why is there a demand for bonds?* 

Bonds allow for protocol-owned liquidity, seeking to address the issues that often makes LPs unsustainable. Olympus does not have to pay out high farming rewards to incentivize liquidityproviders a.k.a renting liquidity.

* Olympus guarantees the market that the liquidity is always there to facilitatesell or buy transaction.
* By being the largest LP (liquidity provider), it earns most of the LP fees whichrepresents another source of income to the treasury.
* All POL can be used to back OHM. The LP tokens are marked down to their risk-freevalue for this purpose. You can read more about the rationale behind this in this"

Advice on first year as a quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/r603bo/advice_on_first_year_as_a_quant/,fueledby21airplanes,1,2021-12-01 07:07:41,9,/r/quant/comments/r603bo/advice_on_first_year_as_a_quant/,NaN,"Hi, so I'm currently a senior in university, and I just signed an offer with a top-tier quant firm  (think like js/hrt/5r/citsec/optiver etc). And I'm not going to lie, I'm kind of dumbfounded. I have zero prior trading experience with any of my past internships (all data science / math research  / ML) and I also do NOT to go one of the HYPSM schools. My GPA is decent but far from perfect due to choosing some very hard classes (took grad analysis as a sophomore for example), as well as COVID and family issues taking a toll on my mental health. But I guess I did well enough on the interview questions they asked me and probability / game theory / algos come very naturally to me, so I got an offer.

So anyways I'm very excited, and have talked to several of my future co-workers who all seem to love their jobs, but I'm definitely a bit nervous. Everyone seems to have done some previous prestigious internship, either with this firm or elsewhere, and also be from harvard/yale/princeton/mit/etc. I know one of the people incoming in my full-time class, and his resume seems to just like dwarf me in every way. So I'm definitely a bit nervous. I've been told that the transition to full-time is a big learning curve for everyone, so I shouldn't be too worried about prior experience, but it still feels like a lot. Does anyone who has worked in the field have any advice about their first few years? Additionally, are there any particular resources for finance background / developing trading algos / just general quant strategies etc that you think I should read? Because I know very little about finance, just basic market-making, options theory, and some stuff like mean reversion / momentum. I have theoretical background though with stuff like time-series analysis, brownian motion, stochastic calculus, and machine learning though (more from the mathematical side than implementation though)."
State of DeFi: Part II,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6127q/state_of_defi_part_ii/,Throwaway410811,1,2021-12-01 07:55:13,5,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6127q/state_of_defi_part_ii/,ANALYSIS,"Before I begin I want to remind you (and hype myself up lol) for my last post from 3 months ago, where I predicted the avalanche eco-system would see [higher than anticipated growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pbqwum/we_need_to_discuss_the_current_state_of_defi/). If someone acted on that advice, their avalanche bag would have tripled at it's peek. Not bad for 3 months! Enough patting myself on the back. Warning: ETH maxis will hate this post more than they currently hate Avalanche.

 My Analysis was based on both decentralization and incentives. Those two predict that quality of Dapps that will deploy on an EVM smart chain and the amount of money that will enter the network, which ultimately leads to network effects and predicts medium term growth. In those three months we saw both Fantom and Avalanche have impressive peaks. While I do think, they will hit higher highs in the next 3-6 months, I don't think they will be offering the top tier risk adjusted return anymore (although I do expect AVAX to go into the top 7 one day). This is similar to how Polygon and BSC no longer have the best returns. The three popular candidates for next high growth EVM compatible chain are [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (cronos), Harmony(One) and Moonriver. I will be arguing that Moonriver is the best bet to take in todays market.

Moonriver is an EVM compatible chain built on Kusama network. Kusama is the canary network for polkadot. This means it is the more agile, innovative developer chain compared to its cousin polkadot. It's for developers who want to iterate and quickly evolve based on the rapidly changing needs of it's customers and test new ideas. For example there's no para auctions process on this cousin network. It's also where we will expect ideas to be tested before they are deployed on Polkadot. And I think we're going to soon see the first important innovative idea very soon.

A couple months ago LIDO and Moonbeam (the polkadot version of Moonriver on Kusuma) announced they were working together to [bring staked polkadot/ Kusuma onto the respective  chains](https://moonbeam.network/announcements/moonbeam-lido-liquid-staking/).  They stated that Lido is expected to deploy to Moonriver later this year, and only once proven to work will it be deployed on Moon Beam. I think this will set off a new incentive program on the moon river chain, and eventually a bigger Moon Beam incentive program. Think about it, why would Moonriver provide incentives to Defi users, if those who support polkadots vision (the stakers!) aren't able to cash in on them. 

And guess what? Moon Beam recently won its parachain spot in auction, so it's time for the next part of the plan; To prepare Moon River for rapid growth and incentives and test their vision. Behind the scenes Moon river is already starting this! They tweeted a minor incentive program with Impermax Finance (underrated protocol btw) that will incentivize LP leveraging. After looking through the discords it looks like Impermax will be adding more leverageable LP's opportunities soon. I'm predicting these have to do with staked Kusuma. When those are added we might expect a lot of liquidity entering the chain and setting off a minor incentive program. You might be wondering where are the AAVE, CURVE and Blue chip Dapp incentives? I think those will be saved for the Polkadot and Moorbeam main launch. Moonriver/ Kusma is more experiemental so we should expect smaller dapps to be invovled.

At a macro level, this might have huge implications. People complain about EVM ""ETH killers""  chains being centralized, VC coin dumping chains. I don't usually agree with those maxi argument, but with Kusama and Polkadot, those arguments have ZERO validity. Gavin Woods literally coded ethereum and his vision with polkadot is all about decentralization. If Moonriver and Moonbeam incentivize use, and they are successful, I think we have our first real problem for Ethereum. Binance, Solana, and Avalanche were just tests for what might be to come.

TLDR; Moonriver incentives soon, Moonbeam incentives a bit later if everything works out. Timelines depends on when LIDO staked DOT and KUSUMA are on chain kickstarting incentives. Get Ready Folks!"

For most farms, specifically ""degen farms"", prices spike early making the LP seem more profitable than it actually is and then high inflation does its thing to prices slowly but surely fall. Most users enter and leave farms within 3 days to capture the parabolic price action and high rewards. 

Protocols can avoid this by providing a legitimate use case for the FARM token beyond just earning a high yield. For pure LP protocols, the use cases are typically governance, which is not very appealing for retail who couldn't care any less about how some protocols are governed.

Reserve currencies have a secondary revenue generating product: bonds, which are means for protocols to accumulate their own liquidity. So the question to be asked here is *why is there a demand for bonds?*

Bonds allow for protocol-owned liquidity, seeking to address the aforementioned issues that often make LPs unsustainable. Instead of protocols renting liquidity to mercenary users who come and go looking for the highest yields, bonding allows protocols to own their own liquidity and provide a sense of stability. This reduces the need for protocols to constantly offer unsustainably high rates in order to incentivize users to participate in their LP. In addition, it allows protocols to earn their own LP fees, which can give them another source of revenue.

**What's the catch?** LP protocols actually incur some costs in exchange for partnering with the bonding program of a reserve currency protocol. And while reserve protocols offer users with more incentives to become long-term participants, they can still always exit and sell the LPs. This may the case during volatile swings.

On the user end, buying bonds usually isn't worth it primarily because reserve protocols typically requires users to wait a certain interval (3-7 days, etc.) while holding the LPs. This presents some risks because the LPs can drop in value and, thus, offset the discounts. Additionally, if users buy the reserve currency token directly, they can immediately maximize the staking yields, which are also often higher than the discounts.

Overall, the long-term utility of the reserve protocol hinges on the demand for bonds. Most reserve currencies are still very new so only time will tell moving forward. Beyond questioning the bonds, reserve currencies are still vulnerable to bank runs, however these risks are designed to be mitigated with how the protocol works.

I know this was a long post so kudos to anyone who managed to read all throughout. These are not the only types of protocols available in defi, there are tons more that are either stark variations or completely unique. I hope you all learned something!"

People borrow because they can earn a yield higher than the rate they're paying to borrow. You could for example, borrow a stablecoin at a 10% borrow rate and then deposit the borrowed funds into a stablecoin liquidity pool that earns you 20%. You keep the extra 10%.

**What's the catch?** If you're not borrowing, the rates are oftentimes very low and you're likely better off staking an asset than lending or even using Cefi. For example, the largest lending/borrowing dapps are Aave, Compound, or Cream and they only offer **&lt;3%** for ETH whereas ETH Cefi rates are **\~6%**.

If you are borrowing, there's no bank to hold your hand and no bailouts. If your collateral falls below a certain amount, the protocols deems you ineligible to pay off your loan and you get liquidated. This can happen if the market falls and you're not watching your funds. However, there are protocols that now allow for liquidity-free lending/borrow.

# Liquidity Pools (LPs)

Examples: Uniswap, Curve, Serum, Raydium, TraderJoe, SpookySwap, Quickswap

Typical rates: 20% to 40% net (for stablecoins, BTC, and ETH)

**Where's the money from?** When you use decentralize exchanges (dexes), there are liquidity provider fees that typically charge 0.25% of trades. The trading fee is the main source of income for LPs.

**Is it sustainable?** At its current state, most LPs are not sustainable. While the demand for LPs like ETH-DAI is pretty straightforward, demand for LPs with, sometimes obscure, protocol or farm tokens are not as clear. Oftentimes, they rely on circular dependencies, ie *finance for the sake of finance.*

As an example, let's take a look at how degen yield farming typically happens:

1. Protocols offer a 1,000% rate for FARM-DAI LP providers
2. Higher rates mean higher inflation, which means the value of the FARM token tend to decrease
3. But the high rate creates demand for the FARM token as users have to buy FARM to join the LP
4. The high demand pumps the price of the FARM token and offsets the high inflation
5. But as the LP participants grow, the rates decrease
6. Lower rates cause lower demand, which means prices are no longer getting pumped
7. At some point, the farm reaches a stage where both prices and rates are going down
8. And when that happens, degens who are merely looking for quick money, tend to leave
9. More and more people leaving and selling the token causes the price to drop

For most farms, specifically ""degen farms"", prices spike early making the LP seem more profitable than it actually is and then high inflation does its thing to prices slowly but surely fall. Most users enter and leave farms within 3 days to capture the parabolic price action and high rewards.

Protocols can avoid this by providing a legitimate use case for the FARM token beyond just earning a high yield. For pure LP protocols, the use cases are typically governance, which is not very appealing for retail who couldn't care any less about how some protocols are governed.

**What's the catch?** Even if the LP rates are very high, a drastic enough drop in price can offset the gains earned from the reward rate. This is especially true for users who were late and were not able to accumulate the rewards. This is why it's often recommended to look into the price action and avoid making decisions based off of rates alone.

LPs, specifically low liquidity ones, are also especially vulnerable to whales who can often cause spikes–both in the upside, when buying, and the downside, when selling. And large spikes can cause a domino effect of mass selling and whoever is left holding the bag gets rekt.

Beyond this, impermanent loss (IP) is the most obvious catch. Participating in LPs typically requires you to split your assets meaning you may be exposed to undesired price action. But there are several ways to avoid or mitigate IP such as participating in stablecoin LPs or LPs with relatively low volatility, ie BTC or ETH. In addition, there's a lot of work going into new protocols to limit the impact of impermanent loss.

# Reserve Currencies

Examples: Olympus DAO, Wonderland, KlimaDAO

Typical rates: 6,000% to 8,000% (current)

**Where's the money from?** Reserve currencies are brought at a premium that's worth several magnitudes (8-10x) more than the intrinsic value of the token. New tokens are minted at an extremely high rate and then distributed as a reward to stakers. A combination of selling at a high premium and minting at a high rate leads to the high APYs.

But, similar to how LPs work, high distribution –&gt; high inflation –&gt; lower prices. At the same time, high rates –&gt; high participation –&gt; lower rates. The expectation is for both rewards to slowly decrease to a target rate of 1,000%. The goal is to accumulate long-term participants because long time horizons would ensure that staking rewards eventually offsets price action.

**Is it sustainable?** Under the hood, the economics are designed similar to LPs. But LPs are often subject to the notion of *finance for the sake of finance* because the only product is often the high yields offered. Reserve currencies have a secondary revenue generating product: bonds, which are means for protocols to accumulate their own liquidity. So the question to be asked here is *why is there a demand for bonds?*

Bonds allow for protocol-owned liquidity, seeking to address the aforementioned issues that often make LPs unsustainable. Instead of protocols renting liquidity to mercenary users who come and go looking for the highest yields, bonding allows protocols to own their own liquidity and provide a sense of stability. This reduces the need for protocols to constantly offer unsustainably high rates in order to incentivize users to participate in their LP. In addition, it allows protocols to earn their own LP fees, which can give them another source of revenue.

**What's the catch?** LP protocols actually incur some costs in exchange for partnering with the bonding program of a reserve currency protocol. And while reserve protocols offer users with more incentives to become long-term participants, they can still always exit and sell the LPs. This may the case during volatile swings.

On the user end, buying bonds usually isn't worth it primarily because reserve protocols typically requires users to wait a certain interval (3-7 days, etc.) while holding the LPs. This presents some risks because the LPs can drop in value and, thus, offset the discounts. Additionally, if users buy the reserve currency token directly, they can immediately maximize the staking yields, which are also often higher than the discounts.

Overall, the long-term utility of the reserve protocol hinges on the demand for bonds. Most reserve currencies are still very new so only time will tell moving forward. Beyond questioning the bonds, reserve currencies are still vulnerable to bank runs, however these risks are designed to be mitigated with how the protocol works.

I know this was a long post so kudos to anyone who managed to read all throughout. These are not the only types of protocols available in defi, there are tons more that are either stark variations or completely unique. I hope you all learned something!"
Fee confusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r647d0/fee_confusion/,tomholli,1,2021-12-01 10:33:59,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r647d0/fee_confusion/,DISCUSSION,"I an a crypto noob and am a bit confused by the fees. Here is my observation so far. The ETH main net coins are expensive to move and expensive to stake. You have to first approve the staking which costs gas and then you have to stake the coins which costs more gas. Unless you are staking thousands of dollars, it will take many years for earned interest to cover the gas fees. I’ve looked at Yearn finance and Curve as well. 

The BNB smart chain is pretty cheap to move coins around. Staking at pancake.finance is pretty cheap too. However, converting ETH main net coins to smart chain coins is expensive since it takes gas. You’re better off selling your ETH and then buying the BNB afterwards. 

LTC, XLM, BCH, and ADA are also pretty cheap to move. USDT is a bit more expensive to move. 

BTC. It seems like I can move it from Coinbase to another wallet for a low fee. My understanding was that moving it would be very expensive. Why am I not seeing the high fee?

ETH 2.0 will move from proof- of-work to proof-of-stake making the transaction fees less. You won’t have to exchange ETH fro ETH 2.0 to benefit from the lower fees. 

Am I mostly correct? What am I missing? Any other secrets other than wait until night to work with ETH to get lower gas fees (whice doesn’t seem to be all that effective)?"

I'm working on my dissertation for my finance Master's. It isn't due until mid-December, and so I know I have plenty of time but it was so disheartening when I went to tackle it today. Even if I tried to follow Medium or other articles I was still running into issues. I just seemed to have gotten error after error and no clue why or how to sort it out. Maybe I shouldn't rely heavily on other codes and see if I can do my own thing from the ground up. I got as far as downloading the data, but everything I thought I knew about Python just didn't seem to help me. When will I use fuzzbuzz?!

One good thing, I suppose, is I was able to find a script that downloaded the tickers for all the constituent S&amp;P500 stocks so that I don't have to type them all out. 

I don't know. It'll be a learning curve but I'm excited to practise. I really do adore using Python - one of my lecturers has written a MatLab script I can use for the first half of the dissertation (I am doing it on pairs trading) but there's a very large part of me that wants to work this out myself. 

Sorry if this isn't the place, just wanted a little vent.

UPDATE: Started my first real Python project and feeling demoralised

My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/p703r7/started_my_first_real_python_project_today_went/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about starting my dissertation and feeling like crap because I tripped immediately at the first hurdle. 

Well, I hit another brick this week. I learnt a **lot** last (and this) week and continued on with my mission over the past few days. Today I finally got past my issue and the code works! 

The coding portion of my dissertation I have split into six main parts (which are subsequently broken down into smaller parts). I’ve got past the first and second chunks. The third and fourth part will be difficult but the fifth and (especially sixth) parts will be the easiest (typical). 

It’s all coming into place, learning loads as I mentioned and really enjoying it. I wish this time last week I knew where I’d be today. I don’t submit for a few months but honestly with the rest of my qualitative research done, I’m not too concerned about time. 

Famous last words?

Today I submitted the dissertation. When I made the first post, I was terrified of not getting it done. I felt so overwhelmed but the key was to just sit back, methodically work out what I wanted to achieve and set out about it. I think in all it took me a month to code the entire thing. Maybe a touch more. But I comfortably was able to finish the coding part. 

I was able to learn **SO** much. I feel I am 100x the coder I was when I started. I was even able to score a job, where I’m using Python at least 2 times a week and I’m planning on building a code to compare Excel sheets to show me differences in values (I’m given daily reports I have to go through and sometimes numbers/names can change). 

Stack Overflow has become my second most visited website. 

Super happy, super proud. I think the dissertation went great overall and I’m hoping for a great mark honestly. Currently sat drinking a barley wine I brewed back in February for this exact moment. 

Cheers everyone. 

As a bonus question to generate some discussion, I was thinking about this earlier - at what point would you say you “know” a coding language? I’d love to eventually learn C++ once I *learn Python*, but what stage would that be? I guess there’s no real answer but would love to hear some thoughts on it!"

DEXs (decentralized exchanges) have been around for quite some time but really began taking off in 2020 at the start of the DeFi (decentralized finance) boom. But why is this?

For one, DEXs offer a smooth user experience when it comes to trading. Users can also swap between various different tokens on multiple blockchains anonymously through a Web3 wallet. This eliminates the need to undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) verification processes, a central motivation for some in crypto.

**Danaswap** is a new and revolutionary DEX solution. It offers a seamless and efficient mechanism for trading on the Ardana platform. 

In order to better understand how Danaswap fits within the DEX ecosystem, let’s take a deep dive into the product itself and its advanced functionalities before exploring the advantages it has over its largest competitors.

## What is Danaswap?

Danaswap is an AMM (automated market maker) designed to support trading and token swaps within the Ardana ecosystem. It consists of stable, multi-asset pools where users can exchange various stablecoins between other wrapped assets.

Advertisement  

So why is Danaswap so powerful? To begin, it’s built on the Cardano blockchain, which provides extremely high throughput, low trading fees, and powerful scalability, ultimately making the entire user experience far superior to other DEXs. 

Additionally, it provides a wide array of unique features for users, such as:

* Minting various supported stablecoins with seamless swapping between them;
* Receiving a percentage of platform market-making fees for depositing assets into pools;
* Providing a digital Forex market in your back pocket — trade between popular fiat-pegged Ardana stablecoins (dUSD, dEUR, dGBP);
* Earning high-interest rates through decentralized yield farming and lending by depositing supported stablecoins;
* A 50-100x increase in efficiency and cost savings thanks to its invariant curve formula.

The DEX also provides stable liquidity pools, which contain fiat-pegged stablecoins and other popular wrapped tokens that maintain consistent price levels.

Danaswap is the key mechanism to bring Ardana and Cardano to the forefront of blockchain technology, demonstrating the true power and viability of ultra-high speeds and efficiencies for decentralized trading. 

## Danaswap Competitive Advantages

But, what benefits does Danaswap have over other decentralized exchanges?

For one, it’s much faster in terms of throughput and transaction speed, meaning you can facilitate transactions far more efficiently – the multitude of stablecoin options it offers also allows reduces price fluctuations and maintains the value of your assets. 

Additionally, with immense competition emerging in the DeFi space, yield returns have greatly diminished and become less lucrative. Danaswap restores the promise to earn passive income through its pools and staking mechanism, meaning users can generate high yields with confidence.

Given the Cardano blockchain’s eco-friendly design, users can feel confident about reducing their carbon footprint while still experiencing some of the fastest trading speeds at virtually no cost. This is critical in today’s crypto ecosystem, where many of the world’s largest blockchains consume exorbitant amounts of electricity, thereby damaging the environment. 

Danaswap is a DEX truly like no other, taking the evolving landscape of trading platforms and interfaces to the next level through its aforementioned features and capabilities.

New to Crypto? Confused and want to know where to start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7552x/new_to_crypto_confused_and_want_to_know_where_to/,joshmaxd,1,2021-12-02 19:08:44,52,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7552x/new_to_crypto_confused_and_want_to_know_where_to/,EXCHANGE,"I'm going to preface this with the usual ""I am not a financial advisor"" malarkey, I'm not one, and like everyone else in this subreddit, I don't know shit about fuck. I am also based in the UK so this is going to be from my perspective here, rules and restrictions in your country of residence may change the experience.

That said, I came into Crypto very late into the last bull run, had no idea what I'm doing (BTC and ETH seemed ""too expensive"" - Fuck my life), bought a bag of litecoin at the very top and have been saltily holding it ever since.

In my time though, I've had the opportunity to try out a lot of different exchanges, Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, OKex, FTX, Bitfinex, you name it I've probably created an account and at least least tried it. So when one of my friends asked me how to get started in the crypto space, and they wanted a simple one stop shop exchange, I had to have a long hard think. I'm not going to discuss EVERY exchange I've ever used, instead I'm going to talk about the ones I find myself goingback to the most, of the myriad of accounts I created. Hopefully it is helpful to someone.

**TL;DR at the bottom if you are not interested in the whole spiel.**

The first thing I'd say is that it kind of comes down to what you want out of an exchange, and how much you want to invest, how active you want to be in managing your funds etc.

Firstly a note on Binance, often times this is the first word out of peoples mouths when talking about exchanges. However, as someone in the UK, we have had our fair share of issues between the FCA and Binance, which has essentially taken it off the table as our fiat on-ramp. Yes you can still use a card to add funds, but that has fees. I want to be able to do a direct bank transfer or some other form of fee-free loading of my fiat. If you are not like me though, and you are not in the UK (Or another country where Binance is problematic) then Binance may be your best bet, they have great staking options and a really wide range of crypto to invest in.

Coinbase is probably (outside of Binance) the biggest crypto exchange, but there are 2 parts to it. coinbase.com and pro.coinbase.com. You can use either of these on the website or using their own apps (one for each). Contrary to what a lot of people think when the first hear about it, Coinbase Pro is not a subscription model.

Coinbase.com is super simple, and has a nice 'learn and earn' section which lets you take quizzes periodically to earn a little bit of random coins and tokens, so well worth having an account with them for that if nothing else. But coinbase.com fees are astronomical, and if you buy some crypto to stake (holding for a passive income)they also take a fairly substantial cut of that.
The easy way around all of that is to use Coinbase pro, which is the same company and even uses the same account you set up on coinbase.com but is much more like a traditional trading interface, and the fees are much more in line with other exchanges.
If you're comfortable using the pro interface that is probably your simplest option, but be aware that coinbase also has notoriously bad customer service, and I know people took literal months to get verified and have had very hard times finding anyone to speak to about it.

Crypto.com is an interesting one which I only recently started using. It requires you to use the app, they don't have a website to trade in the same way, but I really like it actually, and especially think it is worth having for their reward card. If you buy and hold £300 of their CRO token, and move your Spotify account to their card they reimburse you for your Spotify subscription (in CRO). So that benefit, combined with the fact that they also give 2% back on almost all spending on their card is worth it to the point that I am moving my every day spending from my Amex to that card.

**Note:** if you decide to go that route I also reccomend you to look into the Curve card, which allows you to use your crypto.com card with apple/google pay (not supported directly by crypto.com) and will mean you don't have to worry so much about ensuring the crypto.com card is topped up, as you can move charges from one card to another within the Curve app up to 14 days after the fact.

Crypto.com also has a decent variety of investment options, staking rewards and even a nice decentralised finance (defi) app which has some great staking interest (currently getting 12% APY on my CRO in there).  I also have had good experience with their customer service, and as a fiat on ramp. Even though you use a debit card to top the account up, they haven't charged me any fees so far.
The only problem I have had with them so far is transfer fees. Now I'll preface this by saying that with any tokens based in ETH, including ETH itself, the fees to move things from one exchange or wallet to another can be very high, especially when moving at peak times, but I found that even so, Crypto.com seems to put an additional % in exchange fees which makes them ridiculous. I bough £250 in USDT the other month and sent it to a different wallet, it cost me £25 in fees.

Kraken.com is my most used Exchange nowadays when I am on my PC, I use it for bigger trades where crypto.com is my day to day activity and payment card. It has a simple and a pro layout and app, like coinbase, but will let you use the simple interface with lower fees than the latter. They also have a few better staking options (and doesnt take as much or any cut compared to Coinbase), no fees for a fiat on ramp (and a simple transfer method to boot), and a good selection of different tokens (not as many as binance but the key ones are there). FInally I've also found their customer service quick and responsive if I've had questions. They have a nice clear app too which is always a bonus.

I've used a lot of other exchanges, OKex, FTX, KuCoin, and honestly they have all been /fine/, no better or worse than binance in my experience, which I still have a lot of my funds on. Generally you trade better/worse/different selection in coins for marginally better/worse fees and different staking options. But the stand out one for me is Kraken.com

**TL;DR**

It's hard to pinpoint a single exchange and say 'yes use that one only'. But here is what I do:

* My Coinbase account is basically just used to take the quizzes and that's about it, I generally hold them for a bit there then change them into bitcoin, it's a small pot but nice to have a spare bit of change in it.
* Crypto.com is my everyday expense account now, I top the card up from my bank account and pay for everything on their card to earn CRO tokens, nice little earner but I don't really trade much there because I prefer a bit more control.
* Kraken is where I do all my real purchases and 'Dollar Cost Averaging' nowadays, I stick a lump sum in there every few months and buy dips of whatever coins I like, and keep things in staking there for a nice bit of passive income.

The only other advice I'd give relates to security. The nice thing about having crypto on an exchange is a bit more peace of mind as they can be insured and help recover in the event of a loss. I would DEFINITELY say to download something like google authenticator or' authy' to your phone and use that for 2 factor authentication on login to these exchanges, as without it if your password is compromised you are shit out of luck. **Don't** use SMS as a 2 factor authentication option it is super insecure.

The phrase that gets thrown around a lot here is 'not your keys, not your crypto', which is to say if you don't have control of the seed phrase for your crypto you don’t truly own it. All of the options I have listed above are centralised exchanges and they hold the keys not you. So in addition, if you are planning on doing any really big investing (over say £10k) I would advise looking into self-custody wallet apps like Trust wallet, or cold storage wallets like Ledger wallet. These allow you to be in complete control of the seed phrase, you would buy whatever you want and take it off the exchange to a wallet and store there, then only move back when you want to trade it again. Something to think about for sure, but probably a bit advanced at this stage.

I hope this has been helpful to someone, I just have one final caveat, if you are starting to get into crypto now, you're potentially getting in at a tail end of the bull run. A lot of people are suggesting we go into a bear market end of 2021, start of 2022 as I said no one here knows shit about fuck but as always, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose, and have an exit strategy or expect to hold for a good couple of years before seeing profit."

What is Yearn Finance?

Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. It started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. The service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. Later on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. Yearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited. Yearn Finance in 2021 Yearn Finance was launched in July 2020 and its governance token, YFI was released to the community through a fair launch. At its initial release, because there were no fundraising nor valuation placed on Yearn Finance, the market did not fully comprehend the value capture and not able to figure out the market value for it. As Yearn Finance continued to attract liquidity by allowing people to easily earn and participate in DeFi, YFI token went from $30 to $43,000 within 2 months from its launch. In 2021, Yearn Finance continues to solidify its position as the gold standard for yield aggregator in which it managed to hit an all-time high of $91,000 on May 12th, 2021 alongside with the peak of the cryptocurrency markets. What is Yield Farming and Delegated Vaults? Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol’s native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. Other than simple yield farming, Yearn Finance also released a product named delegated vault. Delegated vaults basically use any assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins and recycle the stablecoins into a stablecoin vault. Any subsequent earnings are then used to buy back the asset. For example, one of the delegated vaults is yETH, where users can deposit ETH and expect to have more ETH when they withdraw. The ETH is sent to Maker DAO as collateral in order to draw DAI where the DAI will be invested into the DAI vault, with subsequent earnings used to buy back ETH. Why is the founder, Andre Cronje controversial or famous?

Andre became one of the most famous DeFi thought leaders as he launched Yearn Finance single-handedly, witnessing YFI price went up by roughly 55x in less than 3 months, valuing Yearn Finance by more than $1 billion. He is vocal on Twitter with his ethos of fair token launch and having a bias on launching experimental projects before audits, which gave birth to one of the DeFi main activities “Aping”. Aping basically means buying the tokens the moment it launches in Ethereum mainnet before fully knowing the function of the tokens. It normally involves directly interacting with the Ethereum contract before a website UI is out or buying it straight from DEX such as Uniswap. It is a high risk activity, causing many investors to lose their fund to scams. But the lure of getting early access to tokens that might go up rapidly in price is attracting tons of speculators. One of the examples is when Andre launched EMN, a game economy engine called “Eminence” that was subsequently hacked for $15 million. Subsequent launch of the KP3R token, a network that facilitates keepers to perform automated tasks on behalf of requestors, saw the price go up by 22x in less than 3 months, valuing KP3R at more than $100 million. The activity of aping will not die down anytime soon with numerous projects achieving high valuation within a short span of time. What is the Yearn Finance Alliance?

During the weeks of 24 November until 3 December 2020, Yearn Finance announced the Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A) of multiple protocols, essentially forming an alliance revolving around YFI.

SushiSwap joined as its Automated Market Maker (AMM) arm.

Cover joined as its insurance arm.

Cream joined as its lending arm.

Akropolis joined as its institutional service provider for yVaults and upcoming lending products.

Pickle joined as one of its strategists.

There are even multiple Yearn Ecosystem Index tokens launched such as YETI by Powerpool and YPIE by PieDAO. What are the fees in Yearn Finance? Yearn Finance v1 charges a withdrawal fee of 0.5% plus 5% performance fee from the gas cost saved. Yearn Finance v2 follows the traditional hedge fund fees structure of 2/20 where it charges 2% for management fee and 20% for performance fee. Yearn Finance v2 was launched on 19 January 2021. What is YFI token? YFI is the governance token for the Yearn Finance protocol. It can be used to vote and receive cash flows from the fees earned by the protocol. YFI initiated the first community-fair-launched token distribution, giving out 30,000 tokens to early protocol’s users by a surprise yield farming announcement back in 17-July-2020. How to trade YFI? YFI can be obtained by buying them from exchanges such as Sushiswap or Binance. You can find YFI trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

"Ethereum 2.0 $ETH: Ethereum's Blockchain Upgrade that Will Change the World, Again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r7lhgx/ethereum_20_eth_ethereums_blockchain_upgrade_that/,Beyond_Vision78,1,2021-12-03 08:23:28,35,/r/investing/comments/r7lhgx/ethereum_20_eth_ethereums_blockchain_upgrade_that/,NaN,"Ethereum is disrupting all of traditional finance via the platforms and applications running on top of its blockchain.  When Ethereum 2.0 is fully implemented, the big banks have much to fear in the long run. Proof-of-stake will make Ethereum's blockchain dramatically more energy efficient, more secure, and the shards upgrade will allow for a 1000x throughput upgrade to over 100,000 transactions per second, from the current 15-45.  The cost to transact on Ethereum will finally decrease to mere pennies.  When this occurs, the big banks have much to fear.

Banks have had a monopoly on giving people or corporations loans since their inception.  Because of this, they’ve been able to provide people with relatively predatory loan rates, and have restricted movement of many up the wealth curve.  Banks, like all institutions, have certain incentives to push and must also abide by laws and regulations of governments.  This limits their potential clientele, leaving an opportunity for someone else…

Enter DeFi where with just an internet connection and some crypto, you can get a loan to fund any idea you may have.  No credit scores, no income, just your capital and your idea.  While obviously there are risks to this, the upside outweighs the risks in my view.  A farmer in Africa can now raise capital to expand his business from someone in Germany.  All political or systematic red tape preventing anyone from raising capital has been removed.  If you have the collateral to provide for a loan, you’re eligible.

This is the power of Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem.  Technology and code is disrupting the entire legacy finance stack.  Anyone in the world can now get funded, all without any middleman taking a cut for themselves.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see ETH become a multi-trillion dollar asset in the coming years, assuming the Ethereum2.0 upgrade is completed by the end of 2022. While ETH has changed the world already, it’s just getting started.  A fast, cheap Ethereum blockchain will change everything, again.  If you want to learn more, have a listen to my latest podcast on ETH 2.0.  What they’re doing, how they’re doing it, and it’s impact is all detailed. 

Listen by searching for Beyond Money on all major podcast platforms for those of you that are interested.  Thanks for taking the time to read, and look forward to the discussion."

These are an absolute favorite strategy of mine, likely my second most deployed. Trade details below:

-BTO (10) 16Dec22 7.5C @ 6.15 &amp; 0.82 Delta
-STO (8)   17Dec21 10.5C @ 0.92 &amp; 0.50 Delta

Trade allocation: $15,000
Initial outlay: $6,150 
Current credit received: $736
Current ROIC: 11.97% 

By setting the trade up this way, I make a healthy return on the initial short call sale, I don’t cap my upside, and leave room to scale in if HUT continues down to manage by basis (provided I still feel the same about HUT). I minimize my theta burn on the longs by going further out in time and further ITM. By placing the short call 15 DTE and ATM I balance amount of premium received with capitalizing on theta decay curve (which I shared previously). 

This is a slower more hands off trade where I will continue to manage the short calls as they come closer to expiry, re-evaluate the long calls based on HUT’s performance, and either unwind the longs as the shorts fall ITM to finance their closure or if HUT has a distinct change of performance. I have 4 other versions of this trade on in other crypto centric companies running an A/B test, more to come on those. 

I am prepared to either scale into the full allocation or lose the full allocation. This is trade falls in the speculative section of my portfolio.

What is [Redacted] ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedactedCartel/comments/r8tmul/what_is_redacted/,Nicholasnokia5,1,2021-12-05 00:47:58,0,/r/RedactedCartel/comments/r8tmul/what_is_redacted/,NaN," 

**1.** **What is \[Redacted\]? (** [🦋](https://emojipedia.org/butterfly/), [🦋](https://emojipedia.org/butterfly/))

How did \[Redacted\] begin? How did it all start? 

It started as a proposal by 0xsami focused on acquiring CRV, CVX, and other relevant governance tokens to expand Olympus DAOs reach beyond risk-free value and expand into a multi-token ecosystem.  

  

[\[Chain of events\]](https://preview.redd.it/78fpr6q5vj381.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f60255d72a668f55cf1e5c945ed919bff4d0691)

**TLDR;**

**\[REDACTED\]** incentivizes bonding tokens from the Curve ecosystem into treasury in exchange for the **$BTRFLY** token. 

Each **$BTRFLY** token is backed by value from the Curve ecosystem locked in the DAO treasury. **$BTRFLY** is an ERC20 token, but will bridge the core components and token to whatever chains Curve scales to.

The strategies employed through bonding allow **\[REDACTED\]** to accumulate voting power in the Curve gauge and utilize that power to vote on the behalf of minters ensuring their interests are best represented in the Curve gauge.

In addition to an aggregation of voting power, when utilizing Curve LP tokens to mint **$BTRFLY**, users are receiving a maximized yield and are in possession of a liquid token that is securely backed by stable assets. **$BTRFLY** is primarily backed by the stablecoin LP tokens, remaining relatively stable regardless of the market dynamics.

**$BTRFLY**. will be the latest building block in the Curve governance that aims to accumulate as much veCRV (and CVX) as possible through the mechanics of **OlympusDAO**.  🤯 

**$BTRFLY**. is also leveraged for unlocking liquidity in the Curve ecosystem, in exchange for bonding Curve tokens to the treasury, we will give up a liquid alternative in the form of **$BTRFLY**. 

In its future — **\[REDACTED\]** will become a core piece in the curve economy where the whole ecosystem and monetary policy are managed by the **\[REDACTED\]**  Cartel (aka a DAO). This way we guarantee transparent decision making and long-term stability.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **Flapping her wings**  👀 ‼️ 

**\[REDACTED\]** first became visible to the masses through twitter, a page which was followed by important and powerful accounts in the defi CT sphere. 

When Zeus of Ohm first tweeted about the 30+ list of incubantees , many were confused and questioned if the **\[REDACTED\]** was supposed to be **$Time**, an ohm fork.

An example would be: selling a Call Option for Bond Prices. Issuing a call option that gives you the right but not the obligation to buy LP Bonds at a predetermined price after say a month.

I have decided that Moonriver may be my current favourite spot for defi. Here are the major projects and links if you want to get started.,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/r93t44/i_have_decided_that_moonriver_may_be_my_current/,Physiocrat,1,2021-12-05 09:03:07,16,/r/defi/comments/r93t44/i_have_decided_that_moonriver_may_be_my_current/,NaN,"A quick disclaimer that I do have investments on Moonriver, and I also hold and stake MOVR tokens.

Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama network. Kusama, as I understand it, is a close relative of Polkadot where a lot of development work is done. Moonriver is meant to be a ""canary"" deployment of the highly anticipated Moonbeam network. I suppose what that means is that Moonriver is using Moonbeam's code that they intend to use. This may come with some risk since it is plowing the way.

The things I absolutely love about Moonriver:

- It still has the small early adopter feeling to it. The ecosystem is expanding and more platforms are beginning to join Moonriver, so it doesn't have the small abandoned type of feeling to it.

- The yields seem to be some of the best around. I have wanted to post about Moonriver for a while, but honestly didn't want other people to catch on. The more people that do catch on, the less my yield becomes. At least to some extent.

- Moonriver is still short on quiet a few types of platforms. Right now Moonriver does not have an Aave style lending/borrowing money market and it does not have any official Curve implementation (it does have 1Swap though). I think that its possible that with a money market and Curve, it could push MOVR into the top 100 in market cap (currently its around 160).

- Transacting is cheap and reliable. Metamask still defaults to using 1 gwei for gas, and those do typically go through, but if you do 2.5+ gwei, the transaction will go through very quickly. A normal swap at 2.5 gwei costs about $0.06. I honestly don't know if Moonriver is solving some grand scaling issue. What I do know is that during the flash crash last night, I had absolutely no issue making trades on the Moonriver network and gas prices were not impacted.

- There is still a lack of proper arbitrage on the Moonriver. Sometimes you can make $100 off of bringing in $5000 of a stablecoin that is low on liquidity.

If you want to check Moonriver out, here is some of the quick info you would want to know:

**Bridging:**
- Getting MOVR (the gas token). I find it easiest for any new chain I am setting up on to use [Elk Finance](https://elk.finance). Purchase about $50 worth of ELK on whatever chain you are on, then click on the ""ElkNet"" button, and it will give you a list of chains you can bridge your ELK to. Click the button that says use 1 ELK for gas token, and it will automatically sell 1 ELK and deposit the resulting MOVR into your wallet. You now have enough MOVR to approve the ELK in your wallet for trading, and then trade the ELK for MOVR.

- You can bridge ERC20 tokens directly from Ethereum using [anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange). This can of course be sort of expensive to come through ethereum, but like I mentioned above, you might make some money if you bridge over an asset that is low on supply.

- You can bridge MIM from most of the popular blockchains using anyswap.

- You can bridge DAI.e, USDC.e, and USDT.e using [relaychain](https://app.relaychain.com/#/cross-chain-bridge-transfer). This will not give you the native stablecoin that is used on Moonriver, and you will have to use [1swap](https://1swap.fi/) to trade it for the native version. It costs about $10 to use relaychain. This is one of the places you can make some money by bringing in a coin that is low on supply.

**Dex/Farming:**
The most popular UniSwap based platform is [Solarbeam](https://solarbeam.io). 

[Sushiswap](https://sushi.com) recently launched farms on Moonriver and their TVL is growing as well.

[1Swap](https://1swap.fi/) is the main stableswap platform at the moment. They have a pending audit with Obelisk, and I am not sure how long until it is finalized.

[Nileriver](https://nileriver.finance) seems to be a clone of balancer.

[Firebird](https://app.firebird.finance/swap) is a pretty good option for swap routing. I have used them on multiple platforms, and they usually are plugged in to some good liquidity sources.

**Autocompounding:**
- [Beefy](https://app.beefy.finance/#/moonriver)

- [Autofarm](https://autofarm.network/moonriver/)

**Leverage:**
[Impermax](https://moonriver.impermax.finance/) is new to Moonriver, or at least newly added to DefiLlama's tracking. They offer leverage against specific LP tokens. I have not had a chance to try their platform out yet.

**Blockexplorer:**
[Moonscan](https://moonriver.moonscan.io/) is the etherscan clone.

**MOVR Staking:**
You can nominate your MOVR tokens to a block collator and earn stake on your proportional share. This is done [here](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonriver/staking). I don't know what the APY is, it seems like it is in the 10-20% range."

anxiety and mood swings from high stress job?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/r94dob/anxiety_and_mood_swings_from_high_stress_job/,Forsaken-Eagle-2302,1,2021-12-05 09:34:52,2,/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/r94dob/anxiety_and_mood_swings_from_high_stress_job/,Mental Health,"I work as a data scientist while also juggling a masters in analytics from Georgia Tech, a place I decided to never set foot into again after a mentally harrowing 5 years of a undergrad in Biomedical Engineering with minors in Industrial Design and Applied Physiology. It was a time of my life that turned everything I thought I knew and trusted about myself over on its head. Essentially, it taught me that hardworking != expected success...not always anyway. It also gave me some severe self worth issues, which comes with the territory when you've lived your life ruled by grades. I sometimes joke that even now, four years late, I have a form of PTSD from that time----a joke that I'm not laughing at anymore as I realize everyday how mangled I came out of the experience. 

Data Science was a massive career change, I know. It's been five years since graduating undergrad and not finding a job in BME that pushed me towards coding and data science. My family was worried and to take the edge off, I let myself step into the abyss in a way. Granted, it was a very steep learning curve and I've only been working as a data scientist for almost three years this february 2022. 

I battle with imposter syndrome pretty much everyday, and waking up with a maelstrom of anxiety, fear, and worry in the pit of my stomach doesn't help. And through this, I still get my job done, still soldier through my classes and take my six hour long coding midterms like I should. I've been doing all right I like to think---good grades and reasonably good pay. I'm financially responsible and as minimalistic as it gets (except for my Dunkin' Donuts coffee addiction and my hunt for the best Chinese noodle house).

But the more I do it --- the more I push myself, the more I find myself lacking to the point that I'm not sure this is even the right fit for me at all. I'm naturally drawn writing --- stories centering around controversial topics, mental health, finance, social/cultural, philosophy---pretty much anything and everything, and I've been told I'm good at it. At the very least, it's always come rather easily to me.

And while I like coding well enough as a hobby like playing my flute, I despise it in a corporate environment with deadlines. Yet, I feel like I should push myself and keep pushing myself because it's the image that my world has of me---an illusion of myself that I lived my life believing, the very same illusion that I have no energy to maintain anymore and the cracks are only spidering out even further, widening with each new day.

I want to quit. I want to pursue a lifestyle that while making me the money I need to live( I don't need much), gives me fulfillment and purpose. To me, writing serves that because the stories I have are stories others too have, but they are also stories that are swallowed and suppressed. I want to give voice to those experiences.

Please don't get me wrong. My family is very supportive of me, but the full extent of their advocacy is withheld due to their fear of my life derailing from a set path and the insecurities that would flourish in its wake. Growing up middle class, a job was always a necessity---growing up Indian middle-class meant I could do nothing but STEM. 

I never realized until I was in university that I was better at practical applications than exam taking.

I never realized until getting my first job (I'm in my second right now) that it's extremely difficult for me to work 8 hours a day, slaving away at my computer until I can't think anymore---all for someone else with a purpose I can't give two shits about even if I'm given a million bucks.

Graduating from where I did and where I am in right now, I feel like I should push myself, that I should expect that of myself...I do expect that of myself. But if I quit this career path, I feel that I've failed myself, my family, and would be ""behind"" in comparison to my peers. I feel like I haven't tried hard enough because my parents tried so much harder---that perhaps I'm being lazy and ungrateful for whining about a job that others would love to have in a field many want to break into. Hell, I've gotten sick of my own whining to the point where I'm not sure if I'm complaining or venting.

I don't know what to do and it terrifies me. You'd think after having a pretty stable affair with failure all these years since I started undergrad, I'd get used to it popping its head up uninvited. You'd think after  forcing myself out of the comfort zone since I was eighteen so many times, I'd have made my peace with it. 

But I haven't. I constantly feel like a circular peg with no edges trying to fit into a triangular hole. 

If you've made it to the end of this obscenely long post, thank you for your time and energy. 

If you've any thoughts, please let me know!

have a great holiday!"

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

Above is our analysis of Bumper Finance, a protocol that protects users' assets through a risk conversion mechanism. To do this, we need to design a suitable tokenomics that is enough to incentivise the parties to have certain benefits. Also increases the value of $BUMP and the network over time. After designing tokenomics based on reasonable assumptions, we proceed to evaluate and analyse those variables according to TVL and demand for the protocol. Finally, we have the logical results below:

1. **Cash flow**: 528.24% and 174.67% YoY growth
2. **Ecosystem reward based on the Sigmoid Curve**: 36.47%, 69.85%, 94.88% YoY emission of the network incentive
3. **Total token emission rate**: 22.50%, 11.31% YoY inflation rate.
4. **Token Utility (Demand) Forecast**: network incentive would end on month 25. Then, only the protocol’s boost and stake functions would be used to support its future token issuance.
5. **Circulating Supply Analysis**: scenario analysis by ideal and reasonable case. Under the reasonable case, 30% of the token supply will be held whereas 70% will be sold, resulting in a long term stabilised price of the $BUMP token at around $5.50.
6. **FDV Analysis**: the FDV is high as protocol revenue will grow faster than the theoretical value of the token.

&amp;#x200B;

# General Conclusion

In this article, we analyse Bumper Finance shortly, by breaking down the fundamental drivers of the protocol, token supply, token demand and market activity.

* First, we analyse protocol cash flow, in comparing to similar price protection protocols.
* Secondly, we examine the token supply model, including creating an additional sigmoid function in token distribution.
* Thirdly, given the various incentive policies designed by the Bumper team, we study and report on the internal demand function of the token.
* Fourthly, we combine cash flow, token supply and dynamics of token demand analyses into a circulating supply analysis, giving two possible scenarios - ideal and reasonable.
* Fifthly, we give our insights to the fully diluted value (FDV) analysis, as a proxy to the analysed performance of the token and ecosystem.
* Finally, we provide some provide some insight into our some discussions and iterations we had, with the Bumper team which precipitated several enhancements given our insights, to improve accuracy of the model and analysis.

# What Is Bumper Finance?

Bumper Finance is a DeFi price protection protocol built on Ethereum mainnet. Bumper provides a mechanism by which holders of the underlying asset can maintain the value of their position against a decline in the price of this asset in the market.

Bumper Finance works by transferring risk to the risk-taker (Maker) and receiving some income from the risk-averse party (Taker).

&gt;Bumper is a price insurance protocol.

# Bumper’s Token Model

Bumper is a crypto asset price protection protocol. The assets include Ethereum and (wrapped) Bitcoin for their initial release, and this forms the basis of our analysis.

* The core mechanism - price protection for Takers who pay premiums which are collectively earned by Makers - provides the incentives for Makers and Takers to transact with the protocol.
* The native token of Bumper, $BUMP, is used as an access token which is required to be “bonded” (locked) with the protocol to take out a position. The required bond is calculated as a proportion of the $USDC value of the user’s position."

# What Is Bumper Finance?

Bumper Finance is a DeFi price protection protocol built on Ethereum mainnet. Bumper provides a mechanism by which holders of the underlying asset can maintain the value of their position against a decline in the price of this asset in the market.

Bumper Finance works by transferring risk to the risk-taker (Maker) and receiving some income from the risk-averse party (Taker).

&gt;Bumper is a price insurance protocol.

# Bumper’s Token Model

Bumper is a crypto asset price protection protocol. The assets include Ethereum and (wrapped) Bitcoin for their initial release, and this forms the basis of our analysis.

* The core mechanism - price protection for Takers who pay premiums which are collectively earned by Makers - provides the incentives for Makers and Takers to transact with the protocol.
* The native token of Bumper, $BUMP, is used as an access token which is required to be “bonded” (locked) with the protocol to take out a position. The required bond is calculated as a proportion of the $USDC value of the user’s position."

**TLDR**:

Above is our analysis of Bumper Finance, a protocol that protects users' assets through a risk conversion mechanism. To do this, we need to design a suitable tokenomics that is enough to incentivise the parties to have certain benefits. Also increases the value of $BUMP and the network over time. After designing tokenomics based on reasonable assumptions, we proceed to evaluate and analyse those variables according to TVL and demand for the protocol. Finally, we have the logical results below:

1. **Cash flow**: 528.24% and 174.67% YoY growth
2. **Ecosystem reward based on the Sigmoid Curve**: 36.47%, 69.85%, 94.88% YoY emission of the network incentive
3. **Total token emission rate**: 22.50%, 11.31% YoY inflation rate.
4. **Token Utility (Demand) Forecast**: network incentive would end on month 25. Then, only the protocol’s boost and stake functions would be used to support its future token issuance.
5. **Circulating Supply Analysis**: scenario analysis by ideal and reasonable case. Under the reasonable case, 30% of the token supply will be held whereas 70% will be sold, resulting in a long term stabilised price of the $BUMP token at around $5.50.
6. **FDV Analysis**: the FDV is high as protocol revenue will grow faster than the theoretical value of the token.

In this article, we analyse Bumper Finance shortly, by breaking down the fundamental drivers of the protocol, token supply, token demand and market activity.

Above is our analysis of Bumper Finance, a protocol that protects users' assets through a risk conversion mechanism. To do this, we need to design a suitable tokenomics that is enough to incentivise the parties to have certain benefits. Also increases the value of $BUMP and the network over time. After designing tokenomics based on reasonable assumptions, we proceed to evaluate and analyse those variables according to TVL and demand for the protocol. Finally, we have the logical results below:

1. **Cash flow**: 528.24% and 174.67% YoY growth
2. **Ecosystem reward based on the Sigmoid Curve**: 36.47%, 69.85%, 94.88% YoY emission of the network incentive
3. **Total token emission rate**: 22.50%, 11.31% YoY inflation rate.
4. **Token Utility (Demand) Forecast**: network incentive would end on month 25. Then, only the protocol’s boost and stake functions would be used to support its future token issuance.
5. **Circulating Supply Analysis**: scenario analysis by ideal and reasonable case. Under the reasonable case, 30% of the token supply will be held whereas 70% will be sold, resulting in a long term stabilised price of the $BUMP token at around $5.50.
6. **FDV Analysis**: the FDV is high as protocol revenue will grow faster than the theoretical value of the token.

# General Conclusion

In this article, we analyse Bumper Finance shortly, by breaking down the fundamental drivers of the protocol, token supply, token demand and market activity.

* First, we analyse protocol cash flow, in comparing to similar price protection protocols.
* Secondly, we examine the token supply model, including creating an additional sigmoid function in token distribution.
* Thirdly, given the various incentive policies designed by the Bumper team, we study and report on the internal demand function of the token.
* Fourthly, we combine cash flow, token supply and dynamics of token demand analyses into a circulating supply analysis, giving two possible scenarios - ideal and reasonable.
* Fifthly, we give our insights to the fully diluted value (FDV) analysis, as a proxy to the analysed performance of the token and ecosystem.
* Finally, we provide some provide some insight into our some discussions and iterations we had, with the Bumper team which precipitated several enhancements given our insights, to improve accuracy of the model and analysis.

# What Is Bumper Finance?

Bumper Finance is a DeFi price protection protocol built on Ethereum mainnet. Bumper provides a mechanism by which holders of the underlying asset can maintain the value of their position against a decline in the price of this asset in the market.

Bumper Finance works by transferring risk to the risk-taker (Maker) and receiving some income from the risk-averse party (Taker).

&gt;Bumper is a price insurance protocol.

# Bumper’s Token Model

Bumper is a crypto asset price protection protocol. The assets include Ethereum and (wrapped) Bitcoin for their initial release, and this forms the basis of our analysis.

* The core mechanism - price protection for Takers who pay premiums which are collectively earned by Makers - provides the incentives for Makers and Takers to transact with the protocol.
* The native token of Bumper, $BUMP, is used as an access token which is required to be “bonded” (locked) with the protocol to take out a position. The required bond is calculated as a proportion of the $USDC value of the user’s position."

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

&amp;#x200B;

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

 

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes."

A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

**TLDR**:Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.  


# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes."

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse. 

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars. 

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara. 

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates. 

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business. 

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language. 

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go! 

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have. 

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment). 

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing &amp; Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet. 

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website https://catchy.finance/ for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have.

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment).

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing &amp; Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet.

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website [https://catchy.finance/](https://catchy.finance/) for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse.

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars.

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara.

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates.

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business.

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language.

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

This month we produced the following Inside Track podcasts.

**OIN Finance** \- the DeFi platform talks staking and regulation.

**Rx SeedCoin** \- the project aiming to relieve world hunger, homelessness and sickness talks combining crypto with compassion.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go!

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value.

Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go!

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have.

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment).

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing &amp; Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet.

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website [https://catchy.finance/](https://catchy.finance/) for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse.

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars.

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara.

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates.

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business.

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language.

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use.

From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go!

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have.

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment).

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing &amp; Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet.

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website [https://catchy.finance/](https://catchy.finance/) for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse.

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars.

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara.

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates.

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business.

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language.

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

APR calculation using Curve,https://www.reddit.com/r/LidoFinance/comments/rb7t7f/apr_calculation_using_curve/,kiwi_1337,7,2021-12-08 03:50:10,20,/r/LidoFinance/comments/rb7t7f/apr_calculation_using_curve/,NaN,"Hello Sirs :)

So I was trying to figure out how ETH staking works with Lido and Curve, to see how attractive this is. I've found out that it works as follows:

1. Send ETH to Lido, receive an equal amount of stETH. stETH rebases daily, which is how the rewards are distributed (https://blog.lido.fi/steth-the-mechanics-of-steth/). So my stETH would increase (even without a transaction). Current APR is 4.8%. 

2. Pool stETH on Curve in the ETH+stETH pool, receive steCRV. According to documentation, pooling 1 stETH gives a claim on ETH and stETH. 50%/50% according to https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5231649-a-guide-to-curve-finance (the FAQ at the bottom). Although I wonder if this is 50/50 statement is accurate.. see below. 
* Assuming a 50/50 distribution across ETH and stETH, the APR of staking ETH with Lido is cut in half, to 2.4%.
* Base vAPY of the Curve pool is 2.87%, according to https://curve.fi/pools

3. Stake steCRV on Curve Gauge, receive steCRV-gauge. 0.04% APY in CRV, 3.28% in LDO.

Total staking rewards of my ETH: 2.4% (since in the end, I only have a claim on 50% stETH)  + 2.87% + 0.04% + 3.28% = 8.59% . 

At least so I thought. Then I noticed that in the ETH+stETH pool on Curve, the distrubution across ETH and stETH is not 50/50, but 41.59/58.41 . So my APR of staking ETH with Lido is probably off, instead of 50% of 4.8% it should be 58.41% of 4.8% = 2.80%.

Total APR should then be 2.80% + 2.87% + 0.04% + 3.28% = 8.99%. 

I know that these percentages fluctuate and depend on amount of ETH staked, amount of ETH/stETH pooled, volume on curve, positions of the stars, etc. But my aim is not a rocksolid APR percentage, but testing my knowledge. I have the following questions:

* Did I calculate the percentages correctly ?
* Specifically, the Lido staking reward of 2.80% is not the same as the Curve pool vAPY of 2.87%, right ? So I'm not counting the same APR 2 times ?
* Lido rebasing causes the stETH in the Curve pool to grow. If I pool stETH with Curve, this rebasing happens in the pool. This causes my claim on stETH in the pool will increase, which is how I will earn the APR on stETH will be earned. Correct ?
* It does not really make sense to first stake ETH with Lido, correct ? Since I'm not a whale, the distribution of stETH/ETH will not noticably change if I deposit ETH to curve directly, instead of stETH. So the difference in Lido rewards, relative to the total pool rewards, would be negligible. Would save me one transaction (fee) with Lido. Correct ?

Thanks!"

 [Roman Ugarte](https://messari.io/research/roman-ugarte) messari.io

&amp;#x200B;

Decentralized finance (DeFi), in just over a year, has “remixed” various elements of traditional finance (TradFi), including lending, derivatives, structured products, and more. But one element has yet to fully cross the chasm: order book exchanges.

  
Enter Serum, a Solana-based decentralized exchange seeking to reinvent the way assets are traded in the decentralized economy. Their “central limit order book”—a fully on-chain, highly scalable order-matching mechanism—could power the next generation of interchange, from in-game marketplaces to high-frequency trading. To better understand the promise and risks of this ambitious project, let’s take a look at the broader decentralized exchange landscape, how Serum fits into it, and what the protocol’s tokenomics (SRM) means for investors.

  
**A Brief History of Decentralized Exchanges**

Most asset trading today, from stocks on the NASDAQ to cryptocurrencies on Coinbase, is facilitated through order books. The mechanics of an order book are simple. A trader can place an order—specifying the trading pair, quantity, and price—which is matched with the other side of the order book. In aggregation, the book’s liquidity efficiently matches buyers and sellers.

  
There’s a reason why the vast majority of assets today are exchanged through this mechanism. For one, order books give users the ability to define their own price, even allowing them to place stop-loss and stop-limit orders. They also typically offer efficiency benefits for both traders (i.e., tighter spreads) and liquidity providers (i.e., no impermanent loss).

  
In the early days of decentralized finance (DeFi), a number of decentralized exchanges (DEXes) attempted to replicate this order book model in a trustless, on-chain manner. Starting in 2012, LocalBitcoins launched one of the first DEXes for transacting Bitcoin in a peer-to-peer way, powered by an on-chain escrow technique named [Hashed Time Locked Contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts). In 2016, following Ethereum’s smart contract functionality, [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.com/) released an order book exchange. Numerous decentralized order book exchanges were subsequently launched, including IDEX and 0x, which continue to process hundreds of millions of dollars in volume to this day.

  
Today, however, the vast majority of DEX volume is settled through automated market makers (AMMs), not order book exchanges. In fact, [over 90%](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial) of trades are routed through Uniswap, Sushiswap, or Curve, each representing AMM-based protocols. How did this come to be?

  
The answer lies mostly with implementation. Faced with high transaction costs and slow settlement speeds, AMM-based protocols have been easier to implement on smart contract networks like Ethereum than order book exchanges. AMMs also present certain advantages, such as guaranteed trade settlement, constant liquidity (particularly useful for long-tail assets), and a familiar “vending machine” user experience. They also have disadvantages, such as having higher slippage than order books and, most notably, impermanent loss diminishing the returns for liquidity providers.  
However, with the progression of layer-2 scaling on Ethereum and the adoption of high-throughput chains like Solana, we are due for a new approach to this problem. There’s room for an emerging order book exchange that is fully decentralized, capital-efficient, and appealing to retail users.

  
**Serum: An Order Book Paradigm Shift**

In August 2020, at the tail end of Ethereum’s so-called “DeFi Summer,” Serum was launched as one of the first major projects on Solana. It was incubated and strongly supported by the Solana Foundation, Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried, and several others.

  
The project was built in response to many of the problems the team saw in DeFi at the time. Ethereum’s limitations made it slow and expensive, many protocols were de facto centralized, and there was (and remains) a lack of cross-chain functionality. The [whitepaper](https://assets.website-files.com/61382d4555f82a75dc677b6f/61384a6d5c937269dbed185c_serum_white_paper.88d98f84.pdf)’s section on AMMs takes note of this:  


* Uniswap has quietly revolutionized DeFi by allowing trading without orderbooks.
* But the more remarkable thing is that Automated Market Making is necessary. AMM is a system where there are no limit orders, or even bids or offers; in an orderbook, you can decide the price, size, and direction you want to trade. There are lots of disadvantages to AMM. You can’t provide liquidity unless you provide both sides; you can’t choose to only provide at a particular price; you can’t provide at a price other than the current market price; and you can’t choose the size to provide there without providing way more behind it.
* There’s a solution to this—it’s what the rest of finance does. But DeFi doesn’t have orderbooks, by and large, because the ETH network is too slow and expensive to support them. Matching bids and offers with each other involves a bunch of operations.

Serum, at its core, is a fully on-chain order book built on Solana. The protocol’s first-of-its-kind central limit order book (CLOB) is the technology that enables users to trade with each other in an efficient, trustless, and non-custodial way. The protocol is also asset-agnostic, which means any crypto-assets (spot, derivatives, synthetics, and so on) can be traded on the order book. In fact, an upcoming upgrade called [Serum Core](https://docs.projectserum.com/appendix/serum-core) will make the order book capable of order-matching any financial asset, not just SPL tokens. This protocol improvement will make it even easier to build derivatives and complex products on Serum.

  
The decision to build on Solana is central to the protocol’s mechanism. Solana’s quick settlement speed allows for sub-second trading, which is necessary for a well-functioning order book, and the low network fees (on the order of $0.00001 per transaction) enable inexpensive on-chain interaction.  
While most of the protocol’s mechanics are directly executed on-chain, Serum also plans to have a network of nodes responsible for “[turning the crank](https://docs.projectserum.com/appendix/faq#what-is-crank-turning),” which involves order-matching and occasionally running specific programs. Nodes, in return for their work, would be allocated a share of the protocol’s revenue and are afforded governance responsibilities.

  
Serum, as one of the first and most successful DeFi projects on Solana, has established itself as a major player in the ecosystem. The protocol’s early bet on Solana seems to have paid off; Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has [blossomed](https://defillama.com/chain/Solana) from merely $500M in late June 2021 to nearly $14B today.  
**Composability at the Core: Liquidity as a Service**To best understand Serum, it’s useful to treat it as more of an order book middleware solution than a decentralized exchange itself. While Serum has [numerous front-ends](https://portal.projectserum.com/) for its own exchange (referred to as Serum DEX), its open-source nature allows DeFi protocols, games, dApps, and other projects to plug into Serum’s network of liquidity to power their own exchanges or marketplaces.

  
In fact, many of Solana’s top DeFi protocols are powered by Serum’s order book on the back-end. For example, Raydium, Atrix, and Mango Markets are each built on top of Serum’s open-source DEX infrastructure. While they have designed a unique graphical user interface (GUI) and, in many cases, have implemented new DeFi features (AMM functionality, new asset types, cross-chain, etc.), Serum is an integral part of their protocol architecture. As DeFi on Solana continues to mature, many expect Serum’s integrations to [continue expanding](https://docs.projectserum.com/serum-ecosystem/trading-on-serum/trading-guis).

&amp;#x200B;

Since Serum takes a small transaction fee on the liquidity it routes, it begs the question: Why don’t these protocols build their own on-chain order book?

The answer is two-fold. First, bootstrapping an on-chain order book isn’t easy—the technological and liquidity challenges on their own are enough to discourage many teams from trying. Secondly, and where the protocol’s true value lies, Serum gives DeFi protocols a network of liquidity that they can each tap into, resulting in cost savings and UX improvements for their users.

To visualize this, imagine there being two Serum-powered protocols, DEX A and DEX B. A user of DEX A could place a sell order on the Serum order book, which is then filled by a user of DEX B, without them ever knowing that they interacted with each other. In fact, cross-protocol interactions like these happen constantly between users of different projects in the Serum network since they all utilize the same pool of liquidity. This “liquidity network effect” increases the market depth and capital efficiency for everyone involved.

**On Traction and Defensibility**

In just over a year since Serum’s launch, it has cemented itself as perhaps the most important piece of DeFi infrastructure on Solana to date. The protocol itself directly captures [$1.62B](https://defillama.com/protocol/serum) in total value locked (TVL), making it the second-largest DeFi project on Solana. In addition, SRM, Serum’s native token, is held by [over 35,000](https://solscan.io/tokens) unique wallets, far higher than many other protocols.

Most impressive is how it has become the DEX middleware of choice for many of the ecosystem’s most successful projects. Raydium, an order book AMM with over $2B in TVL and $28B in total trading volume, is powered by Serum. Atrix, another “Serum AMM” with nearly $500M in TVL, also composes directly with the protocol. There are too many others to name.

&amp;#x200B;

In sprawling its tentacles across Solana-based projects, Serum has delivered on its promise to be the core liquidity pool of the ecosystem. And, since much of the project’s value comes from these powerful network effects, Serum is well-positioned to defend against new competitors.

As the ecosystem goes cross-chain, Serum will need to level up. The project’s original whitepaper placed enormous emphasis on the promise of cross-chain swaps and contracts, identifying them as two of the project’s “seven main ingredients.” However, after nearly a year these features have yet to be deployed.

Despite the delay, Serum could have new cross-chain initiatives up its sleeve. They [recently announced](https://coinrivet.com/raydium-and-serum-prepare-for-cross-chain-future-for-defi-on-solana/) intentions to build cross-chain infrastructure in conjunction with the Wormhole bridge to facilitate cross-chain liquidity, which would be a big step forward for the ecosystem. They are also [partnering](https://raydium.medium.com/bridge-the-gap-cross-chain-assets-come-to-raydium-74c12c7e155d) with Raydium to provide yield on cross-chain assets. While the cross-chain space is chock-full of competitors, old and new, Serum’s existing liquidity and the advantages of the Solana blockchain could give them the edge they need.

One thing’s for sure: we’re gearing up for an interesting next few quarters of DeFi innovation—on Solana and broadly—and Serum’s going to have to continue to fight to maintain their position. Successfully executing their cross-chain strategy could be the decisive factor of their future trajectory.

**Under the Hood of SRM Tokenomics**

Serum has two types of tokens: Serum (SRM) and MegaSerum (MSRM).

Serum (SRM) is the protocol’s primary native asset. It’s native to the Solana blockchain (as an SPL token), but is also tradable as an ERC-20 token. Three elements give the token value. First, SRM tokenholders pay lower fees on Serum-powered transactions, proportional to the SRM holdings in their wallet. For example, a non-SRM-holder would pay 22bps as a taker, whereas a wallet that holds 1,000 SRM would pay 18bps, saving 4bps. Second, SRM is also the protocol’s governance token. While on-chain governance hasn’t been fully deployed yet, SRM tokenholders have [already begun](https://forum.projectserum.com/) to propose and vote on grant proposals, changes to the protocol’s fee structure, and more.

The third, and most direct, form of value accrual to the token comes from the protocol’s fee revenue. The protocol’s revenue is allocated as follows: 20% to the GUI or project (e.g., Raydium) and the remaining 80% to “buying-and-burning” SRM.

The buy-and-burn model is a simple yet powerful way of aligning token value with Serum’s usage. Each week, a [smart contract](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Gtc24cVFkpRnH4qWatY4nsAqQipnJGLAsE5fJChdRMgm) collects 80% of the period’s revenues, purchases SRM on the open market, and burns the tokens. This results in a “dividend” of sorts for tokenholders, countering token emission and driving long-term value. Ever since Binance [popularized](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/121046/binance-17th-quarterly-bnb-burn-largest) the burn mechanism, it has been commonly used by protocols of all kinds, particularly revenue-generating exchanges like Serum.

As of writing, 2,437,373.95 SRM have been burned this year, equating to nearly $15M USD in value burned (accounting for weekly price changes). On average, about $350K in SRM is burned per week. The buy-and-burn program, as anticipated, correlates highly with Serum’s DEX volume.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9q6jhqcv07481.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c387d1432e4ff771879a020e205cb12ca000431

The protocol’s second asset is MegaSerum (MSRM). 1 MRSM is created by locking 1,000,000 SRM. The main utility of MRSM is for nodes; each node must hold at least 10,000,000 SRM and 1 MRSM to participate. In addition, MRSM holders receive enhanced rewards when compared to the same quantity of “unlocked” SRM.

The token emission schedule is especially important to study. When the project launched in August 2020, 10% of the total supply (1 billion) was unlocked with the remaining 90% (9 billion) locked for a year. After the one-year lock-up expired, the other 9 billion SRM unlock linearly over 6 years until August 2027, resulting in a total of 10 billion SRM tokens in circulation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d171cgbx07481.png?width=2999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f047cbd2642bd24ea6abd5efc41f75a6a51d9b

Today, a few months into the vesting schedule, SRM has a total supply of 1.1 billion SRM (11% unlocked), but only 133 million SRM are actually in circulation. This means there are over 900 million SRM still held by team members, vested to early investors, locked in smart contracts, or otherwise out of circulation, in addition to the other 9 billion locked SRM. This amounts to only 1.3% of SRM’s future supply currently in circulation.

To see how this figure compares to the broader ecosystem, just look at the proportion of circulating Y2050 projected supplies of other DEXes: Curve (18.23%), Uniswap (41.66%), DODO (11.16%), dYdX (5.63%), 0x (84.55%), and Raydium (13.61%), to name a few. While it’s difficult to make a true apples-to-apples comparison since each of these protocols has very different tokenomics, SRM stands apart as being particularly low. This is somewhat concerning for current tokenholders: low liquidity can amplify market volatility and future token unlocks will dilute existing investors.

As a result of this low circulation proportion, the protocol’s fully-diluted valuation (FDV), which takes into account the large number of locked SRM on the sidelines, is around $75B. This would value Serum at more than the combined FDVs of Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Curve—the three largest DEXes—at current prices, despite having substantially lower transaction volume.

This has spurred a broader conversation in the Serum community around the project’s tokenomics, which [has intensified](https://forum.projectserum.com/t/tokenomics-the-elephant-in-the-room-serums-fdv/205/46) in recent weeks. In particular, community members seem to be asking for greater clarity on the distribution of tokens (including VCs and other insiders), any financial agreements or investments into other projects, and the plan for decentralized governance moving forward as a DAO. The team has begun to address some of these concerns, but more answers will be necessary.

**Looking Forward**

When thinking about the future of Serum, coming up with specific projections is a fool’s errand. From a bigger-picture standpoint, however, there are two main questions to be resolved.

First, what is the outlook on the future of the Solana DeFi ecosystem?

The recent explosion of projects, uptick in usage, and general excitement around Solana should not be underestimated; the nascent blockchain has struck a balance with the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition) that is attractive to both users and developers. Solana is not going away and, while an imminent “flippening” is unlikely, it is a worthy challenger to Ethereum and will continue to form an important part of the smart contract universe.

Using Ethereum’s growth as a baseline, Solana is still at the very beginning of the curve, having passed $5B in TVL only a few months ago. If DeFi on Solana continues on its current trajectory (and that of Ethereum), it could conceivably surpass $100B in TVL in less than six months.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s8lxv0d017481.png?width=2999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70abd20c38489f8dbb08a8a1df2ec8979a9d94e7

Second, how much of the Solana DeFi ecosystem’s growth will be captured by Serum?

This is a far more difficult question to answer. It relies on a number of factors: continued innovation from the core team, the resolution of community criticism, and defensibility against new (and cross-chain) competitors, to name a few.

Over the past six months, Serum’s volume (and SRM’s token price) has more or less followed the growth of DeFi on Solana. While Serum’s volume is certainly more erratic, it seems to directly benefit from an expanding Solana ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5meest417481.png?width=2999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24475ca9325e3440d805407db3af1f8b8342ab64

The bull case, then, is that as DeFi on Solana continues to flourish, Serum will serve as an essential part of liquidity infrastructure for the entire ecosystem, earning protocol fees that accrue to the SRM token. The protocol’s liquidity network effect is a strong moat that could cement Serum as an essential DeFi “lego block” for years to come. It is also a bet on order book DEXes continuing to chip away at the hegemony of AMMs; it’s not difficult to imagine decentralized order books comprising a multiple-billion-dollar market themselves.  
The bear case, however, is that either (a) Serum will lose its market position as the dominant on-chain order book for Solana (and cross-chain) as new competitors enter, or (b) concerns around SRM’s token supply and distribution embroil the project and fail to deliver returns to investors.  
Regardless of Serum’s future, it’s important not to forget the project’s groundbreaking journey. In around a year, the project has built among the first truly decentralized on-chain order books, been a key enabler of the entire Solana DeFi ecosystem, and has settled tens of billions of dollars in the process. Serum, by most standards, has been successful in delivering on its ambitious promises.  
Today, Serum is preparing for the industry’s next leg of growth: a ballooning Solana ecosystem, novel DeFi innovations, and cross-chain interoperability. Whether Serum can remain the industry-leading “liquidity middleware” remains unclear. If they do, the opportunity is massive."

Hi all! I finished A levels last year, and am currently thinking about my future while serving the military (mandatory in my country). I am considering getting into Fintech, and want to know the better way to get into it- via traditional finance or computing. Please advise 🙏

For background knowledge: Was previously a science student. I know for sure that I like finance but I’m not sure about computing. I’ve tried CS50 but it’s really challenging for me and most of my friends have said the same. However, I cannot discount the fact that CS50’s learning curve is very steep and I haven’t tried other courses as of yet. Physics and Mathematics were also my strongest subjects, which is, from what I’ve heard, somewhat related to computer science in terms of reasoning.

If I do plan on studying finance, I’m considering mainly LSE and KCL

For computing, it’ll be ICL and UCL"

**1.** **What is \[Redacted\]? (** [🦋](https://emojipedia.org/butterfly/), [🦋](https://emojipedia.org/butterfly/))

How did \[Redacted\] begin? How did it all start?

It started as a proposal by 0xsami focused on acquiring CRV, CVX, and other relevant governance tokens to expand Olympus DAOs reach beyond risk-free value and expand into a multi-token ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

[\[Chain of Events\]](https://preview.redd.it/ajdtrvvakb481.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ef4bfa398b2ce13666aa39eaac1986cef491390)

**TLDR;**

**\[REDACTED\]** incentivizes bonding tokens from the Curve ecosystem into treasury in exchange for the **$BTRFLY** token.

Each **$BTRFLY** token is backed by value from the Curve ecosystem locked in the DAO treasury. **$BTRFLY** is an ERC20 token, but will bridge the core components and token to whatever chains Curve scales to.

The strategies employed through bonding allow **\[REDACTED\]** to accumulate voting power in the Curve gauge and utilize that power to vote on the behalf of minters ensuring their interests are best represented in the Curve gauge.

In addition to an aggregation of voting power, when utilizing Curve LP tokens to mint **$BTRFLY**, users are receiving a maximized yield and are in possession of a liquid token that is securely backed by stable assets. **$BTRFLY** is primarily backed by the stablecoin LP tokens, remaining relatively stable regardless of the market dynamics.

**$BTRFLY**. will be the latest building block in the Curve governance that aims to accumulate as much veCRV (and CVX) as possible through the mechanics of **OlympusDAO**.  🤯

**$BTRFLY**. is also leveraged for unlocking liquidity in the Curve ecosystem, in exchange for bonding Curve tokens to the treasury, we will give up a liquid alternative in the form of **$BTRFLY**.

In its future — **\[REDACTED\]** will become a core piece in the curve economy where the whole ecosystem and monetary policy are managed by the **\[REDACTED\]**  Cartel (aka a DAO). This way we guarantee transparent decision making and long-term stability.

Plug CEO Andy Marsh in Forbe’s “Why Hydrogen Will Likely Be The Gateway To Net-Zero”,https://www.reddit.com/r/plugpowerstock/comments/rc0od0/plug_ceo_andy_marsh_in_forbes_why_hydrogen_will/,Psyched_investor,16,2021-12-09 04:51:30,2,/r/plugpowerstock/comments/rc0od0/plug_ceo_andy_marsh_in_forbes_why_hydrogen_will/,News,"When Plug Power Inc. hosted its grand opening of a fuel cell and electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Rochester, N.Y this year, it explicitly said that hydrogen produced from clean energy would be the next big thing — and something just around the corner. Indeed, the Plug Power Innovation Center will ramp up production of its electrolyzers that are critical to decarbonizing the global economy. 

What makes this possible is the falling cost of solar and wind energy. And now the hardware is also becoming more affordable — especially the electrolyzers, which are central to hydrogen production: they split apart the hydrogen and oxygen from water. Meanwhile, governments around the globe see hydrogen as a catalyst to net-zero and are targeting monies to research and development. 

“We have made solar more competitive than coal,” says Andy Marsh, chief executive of Plug Power, in a conversation with this writer. “So how do you make green hydrogen competitive with natural gas? Governments are accelerating it,” he says, noting that the hardware portion is not that problematic. “The Department of Energy thinks you can cut the cost of an electrolyzer by two-thirds by 2030.”

Today 99% of all hydrogen is produced in reactions involving coal and natural gas, and is considered “grey hydrogen” that does nothing to limit CO2 emissions. The goal is to produce hydrogen from low-carbon energy sources — “green hydrogen” — and expand its use into the transportation and power generation sectors. 

In its Hydrogen Economy Outlook, Bloomberg New Energy Finance says that the gas could supply 24% of the world’s energy demands by 2050 while cutting CO2 levels by 34%. But that requires proactive policies and new investment. If all the pieces fall into place, hydrogen produced from wind and solar could cost between $0.8 and $1.6 a kilogram. That is roughly the cost of natural gas. 

Hydrogen-powered cars have advantages over electric vehicles, says Marsh. Delivery trucks, for example, offer fast fueling and double the range of a battery: “If you move a vehicle 150 kilometers, you want to carry packages, not batteries.” Besides the giga-factory to make electrolyzers, Plug Power has more than 165 refueling stations. It is also constructing multiple green hydrogen production plants to make 500 tons of liquid green hydrogen a day by 2025; liquid hydrogen is easier to transport to its customers, including Amazon, Home Depot, and Walmart.

Green Lights Ahead

CEO Marsh says that the company is on track to build out 70 metric tons of green hydrogen per day by the third quarter of next year. That compares to the current global capacity of 300 metric tons that is produced from fossil fuels. So almost 20% of hydrogen production next year will come from clean sources, he says: green hydrogen will follow a similar cost reduction trajectory to renewable energy, and ultimately, it will be the lowest cost fuel for transportation. 

Toyota Motor Corporation and Hyundai Motor Company are betting big on it. Meantime, FedEx has a delivery truck running on hydrogen in New York State. It has a range of 240 kilometers on a full tank. Generally, a hydrogen station can service 400 cars a day with fill-ups lasting three minutes.

The advantages of hydrogen are that it is abundant, renewable, and non-polluting. Water vapor is the only byproduct of a fuel cell car that runs on hydrogen. But it is about 30% more expensive to move it via pipelines than carrying natural gas.

Furthermore, the International Renewable Energy Agency says that when hydrogen is produced, about 70% of the energy content is lost. However, that inefficiency is irrelevant if hydrogen is created from solar power that is abundant and free and it would become cheaper than prevailing fuel sources. The agency notes that hydrogen supply costs are now 1.5 times to 5 times that of natural gas per unit of energy. 

It adds that the learning curve linked to creating hydrogen is steep but worth it — no matter the fuel that is used: pipelines are getting built to carry the fuel to where it is consumed. That will reduce the need for new infrastructure investment, accelerating the transition from “grey hydrogen” to “green hydrogen.” 

The market for hydrogen technology is global. Plug Power is expected to join with Fortescue Future Industries to build a giga-factory in Queensland, Australia, to produce electrolyzers. Meantime, Plug Power is likely to work with Egypt’s OCI NV and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to make green hydrogen with its electorlyzer. And Plug announced a joint venture with South Korea’s E&amp;S to accelerate the use of hydrogen for power generation in Asian markets.

“Walmart told us that if we wanted to scale this, we had to take over the whole value chain,” says Plug’s Marsh. “This has driven Plug Power” to expand from fuel cells into electrolyzers and fueling stations.

Breakthrough Agenda

Hydrogen could, indeed, become the gateway to a decarbonized planet. Here in this country, the U.S. Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act authorizes and appropriates $9.5 billion for clean hydrogen research, development, and demonstration programs. The law includes a $1 billion program to cut the cost of producing hydrogen using electrolyzers. And the U.S. Build Back Better Act, which is currently in review by the U.S. Senate, includes a hydrogen production tax credit of $3 per kilogram.

At COP26, 42 countries endorsed the ‘Breakthrough Agenda.’ The goal is to ensure affordable low-carbon hydrogen is globally available by 2030. To that end, the European Commission will target $1 billion to the effort. 

In the meantime, the United Arab Emirates and Germany are expected to grow their cooperation on green hydrogen. The UAE separately announced its ‘Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap’ and targets a 25% global market share of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030. And Japan announced a $100 million investment to convert fossil-fired plants into ammonia- and hydrogen-based plants while South Korea has set aside $40 billion to expand its hydrogen infrastructure by 2040 — from production tools to fuels cells to filling stations.

If Plug Power’s Andy Marsh is right, producing hydrogen from green energy is within sight. A lot of progress has occurred over two decades: cheaper wind and solar prices along with improved electrolyzer engineering. And favorable public policies are attracting capital. Hopeful signs are everywhere — as long as they are not obfuscated by complacency.

Anyways I am decidedly fucked and am trying to scrape together some cash for a good AWD or 4WD used car or maybe a reasonably affordable new car that I can finance. Wanted to ask if anyone had any solid suggestions on the above. The Corolla was perfect because it was cheap to maintain and had excellent gas mileage, hoping I can find something in that ballpark.

"TopShelf Finance - Mint Fully Decentralized Assets on Avalanche🔺, BSC🔶, and Fantom🟦. Interest Free Leveraged Positions up to 100x and Innovative Yield Farms, don’t miss out on TopShelf Finance - Decentralized Borrowing Protocol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/rcnulx/topshelf_finance_mint_fully_decentralized_assets/,jester_j,1,2021-12-10 02:29:53,3,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/rcnulx/topshelf_finance_mint_fully_decentralized_assets/,BSC Token,"Discord:

\[TopShelf Finance\]([https://discord.gg/uJTNw4JN](https://discord.gg/uJTNw4JN))  


# Overview

TopShelf Finance is a multichain protocol for creating collateralized synthetic assets, such as the **USDL stablecoin**.

Based on Liquity and following in the path of some of the best DeFi protocols, TopShelf Finance is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.

The protocol will launch on **BSC, Fantom and Avalanche** and use BNB and 3EPS tokens for collateral on BSC, FTM and g3CRV on Fantom, and AVAX and av3CRV on Avalanche.

# Why TopShelf?

The stablecoin landscape is increasingly competitive with a new generation of protocols allowing more and more collaterals, often weakening the strength and decentralization of their stablecoins. TopShelf value proposition is simple, USDL is backed by the native token of the chain it exists on. It’s non custodial and immutable meaning it’ll be there forever, in the same state it will be from day one.

TopShelf is a decentralized borrowing protocol for taking out interest-free loans against collateral. Loans are paid out in a synthetic token (for example the USDL stablecoin, or BNBL, a *synthetic token* pegged to the price of BNB) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.

There are two primary use-cases for Topshelf synthetic assets:

1. Earning yield as a liquidity provider or by depositing into the Stability Pool, without losing long exposure to the collateral.
2. Entering into a leveraged long or short position.

## Earning Yield through Stability Pools

For each synthetic token, there is a corresponding Stability Pool. The Stability Pool is designed to absorb debt from liquidations, and reward depositors with the liquidated collateral. Users stake their tokens into the Stability Pool, and receive a portion of all liquidated collateral in proportion to their deposit size. Stakers additionally receive incentives in LIQR, the native protocol token.

## Earning Yield as a Liquidity Provider

For each synthetic Topshelf asset, there will be a corresponding Curve pool (Ellipsis on BSC). Liquidity providers for these pools will be incentivized with LIQR, as well as earning a portion of the trade fees generated by the pool.

## Opening Leveraged Positions

Topshelf enables interest-free leveraged positions of up to 10x on BNB, FTM, and AVAX. For example: to go long on BNB a user would deposit BNB, mint USDL, sell the USDL for BNB, then redeposit this BNB and repeat the same process. Entering or exiting a leveraged position is possible in a single transaction, using a flashloan.

# The LIQR token

LIQR is the native protocol token for Topshelf. It is given as an incentive to early users of the protocol in order to encourage healthy liquidity within the system and on related decentralized exchanges.

LIQR is a revenue-sharing token. 100% of fees generated by the protocol are distributed proportionally to LIQR stakers. As Topshelf is immutable and governance-free, holding LIQR does not convey any governance rights.

## Tokenomics

* 6% added as initial liquidity for LIQR
* 9% distributed to participants in the initial liquidity event (ILE)
* 25% evenly distributed between the Stability Pools over 6 years
* 20% reserved for 3rd party AMM incentives over 6 years
* 20% as incentives for LIQR LP token stakers over 3 years
* 20% vested for the Topshelf team over 3 years

Note that all token emissions use a halving schedule. Over a six year release period this means that 50% is released in the first year, 25% in the second, etc. with 98.5% of tokens released after six years. Beyond this time emissions will be so small as to be negligible.

## The Initial Liquidity Event

Topshelf will be kicking off with an Initial Liquidity Event (ILE) to ensure healthy ongoing liquidity for the native protocol token, LIQR.

The ILE will happen simultaneously on BSC, Fantom and Avalanche. At a specific time that we will announce soon, ILE contracts will open for deposits of BNB, FTM and AVAX depending on the chain. Deposits will be open to whitelisted participants only — **more information about the whitelisting process will be released shortly (join our Discord!)**. There will be an initial contribution cap allowing guaranteed entry for everyone who is whitelisted within the first hour. The cap will double each hour until being is removed at 4 hours in. The ILE will last for 24 hours, or until a hard cap of $5m is reached on that chain. The contracts additionally have a soft cap of $1m — once this is reached, **the contract will close for new deposits 6 hours later**. In the event the soft cap is *not* reached, participants will be able to withdraw their contribution after 24 hours.

Once the ILE finishes, the received tokens will be combined with 2% of the total LIQR supply to create initial liquidity on the respective chain’s DEXes: PancakeSwap, SpookySwap and TraderJoe. These LP tokens are permanently locked within the contract — the liquidity is “protocol owned” and cannot ever be removed.

Contributors to the ILE will receive 3% of the total supply of LIQR, distributed proportionally according to their contribution. Thus, all participants are at a 50% profit based on the initial price set in the LP token. The tokens are streamed out linearly over 30 days, starting from the same moment that LIQR emissions begin within the main protocol (less than 24 hours after the close of the ILE).

At any time during the 30 day stream period, a contributor may choose to withdraw their entire reward balance at once. In doing so, they must pay a 33% penalty on all outstanding vested tokens. The tokens paid in the penalty are then distributed evenly between the remaining users who have not taken an early exit. If every user takes an early exit, the remaining penalty tokens are burned.

**The initial liquidity event is planned in approximately one week with the exact date and time to be announced.**

## Incentives for LIQR LPs

LIQR incentives are given to users who provide liquidity for LIQR. These “pool 2” incentives are released on a shorter distribution schedule than the incentives for **Stability Pools** or other AMMs. This is done to encourage significant liquidity in the early stages of the protocol.

There is a 2% deposit fee when staking LIQR LP tokens, as well as a variable withdrawal fee starting at 8% and reducing to 0 at a rate of 1% per week. 50% of the fees received are deposited in the protocol treasury, adding to the protocol owned liquidity. The remaining 50% is held for 8 weeks, after which time the liquidity is withdrawn. At the time of withdrawal, the LIQR is burned and the paired token is sent as an incentive to the LIQR staking contract.

"NFTs, Cryptopunks, and Conceptual Art",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rd2bb7/nfts_cryptopunks_and_conceptual_art/,TonyGabaghoul,1,2021-12-10 14:28:33,2,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rd2bb7/nfts_cryptopunks_and_conceptual_art/,DISCUSSION,"Let me preface this essay by saying that the majority of art NFTs are stupid. They are mostly worthless art done in a relatively rudimentary fashion that does not take advantage of the digital medium in which they are presented. For example, if I went to a gallery in which 3D printed ceramics were being made and they all looked as though they were thrown on a pottery wheel, would it really be that special? Of course not, which is why 3D printed ceramics typically explore forms that are impossible to throw on a wheel. This shows the viewer a blend of technology based design with a traditional practice, thus developing a new category of art. 

As for art NFTs, quite a few of them are likely used for money laundering. However, many physical pieces of art are also used for laundering money, so this in itself cannot be used as an argument against the value of NFTs. In fact, dismissing NFTs entirely based upon this idea, is very similar to Charlie Munger saying that he will not invest in crypto because it is used by criminals. There are many studies that discuss how crime is funded more by fiat than BTC. Why would Munger be arguing against crypto using flawed logic? It is because he is afraid of a changing financial landscape that he is unfamiliar and uncomfortable with. That is fair on an emotional and human level, but it is also illogical, which is detrimental in investing.

One thing that the blockchain excels with is providing opportunity to people in new spaces that they otherwise would not have, such as investing, decentralized finance, liquidity pools and art collecting. With this new opportunity comes an enormous learning curve for those who have little-to-no previous experience with the subtly complex workings of these industries. For example, why would anyone buy a Cryptopunk for $10M USD when you can just take a screenshot of the image and make it your profile picture? One might buy a Cryptopunk for the same reason that another person might prefer to own the original Starry Night as opposed to buying a full scale print from a street vendor. One is an authenticated piece of work that can be traced back to the artist who created it, while the other is a replicate. They can both aesthetically pleasing and carry the same emotional weight to the viewer. However, one was created by Van Gogh, while the other was not.

This leads us more directly to NFTs and brings up the question, what makes Cryptopunks so valuable? Cryptopunks are the first NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. They are the standard for ERC-721 NFTs and serve as an inspiration for the modern crypto art movement. This inspiration stems from their artistically interesting innovation based upon their conceptual point of view, regardless of the viewer’s opinions on their aesthetic qualities. 

Cryptopunks are conceptual art as described by Sol Lewitt’s “Sentence on Conceptual Art” because they take a concept, which at times seems irrational, and explore it fully. The concept is a standard kit of digital parts that can be used in combination to make a large variety of similar pieces that form a set. The 10,000 punks were algorithmically generated using code based on standard parts each with their own rarity. 

Next, Cryptopunks are created without influence from the two artists (John Watkinson and Matt Hall) after their concept was created. This is due to the artist’s removal from the process the moment they allowed the code to generate the Punk’s forms. From a conceptual art point of view, this follows sentence 6 from Sol Lewitt’s “Sentences on Conceptual Art” which states, “If (an) artist changes (their) mind midway through the execution of the piece (they) compromise the result and repeat past results.” 

I like to think that Sol Lewitt would appreciate Cryptopunks, if not for their aesthetic value, then for their conceptual innovation in the evolving world of digital art. After all he liked to explore the cube in his works because in his own words, “The most interesting characteristic of the cube is that it is relatively uninteresting.“ Lewitt’s work with cubes demonstrates the fact that the units involved in a work of art need not be the most interesting because the combination of the units is what creates the art. 

Prominent NFT projects that follow Cryptopunks tend to follow the conceptual blueprint laid out by John Watkinson and Matt Hall. These projects include the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Rabbitars, and Loaded Lions among many others. None of these projects elaborates on the conceptual innovation brought forth by Cryptopunks, however, they allow a wider audience to join the NFT space based upon their various aesthetic qualities, prices, and availability. Why would anyone want to own one of these NFTs that are essentially knocking off the concept of Cryptopunks? To use another physical art analogy, one might prefer the impressionist art of Claude Monet and another might prefer the art of Edouard Manet. The aesthetic qualities and the values of the pieces from the two artists might play an important role in why one art collector would prefer one artist over the other.

To conclude, NFTs are an emerging innovation in both the art and technology world. Many people are both confused by high prices and the simplicity of replication and believe NFTs can only be used as a means for money laundering. Art collecting has never been an affordable hobby, however, the internet and blockchain make it more visible to the average person. If a work of art is not aesthetically pleasing to one viewer, it does not mean that the art is bad or worthless.

TLDR: Cryptopunks go brrr but maybe they aren’t meant for you because of aesthetics and/or price, which is no different than any other piece of art ever made."

In this post I’ll share the experience and knowledge learned from making a yield optimizer.

A bit of background, I made my money in a professional field and then later decided to move to Bali. I lived a laidback loafing lifestyle in this island, even opened several small businesses near the beach, a café and a minimart, which were doing quite well actually up until COVID19 hit, then WHAM had to close down all of them. The thought of going back stateside to look for a new job was unappetizing, to say the least, after getting used to such a relaxing lifestyle in the tropics. Fortuitously though, WSB Yolo, Crypto trading and DeFi have been good to me, good enough at least to cover living expenses.

I started playing with DeFI on ETH back in January and then jumped over to BSC due to the low gas fees. I went ahead and tried all the available BSC yield optimizers, later found out that unfortunately most optimizers boost their APYs by issuing reward tokens in exchange for  &gt;25% of your hard earned farming token profit. The practice of rewards token minting, unless you are a giant with compounding network effect growth like Pancakeswap (PCS), will most likely cause those tokens to drop &gt;90% in value. This means even if all those BSC flash loan ***“exploits”*** hadn’t happened

· [https://www.bsc.news/post/pancakebunny-hit-with-another-flash-loan-exploit-this-time-on-polygon](https://www.bsc.news/post/pancakebunny-hit-with-another-flash-loan-exploit-this-time-on-polygon)

· [https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/30/belt-finance-victim-of-flash-loan-attack-in-latest-exploit-of-a-bsc-defi-protocol/](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/30/belt-finance-victim-of-flash-loan-attack-in-latest-exploit-of-a-bsc-defi-protocol/)

those tokens would’ve plummeted anyway albeit in a slower pace.

Another trend is leveraged yield farming, I consider this akin to a leveraged carry trade in traditional finance’s FX world. Spoiler alert, it seldom ends well for the traders and the saying “picking pennies in front of a steamroller” comes to mind. During a sharp price correction, like last week on Dec 4th for example, besides the delta and gamma risk, leveraged farmers also face infrastructure risk as BSC nodes tend to slow down to a crawl,  making them unable to top up their positions and consequently getting liquidated. When this occurs, steamroller drivers (the platform owners) are happy because they get 5% of the liquidated principal. With such conflicting interests on a single platform, the risk profile is worse then selling naked calls on $GME, you’re gonna end up like Melvin but without Mr. Griffin to bail you out.

Hence after moving around between lots of farms, I was mentally exhausted and simply craved for a farm with low fees, no gimmicks that just do simple restaking to automate the yields, something that I can deposit into and forget about without babysitting it too much. Then I thought hey, why don’t I make my own.

Well the process was more difficult then I thought it would be, so I had  to enter the metaverse and  commune with the elder shroom for help.

Fast forward a thousand trippy man-hours later and voila, a no frills low fee yield optimizer

[**https://HappyHippo.farm/**](https://happyhippo.farm/)

Before we continue, I’m  not  here to shill you this farm specifically but rather the thought process that went into  it, which I believe will be useful for you in making decisions  on yield optimizers. As this is a reference implementation there are no happyhippo tokens. In the following sections we will discuss LPs, vault mechanism, direct contract interactions and the security considerations that goes into an optimizer.

**So where’s the $CAKE vault you ask**  **?**

I know a lot of people here like to stack only $CAKEs,  regrettably today I don’t have a CAKE only vault to share with you. Seriously, if you just want to stack $CAKE please stick to the PCS vault as I’ve looked around at all the other cake compounding vaults and came to the conclusion that Pancakeswap’s (PCS) $CAKE autocompounding is simply the most secure and also probably the most profitable $CAKE stacker over the long run. After a thorough review, I concluded that I can’t bring value add to the existing PCS autocompounding $CAKE vault so I decided instead to focus  on optimizing  PCS LPs farms.

**Why LP pairs ?**

A quick recap, LPs or Flips are the tokens that liquidity providers get for facilitating the swapping in DEXes like PCS. They stake an equal value of paired tokens, and in return receive 0.17%-0.25% fees from each trade/swap that occurs in that pair. Think of LP pair as a way to reduce your delta risk while earning fees, if it’s a BNB pair, your delta risk vs the BSC ecosystem, or if it’s a USD pair your delta against the absolute value of your crypto assets.

You probably have heard of “impermanent loss” as a detrimental risk for LPs, though few seems to understand the actual effect.

[https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/](https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/)

Your relative token prices need to move &gt;50% for you to suffer only a 2% impermanent loss which you should be able to more then make up for in trading fees and farming rewards. Observe how splitting your investment into an LP pair flatten the profit/loss curve vs stacking a single token.

https://preview.redd.it/xfykb2pp3q481.jpg?width=884&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85b4b5e742c264b817ba9c77764888a44bf0a937

***Of course during a mega bull market like 2021, it’s more profitable to stack single coins compared to holding LPs, nonetheless crypto markets are extremely cyclic, entering 2022 if things starts to slow down a bit, you’ll see those LPs earnings far outperforming single tokens.***

**Since this is** /r/pancakeswap,  we’ll discuss two main types of PCS based yield optimizers LP vaults,  the cake maximizer and the flip maximizer vaults, these two constitutes \~80% of the 3B USD TVL in yield optimizers.

**1.** **Cake Maximizer Vaults**

*Processing img alb3l29u3q481...*

These vaults automatically harvest and autocompound your cake rewards by putting it into the CAKE staking pool.

**2.** **LP / Flip Maximizer Vaults**

https://preview.redd.it/mo60cgsv3q481.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9611d95f626898aa510c393b4a36a99cf82180da

These vaults autocompounds your LP tokens by automatically harvesting the cake rewards from PCS farms, converting it to LPs and redepositing it back to the LP PCS farms.

As you can see the mechanics are quite simple, the vault during normal operations doesn’t hold your funds, as 100% of it is  redeposited back into PCS farms or staking pools. Most yield optimizers in BSC complicates the base logic above by adding reward token minting and leverage, both of which is  economically unsustainable and can lead to security exploits

**On the security aspect of yield optimizers**

Examining BSC exploits year to date, almost all of them involved flashloan that manipulated the price of their reward tokens, however on the non reward token vaults, the funds denominated in other coins inside the vaults remain safe. Yield optimizers that don’t issue their own coin and do not use on chain token price in it’s vault logic like happyhippo, are not affected by this type of attack. Another recent DeFI exploit on badgerDAO, hacked the website's content delivery network (CDN) not the contract, by using Cloudflare’s CDN api to inject fake approval request; To mitigate this type of attack, users need to verify the contract address requesting approval is indeed the correct contract address. In summary, this year even tough there were many exploits, none touched the vault smart contracts directly, this shows that vaults smart contract security has matured somewhat catching up with traditional banking standards.

**Bypassing the website Frontend UI**

I’m sure a lot of you already know this but for those who don’t yet know, a Dapp website is just a frontend for the contract in the blockchain. If vault contracts are verified like in happyhippo’s case, you can deposit, withdraw and harvest from the vaults directly using bscscan.

Example;

For the Hippo Cake-BNB Cake Maximizer vaults, open this URL

[https://bscscan.com/address/0x8d7f50F076D1acE3E313b0b0B9c06916eAf41Bc4#writeProxyContract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x8d7f50F076D1acE3E313b0b0B9c06916eAf41Bc4#writeProxyContract)

Connect your wallet and manually enter the values you wish to withdraw from the write function withdraw.

One more thing, when you withdraw your token manually, remember to add the decimals, as BSC tokens like their ETH counterparts uses a trailing decimal system, so when you see 1.0 CAKE-BNB LP in your UI/Wallet for example, it’s actually 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 you need to input in bscscan, without the commas.

**On Yield Optimizer Fees**

For a yield optimizer, the fees matter more then the published APYs. There are two main types of optimizers in BSC. Those that take 30% of your token profit in exchange for minted reward tokens like pancakebunny and autoshark.  And those that take a lower percentage, \~5% of your farming profit but don’t give you reward tokens like beefy and autofarm. Obviously the bunny approach has failed so that gives us the second type such as beefy and autofarm. You may think that \~5% is low enough of a fee but depending on the LP pair you choose, that 5% can actually take more then 30% of the improved yield generated by the optimizer. To illustrate my point, first you need to know that an optimizer’s autocompounding improvement on the base APR is non linear.

Formula

**APY = (1 + APR/365) \^ 365 – 1**

https://preview.redd.it/y404z38y3q481.jpg?width=474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=affcdec2cd51c2c758848d1b66e23409ba6d31d0

If improving a 200% base APR, an optimizer will elevate it to 634% giving a 434% improvement. In that case a 5% fee looks very cheap. BUT

If improving on a 40% APR, which is the yield that most blue chip LP pair token  like CAKE-BNB has, then the optimized yield comes to 49%, only a 9% improvement. When the optimizer takes 5% of that, it works out to ( (5% x 49) / 9 )  \~27% of the net improvement generated, pretty steep.  I don’t understand why they have to set the performance fee so high, so for hippo I’ve set it to 2%, which I believe is the lowest in BSC to date.

**On the**  **Zap function**

https://preview.redd.it/5fwvmm8z3q481.jpg?width=250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2fa5254d2e169751fc459cdc81cb678db334f05

Zap is  a convenience function common in most yield optimizers that allows you to instantly convert your BNB, BUSD, USDT, BTCB directly into LP pairs but it's also much more then that as the zap contract is crucial for optimizers in order to perform  their $CAKE to LP compounding. Reading from the PCS roadmap,

[https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/roadmap](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/roadmap)

PCS is also well on its way in introducing this feature, naming it as single side liquidity. The thing that I noticed on many current optimizer Zap implementations is that some Zap contract assumes default swap routing to the BNB pair pool, even though some tokens don’t have much liquidity in BNB, like CHR-BNB for example. This can lead to very bad prices when using zap for those tokens. In the zap contract above, I’ve curated the route used to ensure the best prices possible.

**All those things considered, my current favorite picks for PCS based LP optimizer vaults are**

**CAKE-BNB CAKE and LP maximizer, 54% and 62% APY**

The bulwarks that need no introduction, If you are bullish on the BSC ecosystem in general then this is the LP token for you.

**USDC-BUSD 13.5%**

This is like the ultimate form of crypto magic for me. Sure you can deposit Turkish Lira and get 14% APY but there are no risk-free USD based investment that comes anywhere close to this yield, none, including bonds and real estates. Even if you go dumpster diving for junk bonds, making deals with the worst rated company in America, it’ll only get you a measly 6% yield tops. As for the issuer, I don’t think either Coinbase or Binance will suddenly go kaput, they are not Tether and they publish monthly audited reports on their asset backing that shows 100% in cash and cash equivalents.

**The Gaming LPs,**

**CHR-BUSD LP Maximizer, 111%**

You’ve played blockchain games right ? Though fun to play, investing in Play to Earn game tokens is extremely risky, just look at what happened to $ETERNAL a few days ago, you might be better off investing in the underlying game technology.  CHR is a relational + single sign in blockchain that is being used for a lot of application especially games, like My Neighbour Alice for example. You can stack CHR directly on their website, if that’s your thing go for it. Nevertheless if you’re bullish on CHR but want to reduce your delta risk vs USD, then get the LP tokens, put it in the Flip autocompounding vault,  then forget about it and  comeback a year later.

**The Yolo Play, ETERNAL-BNB LP Maximizer, 1,200% APY**

Price went from $800 to $2, a 99.8% drop. Dev announced they’re closing down the project, but wait there’s hope, rumor of some Cryptomine reborne in the making. Do you recall the time before $GME when WSB pumped  Hertz($HTZ), the bankrupt car rental company ? One ape reasoning was well the stock can’t go to 0, they have 200,000 cars. In a similar vein, doesn’t ETERNAL have 200,000 spaceships ? that has to be worth something right ? lolz. Not exactly the safest of investments, but if you’re feeling lucky, some bankruptcy play like HTZ did work out.

**Conclusion**

Wow you’ve actually made It this far through that wall of text and for that  I’m grateful for the time and attention you’ve given. In this post I’ve demonstrated a proof of concept no frills low fees yield optimizer and explained the basic mechanism of the vaults. Hopefully by now you’ve realized that the published APYs you see on optimizers doesn’t matter as much compared to how the underlying vault mechanism works. We also see PCS has stated in their roadmap that their Zap contract is implemented and awaiting FE integration, perhaps along with it will come an option in the PCS farming to autoconvert to LPs. Until that time comes, me and my friends are gonna stick to autocompounding in our own farm because we understand the ins and outs of it .

Market Efficiency Index: Ignorance really is bliss.,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/rdi88s/market_efficiency_index_ignorance_really_is_bliss/,girthygirthmonster,1,2021-12-11 04:47:59,4,/r/options/comments/rdi88s/market_efficiency_index_ignorance_really_is_bliss/,NaN,"I always tell people that if you're going to gamble at a casino, Texas Hold'em is the game that'll likely yield you the most.  This is because it can be measured by various means and you aren't playing against the house.  You're playing against other people like we are here.

Texas Holdem to penny slots would be Options to Texas Holdem (as far as putting into perspective just how powerful and capable trading options are).  Not only does it have a safety net of various kinds, but it's super liquid, TONS of measuring capabilities AND people can converse about it through tons of types of mediums.  Whether it is here or whalestream, there is insane capability to make money here that comes with overcoming the learning curve.

But, like anything in life though, there is a catch and for options, it is [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp)**.**

The term speaks for itself, *how efficient are the markets?* How about now compared to 2006?  Or 1919? All things considered, this is the markets ability to respond to information.  If the market was 100% efficient, nobody would ever make any money.  Prices would update immediately and reflect sentiment in real time.  Everything you know now, knew then and forecast are all taken into account and updated instantly.  On the contrary, if markets were severely inefficient, markets would be unresponsive to information or the lack of it.  Prices would be all over the place or sparsely representative of it's expected value.  Kind of sounds like today.

When I take what I have learned about economics, global economics, political science, psychology, mathematics and everything and anything else that is a component of measuring trading options, as of today, the math doesn't add up.  

GME is by far the greatest example of inefficacy ever seen before. The nature of it's situation even existing at all should be enough to anyone to know that market ***inefficacy*** (overall) is at it's highest. Big picture to GME is a re-newed concept of a cat/mouse between short vs long (individual owner) on the stock and the nature of this big picture concept alone may be perceived inefficiently, even propagated, but the truth is that under a ***fair playing field, it is in fact a behavior of efficiency.*** People should be able to see it's true short interest, the sentiment and make a choice around the idea of buying the stock regardless of their intentions because it's a free-market.  Why you purchase or trade stock/options is your choice just as much as it is for institutions to cheat, namely through derivatives (options) which, at it's roots, is center to many of the issues this market has seen over the past 20 years--deregulations with the derivatives market.  It isn't the stock itself manipulated (to extent), it is it's the stocks derivatives doing it and for over 20 years now, Wall Street has had it's way with the derivatives market being completely unregulated, even after 2008.  The dodd-frank act and all this regulation may as well be a front because the **source of inefficacy is here in the derivatives market.** It is where the heart of the beast is at.  It is mount doom and the outrageous path GME has taken thus far just may be the Frodo Baggins this market needs to correct efficiency not just for GME, but the overall market and what fuels the poison.  This is a new meta of investing (sparsely trading though) and the massive institutions short and still shorting GME are equipped with both capital and tools that the individual retail investor (GME or not) will never have or see in their lifetime--unless regulation happens. Even with that though, *there technically is regulation*, just in the wrong spot at the wrong time and even then, the road only end with fundamental ideology sourcing all this: greed.  Which, unfortunately, is an innate feature of who we are as a species.  A degenerative one at best too.  The means to cheat the game when possible and take from those lesser capable and lesser off for GME, really does paint the picture of ***David vs Goliath.***  

The simple truth is that it isn't a fair playing field for this meta and because of that, GME is inefficient. **Completely inefficient.**  Not just the stock price, but options price too (more so if anything).  Option price movement for meme stocks give some illusion to the idea of supply and demand is there until the stock randomly tanks (or goes up) by $150 for no foreseeable reason. Obviously, these things happen, but when you look at GME and you see how insanely random it's price movement is, the frequency behind it and the insane amount of missing information to justify it all, even trading sideways, it becomes clear that this stock is more than just a anomaly, namely a picture of something more sinister, it is a warning sign--one that paints a picture of market efficacy at risk which gives notion to the question: If this can happen with GME, how many others are abused as well?  Not the cat and mouse game concept, but the abusive behavior from these institutions.  

I think it's' important to talk about this because now more than ever, we are seeing an accelerating rate of market anomalies--namely with SPY.  I'm not suggesting that SPY is a GME scenario, but what I am suggesting is market inefficiency with not just one, but THE indexes that represent the overall market.  At this point in time, it's almost--if not entirely complete ignorance--to suggest otherwise about this claim to serious market inefficacy.  It's one thing to see an occasional thing with DOCU and another to see it happen to SPY and then see the frequency not only increase, but ACCELERATE. Fundamental roots of economics, behavioral psychology, finance and everything and anything used to measure this market have become almost entirely obsolete unless a new, dense variable is introduced to create buying/selling pressure in an expected way--like 9/11. As of right now, price movement of spy alone seems to be completely devoid of reality which then makes you wonder about everything else under this market.  It doesn't take a college degree either to see SPY move up 3-5% against new, worrisome information about the condition of the economy.  I mean, the writing is on the wall.  Compare this years movement of SPY against any other time in history.  Have we progressed SO much as a species or country to honestly warrant this type of growth?  Because both big picture and small picture both say the same: MARKET INEFFEINCY.

Now, with all that said, because markets right now are totally devoid of reality and now are just randomness and purely the subject of murphy's law, it's important to highlight the dangerous approach to trading options for SPY and anything and everything not Apple (for whatever reason).

To that, unless VIX is above 30 again and SPY is finally moving down at ac consistent rate, I encourage you to go play Texas Holdem with that money if you're trying to gamble.  This market CAN'T BE MEASURED RIGHT NOW and desperately needs a correction in order to measured using information we know about options trading today.  That or you can just do the opposite of what's expected and do well for yourself."

# **Fed is expected to speed up end of bond buying and signal interest rate hikes are coming - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/fed-is-expected-to-speed-up-end-of-bond-buying-and-signal-interest-rate-hikes-are-coming.html)**
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the Federal Reserve could decide to speed up the end of its bond-buying program and signal that it expects to start hiking interest rates in 2022.
*****
&gt; That is already widely anticipated by investors, ahead of the Fed’s meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Strategists don’t expect much market reaction, unless the central bank’s messaging includes a surprise or its forecast for interest rate hikes is more aggressive than expected.
*****
&gt; In testimony before a Senate panel on Nov. 30, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tipped the warning that the central bank would discuss speeding the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond purchases at the December meetings. His comments followed a parade of Fed speakers, who all suggested the central bank could end the program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks resumed their climb back toward highs after it became clear the omicron Covid variant is unlikely to cause a shutdown of the economy. Pfizer and BioNTech also gave investors some encouragement when announcing that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
&gt; # For now, a calm reaction to higher prices
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.9%, to a record close of 4,712.02. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The three major indexes also notched strong weekly gains: The S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8% and the Nasdaq added 3.6%. The Dow was the outperformer with a 4% jump.
*****
&gt; Investors largely shook off November’s inflation print in which the consumer price index gained 0.8% for the month and 6.8% over the previous year — the highest rate since 1982. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, added 0.5% for the month and gained 4.9% from a year ago — the sharpest increase since 1991.
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose during the week, but the 10-year Treasury yield traded at about 1.48% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “The bond market is taking some comfort in the Fed doing its job to address inflation,” said David Bianco, chief investment officer for the Americas at DWS Group. “To put this in context, if you go back to the 1960s, the average hiking cycle was 400 basis points.” One basis point is equal to 0.01%. That would mean four percentage points in rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Since 1982, if you start with the post great inflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s, since then the average hiking cycle is more like 250 to 300 basis points. The last cycle we got to 225 [2.25%]” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; “We’ve seen it has taken less. Maybe there’s a silver lining in that inflation is surprising the Fed,” he added. “It’s causing the Fed to act a little sooner and hopefully the message is also received on the fiscal side and they’re a little more right-sized and targeted in their spending.”
*****
&gt; Bianco expects two quarter-point rate hikes next year, with the first in June. The following year, the Fed could increase interest rates four more times, but he does not expect the fed funds rate to get much higher. The fed funds rate is the interest rate at which large banks lend to one another overnight.
*****
&gt; # Upcoming projections from the Fed
&gt; The central bank is expected to release its quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates when it releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell will brief reporters at 2:30 p.m.
*****
&gt; In November, the Fed announced it would wind down its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases at a pace of $15 billion a month. If it speeds up the process, strategists say it may finish by March.
*****
&gt; The bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, was put in place in early 2020 to help the economy and financial markets combat the impact of the pandemic. The Fed also had quickly slashed its fed funds target rate to zero.
*****
&gt; In its last forecast, the Fed’s so-called dot-plot chart of inflation forecasts shows that half the Fed officials expected one or two rate hikes next year, but there was no consensus for a hike. The first hikes were in 2023. That is likely to change in the updated forecast, with possibly two hikes penciled in for next year.
*****
&gt; Powell also acknowledged during his recent testimony that inflation could be more of a problem than the central bank thought, and that it was time to retire the description of inflation as “transitory,” or temporary. Indeed, the consumer price index for November surged to its fastest rate in nearly 40 years.

&gt; # Economic data to the forefront
&gt; There is some fresh inflation data in the week ahead. The producer price index is reported Tuesday. Other economic reports include retail sales Wednesday, and industrial production on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Bianco said the market is now fixated on the economy, which likely has surged this quarter compared to the tepid 2.1% annual growth rate of the third quarter. Economists expect an average 7% growth rate for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, according to the CNBC/Moody Analytics Rapid Update survey of economists.
*****
&gt; “In many ways, this cycle has aged quickly. The cycle is 2 years old, going on 7,” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse, also said the market’s focus is heavily on the economy as the Fed moves closer to raising interest rates. A strong economy allows the central bank to hike, and the market should keep going higher, Palfrey said.
*****
&gt; Credit Suisse strategists raised their 2022 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 to 5,200 in the past week because of the strong economy and improving earnings and margins.
*****
&gt; “At the end of the day, the Fed may have only recently changed their messaging on let’s say ‘transitory,’ but in reality, investors have been following the yield curve and inflation and the various dynamics, as well,” Palfrey said. “It doesn’t come as a surprise to many market participants that the Fed found themselves behind the curve and had to correct policy.”

&gt; # CPI vs 10 Year Yield and S&amp;P 500

&gt; With inflation levels surging this year, you would expect to see long-term interest rates right along with CPI. As illustrated in the chart below, though, that has been far from the case. Ever since y/y CPI first crossed 2% back in Q1, the yield on the 10-year has actually declined even as CPI has surged to 6.8%! Fed purchases of treasuries have helped to keep rates low, but if the market was truly worried about inflation pressures becoming a longer-term issue, you would expect to see at least some upward pressure in rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/10-yr-to-CPI-121021.png))**

&gt; While yields have seen little upside pressure from the surge in inflation, stock prices have piggy-backed the move higher the entire time. Investors continue to pile into stocks as low yields seemingly offer no other alternative and negative real yields in the treasury market make equities look more attractive on a relative basis.

&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak

&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.

&gt; This is what used to be known as the “January Effect:” small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

&gt; # Reversals

&gt; Earlier today in our Morning Lineup, we highlighted the fact that there has been a pretty remarkable about-face in market performance at the index level between now and a week ago. The table below compares the trailing 5-day performance of the major index ETFs as of the close on 12/8 versus the trailing 5-day performance as of the close on 12/1. Whether you look at the table or chart, it's pretty clear to see that performance over the last five days has been directly related to performance in the week prior. Indices that were down the most last week have bounced back the most this week, and indices down the least last week are up the least this week. With an r-squared of 0.8324, you can't get much more closely correlated than that.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120921-Index-ETF-Performance-768x278.png))**

&gt; While there has been a close correlation between performance at the index level, at the sector level, the relationship -- while still positive -- hasn't been nearly as strong. While some of the biggest losers in the week ending 12/1 like Industrials and Energy have been among the biggest winners over the last week, a sector like Real Estate that actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the week ending 12/1 is also one of the top-performing sectors over the last week. Additionally, Financials was the worst-performing sector on the way down last week with a decline of 6.6%, but it has also underperformed on the way up this week. As a result, while the r-squared of performance at the index level has been +0.83, the r-squared of performance at the sector level has been much lower at just +0.21.

&gt; # 6 Job Openings Surge

&gt; The BLS released October results of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey this morning showing a significant uptick in job openings. Openings totaled 11.03 million in October, slightly below the record of 11.098 million from this past July. Openings rose by 431K month over month which ranks as the biggest one-month uptick since July and is in the 94th percentile of all monthly moves.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Job-Open-1.png))**

&gt; While the JOLTS data is insightful, it is released at a decent lag. Job listings website Indeed, however, offers a higher frequency (daily) dataset with more up-to-date readings with the latest data available through November 26th. As we discussed ahead of the JOLTS release in last night's Closer, postings through this reading have been hitting new highs and are 57% above the February 2020 baseline reading. That comes with acceleration in new postings being put up on the site throughout the fall, but especially so in recent weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Indeed-New-Post.png))**

&gt; Indeed also offers a breakdown based on industry. As shown below, there are four industries that currently have postings that are twice as high as they were pre-pandemic. Ironically, given the fair degree of labor market slack, the human resources sector continues to top the list with postings almost 120% above the baseline level. Loading &amp; Stocks, Production &amp; Manufacturing, and Software Development are the other most in-demand industries through late November. The other end of the spectrum continues to include many reopening sensitive areas like Hospitality and Tourism (which has also been on the decline in recent weeks as shown in the next chart below), though, these too are now all above baseline levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Indeed-Industry.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, Hospitality and Tourism have seen a decline in postings recently likely as a result of rising case counts. Noting a few other industries, Banking &amp; Finance, Construction, Cleaning &amp; Sanitation, and Food Preparation &amp; Service have all seen an acceleration in postings.

&gt; # Breezy Does It - Chicago Home Prices the Last to Take Out Prior Bubble Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P Case Shiller home price indices for September 2021 were released recently and showed that home prices nationally are now up 47% from their prior highs made during the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. And notably, all 20 of the individual cities/regions tracked by S&amp;P Case Shiller have now eclipsed their prior housing bubble highs now that Chicago has finally moved above its prior high from September 2006. As shown below, home prices in Chicago are now 1% above those September 2006 levels.

&gt; Two cities -- Dallas and Denver -- have home price levels now that are 100%+ above their mid-2000 highs. Five more cities are up at least 50% from their prior housing bubble highs -- Seattle, Portland, Charlotte, San Francisco, and Boston.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/priorbubblehighs.png))**

&gt; You can see Chicago home price levels based on the S&amp;P Case Shiller indices just barely eclipsing their prior highs in the chart below:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/chicago.png))**

&gt; The pandemic has of course been a huge boon for home prices across the country. Below is a look at how much home prices are up versus levels seen in February 2020 just prior to COVID. Prices in Phoenix are up the most post-COVID at 45%, followed by San Diego and Tampa at 35%. Las Vegas, Charlotte, Miami, Dallas, and Seattle have all seen prices rise by 30%+, while the remaining cities are all up between 19% and 27%. Chicago, New York, and DC have seen home prices rise the least, but even these three cities are up ~20% since COVID hit. Like this type of analysis?

&gt; # Russell 2000 2% Spreads Between Intraday Highs and Lows

&gt; The Russell 2000 tracking ETF (IWM) has been particularly volatile as of late, and as of yesterday's close, there have been seven straight trading days in which there was a 2% spread between the intraday high and low. A streak of seven had not been reached since July 2020 (7/2), and the current streak is tied for the longest since 6/22/2020. During the COVID correction, this streak of 2% intraday ranges actually reached 41 days, which was then followed by two streaks of nine trading days in the spring and summer. While the Russell 2000 is up sharply again today, because it gapped higher, the streak is likely to end at seven trading days unless IWM trades below $221.45 or above $226.64.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/2020-to-now-2-pct-h-l-diff-12721-3.png))**

&gt; IWM has only had a streak of 41 or more three times since IWM began trading in late May of 2000. The longest streak came during the financial crisis from late 2008 through early 2009 when 67 consecutive trading days saw at least a 2% spread between IWM's intraday highs and lows. Although the market currently appears quite volatile, it is hardy unprecedented, and IWM has experienced periods where it has undergone significant volatility for much longer periods than the current streak.

&gt; # Will Omicron Ruin the Santa Rally?

&gt; Historically, December has been a great month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant causing major volatility and uncertainty. Still, we remain optimistic that the new worries will subside over the coming weeks and stocks will finish 2021 on a solid note.

&gt; # The Latest on Omicron
&gt; First things first, we are very excited to announce that tomorrow (Tuesday, December 7) we are set to release Outlook 2022: Passing the Baton. This will have all of our views on where we think the economy, stocks, and bonds are headed next year. Because the Outlook is coming out tomorrow, this week’s Weekly Market Commentary is shorter than normal, but hopefully just as impactful.

&gt; After 29 consecutive days without a single 1% move higher or lower for the S&amp;P 500 Index, news of Omicron broke the Friday after Thanksgiving and as a result, five consecutive days saw at least a 1% move up or down. Clearly Omicron and the uncertainty it brought with it showed everyone that stocks can’t stay calm forever.

&gt; Although we do expect this volatility to continue, it very well could be a buying opportunity. We’ve been living with COVID-19 for more than 20 months now. We’ve seen several variants and managed to move forward, and we expect a similar playbook to work once again. Admittedly, we don’t know how effective current vaccines are against Omicron, or how transmissible it is, but we do know that the appetite for another nationwide shutdown is quite low and that these questions should be answered over the coming weeks. We remain optimistic that the medical community will quickly create booster shots against the new variant if needed, paving the way for this economic recovery to move forward early next year.

&gt; # Will Santa Still Come in 2021?
December started off a little rocky, but we are still optimistic that the usual December bullish season will take place. For starters, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 1.5% on average during the final month of the year, with only April and November better. But no month is more likely to be higher, with December up close to 75% of time.

&gt; As shown in Figure 1, it turns out that the majority of the gains tend to take place during the second half of the month, so we could see a continued choppy market until we have more clarity over Omicron, which would match the typical strong second half of December action.

&gt; Where things get interesting is after a negative November (like we saw this year), December does even better, up 2.7% on average and higher 19 out of 22 times (86.3%). What about if stocks are having a great year heading into December? You guessed it, the jolliest month of them all does better. We found there were 15 times the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% for the year at the end of November and the month of December was up 11 of them with an average return of 1.7%; again, better than the average December return of 1.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/newsroom/read/wmc/lp_WMC-120621_01.png))**

&gt; # Conclusion
&gt; Omicron has put quite the wrinkle in the recent bull market, but stocks are still up more than 20% for the year, so it is good to put things in perspective. After more than a 110% rally from the March 2020 lows, perhaps investors needed a reminder that stocks can’t go up forever and that while volatility might be frustrating, it is perfectly normal.

&gt; We aren’t minimizing the Omicron uncertainty, but we remain bullish that the recovery is alive and well, with a very healthy consumer and corporate earnings backdrop leading the way. Buckle up though, as big swings on daily news could be here for several more weeks. But in the end, we expect any lost output due to Omicron to simply be pushed out and recovered by early next year.

# **Fed is expected to speed up end of bond buying and signal interest rate hikes are coming - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/fed-is-expected-to-speed-up-end-of-bond-buying-and-signal-interest-rate-hikes-are-coming.html)**
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the Federal Reserve could decide to speed up the end of its bond-buying program and signal that it expects to start hiking interest rates in 2022.
*****
&gt; That is already widely anticipated by investors, ahead of the Fed’s meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Strategists don’t expect much market reaction, unless the central bank’s messaging includes a surprise or its forecast for interest rate hikes is more aggressive than expected.
*****
&gt; In testimony before a Senate panel on Nov. 30, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tipped the warning that the central bank would discuss speeding the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond purchases at the December meetings. His comments followed a parade of Fed speakers, who all suggested the central bank could end the program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks resumed their climb back toward highs after it became clear the omicron Covid variant is unlikely to cause a shutdown of the economy. Pfizer and BioNTech also gave investors some encouragement when announcing that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
&gt; # For now, a calm reaction to higher prices
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.9%, to a record close of 4,712.02. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The three major indexes also notched strong weekly gains: The S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8% and the Nasdaq added 3.6%. The Dow was the outperformer with a 4% jump.
*****
&gt; Investors largely shook off November’s inflation print in which the consumer price index gained 0.8% for the month and 6.8% over the previous year — the highest rate since 1982. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, added 0.5% for the month and gained 4.9% from a year ago — the sharpest increase since 1991.
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose during the week, but the 10-year Treasury yield traded at about 1.48% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “The bond market is taking some comfort in the Fed doing its job to address inflation,” said David Bianco, chief investment officer for the Americas at DWS Group. “To put this in context, if you go back to the 1960s, the average hiking cycle was 400 basis points.” One basis point is equal to 0.01%. That would mean four percentage points in rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Since 1982, if you start with the post great inflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s, since then the average hiking cycle is more like 250 to 300 basis points. The last cycle we got to 225 [2.25%]” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; “We’ve seen it has taken less. Maybe there’s a silver lining in that inflation is surprising the Fed,” he added. “It’s causing the Fed to act a little sooner and hopefully the message is also received on the fiscal side and they’re a little more right-sized and targeted in their spending.”
*****
&gt; Bianco expects two quarter-point rate hikes next year, with the first in June. The following year, the Fed could increase interest rates four more times, but he does not expect the fed funds rate to get much higher. The fed funds rate is the interest rate at which large banks lend to one another overnight.
*****
&gt; # Upcoming projections from the Fed
&gt; The central bank is expected to release its quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates when it releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell will brief reporters at 2:30 p.m.
*****
&gt; In November, the Fed announced it would wind down its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases at a pace of $15 billion a month. If it speeds up the process, strategists say it may finish by March.
*****
&gt; The bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, was put in place in early 2020 to help the economy and financial markets combat the impact of the pandemic. The Fed also had quickly slashed its fed funds target rate to zero.
*****
&gt; In its last forecast, the Fed’s so-called dot-plot chart of inflation forecasts shows that half the Fed officials expected one or two rate hikes next year, but there was no consensus for a hike. The first hikes were in 2023. That is likely to change in the updated forecast, with possibly two hikes penciled in for next year.
*****
&gt; Powell also acknowledged during his recent testimony that inflation could be more of a problem than the central bank thought, and that it was time to retire the description of inflation as “transitory,” or temporary. Indeed, the consumer price index for November surged to its fastest rate in nearly 40 years.
*****
&gt; # Economic data to the forefront
&gt; There is some fresh inflation data in the week ahead. The producer price index is reported Tuesday. Other economic reports include retail sales Wednesday, and industrial production on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Bianco said the market is now fixated on the economy, which likely has surged this quarter compared to the tepid 2.1% annual growth rate of the third quarter. Economists expect an average 7% growth rate for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, according to the CNBC/Moody Analytics Rapid Update survey of economists.
*****
&gt; “In many ways, this cycle has aged quickly. The cycle is 2 years old, going on 7,” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse, also said the market’s focus is heavily on the economy as the Fed moves closer to raising interest rates. A strong economy allows the central bank to hike, and the market should keep going higher, Palfrey said.
*****
&gt; Credit Suisse strategists raised their 2022 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 to 5,200 in the past week because of the strong economy and improving earnings and margins.
*****
&gt; “At the end of the day, the Fed may have only recently changed their messaging on let’s say ‘transitory,’ but in reality, investors have been following the yield curve and inflation and the various dynamics, as well,” Palfrey said. “It doesn’t come as a surprise to many market participants that the Fed found themselves behind the curve and had to correct policy.”

&gt; # CPI vs 10 Year Yield and S&amp;P 500

&gt; With inflation levels surging this year, you would expect to see long-term interest rates right along with CPI. As illustrated in the chart below, though, that has been far from the case. Ever since y/y CPI first crossed 2% back in Q1, the yield on the 10-year has actually declined even as CPI has surged to 6.8%! Fed purchases of treasuries have helped to keep rates low, but if the market was truly worried about inflation pressures becoming a longer-term issue, you would expect to see at least some upward pressure in rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/10-yr-to-CPI-121021.png))**

&gt; While yields have seen little upside pressure from the surge in inflation, stock prices have piggy-backed the move higher the entire time. Investors continue to pile into stocks as low yields seemingly offer no other alternative and negative real yields in the treasury market make equities look more attractive on a relative basis.

&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak

&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.

&gt; This is what used to be known as the “January Effect:” small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

&gt; # Reversals

&gt; Earlier today in our Morning Lineup, we highlighted the fact that there has been a pretty remarkable about-face in market performance at the index level between now and a week ago. The table below compares the trailing 5-day performance of the major index ETFs as of the close on 12/8 versus the trailing 5-day performance as of the close on 12/1. Whether you look at the table or chart, it's pretty clear to see that performance over the last five days has been directly related to performance in the week prior. Indices that were down the most last week have bounced back the most this week, and indices down the least last week are up the least this week. With an r-squared of 0.8324, you can't get much more closely correlated than that.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120921-Index-ETF-Performance-768x278.png))**

&gt; While there has been a close correlation between performance at the index level, at the sector level, the relationship -- while still positive -- hasn't been nearly as strong. While some of the biggest losers in the week ending 12/1 like Industrials and Energy have been among the biggest winners over the last week, a sector like Real Estate that actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the week ending 12/1 is also one of the top-performing sectors over the last week. Additionally, Financials was the worst-performing sector on the way down last week with a decline of 6.6%, but it has also underperformed on the way up this week. As a result, while the r-squared of performance at the index level has been +0.83, the r-squared of performance at the sector level has been much lower at just +0.21.

&gt; # 6 Job Openings Surge

&gt; The BLS released October results of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey this morning showing a significant uptick in job openings. Openings totaled 11.03 million in October, slightly below the record of 11.098 million from this past July. Openings rose by 431K month over month which ranks as the biggest one-month uptick since July and is in the 94th percentile of all monthly moves.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Job-Open-1.png))**

&gt; While the JOLTS data is insightful, it is released at a decent lag. Job listings website Indeed, however, offers a higher frequency (daily) dataset with more up-to-date readings with the latest data available through November 26th. As we discussed ahead of the JOLTS release in last night's Closer, postings through this reading have been hitting new highs and are 57% above the February 2020 baseline reading. That comes with acceleration in new postings being put up on the site throughout the fall, but especially so in recent weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Indeed-New-Post.png))**

&gt; Indeed also offers a breakdown based on industry. As shown below, there are four industries that currently have postings that are twice as high as they were pre-pandemic. Ironically, given the fair degree of labor market slack, the human resources sector continues to top the list with postings almost 120% above the baseline level. Loading &amp; Stocks, Production &amp; Manufacturing, and Software Development are the other most in-demand industries through late November. The other end of the spectrum continues to include many reopening sensitive areas like Hospitality and Tourism (which has also been on the decline in recent weeks as shown in the next chart below), though, these too are now all above baseline levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Indeed-Industry.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, Hospitality and Tourism have seen a decline in postings recently likely as a result of rising case counts. Noting a few other industries, Banking &amp; Finance, Construction, Cleaning &amp; Sanitation, and Food Preparation &amp; Service have all seen an acceleration in postings.

&gt; # Breezy Does It - Chicago Home Prices the Last to Take Out Prior Bubble Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P Case Shiller home price indices for September 2021 were released recently and showed that home prices nationally are now up 47% from their prior highs made during the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. And notably, all 20 of the individual cities/regions tracked by S&amp;P Case Shiller have now eclipsed their prior housing bubble highs now that Chicago has finally moved above its prior high from September 2006. As shown below, home prices in Chicago are now 1% above those September 2006 levels.

&gt; Two cities -- Dallas and Denver -- have home price levels now that are 100%+ above their mid-2000 highs. Five more cities are up at least 50% from their prior housing bubble highs -- Seattle, Portland, Charlotte, San Francisco, and Boston.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/priorbubblehighs.png))**

&gt; You can see Chicago home price levels based on the S&amp;P Case Shiller indices just barely eclipsing their prior highs in the chart below:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/chicago.png))**

&gt; The pandemic has of course been a huge boon for home prices across the country. Below is a look at how much home prices are up versus levels seen in February 2020 just prior to COVID. Prices in Phoenix are up the most post-COVID at 45%, followed by San Diego and Tampa at 35%. Las Vegas, Charlotte, Miami, Dallas, and Seattle have all seen prices rise by 30%+, while the remaining cities are all up between 19% and 27%. Chicago, New York, and DC have seen home prices rise the least, but even these three cities are up ~20% since COVID hit. Like this type of analysis?

&gt; # Russell 2000 2% Spreads Between Intraday Highs and Lows

&gt; The Russell 2000 tracking ETF (IWM) has been particularly volatile as of late, and as of yesterday's close, there have been seven straight trading days in which there was a 2% spread between the intraday high and low. A streak of seven had not been reached since July 2020 (7/2), and the current streak is tied for the longest since 6/22/2020. During the COVID correction, this streak of 2% intraday ranges actually reached 41 days, which was then followed by two streaks of nine trading days in the spring and summer. While the Russell 2000 is up sharply again today, because it gapped higher, the streak is likely to end at seven trading days unless IWM trades below $221.45 or above $226.64.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/2020-to-now-2-pct-h-l-diff-12721-3.png))**

&gt; IWM has only had a streak of 41 or more three times since IWM began trading in late May of 2000. The longest streak came during the financial crisis from late 2008 through early 2009 when 67 consecutive trading days saw at least a 2% spread between IWM's intraday highs and lows. Although the market currently appears quite volatile, it is hardy unprecedented, and IWM has experienced periods where it has undergone significant volatility for much longer periods than the current streak.

&gt; # Will Omicron Ruin the Santa Rally?

&gt; Historically, December has been a great month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant causing major volatility and uncertainty. Still, we remain optimistic that the new worries will subside over the coming weeks and stocks will finish 2021 on a solid note.

&gt; # The Latest on Omicron
&gt; First things first, we are very excited to announce that tomorrow (Tuesday, December 7) we are set to release Outlook 2022: Passing the Baton. This will have all of our views on where we think the economy, stocks, and bonds are headed next year. Because the Outlook is coming out tomorrow, this week’s Weekly Market Commentary is shorter than normal, but hopefully just as impactful.

&gt; After 29 consecutive days without a single 1% move higher or lower for the S&amp;P 500 Index, news of Omicron broke the Friday after Thanksgiving and as a result, five consecutive days saw at least a 1% move up or down. Clearly Omicron and the uncertainty it brought with it showed everyone that stocks can’t stay calm forever.

&gt; Although we do expect this volatility to continue, it very well could be a buying opportunity. We’ve been living with COVID-19 for more than 20 months now. We’ve seen several variants and managed to move forward, and we expect a similar playbook to work once again. Admittedly, we don’t know how effective current vaccines are against Omicron, or how transmissible it is, but we do know that the appetite for another nationwide shutdown is quite low and that these questions should be answered over the coming weeks. We remain optimistic that the medical community will quickly create booster shots against the new variant if needed, paving the way for this economic recovery to move forward early next year.

&gt; # Will Santa Still Come in 2021?
December started off a little rocky, but we are still optimistic that the usual December bullish season will take place. For starters, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 1.5% on average during the final month of the year, with only April and November better. But no month is more likely to be higher, with December up close to 75% of time.

&gt; As shown in Figure 1, it turns out that the majority of the gains tend to take place during the second half of the month, so we could see a continued choppy market until we have more clarity over Omicron, which would match the typical strong second half of December action.

&gt; Where things get interesting is after a negative November (like we saw this year), December does even better, up 2.7% on average and higher 19 out of 22 times (86.3%). What about if stocks are having a great year heading into December? You guessed it, the jolliest month of them all does better. We found there were 15 times the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% for the year at the end of November and the month of December was up 11 of them with an average return of 1.7%; again, better than the average December return of 1.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/newsroom/read/wmc/lp_WMC-120621_01.png))**

&gt; # Conclusion
&gt; Omicron has put quite the wrinkle in the recent bull market, but stocks are still up more than 20% for the year, so it is good to put things in perspective. After more than a 110% rally from the March 2020 lows, perhaps investors needed a reminder that stocks can’t go up forever and that while volatility might be frustrating, it is perfectly normal.

&gt; We aren’t minimizing the Omicron uncertainty, but we remain bullish that the recovery is alive and well, with a very healthy consumer and corporate earnings backdrop leading the way. Buckle up though, as big swings on daily news could be here for several more weeks. But in the end, we expect any lost output due to Omicron to simply be pushed out and recovered by early next year.

**Mission Notes**  👀 

[Curve.Finance](http://curve.finance/) is the largest DeFi protocol with $20.8 billion in [total value locked](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/08/27/why-defi-pulses-key-metric-is-so-simple-its-confusing/) (TVL), according to CoinGecko. The protocol holds a vital place in the DeFi universe because of its CRV token rewards emissions – a key source of income for multiple other protocols and one of the foundational pillars of a rapidly growing $270 billion market.

Simply put, Curve Wars is the fight to acquire the most CRV rewards through the emission system.

# 

# 1. Provide Bribes for CRV Emissions  👀 

In a nutshell, Curve wars have stablecoin and wrapped liquidity protocols vying for CRV gauge emissions on Curve to power liquidity growth.

Curve Finance is now the largest automated market maker on Ethereum, with over $15 billion in TVL (almost double of Uniswap). Many stablecoin protocols have seen significant liquidity growth after receiving Curve Finance gauge emissions as liquidity providers pile in to earn CRV rewards.

At the same time, close to 51% of Curve governance owned by the Convex Finance community, which means that the Convex Finance community has a close to controlling vote to decide which liquidity pools receive CRV emission rewards, and in what quantities.

The amount of rewards received subsequently has a tangible impact on the growth of stablecoin liquidity pools for the various protocols.

[Curve Stats](https://preview.redd.it/u9bgewbolu481.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb884f72b299854278c6deb266f30c34d8c585d)

&amp;#x200B;

[Infiltration \[Redacted\]](https://preview.redd.it/w36zutwvlu481.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7cfa99d8a16061349e2c0f049bad87bd105f2df)

 **2. Infiltration: Protocol Owned liquidity**   👀 

Protocol-owned liquidity, on the other hand, places a focus on acquiring yield generating assets to be owned by the protocol treasury, and have the yields and asset growth feed back into the native protocol ecosystem.

Protocols developing a bonds treasury can offer native project tokens at a discount to accumulate assets that are of strategic importance to the protocol’s treasury.

In the case of Olympus, users can bond ETH, DAI, OHM-WETH LP and other tokens to back the protocol value. The assets accumulated become part of the DAO’s treasury for future use and deployment.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** **Rendezvous Point**  👀 

The suggested roadmap for \[Redacted\] participation in the Curve wars and development of protocol owned liquidity will be more than the sum of its parts.

A combination to develop a positive feedback cycle for the ecosystem, and a repeatable loop process for continual value accumulation.

This process is broadly as follow:

1. Lock up veCRV and submit gauge proposal to seek approval for rUSD-3CRV pool to receive CRV emissions on Curve.
2. Participate in Convex Finance and give bribes to Convex Finance community to generate CRV emissions for rUSD-3CRV LP pool.
3. Launch bonds offering to build DAO treasury for assets that are yield generating. This includes and are not limited to rUSD-3CRV, Curve tri-crypto assets, ETH LP 
4. Restake the DAO treasury to earn yield, buy back **$Btrfly** tokens.
5. Use the **$Btrfly** tokens repurchased to further incentivize CRV emissions via Convex Finance, launch new bonds offerings to grow treasury, thereby increasing the size of yield streams and treasury accumulated for the **$Btrfly** DAO.
6. Rinse, and repeat to continually accumulate assets and value.

**Report 1: To be continued….**

*****
&gt; In the coming week, the Federal Reserve could decide to speed up the end of its bond-buying program and signal that it expects to start hiking interest rates in 2022.
*****
&gt; That is already widely anticipated by investors, ahead of the Fed’s meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. Strategists don’t expect much market reaction, unless the central bank’s messaging includes a surprise or its forecast for interest rate hikes is more aggressive than expected.
*****
&gt; In testimony before a Senate panel on Nov. 30, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tipped the warning that the central bank would discuss speeding the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond purchases at the December meetings. His comments followed a parade of Fed speakers, who all suggested the central bank could end the program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
&gt; In the past week, stocks resumed their climb back toward highs after it became clear the omicron Covid variant is unlikely to cause a shutdown of the economy. Pfizer and BioNTech also gave investors some encouragement when announcing that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
&gt; # For now, a calm reaction to higher prices
&gt; Stocks rose on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.9%, to a record close of 4,712.02. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The three major indexes also notched strong weekly gains: The S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8% and the Nasdaq added 3.6%. The Dow was the outperformer with a 4% jump.
*****
&gt; Investors largely shook off November’s inflation print in which the consumer price index gained 0.8% for the month and 6.8% over the previous year — the highest rate since 1982. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, added 0.5% for the month and gained 4.9% from a year ago — the sharpest increase since 1991.
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose during the week, but the 10-year Treasury yield traded at about 1.48% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “The bond market is taking some comfort in the Fed doing its job to address inflation,” said David Bianco, chief investment officer for the Americas at DWS Group. “To put this in context, if you go back to the 1960s, the average hiking cycle was 400 basis points.” One basis point is equal to 0.01%. That would mean four percentage points in rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Since 1982, if you start with the post great inflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s, since then the average hiking cycle is more like 250 to 300 basis points. The last cycle we got to 225 [2.25%]” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; “We’ve seen it has taken less. Maybe there’s a silver lining in that inflation is surprising the Fed,” he added. “It’s causing the Fed to act a little sooner and hopefully the message is also received on the fiscal side and they’re a little more right-sized and targeted in their spending.”
*****
&gt; Bianco expects two quarter-point rate hikes next year, with the first in June. The following year, the Fed could increase interest rates four more times, but he does not expect the fed funds rate to get much higher. The fed funds rate is the interest rate at which large banks lend to one another overnight.
*****
&gt; # Upcoming projections from the Fed
&gt; The central bank is expected to release its quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates when it releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell will brief reporters at 2:30 p.m.
*****
&gt; In November, the Fed announced it would wind down its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases at a pace of $15 billion a month. If it speeds up the process, strategists say it may finish by March.
*****
&gt; The bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, was put in place in early 2020 to help the economy and financial markets combat the impact of the pandemic. The Fed also had quickly slashed its fed funds target rate to zero.
*****
&gt; In its last forecast, the Fed’s so-called dot-plot chart of inflation forecasts shows that half the Fed officials expected one or two rate hikes next year, but there was no consensus for a hike. The first hikes were in 2023. That is likely to change in the updated forecast, with possibly two hikes penciled in for next year.
*****
&gt; Powell also acknowledged during his recent testimony that inflation could be more of a problem than the central bank thought, and that it was time to retire the description of inflation as “transitory,” or temporary. Indeed, the consumer price index for November surged to its fastest rate in nearly 40 years.
*****
&gt; # Economic data to the forefront
&gt; There is some fresh inflation data in the week ahead. The producer price index is reported Tuesday. Other economic reports include retail sales Wednesday, and industrial production on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Bianco said the market is now fixated on the economy, which likely has surged this quarter compared to the tepid 2.1% annual growth rate of the third quarter. Economists expect an average 7% growth rate for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, according to the CNBC/Moody Analytics Rapid Update survey of economists.
*****
&gt; “In many ways, this cycle has aged quickly. The cycle is 2 years old, going on 7,” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse, also said the market’s focus is heavily on the economy as the Fed moves closer to raising interest rates. A strong economy allows the central bank to hike, and the market should keep going higher, Palfrey said.
*****
&gt; Credit Suisse strategists raised their 2022 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 to 5,200 in the past week because of the strong economy and improving earnings and margins.
*****
&gt; “At the end of the day, the Fed may have only recently changed their messaging on let’s say ‘transitory,’ but in reality, investors have been following the yield curve and inflation and the various dynamics, as well,” Palfrey said. “It doesn’t come as a surprise to many market participants that the Fed found themselves behind the curve and had to correct policy.”

&gt; # CPI vs 10 Year Yield and S&amp;P 500

&gt; With inflation levels surging this year, you would expect to see long-term interest rates right along with CPI. As illustrated in the chart below, though, that has been far from the case. Ever since y/y CPI first crossed 2% back in Q1, the yield on the 10-year has actually declined even as CPI has surged to 6.8%! Fed purchases of treasuries have helped to keep rates low, but if the market was truly worried about inflation pressures becoming a longer-term issue, you would expect to see at least some upward pressure in rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/10-yr-to-CPI-121021.png))**

&gt; While yields have seen little upside pressure from the surge in inflation, stock prices have piggy-backed the move higher the entire time. Investors continue to pile into stocks as low yields seemingly offer no other alternative and negative real yields in the treasury market make equities look more attractive on a relative basis.

&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak

&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.

&gt; This is what used to be known as the “January Effect:” small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

&gt; # Reversals

&gt; Earlier today in our Morning Lineup, we highlighted the fact that there has been a pretty remarkable about-face in market performance at the index level between now and a week ago. The table below compares the trailing 5-day performance of the major index ETFs as of the close on 12/8 versus the trailing 5-day performance as of the close on 12/1. Whether you look at the table or chart, it's pretty clear to see that performance over the last five days has been directly related to performance in the week prior. Indices that were down the most last week have bounced back the most this week, and indices down the least last week are up the least this week. With an r-squared of 0.8324, you can't get much more closely correlated than that.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120921-Index-ETF-Performance-768x278.png))**

&gt; While there has been a close correlation between performance at the index level, at the sector level, the relationship -- while still positive -- hasn't been nearly as strong. While some of the biggest losers in the week ending 12/1 like Industrials and Energy have been among the biggest winners over the last week, a sector like Real Estate that actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the week ending 12/1 is also one of the top-performing sectors over the last week. Additionally, Financials was the worst-performing sector on the way down last week with a decline of 6.6%, but it has also underperformed on the way up this week. As a result, while the r-squared of performance at the index level has been +0.83, the r-squared of performance at the sector level has been much lower at just +0.21.

&gt; # 6 Job Openings Surge

&gt; The BLS released October results of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey this morning showing a significant uptick in job openings. Openings totaled 11.03 million in October, slightly below the record of 11.098 million from this past July. Openings rose by 431K month over month which ranks as the biggest one-month uptick since July and is in the 94th percentile of all monthly moves.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Job-Open-1.png))**

&gt; While the JOLTS data is insightful, it is released at a decent lag. Job listings website Indeed, however, offers a higher frequency (daily) dataset with more up-to-date readings with the latest data available through November 26th. As we discussed ahead of the JOLTS release in last night's Closer, postings through this reading have been hitting new highs and are 57% above the February 2020 baseline reading. That comes with acceleration in new postings being put up on the site throughout the fall, but especially so in recent weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Indeed-New-Post.png))**

&gt; Indeed also offers a breakdown based on industry. As shown below, there are four industries that currently have postings that are twice as high as they were pre-pandemic. Ironically, given the fair degree of labor market slack, the human resources sector continues to top the list with postings almost 120% above the baseline level. Loading &amp; Stocks, Production &amp; Manufacturing, and Software Development are the other most in-demand industries through late November. The other end of the spectrum continues to include many reopening sensitive areas like Hospitality and Tourism (which has also been on the decline in recent weeks as shown in the next chart below), though, these too are now all above baseline levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/120821-Indeed-Industry.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, Hospitality and Tourism have seen a decline in postings recently likely as a result of rising case counts. Noting a few other industries, Banking &amp; Finance, Construction, Cleaning &amp; Sanitation, and Food Preparation &amp; Service have all seen an acceleration in postings.

&gt; # Breezy Does It - Chicago Home Prices the Last to Take Out Prior Bubble Highs

&gt; The S&amp;P Case Shiller home price indices for September 2021 were released recently and showed that home prices nationally are now up 47% from their prior highs made during the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. And notably, all 20 of the individual cities/regions tracked by S&amp;P Case Shiller have now eclipsed their prior housing bubble highs now that Chicago has finally moved above its prior high from September 2006. As shown below, home prices in Chicago are now 1% above those September 2006 levels.

&gt; Two cities -- Dallas and Denver -- have home price levels now that are 100%+ above their mid-2000 highs. Five more cities are up at least 50% from their prior housing bubble highs -- Seattle, Portland, Charlotte, San Francisco, and Boston.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/priorbubblehighs.png))**

&gt; You can see Chicago home price levels based on the S&amp;P Case Shiller indices just barely eclipsing their prior highs in the chart below:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/chicago.png))**

&gt; The pandemic has of course been a huge boon for home prices across the country. Below is a look at how much home prices are up versus levels seen in February 2020 just prior to COVID. Prices in Phoenix are up the most post-COVID at 45%, followed by San Diego and Tampa at 35%. Las Vegas, Charlotte, Miami, Dallas, and Seattle have all seen prices rise by 30%+, while the remaining cities are all up between 19% and 27%. Chicago, New York, and DC have seen home prices rise the least, but even these three cities are up ~20% since COVID hit. Like this type of analysis?

&gt; # Russell 2000 2% Spreads Between Intraday Highs and Lows

&gt; The Russell 2000 tracking ETF (IWM) has been particularly volatile as of late, and as of yesterday's close, there have been seven straight trading days in which there was a 2% spread between the intraday high and low. A streak of seven had not been reached since July 2020 (7/2), and the current streak is tied for the longest since 6/22/2020. During the COVID correction, this streak of 2% intraday ranges actually reached 41 days, which was then followed by two streaks of nine trading days in the spring and summer. While the Russell 2000 is up sharply again today, because it gapped higher, the streak is likely to end at seven trading days unless IWM trades below $221.45 or above $226.64.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/2020-to-now-2-pct-h-l-diff-12721-3.png))**

&gt; IWM has only had a streak of 41 or more three times since IWM began trading in late May of 2000. The longest streak came during the financial crisis from late 2008 through early 2009 when 67 consecutive trading days saw at least a 2% spread between IWM's intraday highs and lows. Although the market currently appears quite volatile, it is hardy unprecedented, and IWM has experienced periods where it has undergone significant volatility for much longer periods than the current streak.

&gt; # Will Omicron Ruin the Santa Rally?

&gt; Historically, December has been a great month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant causing major volatility and uncertainty. Still, we remain optimistic that the new worries will subside over the coming weeks and stocks will finish 2021 on a solid note.

&gt; # The Latest on Omicron
&gt; First things first, we are very excited to announce that tomorrow (Tuesday, December 7) we are set to release Outlook 2022: Passing the Baton. This will have all of our views on where we think the economy, stocks, and bonds are headed next year. Because the Outlook is coming out tomorrow, this week’s Weekly Market Commentary is shorter than normal, but hopefully just as impactful.

&gt; After 29 consecutive days without a single 1% move higher or lower for the S&amp;P 500 Index, news of Omicron broke the Friday after Thanksgiving and as a result, five consecutive days saw at least a 1% move up or down. Clearly Omicron and the uncertainty it brought with it showed everyone that stocks can’t stay calm forever.

&gt; Although we do expect this volatility to continue, it very well could be a buying opportunity. We’ve been living with COVID-19 for more than 20 months now. We’ve seen several variants and managed to move forward, and we expect a similar playbook to work once again. Admittedly, we don’t know how effective current vaccines are against Omicron, or how transmissible it is, but we do know that the appetite for another nationwide shutdown is quite low and that these questions should be answered over the coming weeks. We remain optimistic that the medical community will quickly create booster shots against the new variant if needed, paving the way for this economic recovery to move forward early next year.

&gt; # Will Santa Still Come in 2021?
December started off a little rocky, but we are still optimistic that the usual December bullish season will take place. For starters, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 1.5% on average during the final month of the year, with only April and November better. But no month is more likely to be higher, with December up close to 75% of time.

&gt; As shown in Figure 1, it turns out that the majority of the gains tend to take place during the second half of the month, so we could see a continued choppy market until we have more clarity over Omicron, which would match the typical strong second half of December action.

&gt; Where things get interesting is after a negative November (like we saw this year), December does even better, up 2.7% on average and higher 19 out of 22 times (86.3%). What about if stocks are having a great year heading into December? You guessed it, the jolliest month of them all does better. We found there were 15 times the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% for the year at the end of November and the month of December was up 11 of them with an average return of 1.7%; again, better than the average December return of 1.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/newsroom/read/wmc/lp_WMC-120621_01.png))**

&gt; # Conclusion
&gt; Omicron has put quite the wrinkle in the recent bull market, but stocks are still up more than 20% for the year, so it is good to put things in perspective. After more than a 110% rally from the March 2020 lows, perhaps investors needed a reminder that stocks can’t go up forever and that while volatility might be frustrating, it is perfectly normal.

&gt; We aren’t minimizing the Omicron uncertainty, but we remain bullish that the recovery is alive and well, with a very healthy consumer and corporate earnings backdrop leading the way. Buckle up though, as big swings on daily news could be here for several more weeks. But in the end, we expect any lost output due to Omicron to simply be pushed out and recovered by early next year.

What is Yearn Finance?

Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. It started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. The service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. Later on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. Yearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited. Yearn Finance in 2021 Yearn Finance was launched in July 2020 and its governance token, YFI was released to the community through a fair launch. At its initial release, because there were no fundraising nor valuation placed on Yearn Finance, the market did not fully comprehend the value capture and not able to figure out the market value for it. As Yearn Finance continued to attract liquidity by allowing people to easily earn and participate in DeFi, YFI token went from $30 to $43,000 within 2 months from its launch. In 2021, Yearn Finance continues to solidify its position as the gold standard for yield aggregator in which it managed to hit an all-time high of $91,000 on May 12th, 2021 alongside with the peak of the cryptocurrency markets. What is Yield Farming and Delegated Vaults? Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol’s native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. Other than simple yield farming, Yearn Finance also released a product named delegated vault. Delegated vaults basically use any assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins and recycle the stablecoins into a stablecoin vault. Any subsequent earnings are then used to buy back the asset. For example, one of the delegated vaults is yETH, where users can deposit ETH and expect to have more ETH when they withdraw. The ETH is sent to Maker DAO as collateral in order to draw DAI where the DAI will be invested into the DAI vault, with subsequent earnings used to buy back ETH. Why is the founder, Andre Cronje controversial or famous?

Andre became one of the most famous DeFi thought leaders as he launched Yearn Finance single-handedly, witnessing YFI price went up by roughly 55x in less than 3 months, valuing Yearn Finance by more than $1 billion. He is vocal on Twitter with his ethos of fair token launch and having a bias on launching experimental projects before audits, which gave birth to one of the DeFi main activities “Aping”. Aping basically means buying the tokens the moment it launches in Ethereum mainnet before fully knowing the function of the tokens. It normally involves directly interacting with the Ethereum contract before a website UI is out or buying it straight from DEX such as Uniswap. It is a high risk activity, causing many investors to lose their fund to scams. But the lure of getting early access to tokens that might go up rapidly in price is attracting tons of speculators. One of the examples is when Andre launched EMN, a game economy engine called “Eminence” that was subsequently hacked for $15 million. Subsequent launch of the KP3R token, a network that facilitates keepers to perform automated tasks on behalf of requestors, saw the price go up by 22x in less than 3 months, valuing KP3R at more than $100 million. The activity of aping will not die down anytime soon with numerous projects achieving high valuation within a short span of time. What is the Yearn Finance Alliance?

During the weeks of 24 November until 3 December 2020, Yearn Finance announced the Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A) of multiple protocols, essentially forming an alliance revolving around YFI.

SushiSwap joined as its Automated Market Maker (AMM) arm.

Cover joined as its insurance arm.

Cream joined as its lending arm.

Akropolis joined as its institutional service provider for yVaults and upcoming lending products.

Pickle joined as one of its strategists.

There are even multiple Yearn Ecosystem Index tokens launched such as YETI by Powerpool and YPIE by PieDAO. What are the fees in Yearn Finance? Yearn Finance v1 charges a withdrawal fee of 0.5% plus 5% performance fee from the gas cost saved. Yearn Finance v2 follows the traditional hedge fund fees structure of 2/20 where it charges 2% for management fee and 20% for performance fee. Yearn Finance v2 was launched on 19 January 2021. What is YFI token? YFI is the governance token for the Yearn Finance protocol. It can be used to vote and receive cash flows from the fees earned by the protocol. YFI initiated the first community-fair-launched token distribution, giving out 30,000 tokens to early protocol’s users by a surprise yield farming announcement back in 17-July-2020. How to trade YFI? YFI can be obtained by buying them from exchanges such as Sushiswap or Binance. You can find YFI trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

You deserve everything you want in life. You're perfect the way you are. Things may be rough now but everything will be okay and if you need someone I'm here! We're all going through a hard time in the current circumstances. So everybody needs a hug! Also hope everyone's loved ones are safe and sound :) Also, as to why I need a friend - Well, more the merrier that's all! And also Pune is still a relatively new city for me and I guess I can use more people to hang out with and spend time with (Beer or your choice of poison is on me if we do end up meeting). Also, I might need a new flatmate as well in a few months so if we end up becoming chums, you've got a pretty cool house buddy who cooks and bakes! 

**Also obligatory alternative (Audio! Since everyone is doing a PowerPoint) for those who don’t wanna read since this is a huge wall of text but if you have earphones on** https://soundcloud.com/user-602845023/track-5 ( Brownie points for effort ? There's some Easter eggs in the post which aren't in the Audio clip though :P ) and of course there's a tl;dr (too long, didn't read?) 

So here we're almost at at the 2-year mark of being stuck with WFH which means it's almost been 2 years since people got to hang out without COVID over their heads. No GRMD, No reddit meetups either hence has been hard to meet people. I am honestly bad at making friends and the moving around a lot part doesn't help either. Growing up, I failed to make friends until I was 12. Those friends were not good for me at all, and they only cared about themselves in the end. The few friends I have, live too far away from or are too busy to talk and hang out. My life got to me so much, with all my negative history being reminded to me by old friends, family, people I didn't know, and even areas where I had been stupid. So I moved away, got more work, and tried to make new friends. But, alas, the friend-making has been painfully slow and COVID isn't helping me socialize either. I don't know about you but staying at home is driving me craaaaazy. Luckily I have work to keep me busy all the time. I usually end up sleeping at 4 AM due to supporting clients from the other end of the globe, so basically a night owl! But dang, don't I miss going out. I miss the planning of where to go out the most more than going out and I miss going to work and having the freedom to move around! And with regard to this post, I gotta say I've done this before, a couple of times actually but I guess things didn't work out or people lost interest or might have been my fault as well. And I can understand why that happens and that a friendship can't be forced so I won't hold it against anyone. Making friends is hard! That's why we're here, aren't we? My whole life I've longed for a best friend. Someone that wants to travel the world with me. Someone that feels so comfortable with me could tell me anything and I'd take it to my grave. Someone I could care deeply for. Not a huge group of friends, but just a couple of people, heck even 1 person, that I could share my life with, fun times, and have a special bond that I see with so many other people's friendships. I've tried everything and I'm not gonna give up on trying. So here we go. Here is a little about me:

I'll start with the fact that I have and pretty much am still suffering from depression and anxiety. The depression is not as severe as it was quite some time back but it's a Sine curve so some days are good but boy, the rest are outright horrible. But I still deal with anxiety and I am planning to get back on meds again. I had stopped taking them a while back after deciding that I am not gonna let 3 pills decide my individuality and that I don't want to be a zombie but I've learnt that it was a stupid move and I should've checked with my doctor first. So fair warning, I might disappear at times when I just need some time away from reality and I'm really sorry for that. I am not gonna ghost you though and am just a hi! away. I'd like to say I've got a pretty decent memory so we can pick u right where we left. And I wouldn't forget you as well, I just sort of dig myself into my hole deeper and deeper and it'll take me a while to come out of it. I've also spent quite a bit of my life with my head in the clouds or in a good book. Right now and for quite a while, my life is kind of not where I really want it to be, both personally and professionally. I'm currently trying to figure out how to get my career goals sorted out. I enjoy going out and having a good time, whether it's hiking, just driving around, or spending nights at home. I also write. You can stalk my Reddit profile for some things I've written :) Music is also something I find lacking in my life, but I love most genres except punk metal. If you're like me and worship the ground that Bowie walked on, I will love you forever. I'm mostly into the indie music scene in India, and a big fan of Prateek Kuhad, Ritviz, Aditi Ramesh (a good friend of mine actually ) Aarifah Rebello, and a couple of others in the Indian Indie scene (We can go to their concerts/shows!) and Anson Seabra, Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver, Arctic Monkeys, Tame Impala, The Smiths, The Killers (Are we human, or are we dancer?), Tom Rosenthal, Lumineers, Hollow Coves, Ben Howard, Of Monsters and Men, The National, Frightened Rabbit, alt-j and a lot of others too :) and I can assure you I have a playlist for every type of day and mood that I'll be more than happy to share :D I really love classical music and jazz as well. Jazz is a recent development so still exploring the genre!  I'm not an audiophile but to those out there, I use a Sony WH 1000XM3 for travel and a Jabra elite 85t for my daily commutes and both do a great job for their price. Oh, and I have a dog and a cat as well! They definitely help with the loneliness when you're staying alone. I also like writing and I've written some things on Reddit primarily on the /r/unsentletters subreddit(Links if you're not gonna stalk my profile - [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hkc1ee/the_vows_to_the_wife_i_never_had_we_were_supposed/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hjsx95/to_the_one_who_gets_to_love_her_next_long/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/fxo0xh/to_the_girl_that_needs_to_let_go/), [Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/kiannb/to_the_best_friend_who_died_before_we_got_to_go/), I think there are a few more but these are the ones that I really hold close to my heart) But other than that I have a collection of letters that I had written a while back along with other letters mostly addressed to myself for different days when I could use some uplifting or have some sense knocked into me. I'm currently obsessed with Final Space. I don't know if many have seen that show but it's hilarious and has the right amount of sci-fi. Recently saw Only Murders in the Building S1 as well and it was hilarious! (To all the true crime fans out there! Give this one a watch) Oh yeah and I do enjoy podcasts and always wanted to start my own! I love to go on suuuuuuper long drives and these True Crime podcasts are mostly my companion on these journeys along with a couple of finance and general talk shows about money, books, movies and music.

I love fishing (not a fan of eating them though, so it's mostly catch and throw) and had gone to catch a few yesterday! (It rained where I am here! So yay!) but it's pretty boring in the cities as all you can catch are the small ones, None of those awesome battles between fishing rods and the fishes as shown on Nat Geo. And finally Hiking, I just love to go for long hikes and camping, although I never had the chance to go for a really long one and am tempted to go for the IndiaHikes Bali Pass trek in June 22'. ( It's the next thing to do on my bucket list ) And well, coming to books, I am currently reading The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah, and the book I read last was Of Women and Salt by my favorite Author - Gabriel Garcia, and boy it's a great book, and next on my list is Fake Accounts by Lauren Oyler. In search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust is one of my all-time classical favorites and I've got a shit ton of books this year ( Trying to finish that 52 Books challenge - At 33 now. I wanted to be at 40 at least but a heavy workload and well my side hustles aren't helping ), crosswords are awesome too, but I usually end up getting frustrated and leaving it out. I love watching TV Shows and is also a tech enthusiast. I'm trying to study and learn some stuff, so we can be study buddies as well. I used to have a friend who I used to step into a call and study although we're both doing different things it helps knowing there is someone with you. A work buddy would be awesome as well! We can both do our own work but I can holla to you and you can holla back! I happen to have a stamp collection and a boarding pass collection too if it interests you! I recently got into Digital Art(using Procreate!) and is working on sketching some really cool people from my life. A slow progress but I will get there I hope! I am more of a traditional artist though and have been sketching and painting for as long as I can remember but digital is completely new to me and I'm trying to learn the mechanics of it including layers and everything :) I do game a bit as well but on a console! Have a couple of games - RDD 2, GTA V, Apex, COD WZ, RSS and a ton of other single player/adventure games and also whatever else the kids are playing these days. If you game as well and might be looking for someone to play with on co-op missions or anything, do let me know as well! and we can play! (Hopefully your game supports multi platform)

That's enough about me I hope and now here's what you can expect:

THE 13 REASONS WHY(Pun? Sorta Shitty show though) WHY WE SHOULD HANG OUT:

1. A great friend to talk to throughout the day and night wherever you are. I'm a night owl, so I probably will be awake through all the odd hours either working or overthinking.
2. A support system. Feel free to vent and I will listen and talk. I hope I can expect the same although I don't tend to talk too much till I get to know you pretty well that is. 
3. Someone to hang out with if we happen to be in the same city/country - I travel a lot for work so chances are we might actually have common boundaries or if you're in Pune, just call me and I'll be at your front door with a shovel to bury whatever you're hiding, no questions asked. 
4. I know how hard it is to struggle through those shitty times and I want to make someone feel a little less alone and desperate.
5. Loooots of stories to discuss and personal life experiences to share. Although I'm relatively young, I've gone through a lot of things and if it'll help someone, I'll be glad to share.
6. Career advice maybe? Depends on what you do or want to do.
7. I promise not to ghost you. I have ghosted and I've been on the receiving end as well and it always feels shitty so I won't do that. 
8. Unlimited supply of humor, memes, kitten/puppy pictures to lighten your day. 
9. I can cook pretty well or so I like to hope. Mostly desserts so if we happen to be in the same city, expect a lot of amazing food! And if you need help with cooking or don't know what to cook, ask me!
10. Trying to reach your fitness goals or study more or need motivation for anything? You got me to do that for you. I've been trying to get back in shape to shed the quarantine weight. Even better if you use cure.fit since we can set up a team for the live classes to motivate each other :)
11. Will take your side in an argument and will literally fight for you if it comes to that always. Pinky promise too :P
12. This is for all the night owls out there and to anyone actually. You can call me at 4 AM with a mid-life crisis and I'll be right there for you
13. Unlimited Spotify Playlists for every occasion, Netflix/Hotstar/Prime and what else is there recommendations and if I really think you're a great person heck, I'd share my accounts and we can even sit and watch something together over zoom!  

Anyhow now you know quite a bit about me and also where to find me :P

Hope to hear back from you!

PS - I’m hoping to find something long term here. we can talk every day, share memes, secrets, or whatever you'd like. Also, I'd hope for this to be a regular thing where we can just talk throughout the day and kind of share dumb videos and maybe just watch dumb videos or movies together and have some really deep and intriguing conversations. I just want to find someone to genuinely have fun and get to know, but I know it does take some time to get there and I don't want to force it. Most of the time, I notice I gravitate toward people who overshare a lot and are slightly extroverted, so I really hope you like talking about yourself! I'm kind of shy at first and honestly consistently awkward, but I open up quickly. I like people who are kind and affectionate, too. I'm not going to be at my computer all the time nor do I expect you to be, but I would like for this to be a daily thing where we talk or hang out with some frequency. We can talk about whatever’s bothering you or if your boss was being a bitch today, we can gossip about celebs or friends. We can offer support and motivation to each other and be best buds! And if things work out for the best and we do end up talking for a while, we could be life-long friends and meet each other and keep in contact forever(or what is forever in reality) which would be absolutely amazing. it doesn’t matter to me what your gender/sexuality/race is or what country or timezone you’re from, all that matters is that you be yourself and want to get to know me.

Also just a general disclaimer - Please don't ghost? And I wouldn't want to either. I'll try my best and will do all I can to keep the words flowing! But no matter how good a conversation is going, if you reply with a single word or a smiley of any kind you kill a conversation. There is no good way to respond to ""cool"", ""awesome"" or "":)"" that doesn't force the other person to reestablish the entire conversation. It doesn't matter how cute you think that emoji is, if that's all you're sending someone they have no way to respond to it.

If you want a conversation to continue then you have to keep it on the tracks. Every time you respond to someone you have to keep it moving forward or choose the other track which drives it directly into a brick wall and forces the other person to reverse it and start over again.

If you have nothing to say on a topic or nothing interesting to respond to something with then move it to a new subject. That way they have something to rebound back to you, if you just respond with a single word it signals a lack of interest in talking to them at all. You're asking them to invest their time in you and not one of the thousands of other things they could be doing, if you don't put in the minimal conversation effort they're simply going to go do something more engaging. It doesn't matter how smart you think you are or how amazing you think your rack is, if you're not putting in the effort you're getting ghosted. There are a million other ways someone could be spending their time instead of you, if you can't do the bare minimum to keep a conversation alive then why shouldn't I just go watch a video about my hobby or see what new games were just released I could be playing instead? Also, If you see a post that's well-written and you want to talk to that person, give them some information! ASL should just be the basics. This person has already made a post talking about themselves. They've put that effort in; you should give them more than one or two sentences when you message them! (On the flip side don't go way overboard and write an essay, just in general -- some people love essays - I'm one of them!)

Aaaaand Reddit chat is kinda buggy at times so expect a delay or can talk on any platform you’d like if we hit it off so feel free to let me know as I'm pretty much open to anything :)

So if you’ve made it so far, you’re either interested in talking to me or you’re just I don't know what you’re doing. anyways, sorry for the super boring and long essay but if you’d like to be best buds, send me a dm! I am super excited to meet you and get to know you!

Have a great day Redditors! And Stay home, Stay safe, and most importantly Stay Healthy!

tl;dr: I know it's a little long but, Looking for a new best friend(s) so hit me up :P"

Not looking for anything specific just wanted to share my story and see what people think. 

For the past 6 years I worked at a bootstrapped startup as the sole services engineer implementing our product for clients.  Prior to my arrival, development on the product was funded by consulting services that were completely unrelated to the product (basically a different business).  Unfortunately those consulting services were all based around one company and when they hit a rough patch that safety net died. Afterwards the company dwindled until it was just me, the guy in charge of platform dev and the founder who was doing sales. We still continued to survive and live off proceeds from the product and associated services but selling has never been easy. We acquired a really great client in 2018 and started implementing a rollout across their company, the first such implementation of that scale. Then covid... during 2019 the founder retired and due to the lack of funds from our client's not being able to pay their bills I had to go get another full time job to pay my bills and the plan was for me to consult for the company on the side.  By the end of 2019 with some more events transpiring I ended up as the CEO and majority shareholder of the company. My first move was to fire the head of platform dev as I don't think he invested the money wisely into the platform and didn't grow it to where it should have been by now. I kept the guy under him (who was actually doing all the work) and started to rebuild the company from there. In that time I hired and trained 3 younger engineers though 1 didn't work out. I chose to pay everyone else over myself and keep my full time job. Its now been a year with me climbing a ridiculous learning curve of how hard it is to be in charge of running a small business from legal to finance to training younger folks and still trying to keep clients happy. We did manage to gain another client and implement successfully but I have done 0 sales in the past year. I'm now at the point where I have a team again and need to get back into sales but I'm burnt and feel like I want to get my life back. I'm not going to because we still have clients that want to do more work with us and I haven't given sales a chance at all yet. I know I have to persevere... I just wish I could play a video game and not feel guilty for not working. Anyways just felt like ranting I guess. Curious to see what others think."

I also like writing and I've written some things on Reddit primarily on the /r/unsentletters subreddit(Links if you're not gonna stalk my profile - [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hkc1ee/the_vows_to_the_wife_i_never_had_we_were_supposed/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/hjsx95/to_the_one_who_gets_to_love_her_next_long/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/fxo0xh/to_the_girl_that_needs_to_let_go/), [Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/kiannb/to_the_best_friend_who_died_before_we_got_to_go/), I think there are a few more but these are the ones that I really hold close to my heart) But other than that I have a collection of letters that I had written a while back along with other letters mostly addressed to myself for different days when I could use some uplifting or have some sense knocked into me. I'm currently obsessed with Final Space. I don't know if many have seen that show but it's hilarious and has the right amount of sci-fi. Recently saw Only Murders in the Building S1 as well and it was hilarious! (To all the true crime fans out there! Give this one a watch) Oh yeah and I do enjoy podcasts and always wanted to start my own! I love to go on suuuuuuper long drives and these True Crime podcasts are mostly my companion on these journeys along with a couple of finance and general talk shows about money, books, movies and music.

I love fishing (not a fan of eating them though, so it's mostly catch and throw) and had gone to catch a few yesterday! (It rained where I am here! So yay!) but it's pretty boring in the cities as all you can catch are the small ones, None of those awesome battles between fishing rods and the fishes as shown on Nat Geo. And finally Hiking, I just love to go for long hikes and camping, although I never had the chance to go for a really long one and am tempted to go for the IndiaHikes Bali Pass trek in June 22'. ( It's the next thing to do on my bucket list ) And well, coming to books, I am currently reading The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah, and the book I read last was Of Women and Salt by my favorite Author - Gabriel Garcia, and boy it's a great book, and next on my list is Fake Accounts by Lauren Oyler. In search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust is one of my all-time classical favorites and I've got a shit ton of books this year ( Trying to finish that 52 Books challenge - At 33 now. I wanted to be at 40 at least but a heavy workload and well my side hustles aren't helping ), crosswords are awesome too, but I usually end up getting frustrated and leaving it out. I love watching TV Shows and is also a tech enthusiast. I'm trying to study and learn some stuff, so we can be study buddies as well. I used to have a friend who I used to step into a call and study although we're both doing different things it helps knowing there is someone with you. A work buddy would be awesome as well! We can both do our own work but I can holla to you and you can holla back! I happen to have a stamp collection and a boarding pass collection too if it interests you! I recently got into Digital Art(using Procreate!) and is working on sketching some really cool people from my life. A slow progress but I will get there I hope! I am more of a traditional artist though and have been sketching and painting for as long as I can remember but digital is completely new to me and I'm trying to learn the mechanics of it including layers and everything :) I do game a bit as well but on a console! Have a couple of games - RDD 2, GTA V, Apex, COD WZ, RSS and a ton of other single player/adventure games and also whatever else the kids are playing these days. If you game as well and might be looking for someone to play with on co-op missions or anything, do let me know as well! and we can play! (Hopefully your game supports multi platform)

That's enough about me I hope and now here's what you can expect:

THE 13 REASONS WHY(Pun? Sorta Shitty show though) WHY WE SHOULD HANG OUT:

1. A great friend to talk to throughout the day and night wherever you are. I'm a night owl, so I probably will be awake through all the odd hours either working or overthinking.
2. A support system. Feel free to vent and I will listen and talk. I hope I can expect the same although I don't tend to talk too much till I get to know you pretty well that is. 
3. Someone to hang out with if we happen to be in the same city/country - I travel a lot for work so chances are we might actually have common boundaries or if you're in Pune, just call me and I'll be at your front door with a shovel to bury whatever you're hiding, no questions asked. 
4. I know how hard it is to struggle through those shitty times and I want to make someone feel a little less alone and desperate.
5. Loooots of stories to discuss and personal life experiences to share. Although I'm relatively young, I've gone through a lot of things and if it'll help someone, I'll be glad to share.
6. Career advice maybe? Depends on what you do or want to do.
7. I promise not to ghost you. I have ghosted and I've been on the receiving end as well and it always feels shitty so I won't do that. 
8. Unlimited supply of humor, memes, kitten/puppy pictures to lighten your day. 
9. I can cook pretty well or so I like to hope. Mostly desserts so if we happen to be in the same city, expect a lot of amazing food! And if you need help with cooking or don't know what to cook, ask me!
10. Trying to reach your fitness goals or study more or need motivation for anything? You got me to do that for you. I've been trying to get back in shape to shed the quarantine weight. Even better if you use cure.fit since we can set up a team for the live classes to motivate each other :)
11. Will take your side in an argument and will literally fight for you if it comes to that always. Pinky promise too :P
12. This is for all the night owls out there and to anyone actually. You can call me at 4 AM with a mid-life crisis and I'll be right there for you
13. Unlimited Spotify Playlists for every occasion, Netflix/Hotstar/Prime and what else is there recommendations and if I really think you're a great person heck, I'd share my accounts and we can even sit and watch something together over zoom!  

Anyhow now you know quite a bit about me and also where to find me :P

Hope to hear back from you!

PS - I’m hoping to find something long term here. we can talk every day, share memes, secrets, or whatever you'd like. Also, I'd hope for this to be a regular thing where we can just talk throughout the day and kind of share dumb videos and maybe just watch dumb videos or movies together and have some really deep and intriguing conversations. I just want to find someone to genuinely have fun and get to know, but I know it does take some time to get there and I don't want to force it. Most of the time, I notice I gravitate toward people who overshare a lot and are slightly extroverted, so I really hope you like talking about yourself! I'm kind of shy at first and honestly consistently awkward, but I open up quickly. I like people who are kind and affectionate, too. I'm not going to be at my computer all the time nor do I expect you to be, but I would like for this to be a daily thing where we talk or hang out with some frequency. We can talk about whatever’s bothering you or if your boss was being a bitch today, we can gossip about celebs or friends. We can offer support and motivation to each other and be best buds! And if things work out for the best and we do end up talking for a while, we could be life-long friends and meet each other and keep in contact forever(or what is forever in reality) which would be absolutely amazing. it doesn’t matter to me what your gender/sexuality/race is or what country or timezone you’re from, all that matters is that you be yourself and want to get to know me.

Also just a general disclaimer - Please don't ghost? And I wouldn't want to either. I'll try my best and will do all I can to keep the words flowing! But no matter how good a conversation is going, if you reply with a single word or a smiley of any kind you kill a conversation. There is no good way to respond to ""cool"", ""awesome"" or "":)"" that doesn't force the other person to reestablish the entire conversation. It doesn't matter how cute you think that emoji is, if that's all you're sending someone they have no way to respond to it.

If you want a conversation to continue then you have to keep it on the tracks. Every time you respond to someone you have to keep it moving forward or choose the other track which drives it directly into a brick wall and forces the other person to reverse it and start over again.

If you have nothing to say on a topic or nothing interesting to respond to something with then move it to a new subject. That way they have something to rebound back to you, if you just respond with a single word it signals a lack of interest in talking to them at all. You're asking them to invest their time in you and not one of the thousands of other things they could be doing, if you don't put in the minimal conversation effort they're simply going to go do something more engaging. It doesn't matter how smart you think you are or how amazing you think your rack is, if you're not putting in the effort you're getting ghosted. There are a million other ways someone could be spending their time instead of you, if you can't do the bare minimum to keep a conversation alive then why shouldn't I just go watch a video about my hobby or see what new games were just released I could be playing instead? Also, If you see a post that's well-written and you want to talk to that person, give them some information! ASL should just be the basics. This person has already made a post talking about themselves. They've put that effort in; you should give them more than one or two sentences when you message them! (On the flip side don't go way overboard and write an essay, just in general -- some people love essays - I'm one of them!)

Aaaaand Reddit chat is kinda buggy at times so expect a delay or can talk on any platform you’d like if we hit it off so feel free to let me know as I'm pretty much open to anything :)

So if you’ve made it so far, you’re either interested in talking to me or you’re just I don't know what you’re doing. anyways, sorry for the super boring and long essay but if you’d like to be best buds, send me a dm! I am super excited to meet you and get to know you!

Have a great day Redditors! And Stay home, Stay safe, and most importantly Stay Healthy!

tl;dr: I know it's a little long but, Looking for a new best friend(s) so hit me up :P"

*Disclaimer: This post is about DRIP. A high interest, low risk Crypto investment. If you don't like Crypto, are wary of it, or just don't understand it then feel free to skip past me. As with all things Crypto, it does have a learning curve.* ***This Passive method is also INVITE ONLY, and you can be invited by using my 'buddy' id (basically my wallet id. Posted further below)****. It's honestly the same as a referral, so if referrals aren't for you or you are wary of people posting them, then feel free to use another buddy code that you might find elsewhere.*

DRIP is a cryptocurrency that is used to provide passive income, by paying it's users out 1% interest per day. This 1% can then be 'hydrated' - which is cute crypto lingo for reinvesting your dividends - to increase the 1% yield from your account every day. Below is the resulting account balance after 365 days if you were to reinvest everyday and grow your balance - not including any taxes or hydration fees.

This crypto also works off the BSC (Binance Smart Chain), meaning that you can buy BNB off of binance (sign-up is easy, and so is verification), and then transfer them to DRIP on the site using Metamask or some other wallet plug-in (I use metamask personally).

Now, if you're like me, you probably aren't gonna throw a small amount at something this scalable, and instead will likely price average into it somehow. In my case, I currently add about $50 to my balance each week. A seemingly small amount of money, but over the course of an entire year, while making my 1% each day, I would make the below amount in 365 days.

And for the heck of it, let's assume you put $2,000 into this and add $100 each week.

Now, all of this is done at the current price of DRIP tokens ($52.95 at the time of writing this), and is subject to change to market conditions, and also doesn't account for taxes and fees. Without getting into it with too much detail (check out the white paper if you want to really see the breakdowns), this site is able to pay 1% each day to it's users because it has a 10% Withdraw fee, and then an additional 10% Selling fee. These high fees are what enable these high interest rates, as well as a few other things (whale tax for example that levels the playing field for smaller investors and redistributes some of that wealth).

If you're interested, I've linked my article below which highlights how to set up everything from scratch. My buddy code - or invite code - that you would need to deposit into the faucet (where the 1% comes from) is: **0x8FcCC8832038fDa7f6C4f933284D5056fB175113** (also listed in the below article).

End of year disappointment,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rfsju3/end_of_year_disappointment/,deedopete,1,2021-12-14 06:52:05,0,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rfsju3/end_of_year_disappointment/,DISCUSSION,"There was a lot of hype concerning Bitcoin to 100k before the end of the year.  Crypto influencers across multiple platforms have been hounding on the final Bull run up to $100,000 in December and then we were to get ready for “alt coin season” where everything would go “parabolic”.  I admit, I bought into the hype and was tracking Plan B all the way for the last few months.  

Yes, I am short term disappointed, but I am long term bullish.  This is the future of global finance and I believe we are still early in the adoption curve.  This is crypto, we will rebound eventually like maybe tonight or tomorrow or 2022."
"Brinc Finance Got Exploited, Lost Around $1M of Staked Assets",https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiTeller/comments/rg48ef/brinc_finance_got_exploited_lost_around_1m_of/,TobiramaTheSecond,1,2021-12-14 17:57:33,0,/r/DeFiTeller/comments/rg48ef/brinc_finance_got_exploited_lost_around_1m_of/,NaN,"Brinc Finance, a relatively new DeFi protocol, became a victim of an exploit on Dec.14.    


According to developers, a hacker was able to withdraw BRC and gBRC tokens from the protocol’s staking pools and transfer stolen assets to his **Ethereum address**. Afterwards the tokens were burned allowing the attacker to receive DAI which they successfully swapped to Ether. The address used for the attack now holds over 291 ETH worth over $1,1million.   


Brinc Finance team is still investigating the exploit and reportedly reached out to a security firm CertiK for help.   


According to DefiLlama, which has just recently started tracking Brinc Finance, the protocol’s TVL was drained overnight from $1.1 million on Monday to just $15 thousand on Tuesday.   


The Brinc protocol offers the decentralized creation and governance of a stablecoin token built on a bonding curve that mathematically increases in price.

Brinc Finance, a bonding curve token protocol deployed on Ethereum was exploited at 01:59:04 AM on Dec-14-2021 +UTC.

Here is the basic info about this incident:

The root cause of this incident was the admin’s private key was compromised. And the admin’s private key was used to transfer the staking contract’s owner right to the attacker’s address **0x6B0b61323F6d77ef8A1a35D11FA877631d8f67Bb**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jtx7o9besh581.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a07b5f2670d6f31bfc2272e7d58b41122864664

The attacker then upgraded the staking contract to a new one deployed at **0x1ec83036a1dbbd6e001bb216e31b8a259ebd8f3d**. In this new contract, a rescueToken function was inserted. The rescueToken function had an onlyOwner modifier which only allowed the owner to call this function. 

*Here is the function’s code*:

function rescueTokens(address to, IERC20Upgradeable token) public onlyOwner {

 uint bal = token.balanceOf(address(this));

 require(bal &gt; 0);

 token.transfer(to, bal);

 }

Then the “owner” at 0x43e0Acd5314D0B8BCf34d45Fc9F5B8eA2DD403b9 could arbitrarily transfer tokens out of the staking contract. Nearly 14.3 million BRCs and 3.2 million gBRCs were taken out of the contract. 14.3 million BRCs were converted to 927,000 DAIs. 3.2 million gBRCs were converted to 176,000 DAIs via Sushi. 

1.1 million DAIs were converted to 290.6 ETHs via MetaMask’s swap router.

Fairyproof’d like to reiterate here it is highly recommended to use a multi-sig wallet to manage access control."

*Catch the full episode: https://www.wealthformula.com/podcast/294-navigating-the-boom-bust-cycle-with-murray-sabrin/*

**Buck:** Welcome back to the show everyone. Today, my guest on Wealth Formula Podcast is Murray Sabin. Now Murray is an Emeritus Professor of finance at Ramapo college of New Jersey. And he was also the New Jersey libertarian party nominee for governor in 1997. Having also sought the Republican nomination for the US Senate twice as well. He is also the author of navigating the boom bust cycle in entrepreneur survival guide, which was just released this October of 2021. And that is what we're going to talk about today. Murray, welcome to Wealth Formula Podcast. 

**Murray:** Well, thank you, Buck, appreciate the opportunity to help educate people and give them some tools to navigate the boom-bust cycle.

**Buck:** Well, yeah, and this is, this is really important. Sit off because as you and I talked about offline, we're really, you know, my group, here we're, you know, we're investors and we, we tend to be investors in alternative assets. people who've got a fair amount to lose when these markets. Boom and bust the way they do.

So it would be great to hear your take on things. You don't let me just jump right into it.  Murray. One of the questions I've got for you is, historically, the inversion of the yield curve signals a depression or re recession, I should say. And in 2019, the U S witnessed an inverted yield curve, but there was no recession or depression or anything. Maybe you can back up and just tell everybody how you define or how the yield curve inversion is defined, what the significance is of that it didn't follow what it normally does in 2019. 

**Murray:** Sure. The yield curve inverts when the federal reserve, after years of easy money decides it's time to raise interest rates and pull back the liquidity that has injected into the economy.

And when the short term rates go above long-term rates, since they're most sensitive to the federal reserve policy, you get a scramble for funds that the bank said short term rates start going up. And, that, that, that, what that does is reveal. The what's called the malinvestment. So the distortions in the boom that were unsustainable, if it weren't for, easy money, easy money makes possible a lot of investments that would never have occurred because if depressed interest rates, what does that do?

It increases the net value net, present value of future investments and boom. You've got people flooding money into the real estate market and other markets where they see that the rate of return over 10, 15 years is great because you have a lower discount rate. So again, this is pretty, pretty much elementary from a corporate finance perspective.

And so what happened in 2019 is really fascinating. I, several people have written about it, but I talk about it in the book, is that the yield curve inverted. And then in the first quarter, COVID. And when COVID hit, the economy was locked down. The economy imploded, unemployment went to 16%. Number of people have lost jobs, businesses were closed. And what you had was the federal government under the Trump administration, flooding the economy with all sorts of stimulus money in order to backstop all the businesses and employees that lost their jobs. Well, the fed didn't sit idly by, they started pumping money in. And before there was $4 trillion of new money created by the federal reserve and the very short period of time.

So basically the normal quote, normal business cycle would have occurred sometime in either 20, 20 or early 2021. But because of COVID. Not a recession, but you got, economic implosion because of the federal government, locking down the economy. And of course states, states were following suit.

So you had a horrible situation. And then the fed put the pedal to the metal. And, here we are a year later and we still have a sloping yield curve because the Fed has started to reduce its money printing, but nowhere near what it would take to invert the yield curve. So,  last year was, I guess, going to be studied for decades to come as to what happened to the economy.

It was the shortest downturn in US history, as you know, the stock market declined at 34 to 35% in a few weeks, which was the shortest bear market in history. And so, it's very unique. To see what happened in 2020 as a repeat. Well, it happened in the future. No one can rule that out because obviously we don't know what the future will bring if another pandemic occurs or some other events that could cause the economy to implode in a very short period of time.

But yeah, the yield curve looking back in history is probably one of the best, if not the best indicator that portends a recession six months to a year down the road. 

**Buck:** So basically. It was essentially hidden behind everything else that had happened in that period, in that massive liquidity injection from the Fed and the government intervention.

Essentially, when we look at what's going on right now, obviously we've got this massive. Right. It's massive boom. And when you look at all of the money that's in the market, I mean, it's sort of obvious why you mentioned some, you know, the Fed tightening a little bit. We'll see if that happens, but you know, as investors, or maybe business owners, What kinds of signals should we be looking for? That might suggest a change in the business cycle. 

Mmm Yeah. There are several, obviously the ones that are most sensitive to interest rates would be commodity prices because it takes a long time to get a mine into production. Other commodity prices, very sensitive to the business cycle.

So you look at the CRB index and some of the components copper is considered one of the. of boom and bust indicators because copper is used so widespread in the economy and construction and then other manufacturing sectors. So the price of copper is a good leading indicator as well. And, you have other indicators as well. Heavy duty trucks are a good indicator. So when you drill down in the motor vehicle sector, you see all these subsets of  areas of the economy that are very sensitive to steel would be another example of the production of steel or iron or coal, things like that. Oil is a kind of interesting situation. We saw the price of oil skyrocket, 180, $140 during the housing bubble. Then it collapsed, I think 35 or $40, which was really. Bizarre to see it collapse, but 80% or so 70% in a very short period of time. So, but if you look at some of the big macro, the unemployment rate, by the way, is a very good indicator as well. When that bottoms out and sort of goes sideways, the unemployment rate starts creeping up, you know, a recession is on hand because businesses are seeing their sales go down and that's one of the first things they do. They lay off people. So, again, you can do that by industry as well. So you look at these economically sensitive industries. You see what the employment rate is there, whether they're hiring or not. And then of course, one of the last things that we I would look at is retail sales and, and divide that into discretionary versus,  consumer staples, consumer staples don't have much of, of cyclical, trends, but, obviously discretionary items like automobiles and, housing and other things, high ticket items are very sensitive to the business. 

**Buck:** You know, one of the questions I wonder about myself is, you know, you've talked about a lot of the, sort of the, econ 101, you know, type signals, that the economy gives. We don't really live in that world anymore though in some regards. And, you know, we, we live in some unparalleled times where we've seen some, you know, unparalleled, interventions. And how do you use it? Some of this information to kind of guide you. And how has that changed over time, given where we are now, in other words, the reality is different, it seems to me that some, you know, it seems different, right? It seems like the old rule book, not that you throw it out, but it's, some of the rules have changed. How do you, how do you deal with that?

**Murray:** This is why it's so important to understand the macro economy and how it's affecting the micro economy, which is the world in which business people live in ethical decisions every single day about capital investment, hiring, firing, relocation of plants. The supply chain, which of course is the buzzword for this year because it's been so disrupted because of COVID and other factors. And so you really have to have a good economic framework in order to understand supply demand, which is economics 101. And we noticed that supply in the US. Then the next thing you do is they say follow the money.

Where is the money being created? Where is it flowing through the economy? And how is it impacting different sectors of the economy? The average business owner, the average CEO. I think of, I don't know if the other word should be average, but the typical CEO, a CFO. Doing a deep dive in the federal reserve database to see exactly what's happening to all these time series.

Of course, they're reported by different government agencies throughout the month such as the unemployment data, the producer price index, CPI index, consumer sentiment, which is a very good indicator as well. And so, to unravel all of that, you really have to have an economic theory. If you will, to explain it in the book, I will go into the different economic theories and which one I think is the best one. Wayne how the cycle unfolds and what to look for, especially in your particular business, because every sector is different in terms of where they are in the cycle. And then, make decisions that don't get you caught up in what Greenspan said in 1996, irrational exhibit.

Well, you were expanding at a rate that is unsustainable because it looks like the trees are going to be grown to the sky. We know trees don't grow to the sky. They slow down or sometimes they die. And, that's why it's important to really understand the macro economy to a certain point. But yet really have a pulse on your industry.

Cause I think that's really the key and with all these trade journals out there and online information, and of course your own revenue flow, you know exactly what's happening on a day to day, week to week, month to month basis. So you can get those reports if you're the CFO of a large company. The COO or you're a small mom and pop shop on main street that you know exactly what's happening with your sales data.

And then you can plan accordingly based upon trends, because a lot of these things are not a one off shoot things. They take place over several months or several years. 

**Buck:** In terms of right now, you mentioned a bunch of indicators. For the most part, it seems to me that we're, we are very steep in that boom still, is there any indication from your end that this is slowing down anytime soon? 

**Murray:** Well, it depends on what the Fed does, and not give a cop out answer. But, the Fed announced this week that they don't think inflation is transitory. So that was a change in their view of the inflation picture that they, of course, created by boosting the money supply 25% of 27% last year, which is an extraordinary injection of liquidity and the U S economy. So again, if the Fed sees inflation ramping up and, and, every, what does the second week of the month, the bureau of labor statistics at ounces, the, the CPI and the PPI. And if those show. Inflation is accelerating or not slowing down the Fed may act preemptively or less this way, forcing the Fed's hands to raise rates before they wanted to.

And that would start the countdown to when the yield curve inverts and when the stock market peaks out of. And so one indicator, which says that the stock market is grossly inflated, which you're probably familiar with is the buffet indicator that the market capitalization of the stock market to the GDP is now 50% higher, where it was when the.com bubble burst.

So that indicator is now flashing yellow. Maybe even read the question: how high can it go in this cycle? And again, nobody knows the answer to that question, but what we're seeing is these periodic downdrafts and the economy like shows that there are a lot of nervous investors out there and money managers that can drop the stock market three, 4% in one day, that's not in the sign of a healthy market and then rebound 3, 4% in one.

So again, what I think this is telling us is that there's a battle going on between the bulls and the bears and the economy. There are some people that are pretty bearish and there's some people that are pretty bullish. And so that's what makes markets, supplying the man and people's perception of the future.

**Buck:** It seems to me that the irony here is that some of the threats, the more systemic threats, to. The economy are, potentially what's, what's keeping it booming. you know, for example, if you look at with COVID and now, you know, sure. The Fed could be thinking about tightening up monetary policy, but they also, you know, have the looming threat of a new strain of COVID that creates another round of shutdowns and that kind of thing. And then, so we're kind of a no man's land in that regard. And, and it's that's, I feel like that's one of the biggest challenges because you, you just don't, you're not dealing with just the economy.

**Murray:** Yeah, this is why, I think that a lot of CEOs and CFOs stay up late at night because they're trying to figure out what will the economy look like three, five years down the road, because remember a lot of these capital expenditure plans take place over three to five years or longer. And so, if you count COVID, which of course you could by engaging in major capital investment and then seeing the economy implode for six months or a year or so, or any time in between that may give you pause as to doing any major capital investment because there's too much uncertainty. And that's exactly what happened by the way, during the great depression, when economic policy was changing so much, it was hard for business people to plan for three to five years. And so the depression dragged on for the whole decade instead of, being a pretty short and swift up downturn, which we've got rid of a lot of the distorted investments of the 1920.

So again, As I told my students before I left teaching last year, I think we're going to see days where the stock market goes down 5, 10% in one day. But I mean, we have, after all we saw a 22% decline in October, 1987. And, then the market rallied, if you look at a long-term chart, it was just a little blip.

It could be to this century what it was in the previous century, a lot of volatility, a lot of upward movement. And then, the interesting thing I came up with when I was doing the research is that there seems to be a hundred year cycle and the stock market, the panic of 1819. The forgotten depression of 1920 and then the implosion of 2020.

So if that's the case, well we know what happened in 1929 after the roaring twenties. So who knows what 2029, 2030 could look like. In fact, there's one indicator. I have a dimension because it's public information Tom McClellan from Seattle, who does the McClellan oscillator. He came up with an interesting chart, which was published years ago, showing the relationship between the stock market and the price of oil.

So he shows whenever the oil price peaks, 10 years later, the stock market peaks. And so he's showing that says the price of oil picks up in 2024 could be a very bad year for the stock market and the incumbent in the white house, which now is Joe Biden. So, that's something to look at in terms of a fairly short term prognosis, but, or at least a forecast based upon this indicator oil and stock market, which he doesn't have any explanation. He just came across it and did his research about prices. And he saw that there was this correlation between the stock market and the price of oil was a ten-year leg. 

**Buck:** You know, one of the questions I asked myself a little too, as again, when we look at these cycles and we talk about a hundred year cycle and, you know, big depressions, you know, certainly we've had other economists, on, on the show specifically talking about the night 1930s, ITR economics is another group we've added in predicting a depression in the thirties, a big confluence of debt and, you know, The other issues that they think are going to happen.

Then one of the questions I often ask myself again is, is this different now? Because the rule book is different. And like, I mean, the Fed can and does things that it's never done before. Right? 

**Murray:** Well, here's the thing that I believe could happen based upon what I was studying in the 1970s, when I was studying my, working on my doctoral dissertation, which by the way, was on inflation and how it spread through the economy.

And so the key thing to the US economy is really the dollar because the dollar is the reserve currency. And if you recall, it was 1979, 1980, we came very close. Total runaway inflation, where the dollar was imploding the price of gold, nearly doubled in a few months, because there was a flight out of the dollar, the Chinese, irrelevant to the world economy.

Now that's sitting on trillions of dollars of US debt dollars per se. So the question is. How long will overseas investors hold on to the dollar, especially foreign governments, as far as central banks are concerned, which basically prop up the US dollar because when you have a demand for something, its price stays relatively high.

And so the dollar is fairly strong given the world of Fiat currencies relative to other currencies. But, the point is a day of reckoning could come in the future. foreign holders of a dollar say enough is enough. We are worried about the inflation in the United States, which is appreciating the value of our dollars.

And so we're going to start dumping those dollars, maybe not all in one day or one week or one month, maybe for several years. And you see a slow, steady drip of the dollar declining. And, that could signal that the Fed has really lost control because if they try to prop up the dollar. Buying up dollars by creating valors that's when you go into a really hyperinflation scenario.

**Buck:** Although on the other side of that, it's not like we're the only country in the world that's doing this. And so in many regards are sort of the least ugly economy. 

**Murray:** Well, this is why we have been in an experiment since August, 1971. When Nixon closed the gold window. The dollar Fiat currency. So we are in one of the longest monetary experiments in world history. And no one knows exactly what the end result would be.

The question is, can we muddle along with paper money and the fed, inflating and deflating and inflating and deflating, like a rubber band. If you keep on stretching it long enough, it's gonna eventually break. So the question is when could the economy break? Because the underlying institution that we need to have sound money if you will, may be in jeopardy. 

**Buck:** There's a few terms that you use, I think would be useful for people to know about what is a public economy versus a private economy. You talk about that. 

**Murray:** Yeah. The private economy is something we all participate in. We have a business where work for a private enterprise and we have retailers, e-commerce, that's the private economy based upon supply and demand. That's where most of the action takes place. 

Then of course we have government spending and the federal reserve. So government spending does what it takes money out of the private economy, shuffles it through Washington through the different agencies and then dispenses it to the different agencies for various social and military programs.

And then you have, then you have the federal reserve trying to manage this by targeting short-term interest rates. So there's a tug of war going on in the natural economy, the private economy, which by the way, is something that very few people talk about in the mainstream media. The tendency of prices in a natural free economy is for prices to slowly fall.

As we saw in the last third of the 19th century, when we had fairly sound money and tremendous productivity and investment in infrastructure and capital goods. Real wages were going up for a fee every year. Now there were bumps in the road, the panic of 1873, the depression of the 1890s, but basically it was a great period for the US economy.

It became the world's great economic power during this period. And that of course carried through the 20th century and now in the 21st century. So all these things come together in the data. And what I try to do is sort it out in terms of, what's the good stuff that's happening in the economy. And the really good stuff is that there are incredible entrepreneurs, men and women who are just building great businesses from scratch despite all the regulations, that's a plus that's another part of the public economy or the regulations that businesses have to do that. Whether it's minimum wage laws, whether it's, environmental regulations or whether it's,  labor regulations. There are a host of things that businesses have to deal with.

And of course, the smaller the business, the less room for error, because they're working on tight margins. And if their costs are going up because of regulation, they have a tough time staying in business. All these generate enough revenue to grow. 

**Buck:** So you wrote a book called why the federal reserve sucks. What's it about? 

**Murray:** Well, what he did was, look at the testimony of Greenspan and Bernacchi during the dotcom bubble, the housing bubble, and it looked like they were pretty clueless as to what was going on, given that they're supposed to be pretty savvy people.

In fact, the Armani is that a Greenspan wrote a wonderful article in 1966, called golden economic and freedom where he pinpointed the problems of the right depression on the feds, easy money policies of the 1920s. And so when he became fed chairman in June of 1987, What did he do? He did the same thing that the federal reserve did in the 1920s, put the pedal to the metal and increase the money supply.

A flood of the economy was liquidity, and we got the.com bubble. And then the housing bubble, which of course Bernacchi didn't do anything to stop when he was appointed in 2006 after Greenspan served for 19 years. So again, you look at the testimony that they made in Congress. You look at the record of the economy and what they're there to do basically is to, for lack of better term, do the bidding of wall street, which loves low interest rates in order to have funds to boost the stock market and other markets. 

**Buck:** What happens when, you know, if, and when, I mean, obviously it's clear that it wouldn't would not be good for the economy, but okay. Realistically, people talk, but people have been talking. You know, the Fed and tightening, tightening of monetary policy and, you know, trying to get inflation under rain and rates going up all of these things, but given the fragility of the economy, do you really think that's realistic?

And if it does happen, if rates do start going up, aren't we kind of in a, in a really bad place, for that to happen, just in terms of the second. 

**Murray:** Yeah, it could happen. What happened in 1966, do a little economic history analogy. The Fed was tightening because of the Vietnam war and a great society program.

And, LBJ got very concerned and he called the chairman of the third reserve down to his ranch in Texas and basically, hovered over him and said, what are you doing? You got to keep rates down. And we had a mini recession in 1966, the fed put the pedal to the metal. The economy overheated in the late sixties.

And then we got the 69/70 recession. The Fed could do the same thing this time around when the economy starts slowing down and stock market tanks. And, the fed says, we can't continue the pain out there. And so they do another round of quantitative easing and we're back to the races again. So again, nothing is unusual or should I say nothing is off the table in terms of what the fed could do before. Their reaction to the economy after it slows down. It's quantitative easing.

**Buck:** The latest book is Navigating The Boom Bust Cycle: An Entrepreneur Survival Guide. Tell us about it. Who's it written for? Who can benefit from this? 

**Murray:** Well, I think there are several target audiences. Obviously it's the small business owner, the CFOs, the CEOs, the CEOs of major corporations. It's also, I think, a great book for college business students or MBA students who really want to know what's going on in the economy. How can we tell when the economy starts peaking and when the bottom occurs?

Because ironically enough, for some business people, if they're savvy enough, you pick up a lot of cheap assets. At the bottom of an economic cycle and you're ride that sucker off in the next boom. And you can make a lot of money, which is what Sir John Templeton did in the 1930s when he bought stocks. I think his goal was to buy quality companies that was selling for about a dollar in 1930-33, and the market imploded 90%.

And he made a ton of money during the 1930s because the Fed was pumping so much money in the stock market and had a big rally in the 1930s. One strategy is to get some cash in your portfolio. Listen, Warren Buffet has $149 billion on the balance sheet of Berkshire Hathaway. So what is he telling the world?

He doesn't think there are many good values out there. And so therefore he's keeping his powder dry. Possibly for the next downturn to buy up assets, either companies or stocks. Remember he wrote an op-ed on October 19th, 2007, actually 2008, just before the market bottomed in March of 2009 saying, Hey, I'm buying US stocks. There are great companies out there at good prices. Of course he was a few months early, but over the term, Those stocks turned out to be really good buys for buffet in October, 2000.

**Buck:** Is the book written at a level where you don't necessarily have to have a lot of financial or economic education before. I mean, I know a lot of it's interesting, you know, with my audience it's educated individuals, but you know, if you were a biochemistry major and you didn’t take Econ, except for macro. And just to get your requirement done 25 years ago, then you know, you don't have a lot of knowledge, but is this the type of book that would be good for, you know, a smart person who's interested in learning how things work in general, or you have to have some backup.

**Murray:** Absolutely. I try to write these books for the target audience and also people who don't have a background in economics and finance, because I think that's one of my strengths as a teacher and writer is I could explain fairly complex concepts to a general audience because these concepts are pretty common sense when you think about it.

And so, I've gotten great reviews. The testimonials are in the front of the book and I'm really proud of them because they talk about the book. It's an indispensable guide for people who really want to know how the economy unfolds over time and, and what the landmarks are to look at. So, I think anyone who is curious about the economy who wants some more insight about the economy, can pick it up.

And by the way, the publisher has a 20% discount audits with a code boom20. And if you go to my blog,  MurraySabrin.com, it links you to the publishers of books, a website, and it's Black Friday, everyday at Business Experts Press for them.

**Buck:** So, okay, so you can find the book at your website, www.murraysabrin.com.

That's murraysabrin.com. Can you also get it on Amazon?

**Murray:** The publisher's discount is not available on Amazon. So, that's the nice thing about the publisher. They really think this book could have a tremendous impact in terms of people really understanding it and having more educated entrepreneurs.

**Buck:** Good stuff,  Murray, I really do appreciate your time. And, looking forward to reading the book, I have a copy and I just sort of skimmed a little bit so far, but, I want to get into it a little bit more and I appreciate your, your willingness to, to teach, you know, those of us who don't know as much about this stuff.

**Murray:** Thank you so much, Buck. Appreciate it. 

**Buck:** We'll be right back."
How much will the Taycan improve over the next 3 years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Taycan/comments/rh8sl3/how_much_will_the_taycan_improve_over_the_next_3/,Adventurous_Dot_3062,1,2021-12-16 04:40:38,0,/r/Taycan/comments/rh8sl3/how_much_will_the_taycan_improve_over_the_next_3/,NaN,"Context: I have a deposit in for a Taycan GTS at my local dealer. I am first in line for an allocation and they expect one to come through in 5-6 months. The build spec I have put together is a little over 150k. 

The reason for my question is that I am trying to get a sense of where the community thinks the Taycan is going in terms of year over year improvements. Although I think there is no question in my mind that the Porsche Taycan is currently the best overall EV sports saloon by far (outside of the electric hypercars in the million+ range), I also wonder if it won't be made obsolete by near-future improvements in the technology. An analogy: The first iPhone was vastly superior to its competitor ""smart"" phones (anyone remember the Blackberry Storm ... yeesh). However, the first iPhone compared to the iPhone 4 was hot garbage. Now the technology has matured, and the difference between an iPhone 12 vs iPhone 13 is marginal at best. But in those early days, you were generally better off waiting another year unless you really, really needed a new phone (or money was no object and you could just upgrade every year without a second thought).   


I'm not sure where we are at in the EV technology curve, but they do seem to be advancing very quickly. Am I foolish to plunk down 150k on a stellar EV knowing it may be comparatively obsolete in 3 years, or am I overestimating the rate of technological progress in this space? I also have the option to lease a lower trim model for 3 years at pretty attractive terms and see where the technology goes, but the money spent on a lease during those 3 years would cover about a third of the purchase price of a GTS, and with inflation who knows where the prices will reset over the 3 years, much less interest rates (I will likely finance about 50% of the purchase given how low current interest rates are). 

I'm probably overthinking this but am very interested in everyone's thoughts."

# Announcing the Launch of the ALPACA Governance Vault! Higher APYs for ALPACA holders!

https://preview.redd.it/1x1yguxplu581.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9867637ceb398e54a7a8167a0f07b62c8d4346

We senior alpacas are thrilled to announce yet another major product release to wrap up 2021 on a strong note. Starting the **21st of December 2021,** you’ll be able to lock up your ALPACA in the governance vault for higher rewards and platform revenue sharing!

# ❓How the Governance Pool Will Work

Our governance vault is a fork of Curve DAO’s governance. We believe this is one of the best models to align the incentives of the platform with loyal token holders.

You’ll be able to choose how long you want to lock up your ALPACA tokens, from **a minimum of 1 week to a maximum of 1 year.** In return, you will receive xALPACA tokens which will represent your share in the governance rewards pool as well as your voting power for the upcoming governance functions in Q1 2022.

The amount of xALPACA you’ll receive will be calculated based on the amount of ALPACA deposited and the remaining lock duration, where **1 ALPACA locked for one year = 1 xALPACA.** Your xALPACA balance will decrease linearly over time and will reach 0 when it’s unlocked.

**The longer you lock up for, the more xALPACA you will receive, which translates into a higher multiple on your rewards APY and governance voting power.**

**Example 1:**

* Alice locked **100 ALPACA** for **52 weeks** and received **100 xALPACA**
* **26 weeks** have passed. Alice’s xALPACA balance became **50**

**Example 2:**

* John locked **100 ALPACA** for **26 weeks**, and received **50 xALPACA**
* Feeling like a llama, John then decided he’d prefer to get a higher multiple on his rewards so he extended his lockup from 26 to **52 weeks,**and received an additional 50 xALPACA, bringing his total balance to**100 xALPACA**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/58bxti0tlu581.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6846a7b62ca59c0416261b432125bcbfcf5e9c84

&gt;***💡 Pro tips***  
*- To ensure you always get the maximum APY on your governance rewards, you can extend your lockup period (to the max. 52 weeks) every week before the snapshot is taken*  
*- You can add ALPACA to your locked position or extend the locked duration at any time*  
*- You can only have one locked position for each wallet address. If you wish to have multiple locked positions with different durations, you can use multiple wallets*

# 🎁Rewards for Participants

By locking up your ALPACA, you will be entitled to receive **ALL the following rewards!**

## ALPACA Emissions

A️ portion of ALPACA emissions will be distributed to governance vault stakers — 300 allocation points (\~0.355 ALPACA / block.) These rewards will be shifted from the ibALPACA staking pool.

## Grazing Range Pool Rewards

Governance vault stakers will earn token rewards from all future Grazing Range pools. Moreover, you will not have to choose which pool to stake in. If there are multiple pools running concurrently, **you will be eligible to receive rewards from all of them!** The yields will stack up for you.

&gt;*There will not be a change to the existing GR pools. ibALPACA will continue to be used for staking in the Grazing Range until the reward periods on the current pools end*

## Platform Revenue Sharing

To align closer to market rates, and give more benefits to ALPACA holders, we will adjust the leveraged yield farming performance fee to **9%** (on yield farming rewards portion only). Of this, **5%** will go to Protocol APR for the ALPACA stakers in the governance vault (as an ALPACA buyback), with the remainder going towards the development fund.

This is a new revenue stream for ibALPACA stakers that will bring in an additional \~**2.6Mn/year** or \~**$50k/week** (based on last week’s metrics) as rewards to them, adding a consistent income channel on top of the existing Protocol APR, Grazing Range rewards, and long-term deflationary benefits through buyback &amp; burn that ALPACA holders enjoy. That’s right, dear alpacas, you’re about to get fat on grass.

## Governance Voting Power

More xALPACA = more votes for governance proposals. This is coming in the second half of the product release for this governance vault next quarter.

# ⏰Rewards Distribution Mechanism

Due to the smart contract structure, **rewards will now be distributed on a weekly basis.**

Each week, we will take a snapshot of users’ xALPACA balances at **Midnight UTC Thursday.** This balance will be used to calculate each user’s share of the rewards accrued in the following week. Rewards will then be available to claim the following Thursday.

Let’s look at an example to further clarify this concept.

* Users will be able to start locking their ALPACA when we deploy the UI for the governance vault on **Tuesday, the 21st of December.**
* The first snapshot will be taken at **midnight UTC on Thursday the 23rd of December.**
* All the users that lock their ALPACA in the governance vault before Midnight UTC on the 23rd of December will be eligible for the rewards that accrue from **23rd December to 30th December.**
* Rewards will be available to claim after **midnight UTC on the 30th of December.**

&gt;***💡 Pro tips***  
*Make sure you make any adjustments to your locked positions(such as extending lockup for a higher multiplier or adding more ALPACA) by* ***11.59PM UTC Wednesday*** *to get the max allocation from the following week’s rewards.*

With this new lockup vault, selling pressure on ALPACA should decrease substantially. When combined with the token’s deflationary nature, that should tip the ALPACA trading market towards net buying and price improvement, as has been the case in other protocols that have introduced lockup vaults.

Now, as 2021 draws to a close, we would like to take this opportunity to thank our community and partners for their continued support. The team is grateful for all your help, suggestions, participation, and kind words. It’s been a busy year but we will continue to work tirelessly to deliver on our roadmap and make the best products we can. Happy Holidays!

I’m here to shill you my yield optimizer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhpumv/im_here_to_shill_you_my_yield_optimizer/,indonesian_activist,1,2021-12-16 20:34:38,0,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhpumv/im_here_to_shill_you_my_yield_optimizer/,PROJECT-UPDATE,"If you are currently riding high, profiting in every trade you make,  printing triple digit gains and feeling like you’re on top of the world then stop reading right now as this post is not for you. On the other hand if you’re feeling a bit down, not as good as you did at the start of 2021 as you haven’t been doing too well in a choppy market then read on.

In this post I’ll talk about a less stressful way to earn money in crypto besides active trading called DeFI(Decentralized Finance) and near the end of the post I’ll slip in a little shill about my own product to help you accomplish that goal.

**A Layman Introduction to DeFI**

When people talk about DeFI, usually it means they’re playing around with a chrome browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is a wallet for EVM compatible blockchain like Ethereum, Binance smart chain, polygon and etc. It let’s you interact with smart contracts in the blockchain via frontend websites called Dapps/WEB3.0. You can do a lot of things in those Dapps like making bets, trading,  saving/lending , staking and providing liquidity.

**Providing Liquidity in DeFI**

In a DeFI Decentralized Exchange (DEX) like Ethereum’s Uniswap or their BSC counterpart, Pancakeswap there are no order books instead every trade you make happens against a liquidity pool provided by liquidity providers. Liquidity providers stake an equal value of paired tokens, ETH-USDT for example, and in return for facilitating trade receives a LP/Flip token and \~ 0.17-0.25%  of the trade volume that occurs in that pool. 

[https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/](https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/)

The affect of providing liquidity vs stacking single tokens is that it flattens your profit/loss curve like the example below.

https://preview.redd.it/49yl0gm9ew581.jpg?width=884&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64de11a005e45c63f79ceb01208749d0c2cff205

In a mega bull cycle like 2021, as a LP you’ll make less then stacking single coins however crypto markets are extremely cyclic,  entering 2022, if the market starts to slow down a bit, LPs stand to  make much more in fees compared to stacking single coins.

**Introducing Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the 2nd most popular destination for LPs**

As Ethereum gas fees (the cost to make a transaction in the blockchain) has risen to hundreds of dollars per Tx, it has driven a lot of retail investors  to BSC. BSC currently holds the top position in number of transactions per day and wins in ease of use due to the smooth integration of it’s bsc wallet with binance.com. Being a much younger ecosystem compared to ETH there are still plenty of opportunities in BSC to get high passive income returns measured in annualized percentage yield (APY) however the low barrier to entry has also made it into a  “rug pull central” of sorts for scam coins and projects. 

**How to tell if a BSC DeFI project is a scam/Ponzi** 

Technically speaking, A Ponzi scheme is **an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors**.  In my view, in general, a coin or a Dapp needs to provide some other functions besides playing tricks with liquidity to not be considered as a Ponzi. For example, Pancakeswap facilitates coin trading in BSC, Venus provides crypto savings/lending and Chromia is a SaaS for games. You can tell those are not Ponzi as they provide actual utility while the Ponzi ones always starts with a variation of the following statement

*“Why is bitcoin considered to not be a Ponzi …. “*

Then will go on to explain why similar to bitcoin,  their coin/project is also not a Ponzi  due to the belief from a large group of people and some convoluted explanation on how their advanced algorithm maintains liquidity. Of course it usually has some crazy high APYs like 1,000,000% for staking and  do a lot of rebasing. Rebasing is the practice of reducing and or increasing the supply of a token, including the ones already in your wallet to achieve a certain price target. So for the token creators to let’s say increase the price by 1,000%, rather then buying the tokens in the liquidity pools he could just reduce the supply by 90%. Obviously in this process no real value is created as it’s just a liquidity shell game which would have to collapse at some point. This brings me to the second point.

**A lot of people are aware of this but invest anyway**

From my observation in a typical scam coin/Dapp telegram group, at least 1/3 of the people there are fully aware of the reality but choose to invest anyway. They act oblivious to the fact and spend every other hour shilling the coin/project in the group in the hopes of convincing a greater fool to buy in. Though usually less then 5% of the investors will end up in the green when the rug is pulled.

**Nonetheless there are plenty of genuine gems in BSC**

Like Pancakeswap (PCS) for example, they are the leading DEX in BSC and have surpassed Uniswap in both transaction count and volume since a few months ago.  After a significant pullback, their $CAKE token is now in a deflationary phase as the weekly total burn exceeds the amount of new cake minted. It’s price is currently at support and looks poised to bounce back following reduced supply. PCS provides farming rewards for liquidity providers which means in addition to receiving LP fees from the trading pool, Liquidity Providers can also stake the LP tokens in PCS farms to receive rewards. This reward is often more lucrative then the trading fees it self as it can reach hundreds of percent APY depending on the amount of liquidity in the pool.  A popular LP pair for investors in PCS is the CAKE-BNB pair which earns great rewards while not being too volatile.

**Only, however, PCS gives you the reward in $CAKE and you have to manually harvest to compound**

Many investors don’t like this as they prefer to remain in relatively more delta stable LPs, plus it cost gas fees to harvest frequently.  Enter the yield optimizers, yield optimizers are a class of smart contracts that performs automatic harvesting and compounding of your farming rewards to maximize your yield and reduce gas fees.  There are two main types of PCS yield optimizers, the CAKE Maximizer and the LP/Flip Maximizer.

**WARNING INCOMING SHILL BELOW**

From the above diagram you’ve seen how a PCS yield optimizer is supposed to work nonetheless in practice, a lot of projects twist this to take advantage of unsophisticated investors.  Observe the following example screenshots taken from existing bsc optimizers.

https://preview.redd.it/dxpbae5kew581.png?width=1648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d6bd9d7fa8330ff8805d992c1451d4a23bcc56a

Notice the two vaults on the left and center have higher APYS yet unfortunately they don’t give you the reward in pure LPs but rather in their own reward token. Those vaults give you their minted token and keep the earned LPs for themselves, a bait and switch so to speak.  Later on, when inevitably the price and liquidity of the tokens they gave you goes to zero, they just close up shop and start again under a new name.  The vault on the right on the other hand, has lower APY but gives you the reward in the blue-chip BSC LP token you’ve deposited in, CAKE-BNB. That vault is from https://happyhippo.farm/ , a BSC yield optimizer I’ve been working on. Happyhippo doesn’t issue it’s own token, doesn’t pretend to be a DAO and to the best of my knowledge, currently has the lowest fees in the entire BSC ecosystem, at only 2% of your earned profit.  If you’re interested in a no frills low fees yield farm, come and give it ago.

**The Available LP pairs in HappyHippo.farm are**

CAKE-BNB 61.5% APY

USDC-BUSD 13.8% APY

CHR-BUSD 112% APY

ETERNAL-BNB 1,120% APY 

*\*APY numbers are annualized projections based on 7 days average vault performance*

**In case that you’re new to providing liquidity,**

you can use Hippo’s Zap to directly acquire LP tokens, it’s a pretty simple process as you can convert your BNB,USDT,USDC,BUSD directly to the desired LP pairs. I’ve curated the zap routes and configuration to ensure it gives  competitive prices vs adding liquidity manually through PCS interface.

**What if the website goes down**

First, this is very unlikely as I’ve paid a 2 year advance for the website hosting and I’m sure a lot of you already know this but for those who don’t yet know, a Dapp website is just a frontend for the contract in the blockchain. If the vault contracts are verified like in happyhippo’s case, you can deposit, withdraw and harvest from the vaults directly using bscscan. 

Example;

For the Hippo Cake-BNB Cake Maximizer vaults, open this URL

[https://bscscan.com/address/0x8d7f50F076D1acE3E313b0b0B9c06916eAf41Bc4#writeProxyContract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x8d7f50F076D1acE3E313b0b0B9c06916eAf41Bc4#writeProxyContract)

Connect your wallet and manually enter the values you wish to withdraw from the write function withdraw.

One more thing, when you withdraw your token manually, remember to add the decimals, as BSC tokens like their ETH counterparts uses a trailing decimal system, so when you see 1.0 CAKE-BNB LP in your UI/Wallet for example, it’s actually 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 you need to input in bscscan, without the commas.

**To conclude,**

Back in 2018, having made my money in a professional field, I retired early and moved to Bali. Life was good and I even opened a few small business on the island. When COVID19 hit and the lockdown started, I choose to keep the business afloat using my retirement savings, which of course in hindsight was not a very good idea. In Q3 2020, I started participating in WSB YOLOs which surprisingly worked out quite well and now near the end of 2021, I have zeroed in on DeFI. Point is, life is very unpredictable at times and you have to be open to learning new things in order to survive and grow. Things like my yield optimizer for example which I believe brings real value for you through optimizing your farming rewards on blue-chip BSC  tokens.  I’ve retired early once before and am now convinced through crypto and optimizing DeFI APY, I would be able to retire very comfortably once again,  not by rug pulling you guys but by helping you earn yields through hippo’s vaults so that we can all retire sooner to the earthly paradise of our choosing. That’s it for today, thank you for the time and attention you’ve given and feel free to dm me if you have any questions or feedbacks."

On the other hand if you’re feeling a bit down, not as good as you did at the start of 2021 as you haven’t been doing too well in a choppy market then read on.

In this post I’ll talk about a less stressful way to earn money in crypto besides active trading called DeFI(Decentralized Finance) and near the end of the post I’ll slip in a bit  about my own product to help you accomplish that goal.

**A Layman Introduction to DeFI**

When people talk about DeFI, usually it means they’re playing around with a chrome browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is a wallet for EVM compatible blockchain like Ethereum, Binance smart chain, polygon and etc. It let’s you interact with smart contracts in the blockchain via frontend websites called Dapps/WEB3.0. You can do a lot of things in those Dapps like making bets, trading,  saving/lending , staking and providing liquidity.

**Providing Liquidity in DeFI**

In a DeFI Decentralized Exchange (DEX) like Ethereum’s Uniswap or their BSC counterpart, Pancakeswap there are no order books instead every trade you make happens against a liquidity pool provided by liquidity providers. Liquidity providers stake an equal value of paired tokens, ETH-USDT for example, and in return for facilitating trade receives a LP/Flip token and \~ 0.17-0.25%  of the trade volume that occurs in that pool.  The affect of providing liquidity vs stacking single tokens is that it flattens your profit/loss curve like the example below.

https://preview.redd.it/420v3pqdix581.jpg?width=884&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2075a8a9d3086fa05278b0e2eb104954e384d0e

In a mega bull cycle like 2021, as a LP you’ll make less then stacking single coins however crypto markets are extremely cyclic,  entering 2022, if the market starts to slow down a bit, LPs stand to  make much more in fees compared to stacking single coins.

**Introducing Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the 2nd most popular destination for LPs**

As Ethereum gas fees (the cost to make a transaction in the blockchain) has risen to hundreds of dollars per Tx, it has driven a lot of retail investors  to BSC. BSC currently holds the top position in number of transactions per day and wins in ease of use due to the smooth integration of it’s bsc wallet with binance.com. Being a much younger ecosystem compared to ETH there are still plenty of opportunities in BSC to get high passive income returns measured in annualized percentage yield (APY) however the low barrier to entry has also made it into a  “rug pull central” of sorts for scam coins and projects. 

**How to tell if a BSC DeFI project is a scam/Ponzi** 

Technically speaking, A Ponzi scheme is **an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors**.  In my view, in general, a coin or a Dapp needs to provide some other functions besides playing tricks with liquidity to not be considered as a Ponzi. For example, Pancakeswap facilitates coin trading in BSC, Venus provides crypto savings/lending and Chromia is a SaaS for games. You can tell those are not Ponzi as they provide actual utility while the Ponzi ones always starts with a variation of the following statement

*“Why is bitcoin considered to not be a Ponzi …. “*

Then will go on to explain why similar to bitcoin,  their coin/project is also not a Ponzi  due to the belief from a large group of people and some convoluted explanation on how their advanced algorithm maintains liquidity. Of course it usually has some crazy high APYs like 1,000,000% for staking and  do a lot of rebasing. Rebasing is the practice of reducing and or increasing the supply of a token, including the ones already in your wallet to achieve a certain price target. So for the token creators to let’s say increase the price by 1,000%, rather then buying the tokens in the liquidity pools he could just reduce the supply by 90%. Obviously in this process no real value is created as it’s just a liquidity shell game which would have to collapse at some point. This brings me to the second point.

**A lot of people are aware of this but invest anyway**

From my observation in a typical scam coin/Dapp telegram group, at least 1/3 of the people there are fully aware of the reality but choose to invest anyway. They act oblivious to the fact and spend every other hour shouting the coin/project in the group in the hopes of convincing a greater fool to buy in. Though usually less then 5% of the investors will end up in the green when the rug is pulled.

**Nonetheless there are plenty of genuine gems in BSC**

Like Pancakeswap (PCS) for example, they are the leading DEX in BSC and have surpassed Uniswap in both transaction count and volume since a few months ago.  After a significant pullback, their CAKE token is now in a deflationary phase as the weekly total burn exceeds the amount of new cake minted. It’s price is currently at support and looks poised to bounce back following reduced supply. PCS provides farming rewards for liquidity providers which means in addition to receiving LP fees from the trading pool, Liquidity Providers can also stake the LP tokens in PCS farms to receive rewards. This reward is often more lucrative then the trading fees it self as it can reach hundreds of percent APY depending on the amount of liquidity in the pool.  A popular LP pair for investors in PCS is the CAKE-BNB pair which earns great rewards while not being too volatile.

**Only, however, PCS gives you the reward in CAKE and you have to manually harvest to compound**

Many investors don’t like this as they prefer to remain in relatively more delta stable LPs, plus it cost gas fees to harvest frequently.  Enter the yield optimizers, yield optimizers are a class of smart contracts that performs automatic harvesting and compounding of your farming rewards to maximize your yield and reduce gas fees.  There are two main types of PCS yield optimizers, the CAKE Maximizer and the LP/Flip Maximizer.

It’s [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/) In looking at this site it would seem these coins are severely undervalued. In coming up with a fair value for each coin I would expect the total market cap to either be at least the value locked or at lowest ¼ the value. I decided to look at the top 5 to determine how close their market cap was to the total value locked.

Maker (MKR) has $18.20B value locked but has a market cap of $2.32B. Curve Finance (CRV) has $14.03B value locked but has a market cap of $1.72B. Aave (AAVE) has $11.28B value locked but has a market cap of $2.36B. InstaDApp (INST) has $10.77B value locked but has a market cap of $66M. Compound (COMP) has $10.12B value locked but has a market cap of $1.17B.

This would mean that MKR is 13% of the value locked, CRV is 12%, AAVE is 21%, INST is 1%, and COMP is 12%. It seems like the biggest outlier of this group is INST. But the other four coins seem to be around the same or similar range. Based on this, I would think these coins would have larger market caps and not be as low as they are today.

Any thoughts on what the true value of DeFi coins should be?"

DeFi has grown into a giant snowball in the past few years rolling down the hill of alternative finance towards the land of traditional finance. With every move it makes, DeFi tends to answer the unanswered questions of CeFi, trying to create a fairer playing field for the average investors.

Common practices like under-collateralized loans, unfair borrowing conditions, institutional investors only (read rich-only) investing slots are becoming a thing of the past as DeFi expands.

Although, there are still problems like liquidity pool hacks, smart contract loopholes, and good ol’ rug pulls in DeFi, having a strong cooperative community across the whole space makes it way easier to overcome these problems and safeguard investors’ funds.

In this article, we’ll have a close look at the state of the art in the DeFi space and where does iBNB Grand fit into this intricately designed world of finance.

**The Beginning Days of DeFi**

Before diving into where DeFi is now, it’s important to know where it all started. To have a better understanding of the speed of development the space is going through.

It all started with the birth of Ethereum, a modified version of the Bitcoin blockchain to host Dapps on top of it. It was at that moment in the history of web3 that a blockchain became more than a really advanced cashbook.

As Ethereum was introduced, ideas of creating a peer-to-peer lending system started popping out. The platform that actually laid the building blocks of DeFi was Maker or MakerDAO.

**Maker DAO — The Concept of DeFi**

The creator of Maker presented a platform where users can come onboard to directly lend and borrow money, eliminating the third party — banks.

However, the problem with a peer-to-peer lending/borrowing system was to find the appropriate person on the other side who is prepared to lend to you on your terms and vice versa.

Let’s say you want to borrow 30 ETH on a 5% interest for 6 months, using the P2P lending model, it’ll be a time-consuming method to match you with someone who agrees on those terms.

As a result, the user-to-contract protocol came into existence replacing the peer-to-peer model of DeFi. In short, liquidity pools came into existence.

A liquidity pool, as you know, is a pool of assets where the money you want to borrow already exists and you can just borrow it against sizeable collateral. Similarly, you can invest in the pool as a liquidity provider (LP), in return for your investment, you’ll earn interests and rewards.

We’ll go into the details of the liquidity pool as the article progresses.

Borrowing from Maker, or any other DeFi platform requires you to over-collateralize the loan to ensure that LPs don’t lose money and the pool remains healthy. In Maker, the borrower has to collateralize 150% of the borrowed amount. For every 100 ETH put in the pool, the person can borrow 66% of its total value in DAI.

\[DAI is the native token for transactions in the Maker ecosystem. It’s soft pegged to the USD backed by the Maker liquidity pool. That means, the value of 1 DAI always remains close to $1.\]

Being backed by a pool of multi-collateral assets makes DAI (one of) the most trusted trustless stable coin.

If the value of the collateralized assets dips lower than 150% of the borrowed amount, Maker automatically liquidates the position of the user to cover the losses and imposes a penalty to discourage such incidents from happening.

If at any point, the value of the currency fluctuates heavily, Maker encourages the borrowers to pay the principal loan amount in DAI and the accrued interest in MKR, the governance token of MakerDAO. Once the DAI gets into the pool, it gets burnt to decrease the supply.

Now coming to the DAO part of MakerDAO, Maker has a DAO in place that makes these decisions through consensus. Anyone holding the MKR token has the right to vote on issues.

These are the primary aspects of MakerDAO and DeFi as a whole, with slightly different rules and regulations.

**AAVE — Flash Loans and Collateral Swap**

AAVE was launched at the time of the ICO-mania of 2017–18 and is on the top 3 of DeFi platforms.

AAVE introduced a few brand new features and improved a couple of existing options in the DeFi space. The most revolutionary and groundbreaking was Flash Loans.

The concept of a Flash Loan is slightly complicated as it consists of multiple technical aspects of the Ethereum blockchain.

A Flash Loan lets a user borrow a massive amount without any collateral. But the user has to repay the amount on the same transaction within the standard Ethereum block time of 13 seconds. That’s where the name Flash Loan comes from.

Basically, you’re taking out a loan, using the money, and then returning it to the lender within a few seconds. So what exactly is happening here?

Given the special requirement of the loan, it can only be used in a few specific scenarios.

1. Arbitrage

2. Collateral Swap

3. Self Liquidation

Arbitrage is the action of exploiting the price difference of an asset in two different exchanges to make a profit. For instance, if the price of BNB is $550.00 at exchange A and $550.50 at exchange B, buying 1 BNB from A and selling at B will result in a $0.5 profit.

If the same action gets repeated with $10 million worth of margin, the profit will be astronomically high. And that’s where a Flash Loan comes into action.

Collateral swap is another useful action that can be performed with Flash Loans. As the name says, it is used to swap collaterals inside the liquidity pool.

Say you have 100 ETH as collateral in the liquidity pool but you want to swap it with BAT tokens. In this case, you’ll have to take out a flash loan of DAI and repay your loan, then swap your ETH for BAT, and then take a put the BAT tokens in the liquidity pool to borrow DAI.

The third action that Flash Loans perform is self-liquidation. This issue arises when your collateralized asset (ETH, for example) loses value and comes close to the minimum valuation limit. At this level, you don’t want to put more of the same asset in the pool, so you take out a DAI flash loan and to repay your borrowed amount and withdraw the ETH. Once you have withdrawn, swap your ETH for DAI to repay the flash loan and keep the rest.

**Compound and cTokens**

Compound is another popular DeFi platform with $5 billion in total value locked. It more or less uses the same system with a few exceptions.

Compound’s most interesting revelation to the world is cTokens. cTokens are used as a token of certification to liquidity providers. Depending on your lending token, the cTokens are assigned directly at a standard exchange rate. For ETH, it will cETH, for DAI, it’ll cDAI, and the exchange rate of cTokens against the actual token depends on the market price.

The exchange rate of DAI to cDAI at the time of writing is 44.95 cDAI.

So if you lend 1000 DAI to the Compound Protocol, the protocol will transfer 44950 cDAI to your wallet. You can redeem your cTokens by withdrawing your actual tokens, or you can redeem a portion of it.

The longer you hold the cTokens, the more it appreciates in value.

Projects like Uniswap, Curve Finance, Bancor are doing great in the space going on an explosive trajectory.

**How iBNB is Improving the DeFi Space.**

iBNB entered the DeFi space with a different mindset. All the things that I mentioned so far speak for the massive progress DeFi has seen from its inception 5 years ago. Although it has done a great job so far, it is still lacking in a few places. The goal of iBNB is to fix these problems with innovative scalable solutions, and iBNB has been doing a pretty impressive job at it.

**Dynamic Transaction Protocol**

The most significant aspect of iBNB is the Dynamic Transaction Protocol (DTP). As the name suggests, it’s a tax protocol that automatically adjusts the transaction fees depending on the health of the liquidity pool to keep the fluctuations low. As per the iBNB whitepaper, “The distribution between liquidity and dividend pool is continuously adjusted in order to maximize rewards while ensuring healthy liquidity.”

For instance, in general, a 10% transaction fee is sent to the dividend pool to be divided between the investors. But in case of low liquidity, the system implements the rejuvenation state. At this state, to mitigate the diminishing condition of the liquidity pool, a percent of the transaction fees gets redirected to the pool. This cycle continues till the liquidity pool gets back in its healthy state.

Also, in times of excess liquidity (&gt;15% of iBNB market capitalization), the excess gets redirected to the dividend pool as additional rewarding factors to investors.

**Anti-Dump Mechanism**

The whole Crypto space including DeFi suffers from pump-and-dump scams resulting in catastrophic price fluctuations in the market. In an attempt to inspire healthy practice, iBNB has deployed an anti-dump mechanism that discourages token holders to sell a large portion of their funds by charging a higher transaction fee.

Within a 24-hour standpoint, if an investor sells more than 0.01% of the total supply sold within that period, an additional 2% fee gets deducted from the transaction. If the sold token amounts to anywhere between 0.01% — 0.029%, the fee goes to 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

Amount of fees deducted on various degrees of transactions.

**iBNB Bank and Debit Card**

The iBNB Bank is the first DeFi bank that facilitates the management and growth of investors’ finance. It is a central system for receiving, smart distribution, and utility of large volumes of BNBs that is collected from project transaction fees and exchanges.

The bank acts on multiple levels to keep the iBNB ecosystem functioning by allocating funds to different internal projects, clearing dividends to investors, and funding research and development.

The iBNB Debit Card is the resulting subsidiary of the iBNB bank. Like the bank, it’s going to be the first DeFi Debit card that lets investors collect their rewards and spend them directly on activities like shopping, travelling, etc.

Most importantly, the iBNB Bank has the infrastructure in place to continue evolving to the frontiers of DeFi innovation. It means that with collaboration and insights from experts and the community itself, the latest State of the Art DeFi innovations is implemented by the research and development team of iBNB.

**nBNB Partner Projects**

As of today, there is one project as partner on the nBNB Network.

**BabySafeMoon**

BabySafeMoon is a deflationary token with a core tax protocol in place. With every transaction, the tax rate is adjustable and the amount of tax deducted caters to different purposes.

For example, a 15% tax is deducted on a $100 transaction, the $15 will be divided into multiple areas like reflection, development, nBNB bridge, etc.

The Dynamic Transaction Protocol (DTP V2) is also deployed in this scenario to adjust the tax rate. So if the Liquidity Pool is unstable and needs more supply, the tax will get higher automatically. On the other hand, if the LP remains healthy, the tax deduction will remain the same.

**The near Future**

In a special early freebie shared with you here first, the nBNB Network is scheduled to onboard 6 projects in the upcoming time to come. With transaction fees coming into the iBNB Bank, and the iBNB Bank issuing special collectables for iBNB investors to gamify the investment experience with bonuses, the near future is looking very promising for iBNB.

**Conclusion**

As Defi progresses, the idea of the State of the Art will change too, affecting the finance sector in much larger ways. It has taken DeFi less than 5 years to reach a place where investors consider it as a viable investment option with much larger profit margins. So much so that the total value locked in the space has crossed $200 billion.

iBNB promises a better and more integrated future for DeFi by creating a network of projects and infrastructure that has the potential to revolutionize the field. As the pioneer, iBNB is charting the course and as more projects join the nBNB network, newer and better technologies will be implemented to improve the investors’ experience.

Unintended Consequences: The Curious Case of the Flat Curve  The foundations of modern finance was upended on July 16, 2021. Let me explain...

Remember how over the summer everyone briefly marveled at this thing called the Reverse Repo? You knew something was strange, but stocks go up so who cares? Well, as with many well-intentioned interventions, it's often the unintended consequences that matter.

Stick with me. So the Reverse Repo (""RRP"") is a tool the Fed created to mop up excess liquidity created by QE. QE creates cash and removes collateral (govt + mortgage debt). This lowers interest rates, ensures liquidity for banks etc.

  
But at some point, there is simply too much cash that needs to find a home. As short term interests are about to go negative, the Fed says ""wait this is no good, we don't want negative rates, just give me that money and I'll hold it for you directly"" (via the RRP)

Historically this has gone pretty smoothly. As rates rise and QE ends, cash leaves Fed's zero interest ""cold storage"" to find a positive return in the real world. But things have changed.

First: the RRP historically did not pay any interest - hence ""cold storage"". On June 16, the Fed announced it would begin paying 0.05%.   Second: the maximum capacity of this cold storage (as determined by the counterparty limit) increased by 6x since March.

These changes, described as technical tweaks, transformed an overflow facility into the most attractive short-term asset ever available to non-bank entities. A truly riskless, overnight, guaranteed 0.05% return.

The foundation of modern finance is the assumption of a risk-free rate, approximated by government debt yield. This new RRP is not an approximation - its the real deal, particularly in the backdrop of the debt ceiling debates and volatility in the short term rates market

Ok, let that sink in. Why lend to the US GOVT when you can lend to the FED directly? As I've remarked previously - if you are a Money Market manager, you basically have a fiduciary obligation to use as much RRP as you can.

(repost of a previous tweet back in Jun28th about the new facility)- Given the option of a riskless 5bps from the Fed itself, why would a MMF ever choose to take counterparty risk in the repo market? This dynamic will only be reflexively exacerbated as perceived counterparty risk increases - precisely when that liquidity is most needed

Indeed - this is precisely what money market funds have done. While total funds held by MMFs have remained flat, usage of the RRP has increased by over $1tr, and selling off $1tr of short-term collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

[From His Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/lfxome46zb681.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbeda7b2426a5c743f64147d1df0a268b18518e)

Increased usage of the RRP nets increased incremental short-term collateral into the market. More supply means short-term yields go up. Here's the 2yr UST yield with two dates marked: - June 16 - Fed increased RRP rate to 0.05% - Sept 22 - Fed doubled the counterparty limit to $160bn

&amp;#x200B;

[From Thread](https://preview.redd.it/cu6znacazb681.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6132e28e4ded1c8b3e25aef3806e0ea0d32d2561)

Here's the 3mo / 1yr / 2yr / 3yr UST yields with those same dates marked. 3mo bills have remained pinned to 0.05%. So either (i) MMFs are selling their longest duration assets or (ii) the new availability of T-bills allows other players to ""slide down"" the duration curve

&amp;#x200B;

[Thread](https://preview.redd.it/7cs3ezgczb681.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3331894cb32511fcf78891af72209958c77fc1)

Beyond increasing collateral supply, increased RRP usage also impacts the liquidity of those short-term treasury markets, as the largest liquidity providers in them (MMFs) are choosing to transact with the FED. Increased supply + reduced liquidity = yikes.  
But then how do we explain the strength in the long end (10y - 30y) over this period? First, the buyers for short and long duration assets are probably more distinct than we imagine in theory. Second (more interestingly) is a duration mismatch between QE and the RRP.

The FED chooses which collateral to purchase in QE - long and short duration assets. But as explained here, no matter what collateral the Fed ""gives back"" in the RRP market, the impact is always to release only short-term collateral that the RRP substitutes.

Net net - this means long duration is being removed via QE as RRP is adding short duration supply - intentionally or otherwise, the unintended consequences of the FED has twisted the yield curve while also reducing liquidity in critical short term debt markets.

To me, this represents an intriguing counterargument to the consensus that short-term rates are rising because inflation/rate hikes, and long-term rates falling because ""growth concerns"" and demonstrates how intervention can drive markets in unforeseen ways.

This semester I decided to take two courses for my mental health.

For these two courses, I have been doing the  Homeworks and getting 80s - 100s, and have been attending classes. For group projects, I have been doing my part of the work and learning as best as I can.

But in one of these courses, a Finance class, I have been FLUNKING the exams. Midterm 1 = 47% curved it was a 69%, Midterm 2 = 59%, no curve. 

I used some online course grade calculators and found out I need an 80% in order to pass with a C, which will not damage my GPA too much. But as I study I can't help but feel that 80 is getting farther and farther away. At this point, I can't help but feel like I'll fuck up this semester and it will damage my GPA badly. 

Can anyone tell me if they have been in a situation similar to this and what they did to improve?"

Cookie-cutter houses, manicured lawns, silver minivans adorned with “my child is an honor student” bumper stickers. We’ve all visited a town like it. Maybe you’ve lived in a similar town. Maybe you live in one right now. Out of respect for the victims, I won’t say the name of my wife’s hometown. (\_\_\_\_\_\_\_town should suffice.) But just know, it was a slice of all-American middle-class comfort pie, a place where bad things simply did not happen.

I never intended to live in such a town but ended up in one anyway. At the time, I was in my late twenties. I had wanted to move to Los Angeles to take one last shot at my childhood dream, a career in screenwriting, but my wife, Melanie, whom I had married young, wanted to stay put on the east coast to be near her parents. After much deliberation, we agreed that we would move to Los Angeles on the condition that, first, we stay with her parents for nine months, so she could spend quality time with them before heading out west. 

“And think of all the money we’ll save not paying rent,” she had said. “You won’t even have to work full time. You can just focus on writing.”

At the end of our lease, we put our furniture in storage, said goodbye to the trendy Brooklyn neighborhood we had called home for the past seven years, and headed to the suburbs. The adjustment, at first, was surprisingly smooth. With access to a big backyard, a dog to play with, and a car for running errands, I found myself wondering why I had ever put myself through un-air-conditioned subways and high-rent shoebox apartments. But after a few weeks, the rosy newness wore off and was replaced by a vacant malaise. The problem was, there was nothing to do in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town. No-thing. I longed for Greenwich village arthouse movie theaters, Chelsea galleries, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. I even missed sweating on the subway. At least subway sweat was interesting. 

My boredom was at its worst in the afternoon. With the move, I had gotten a part-time as a video editor at the local news station. I worked the night shift, which paid well, but meant that I hardly spent any waking hours with Melanie—or anyone else, for that matter. I thought that the solitude would be a fruitful source of writing inspiration, a way to get a head start on a feature script or a T.V. pilot before we went to LA. But it was not to be. Melanie’s mom ran a daycare in their home, meaning that between 3 and 5 pm, my prime writing hours, there were ten to fourteen children screaming at the top of their lungs, desecrating my brain space. I suppose I could have gone to a coffee shop or a library to work, but if you give a writer an excuse not to write, he will take it every time. 

And so the walks began. Each weekday, after sleeping through the morning and into the early afternoon, I would lace up my Chuck Taylors and venture out into the quiet streets of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town. I had nowhere specific to go, and the route I took each day varied. Rain or shine I explored my new neighborhood, memorizing street names, taking note of new additions being added to houses. I justified the long walks by telling myself they were productive, a time to gather my thoughts and outline screenplays in my head. But they never were. Most days, I would just listen to old jazz music, fake-smile at the dog-walking neighbors, and count the days until I could get the hell out of the suburbs. 

One rainy afternoon I stumbled upon an off-road path. The path ran under a set of towering power lines and seemed to carry on endlessly. I stopped and stared, intrigued by the path’s enigmatic grandeur. It felt both out of place and right at home, like pimples on a teenager. I looked for signage telling me I wasn’t allowed on the path, but it was unmarked, which I took as an open invitation to explore. Anyway, I told myself, I could always leave if anyone gave me a hard time. In a move that would haunt me for years to come, I stepped off the pavement onto the gravel. The rocks made a dreamy, satisfying *crunch* beneath my feet, an audible signifier that I had crossed over. I started walking, letting the power lines guide me, unsure of where they would lead.

Five steps onto the path, it was if I had left \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town. The sides of the path were damp and muddy. Overgrown weeds stretched up through cracks in the gravel and tickled my exposed knees. The smell of sewage permeated the air, wafting up, as if from the earth itself. Mosquitos nibbled at my ankles. Rodents scurried around and burrowed into the ground, probably to get away from me. 

But despite its wretched ugliness, I found the path to be quite…lovely. Having lived in the city for so long, there was an element of grimy danger to which I had grown accustomed and, quite frankly, missed. The path filled that void. On the path, I was vulnerable, alert, alive. But mostly, I was alone. Yes, there were signs of life on the path: A few torn blankets, some newspapers, a collection of empty Icebreakers gum containers—the big ones that held 100 pieces; there were the remnants of late-night teenage escapades: empty beer bottles, used condoms, graffiti manifestos painted on the back of vinyl fences (Ⓐ*narchy, Suzi Vance Sux Cok, Fuk Da Police*)*,* but I didn’t get the feeling anybody went there during the day. During the day, it was mine. My mud, my overgrown weeds, my sewage smell. The path was freedom. It was liberation. It was an ounce of control in a life that, every day, felt more and more like it belonged to somebody else.

I didn’t walk too far down the path that first day. I wanted to leave some mystery for the next trip. The second day I went a little farther, and even farther than that the third and fourth days. After a week, I walked so far that I came home late for dinner.

“Where’d you walk today?” Melanie said.

“Around,” I said. 

“Around where?” 

“You know, the neighborhood. Nothing crazy.” 

One of the most curious features of the path was how it cut straight through \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town, like an artery. Houses ran parallel to the path, their backyards separated only by a row of fencing. Most of the fences were tall, white, and opaque, but the ones that were short or otherwise see-through offered a rare glimpse into suburban life: untended sprinklers, bee-infested wooden sheds, neglected swing sets. Sometimes I’d see a housewife through the window, sipping her afternoon wine. Or I’d catch a T.V. playing Fox news to a sad, empty room. I found it fascinating how some houses, which looked so pristine from the front, appeared to be in total disrepair from the back. For every new paint job, there were ten peeling shingles, two cases of stained siding, and a green scummy pool filled with tadpoles. It was as if the residents started re-finishing their houses but ran out of money after the contractors finished the facade. I suppose the owners of the houses figured nobody would ever see the back, because who in their right mind would be walking down this disgusting path and think to look in? 

I would often catch myself thinking about the power lines themselves, how they blended in like set dressing despite their vast importance in our everyday lives. Power lines fuel our internet, our televisions, our home security systems. And yet, we don’t give them a second thought until those comforts are compromised. We don’t protect them or cherish them. In most cases, we relegate them to an out-of-the-way spot where we can pretend they don’t exist. A spot where anybody with a mind for trouble could tamper with them.

The day I saw him started like any other. I got home from work at 4 am, slept until 1:30 pm, ate a little snack, thought about doing some writing—didn’t do any writing—then set out for my walk. I had been visiting the path for a month at that point, and summer had begun to turn to fall. Though the path itself was treeless, the people who lived adjacent to it would rake their leaves and throw them over the fence so as to avoid having to bag them. The colorful foliage made my path oh-so-enchanting and helped mask the smell of the sewage. Donning my denim jacket, I strolled the foggy multicolored wonderland, enmeshed in a childlike sense of belonging. I began to give serious consideration to whether or not I might be better off just staying in the suburbs. Staying with my path. 

But that all changed when I saw a man in the distance. He was dressed in black from head to toe, walking toward me down the path. He had a crooked limp in his left leg, and his shoulder dipped with each step. I felt an immediate sense of dread when I saw him, the kind of lurching repulsion you get you see a rat scurry across the street and know on an animal level you should avoid it. My first instinct was to turn around and try to get off the path before he caught up. But he had spotted me already, and to turn away would be a sign of fear.

As I drew closer to the mystery man, I realized that he was not wearing black but rather varying militaristic shades of dark green, as if to camouflage himself. His hair was curly and greying on the sides. He was bald on top. The sewage smell flared up as we approached each other and continued to grow stronger with each step. He had holes in the knees of his pants, holes on the elbows of his jacket, holes in the toes of his shoes. He kept his hands in his pockets, but if he was wearing gloves, I’m sure they would have had holes in them, too. 

And then I saw his face. 

His face. It was not ugly per-se, but there was something…*off* about it. Something hard to place. There was the dirt—a layer of sweaty grime that coated his forehead and cheeks and made him look splotchy. But that wasn’t it. I had seen plenty of dirty individuals in the city—homeless people, construction workers—some far filthier than the mystery man, but none of them had ever possessed such an uncanny quality. No, it wasn’t the dirt, nor was it his uneven, bushy eyebrows or his crooked, once-broken nose. No, that wasn’t it. 

As we moved within talking distance, my heart raced and my fingers went numb. A prickly tingle rushed down my back, like spiders crawling all over my skin. How many times had I walked home alone late at night, crossed under deserted bridges, shared a vacant side street with a stranger? But still, never before had I felt as uncomfortable, as concerned for my safety and well-being, as I did with this man. I wasn’t sure if I should make eye contact or pretend he wasn’t there. As we crossed paths, I instinctually glanced at him, only to discover that he was looking back at me. Eye contact it was.

As a self-defense mechanism, I gave him a nod, an acknowledgment that I could see him and knew his face enough to pick it out of a police lineup. With my nod, the corners of his dry, cracked lips spread into a wide smile. And it was then that I realized what gave his appearance that uncanny quality: 

His teeth. 

Paired with the dirt and grime and torn clothing was a set of spectacularly white teeth. Movie star white. White like the intense ring of light around a solar eclipse. These Cadillac-white teeth were out of place on such a disheveled man, as if they’d been stolen from another mouth and implanted in his via black market bathtub surgery. They were a bit large, too, like they didn’t quite fit.  

And while he smiled at me with those porcelain pellets, and I stared back, I heard a small sound that cut through that of the dead leaves and gravel crunching below the man’s water-stained boots. It was a kind of rhythmic sucking *pop* that, with the motion of his jaw, I recognized as gum chewing. 

*Pop, pop, pop.* 

He looked me in the eye for a moment longer—though it seemed like he was looking through me, not at me—popped his gum a few more times, and walked on. 

I kept walking too, picking up my pace and trying not to make it obvious that I was peaking back over my shoulder. When I did catch a glimpse of the man, he was about a hundred feet away and showed no signs of slowing. With my second glance, he faded into the horizon. 

Alone again on the path and once again feeling safe, I let out a loud, relieved laugh. How paranoid I had been to suspect that man, how judgmental. Yes, he was dirty, and his teeth were a bit odd, but all he was doing was taking a walk, same as me. And since when was that a crime? He was probably just as afraid of me as I was of him. And there *I* was standing around, laughing to myself like a lunatic. I wiped a silly tear of relief from my eye. This is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town, I reminded myself. Nothing bad ever happens in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town.

Weeks passed and I continued my walks down the path, switching out my denim jacket for a winter coat and my favorite orange beanie. I didn’t see the man again, but a few new gum containers, which I figured probably belonged to him, did appear during that time.

I spent Thanksgiving and Chanukah down in Florida with my parents. The warm weather and pastel scenery was a welcome change from the dreary northeastern cold. But after three days of my Mom telling me about her friend’s son who worked in finance and how he might be able to connect me to a higher paying job, I found myself missing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town. As soon as I got back, I took a nice long stroll. 

Melanie took three weeks off around the holidays, one last hurrah where the family could all be together uninterrupted by work. This vacation put her at home during the daytime when I would normally go walking. While I was thrilled to finally spend some time with her, I couldn’t help but feel each day was incomplete without my walk of solitude. There were a few afternoons when I was able to convince her to go on walks with me, but Melanie was quick to complain about the cold, and we ended cutting the walks short.

“Why don’t we just go home and have hot chocolate instead?” Melanie would say. 

Because Melanie’s family is Puerto Rican, we celebrated Christmas on the night of the 24th. It was a cozy evening filled with laughter and good food*.* We all wore pajamas and opened presents at midnight. Melanie’s parents bought me a new pair of boots. “We know how much you like to walk,” Melanie’s father said as I tried them on.

Since we had celebrated the night before, the plan for Christmas Day was to go out to a movie and eat Chinese food. Having grown up in a Jewish household, this made me feel right at home. Melanie’s family even let me pick the movie. We woke up late, cleaned up any leftover mess from the night before, and had a leisurely breakfast. The weather was warm for Christmas Day, hovering in the low 40’s. An intermittent drizzle fell throughout the morning and coated the landscape in gray. Had we not purchased our movie tickets in advance, the weather may have been enough to keep us home.

As we navigated the neighborhood in Melanie’s parent’s minivan, a blue light, obscured by rain and fog, appeared in the distance.

“What’s that?” I said. 

“What’s what?” Melanie said, craning her neck. She squinted. “Looks like a police car. Maybe it’s the Santa thing.”

“Santa thing?” Melanie’s dad said. 

“It’s the—you’ve seen it, Dad. Every year. The thing where the police drive the guy in the Santa costume. And he hands out the candy canes.”

“Isn’t that the fire department?” I said. 

Melanie shrugged. 

We pulled up and the scene came into view. The light was not coming from a single police car but many. They were parked in a line down the street. I counted eight in total, all of the SUV variety. A brigade. At the end of the line of cars were two ambulances.

The car in front of us slowed down, presumably out of curiosity, which gave us a chance to take a look as well. Halfway up the block, there was a house surrounded by yellow police tape. A few police officers stood on the lawn, trekking across the wet grass and pulling up mud with their boots. One of the officers had a clipboard in his hands and was taking notes, while another pointed at the grass and spoke. Having watched so many movies, the demeanor of the police officers surprised me. I was used to fast-talking cops with sharp haircuts who had all the right moves. But these cops were the opposite of that. They looked uncomfortable, timid, unsure of their actions. One in a particular, a young cop, younger than me, probably no older than 25, looked pale, green, and a little nauseous. His cheeks were puffy and damp as if he’d been crying. He stood with his hands in his pockets and rocked gently back and forth on his heels, keeping his red eyes trained on the ground. 

When the front door opened, the car in front of us stepped on the breaks to watch. We were on a narrow, one-lane road, so we had to stop as well. Two paramedics emerged from the door, wheeling out a body draped in white cloth. After a few feet, the wheel of the gurney got stuck in a deep groove on the sidewalk. The paramedics counted to three in unison, then lifted the gurney to get it moving again.

The cloth-wrapped body looked little, half-sized. Feeling guilty about gawking, I turned my head away from the scene and caught a glimpse of the across-the-street neighbors. They were out on their front porch, reclining in lawn chairs watching the drama unfold. They had Santa hats on their heads, beers in their hands, and looks of giddy fascination on their faces. Whatever unfortunate event was taking place had turned into a spectator sport. 

The front door of the house burst open again. This time, rather than medical or police professionals, a lone woman stumbled out. She looked to be in her mid to late thirties. Her curly brown hair was a mess, and one sleeve of her salmon-colored nightgown was slipping down to reveal a freckled shoulder. She had clearly been crying. 

The woman took a few dizzy steps, then started running after the paramedics, her bare feet slapping against the paved walk-up. As the paramedics loaded the body into an ambulance, the woman tripped over her feet and dropped to her knees on the wet lawn. 

“No, no, don’t take him,” she cried, throwing her arms out and bending at the waist as if in prayer. 

The paramedics shut the doors of the ambulance, and the woman, too distraught for words and now choking on her own spit, began letting out a throaty, animalistic keening. Even though the car window was closed, I could hear how violent the sound was, how much it was shredding her vocal cords. 

The paramedics drove away and the woman went limp, flopping down in the grass and lying face down. A sad-looking man with hunched shoulders and an unstylish mustache came out of the house and peeled the woman off the ground. The front of her gown was soaked through and stuck to her breasts and abdomen as they rose and fell with each desperate breath.

I was called into work that night. It was Christmas, but if you work *for* the news, you work *when* there’s news. It was my assignment to cut together the segment about the house with the weeping woman, making me both the editor and a primary source. There, working late into the night in the closet-turned-editing room, I learned what had really happened.

The story revolved around a married couple who, in the continued pursuit of anonymity, I will refer at Jeff and Stephanie Sarkoob. Like Melanie and me, Jeff and Stephanie had spent their twenties in the city. He worked as an analyst for a mid-sized investment company, and she worked as a secretary for a since-dissolved PR firm. They met at a bar on the lower east side and fell in love instantly. After dating for a couple of years, they tied the knot with a modest but charming wedding in Cape Cod. They moved to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town shortly thereafter. Eleven months after the move, they welcomed their first and only child, Ethan, into the world. In the almost decade since Ethan’s birth, Jeff and Stephanie had slid comfortably into the little league-coaching, crustless sandwich-making life of suburban parents. 

Ethan, a chipper if not slightly hyperactive nine-year-old, was a Christmas fanatic. Among his favorite holiday pastimes were decorating the tree, going to see the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall, and making hand-drawn cards for his parents. But his favorite tradition, without fail, was sleeping downstairs on the couch on Christmas Eve in the hopes of meeting Santa Claus. Each year, he would stay up as late as he could, only to awake the next morning and find that he had just missed the big man in red. Nevertheless, he always tried. 

The year that I discovered Ethan, he had staved off sleep until 12:15—a new record—before he finally succumbed to exhaustion, shut his little eyes, and dozed off. Once Ethan was asleep, Jeff and Stephanie tiptoed into the living room and slid “Santa’s” presents under the tree. Jeff took a few bites of the carrots Ethan had left for Rudolf, and Stephanie nibbled the cookies and sipped the milk. They went upstairs, got in bed, and fell asleep to an episode of Criminal Minds. 

When they awoke at 11:00 am the next morning having gotten their best and most complete night of sleep in ten years, Jeff and Stephanie knew something was wrong. Normally, on Christmas morning, Ethan would have woken them at the crack of dawn, buzzing with excitement over Santa’s visit. But they hadn’t heard a peep from him. They got out of bed and walked down the stairs, both secretly praying that they would find Ethan sitting criss-cross applesauce next to the Christmas tree, surrounded by wrapping paper, playing with one of his new presents. 

But upon entering the living room, Jeff and Stephanie discovered a bizarre scene. Gone were the cookies, the milk, the carrots; gone were the stockings, the ornaments, the presents they had left under the tree. And, most noticeably, gone was their son. 

The only Christmas-related items left in the room were the naked balsam fir tree and, beneath the tree, a single, unfamiliar gift-wrapped box—a box which neither Jeff nor Stephanie had placed there. 

Nobody knows how they reacted, not even Jeff or Stephanie, who were so rattled by what came next that they explained it to the police three times, differently with each telling. But since I’ve now had some time to think it over, I’ve taken the liberty to imagine how the events of that morning might have transpired.

Picture, if you will, Jeff and Stephanie standing dumbfounded at the base of the stairs, each waiting for the other to take initiative and make a move. Stephanie places an open hand on her chest. Jeff curls his big toe inside of his fraying cotton slippers. Finally, unable to bear the silence, Stephanie mumbles, “Should we should…open it?”

“Yeah,” Jeff says, his voice cracking.

Jeff takes a step forward toward the tree, his mustache fluttering with each nervous breath. He reaches the tree and wraps his plump fingers around the edge of the box. He picks it up, surprised by its heft. Giving the box a timid shake, Jeff turns and looks back at Stephanie, whose fingers have moved from her chest to her mouth as she gnaws off her candy cane-patterned nail polish. She gives Jeff a nod, as if to say, continue. Jeff unties the bow and peals off the wrapping paper with neat and unnecessary precision. He folds the discarded wrapping paper into a small square and places it down next to the box.

Jeff opens the lid. For a moment he smiles, relieved at the sight of his son staring back up at him. *Oh, there’s Ethan,* he thinks to himself. *We had nothing to worry about.* But his smile fades as Jeff realizes that there is nothing but air in the space between the ground and the box in his hands. 

“What is it?” Stephanie says. 

Jeff doesn’t answer. 

“Babe, what’s…Jeff, say something!” 

Jeff turns to Stephanie. 

“It’s…” Jeff starts. Unable to finish his sentence, Jeff reaches into the box and grabs Ethan, pulling him out by the hair. 

Stephanie gasps in a few breaths and forces out a shriek. She collapses to the ground.

Jeff, startled by Stephanie’s reaction, drops Ethan’s small head. It rolls a couple of feet, smudging semi-dry blood across their Tuscan yellow Ikea carpet. Jeff vomits and Stephanie screams again. And she keeps screaming, without pause, until a few hours later when I see her through the window of Melanie’s family’s minivan. 

At around 4:00 am, my boss popped his head into the editing room. He was wearing a Santa hat and strap-on beard. His eyes were bloodshot and tired.

“You can go home if you want,” he slurs. “I know this was supposed to be a day off for you.” 

I said, “I don’t mind. I’m almost done anyway.” 

“Alright,” he said. “Well, there’s some more egg nog in the”— he burped and patted his chest —“in the break room. You want me to get you some?”

“Sure,” I said.

“Copy.”  

He walked out of the room, and I looked back to the screen. Alone again, I began second-guessing my decision to stay. I had just reached the part of the story where the reporter was talking about the police finding the rest of Ethan’s body in the fireplace, and I couldn’t help but wonder if so much negativity was bad for my mental health.

My boss returned a minute later and handed me a cup of eggnog. I thanked him, took a swig, and got back to work. 

After another hour of editing, I finished the segment. I was about to hit the export button but decided that this piece, this subject matter, deserved one last watch-through for mistakes. I hit the spacebar and the video began. It played as expected: shots of police lights bouncing off of freshly painted siding, our local reporter on the scene, interviews with the neighbors, beers in hand. I hate to say it, but it was some of my finest editing work. I couldn’t help but admire how compelling the story was, how much it drew me in, made me want to invest my time and energy. 

Near the end of the video, I noticed that I had forgotten to include a Ken Burns effect on a photo of the Sarkoob house. I paused on the image and had just begun rendering the effect when a small black line in the upper right-hand corner of the frame caught my eye. At first, I thought it might have been some dirt or maybe a crack in the screen. I reached out and tried to scrape it off with my fingernail, but the surface was smooth and unblemished. I zoomed in on the black line and it grew larger. Up close, I could see that it was three-dimensional, rounded out, receiving light from the same source as the rest of the house. It was part of the image. I stared at the pixels, trying to make sense of this strange, charcoal sky spaghetti. 

And then I recognized it. The angle, the placement, the gentle curve. It was a power line, running parallel to the Sarkoob house, lurking, just barely in the distance. I hit the export button and waited in silence. The moment the video finished I grabbed my coat, put on my orange beanie, and headed for the exit. On the way out the door, I heard my boss say, “Merry Christmas.” 

I rode my bike at a rapturous pace from the studio to town. The freezing winter air bit my face. Watery, clear mucus ran from my nose to my upper lip and filled my tongue with the taste of salt. The roads, lit by the subtle green and red glow of Christmas lights, were eerie and desolate. I had a tight feeling in my stomach, a crocheting of my innards that reminded me I was riding into trouble. 

I cruised past Melanie’s house. The light was off in her window, our window. I worried that the loud clicking of my poorly lubricated bike chain might wake the family dog. But I made it past the house without a single bark. Onward. 

I rode my normal walking route, which seemed shorter and less interesting on a bike. The sun had just begun to rise when I arrived at the power line path, though it hadn’t yet reached the horizon, leaving the landscape stark and blue. The leafless trees hung over the scene, ominous and dark. 

The gravel on the path was too loose and rough to ride over, so I climbed off my bike and hid it behind a wild pine bush. Then, with my body shaking from a combination of cold and nerves, I set off down the path on foot, one last time. 

I observed the familiar details and noted how they had changed in my two-week absence. The frozen ground, the mud, the erratic arrays of garbage and abandoned clothing. The differences were slight but felt. I looked at the houses. Plumes of smoke drifted out of a few chimneys. Some houses appeared more run-down than they had just a couple of weeks before, a reminder that our protection from the elements is a thin and flimsy comfort. I thought about the people inside the houses who hadn’t yet heard the news. How, in just a short time, a TV report would dismantle their sense of safety and comfort forever. 

I walked down the path, looking for that vague *something,* a hint, a clue, an indication that I wasn’t wasting my time. And then I found it. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a flash of an unnatural yellow color next to one of the houses. It took a moment, but I recognized it as police tape, a dead giveaway that I was looking at the house that belonged to Jeff and Stephanie Sarkoob. There it was, standing cold and empty, tragic in its plainness. Had it not been for the police tape, I never would have noticed it. An old, cracked kiddie pool in the backyard, an expensive swing set that didn’t look like it got much use. It could have been any house in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town. Except it wasn’t any house. It was a house of horror, a new Amityville, a place where future generations of teenagers would go on Halloween to test how brave they were, then laugh about it later. 

The house was separated from the path only by a low chainlink fence. The blinds were open and the lights were on, giving me a clear view into the living room. I could see a few framed photos, the Christmas tree, the couch where Ethan would have slept. The life of the Sarkoobs was there on display, available for me, or anybody else, who had ever stood in this spot on the path and felt compelled to look. 

A chill ran through my body, and I took a step backward. Something hard crunched under my foot and made me jump. I looked down. It was just one of those empty Icebreakers gum containers. I went to kick it out of the way but stopped before my foot made contact. I had broken the container when I stepped on it, and now a lightning bolt-shaped crack ran from the lid to the base. And through that crack, I could see the faint outline of something round and oblong inside. It was pale in color and about the size and shape of a battery, too big to be a piece of gum. I picked up the container and gave it a little shake. The mystery object made a soft, dull thudding sound as it knocked against the inner plastic walls. 

I slid my finger under the lid and flicked it open. The first thing I saw was the nail, chipped like driftwood, and yellowing at the edges. The skin was pale and purplish and loose around the knuckle. The bone stuck out at the bottom where a small amount of blood was smeared against the plastic. 

I let the container fall from my hand, then dropped to my knees and dry-heaved. The taste of eggnog was faintly present on the base of my tongue. I grabbed a handful of gravel and held it tight, bracing for violence. When the nauseous feeling passed, I tilted my head up and stared at the rest of the gum containers scattered across the ground. I didn’t want to look, but I had to know. I grabbed another one and flipped it open, and like the first, there was a finger, a thumb this time. Frantically, I opened the rest. I counted as I went: three, four, five, six. I had just finished counting the final container—number eleven—when I heard the faint sound of a leaf crunching underfoot behind me. 

I froze like a possum, foolishly playing dead in broad daylight with my back turned to my would-be attacker. There was total silence for a moment. Then…

*Pop, pop, pop.* 

It was a sound I had heard just once before but that had ingrained itself into my DNA like a fear of spiders or snakes. *Pop, pop, pop*, he went again, chewing on his gum. I turned my head slowly, looking back over my shoulder, just far enough to catch a glimpse of his gleaming white teeth. 

And then I took off. I ran with the fear of God, or worse, pushing me forward. I ran like I hadn’t since high school gym class, sprinting, my legs getting ahead of my body, arms flailing to maintain balance. My beanie flew off, but I kept going, not even thinking to look back. Finally, after what felt like thirty miles, I hit the main road. It was the end of the path, where the power lines split off to carry electricity to the next town over. Wheezing from the cold air that punished my lungs, I bent at the waist and looked back behind me. There was no sign of the man with the pristine smile. Only the path, darting straight into the distance, disappearing into the single vanishing point that was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town. 

It took me an hour to get back to Melanie’s house. The path, it turned out, was the only direct route from where I was to her neighborhood, so I had to walk down the main road and loop all the way around town. 

By the time I got home, the house smelled like *quesito* and coffee, a sign that Melanie and her parents were awake. Melanie was sitting at the kitchen counter reading a book. Her mom was cooking behind her. 

“Are you just getting home from work now?” Melanie said, flipping a page. She looked up over the edge of her book, and I could tell from the change in her expression that I must have looked terrible. 

“I—” I started, but then lost the breath in my chest.  

“Hun,” she said and stood up. She looked down at my wet, mud-coated boots, the same boots her parents had gifted me less than forty-eight hours prior. “Hun, are you ok?” 

My knees buckled and I lowered myself to the ground. By the time Melanie reached me, the tears had already started. 

“What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” she kept asking. But I was crying too hard to answer. Her mom got me a glass of water, and after twenty minutes I was able to talk. I told Melanie the whole story: the walks, the path, the man with the white teeth. When I finished, Melanie sat there in silence.

“Why didn’t you talk to me about any of this?” she said after an eternity.  

I shook my head and I looked down at the ground. “I don’t know,” I said.

Melanie took a deep breath and bit her lip. She looked up at the ceiling, her eyes glistening in the overhead lighting. “I think you should call the police,” she said.

The police sent a team to the path to look for evidence. They brought in UV lights, DNA experts, and dogs trained on Ethan’s scent. They sent a helicopter to do a flyover on the entire area. But they found nothing. The scene, it seemed, had been wiped clean. They brought me into the station a few days later for official questioning, but I was cleared right away, my alibi confirmed by Melanie and her family. 

As news of my findings spread (somebody from the police leaked it), outrage grew among the public that the police had failed to sweep the scene properly. “How could they have missed it?” was the question everybody kept asking. “How come they didn’t take a closer look at that path?” But to me, the answer was simple: They missed the path because they didn’t think to look. To the people of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town, police included, the path was an ugly blemish, an unsightly, oozing wound that was easier to ignore to the point of infection than confront. To them, the path did not exist. And why would they look at something that wasn’t there?

Time passed uneventfully after that. A slew of “For Sale” signs popped up in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town in the weeks and months following the murder, but there were no additional incidents. Personally, I felt fortunate to have come out of the whole thing unscathed. Yes, there were the recurring night terrors about my teeth falling out, and I would sometimes have trouble breathing when passing by packets of gum for sale at the supermarket. But that mostly went away with time. 

After our nine months in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town were up, Melanie and I packed our life into a U-haul, drove across the country, and moved into an apartment in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. She spent her days working remotely from home, and I spent mine trying to write screenplays at Intelligentsia coffee shop on Sunset Boulevard. After a full year, I was able to piece together a presentable script—a hard-boiled serial killer mystery, nothing groundbreaking. I sent query letters to agents and managers all over town and heard back from only two, both of whom informed me that, for legal reasons, they weren’t allowed to accept unsolicited material. I started going for long drives during the day, wasting large amounts of money on gas to see how far I could get into the desert and still make it home in time for dinner. Sometimes I imagined myself driving into death valley until the sun melted the car and I became one with the sand. 

One evening, after driving all the way to Primm, Nevada and back, I found Melanie sitting at the kitchen table, her eyes wet, tears drizzling down her cheeks. 

“What’s going on?” I said. 

She looked up at me and said the thing that had been on both of our minds for the past few months: “I don’t like it here, and I want to go home.” 

We ran out our lease, packed a u-haul, and went back to her family’s house in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_town, completing our extended cross country trip. I returned to my job at the news station. It was like we had never left and nothing had changed. 

One day, on a whim, I decided to go for a walk. I perused the neighborhood, letting my feet guide me. It was winter again, and the Christmas decorations were out in full force. After a series of random turns and curves, I found myself facing a familiar street—a street that led to a familiar path. Fear ran through me like an acid flashback. But still, I was drawn to it. I took a step forward and walked toward the path. 

When I arrived at the entrance, I was both relieved and disappointed to find that the town had put up a metal gate blocking off the path. The gate featured two steel locks and three *No Trespassing* signs. So that’s that, I thought. I turned to walk away but stopped as an image popped into my mind: wheels, spokes, handlebars, an under-lubricated chain.

I figured that the bike wouldn’t still be there, but it was worth checking. I walked around the pine bush, and sure enough, there it was, dirty and rusted, but still in good enough condition that I might be able to sell some parts and recoup a bit of the money I had blown on the move. I dug the deflated wheels out of the grooves in the ground into which they had sunk. As I pulled the bike away from the bush, a piece of orange fabric fell off of one of the handlebars. I bent down to pick it up and froze when I realized what it was. 

My beanie, which I had not seen since it had fallen off my head, was as bright and orange as the day I bought it. I pinched the fabric between my fingers. It was soft and clean and smelled of laundry detergent, not at all the condition in which one would expect to find a piece of clothing that had spent almost two years outside in the northeast. I turned my head and let the bike fall to the ground. The frozen bell clanked as it impacted an above-ground root. The wind blew, and my body shook. I was suddenly cold—colder than hail, colder than night, colder than vast and empty space. My teeth chattered and knocked against the inside of my skull. Hands shaking, I pulled the beanie onto my head and crossed my arms for warmth. And there I stood, freezing and alone, looking over my shoulder in a town where bad things simply didn’t happen."

 Ardana is a stablecoin ecosystem, consisting of a liquidity pool, a DEX (decentralized exchange), and asset-backed stablecoins, built on the Cardano blockchain. The project looks to develop a DeFi ecosystem that can deliver on the promise to give everyone access to DeFi. Cardano’s mainnet saw significant growth recently, with several new projects already launched or in the process of being onboarded on its blockchain.

The team behind Ardana is helping Cardano better prepare its ecosystem and infrastructure to handle free-flowing capital and allow it to easily attract cash flow, continuing towards its goal of a robust and open DeFi ecosystem. After years of development, Cardano has become one of the leading blockchain projects and largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Its focus was centered around real-world applications, but it has since widened this area of focus to include DeFi.

Before we can understand why Ardana has chosen Cardano as its blockchain of choice, let us gain a better understanding of both projects.

### An Introduction to Ardana

Ardana is an asset-backed stablecoin protocol and DEX built on the Cardano blockchain. It offers access to on-chain Cardano-native assets coupled with seamless transactions and swaps between them. The Ardana ecosystem consists of two main products: its stablecoins (comparable to MakerDAO) and Danaswap, a DEX that operates similarly to Curve Finance.

Danaswap enables seamless, high-speed swaps between stablecoins and other assets through multi-asset liquidity pools, in addition to reward-based mechanisms to enable DeFi at its fullest.

### What is Cardano?

Cardano is an open-source, decentralized blockchain project that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions. It uses a layered architecture, facilitates smart contracts, and offers better scalability than competitors, like Ethereum. The platform’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, can be leveraged by users on Cardano to conduct transactions and validate on its Proof of Stake (PoS) network.

The Cardano blockchain is made up of third-generation technology that significantly improves the underlying problems (i.e. scalability, energy consumption) faced by first and second-generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Cardano has all its protocols peer-reviewed, allowing it to easily and quickly tackle any potential issues. On top of this, the project is backed by several organizations, working in tandem with them to develop the platform. The main organizations working on the Cardano blockchain are Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation.

### Why Did Ardana Choose to Build on Cardano?

Since its founding, Cardano has grown in leaps and bounds, becoming one of the leading blockchain projects globally. This rapid growth is easy to see in comparison to its competition, as ADA is currently the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The success of Carcano is easily traced back to its Founder, Ethereum Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson, who identified the need for a scalable blockchain and smart contract solution. Hoskinson teamed up with Jeremy Wood, who shared similar views of the market’s needs.

From that point forward, Cardano was born.

Development began in 2015, with the project focused on building solutions to improve the blockchain. The first public iteration of the project was released in 2017, starting with the Byron phase, followed by Shelly, which introduced staking and better decentralization. The Goguen era saw Cardano add a smart contract ability, enhancing its blockchains’ overall use cases and functionality for dApps (decentralized applications) and protocols.

#### The Technology Behind Cardano

Cardano’s protocols are peer-reviewed before they’re added for use on the platform. The project utilizes two programming languages named Haskell and Plutus. As previously mentioned, rather than using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which consumes a significant amount of electricity to verify transactions, Cardano uses a PoS consensus mechanism. This allows it to utilize significantly less power and fuel a much more sustainable ecosystem.

#### Ouroboros

Cardano’s PoS consensus mechanism is significantly different from that of Bitcoin’s PoW consensus mechanism. BTC requires specialized rigs to solve for the next block, but also lacks any features that could prevent potential monopolies over mining operations.

Ouroboros is Cardano’s PoS mechanism that uses a system of time periods, also known as “epochs.” Each epoch lasts for five days, with each one containing 21,600 smaller units called “slots.” One slot is equal to 20 seconds. Stake pools are assigned randomly to each slot, and slot leaders are selected through a lottery system. To ensure fairness, Cardano selects slot leaders using the following method:

* The user must have a 2% stake in Cardano
* The higher the stake, the better the chances of being selected as a slot leader
* If slot leaders fail to create a block during their slot, they are replaced and must wait until re-election

Ouroboros allows ADA holders to stake their coins in pools that other users operate. Alternatively, token holders can also become stake pool operators themselves. Any rewards generated for adding new blocks to the blockchain are shared between the pool operators and stakers at the end of every epoch.

### Cardano: The Best Fit for Ardana

With Cardano well on the way to creating an ecosystem to address the issues of older blockchains, it’s now focused on developing cheaper, quicker, and more scalable solutions for blockchain-based transactions. According to Ardana’s team, this makes Cardano’s ecosystem perfect for the Ardana protocol.

Cardano is set to become a top ecosystem in the DeFi space, blurring the lines between DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance). The team at Ardana set out to create a DeFi hub on Cardano to enable the protocol to experience the same level of growth seen on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon (Matic). To enhance stability, the team at Ardana also introduced a stablecoin and a stable-asset exchange.

Ardana’s team reached out to Cardano to build the infrastructure required for their project. Cardano also required a significant liquidity floor, along with a suitable stablecoin suite; this was achieved by offering lending through Ardana vaults, which enabled minting for its various stablecoins. Ardana’s team also had the vision to bring foreign exchange to the decentralized world, opening this up to more users. They needed to ensure that the price to swap between different currencies was close enough to the actual price for foreign exchange, though. This led to the creation of Danaswap, a stablecoin DEX built on the protocol.

### Closing Thoughts

Ardana’s DeFi ecosystem has the ability to fully unleash Cardano’s potential, allowing it to become one of the most prominent players in the DeFi space. The benefits are mutual, as Ardana’s association with Cardano means it is backed by one of the largest and most trusted blockchain protocols. Ardana’s ecosystem on Cardano will truly take Cardano’s functionality to a whole new level.

Fairyproof’s Brief Analysis of Attack on Bent Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FairyproofTech/comments/rlcel6/fairyproofs_brief_analysis_of_attack_on_bent/,FairyproofTech,1,2021-12-21 19:07:12,0,/r/u_FairyproofTech/comments/rlcel6/fairyproofs_brief_analysis_of_attack_on_bent/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[Bent Finance](https://app.bentfinance.com/), a staking and farming platform to enhance users’ curve returns was exploited twice within ten days.

In these two attacks, the attacker exploited 263,000 cvxCRV tokens in the first attack and 250,000 cvxCRV tokens in the second attack. The value of the totally exploited LP tokens was around 3 million USDs.

The first exploitation happened at 08:38:53 PM on Dec-12-2021 +UTC and the transaction can be checked at:

The attacked contract was the BentBasePool contract deployed at **0x270B6AFF561284ef380cDD6d8B036f4981049A86** on Ethereum. This contract allowed its implementation contract to be upgraded. After a contract upgrade was to happen, an “updateVersion” function would be called to finish the upgrade.

The root cause of this attack is the admin’s private key was compromised.

**The whole process**:

The attacker exploited the admin’s private key to update the application with his/her malicious contract and update the balance of his/her address by calling the malicious contract’s updateVersion function.

Then the attacker updated the implementation contract again with a normal contract and called the updateVersion to finish the upgrade."

It was a little over 100 days ago that Raydium officially fired up its thrusters and blasted off. 🔱,https://www.reddit.com/r/investigator_chain/comments/rn2foj/it_was_a_little_over_100_days_ago_that_raydium/,Abra_777,1,2021-12-24 02:50:07,0,/r/investigator_chain/comments/rn2foj/it_was_a_little_over_100_days_ago_that_raydium/,defi,"&amp;#x200B;

  


  
 Our vision was to drive ecosystem-wide liquidity for Solana by creating an AMM that interacts with Serum’s central limit order book, all while solving key challenges for users like high fees and slow transactions.

  
The first step was to focus on bootstrapping liquidity for key projects and trading pairs. Once this foundation was in place, we mapped a course towards driving liquidity for the influx of new Solana projects and their communities.

  
Now a few months after launch, we take some time to reflect as we orbit into Solana Season.

  
So, Where are We Now?

  
Having everyone aboard for the ride has been amazing. Here’s a look at what we’ve seen along the way:

  


  
On day one, Raydium launched an AMM that radiates liquidity throughout the Solana ecosystem by interacting with the Serum central order book. The Raydium AMM has remained at the core of everything we’ve done since launch.Fusion Pools were launched to allow high-quality projects to offer LP reward emissions and therefore bootstrap their own liquidity. So far 10 pools have been launched with quickly emerging projects, including FIDA, OXY, COPE, MEDIA, and MER with more to come!AcceleRaytor serves as a launchpad for new projects to raise capital and IDO while enabling the community to participate in carefully vetted token offerings. MEDIA and MER were the first two projects launched. If your project is interested in AcceleRaytor, feel free to fill out this form.Permissionless Pools allow any project or user to create an AMM Pool that is tradable on Raydium and Serum. Less than 2 weeks after launch, more than 40 pools have already been created by project teams and the community.Raydium reached $1 Billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) on May 4th. This was a huge liquidity milestone for the entire community and a big statement about how far the Solana ecosystem has come.

  
The first 100 days were about executing to build out all of the moving parts of Raydium, laying a foundation for the community, and the groundwork for what’s ahead.

  
So, What’s Next?

  
The next 100 days will be about supercharging the platform and working closely with partners and community to really crank up the Raydiation. Below are some of the top priorities for the next leg of this voyage:

  


  
Product &amp; Platform

  
Scalability: Raydium has seen a massive influx of users since first launching, and with that came some growing pains. After the platform faced slowdowns during the first AcceleRaytor launch and IDO for MEDIA, we more than 10X-ed the number of dedicated RPC servers for Raydium. We’ve also worked closely with Serum to identify, optimize and resolve a few other issues encountered during high traffic events. As the community grows, Raydium will continue to dedicate significant resources and work alongside Solana and Serum teams to ensure the platform scales in line with the entire ecosystem.UI/UX: In the lead up to Raydium’s launch, the team was heads down and focused on delivering a next-level AMM. Since then, we’ve worked hard to create a user experience that matches the pace of the platform’s development. However we are determined to strongly improve the aesthetics and usability of Raydium and are in the process of a full UI/UX refresh.AcceleRaytor: The two initial AcceleRaytor launches have been incredibly successful in terms of participation, yet we are still striving to optimize the model. With each project comes unique challenges for a launch, which depend on total allocation, project community, tokenomics, and more. As a result, Raydium will continue to adjust and fine-tune the model in order to deliver value for the project and wider ecosystem, while also striving to properly reward the Raydium community.Stable Curve Pools: Stable coins are an important part of any trading platform, however there are currently limited options on Solana for swapping between stables like USDC and USDT. While there are great teams like Mercurial Finance and Stableswap working on this, we think it’s important for Raydium to have a straightforward in-house solution. We’ve been working on a new AMM curve that will enable swapping of stables while also providing liquidity to Serum. This AMM curve will also address an increasing need for the swapping of other assets with highly correlated prices, such as synthetics with underlying assets or equivalent synthetics.Sushiswap Integration: We are also set on bringing Sushiswap to the Raydium menu in the near future. Despite delays due to the crazy pace of development for both teams, integration with Sushi is still in the making. Implementation and cooperation between the teams is ongoing and we are hoping to have more info on this soon.

  
Community

  
Governance: One of our next objectives is allowing increased community participation in the development and direction of Raydium and further decentralizing the protocol. With the number of projects and communities now interacting with Raydium, we’re eager to get everyone more involved. We are currently working with Solana on a flexible on-chain governance platform and the logistics of how to better serve the community through this initiative.Solana Hackathon: The Solana Season Hackathon is going on right now, with Raydium playing a key role. Core Raydium team members are on the judges panel and will be assessing the next wave of Solana projects from among thousands of registered teams. We’re even putting up $40,000 in grant money for the leading projects. You can be sure that we’ll be chatting with the top teams as well, and looking to help kick-start their journeys as part of the Solana ecosystem.

  
We’ll continue to push out additional details on these points as we have them, but we hope this helps give an overview on some of the key things on the agenda. Again, we appreciate everyone’s support since Raydium’s launch, and we’re excited for the next 100 days on the voyage to liquidity and beyond!

Curve Finance No Longer Rewarding WONE,https://www.reddit.com/r/harmony_one/comments/rn4j8f/curve_finance_no_longer_rewarding_wone/,TheRealTrojan,1,2021-12-24 04:27:54,1,/r/harmony_one/comments/rn4j8f/curve_finance_no_longer_rewarding_wone/,Discussion,"Hi guys. 

I was wondering what happened to the WONE rewards on Curve Finance? It was +10 WONE on the pools literally 2 days ago but now there doesn't seem to be any WONE yield or even yield in general really. 

Is this a visual bug or did something happen? I remember reading about how Harmony was incentizing people to use curve by giving out ONE but I didn't think those rewards ended yet."

I would like to mention about some improvements actually an innovation on decentralized finance. Defi ecosystem is growing exponentially and people are moving from TradFi to deFi due to centralization concerns, people would like to control their assets by themselves totally.

The total value locked in DeFi on the ethereum blockchain has soared to nearly $200 billion today from about $20 billion last year.

If we look into the charming kid of cryptocurrency that is Avalanche with no doubt, TVL has reached $12.8b today.

Avalanche is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain designed for running smart contracts, which, in turn, serve as the backbone for deFi protocols and applications.

The Avalanche Foundation incentivizes new projects with funds that will be allocated specifically to projects building in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications among other sectors.

I have been personally into cryptocurrency for years as a trader and after that, I have decided to dig into technological improvements, blockchain infrastructure in my spare time.

There are many innovative projects built on Avalanche blockchain and I dig into the most innovative, unique ones which I believe need attention.

Most of you have heard Automated Market Makers(AMM) which is described as the system providing liquidity to the exchange it operates in through automated trading. AMM's allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers.

There are plenty of them; Uniswap, Curve, Traderjoe, Pangolin... the list is going on.

So what if we combine our trading habits with decentralized exchange? I mean if I make a limit order and another existing order in the order book matches with mine and make it executed.

This is called Central Limit Order book and it is a collection of buy and sell orders of different prices and sizes. It differs from an AMM liquidity pool where there is a single formula ( x \* y = k) that defines any given trades.

The first decentralized exchange on Avalanche with a central limit order book is **Dexalot.** Its mission is to bring a truly inclusive and transparent environment where Dexalot users can trade crypto securely and efficiently with no slippage and no custody risk.

🔥 Embr Finance is a DEX and Yield Farm based on Balancer V2. Our goal is to build DeFi 3.0 on the Avalanche network 🔥

&amp;#x200B;

Embr Finance is a new project from Avaware. We are proud to say that Embr Finance is the first Balancer V2 fork on the chain. Be ready to use next generation AMM protocols on Avalanche!

&amp;#x200B;

**Embr is a one-stop decentralized investment platform on Avalanche.**

&amp;#x200B;

Join us if you want to enjoy +700% APRs, a high quality team, an incredible community, and next generation finance tech.

&amp;#x200B;

✔ **Project Utility and Features:**

&amp;#x200B;

📈 **Weighted Investment Pools**:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

&amp;#x200B;

**💵 Stable Pools**: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

&amp;#x200B;

**↔ Trade**: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

&amp;#x200B;

🚜 **Farm:** Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

💸 **Earn Protocol Fees**: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

&amp;#x200B;

And many more.

We’re on Avalanche and our token EMBR is listed on Pangolin.Exchange

Our goal is to build DeFi 3.0 on the Avalanche network 🔥

Embr Finance is a new project from Avaware. We are proud to say that Embr Finance is the first Balancer V2 fork on the chain. Be ready to use next generation AMM protocols on Avalanche!

**Embr is a one-stop decentralized investment platform on Avalanche.**

Join us if you want to enjoy +700% APRs, a high quality team, an incredible community, and next generation finance tech.

✔ **Project Utility and Features:**

📈 **Weighted Investment Pools**:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

**💵 Stable Pools**: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

**↔ Trade**: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 **Farm:** Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 **Earn Protocol Fees**: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

We’re on Avalanche and our token EMBR is listed on Pangolin.Exchange

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

Join us if you want to enjoy +700% APRs, a high quality team, an incredible community, and next generation finance tech.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

We’re on Avalanche and our token EMBR is listed on Pangolin.Exchange

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

What Makes SAP The Best ERP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TimesPro30/comments/ror8il/what_makes_sap_the_best_erp/,TimesPro30,1,2021-12-26 14:33:20,0,/r/u_TimesPro30/comments/ror8il/what_makes_sap_the_best_erp/,NaN,"  

Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP as it is commonly referred to as, is a category of business management software that aids in the management of business processes. It is at the core of a company’s technological system as it offers an amalgamation of all the features of the business, right from product development and manufacturing to marketing and sales. The aim of ERP is to establish collaboration between all the business processes to enhance productivity, decrease costs, and smoothen out the overall functioning.

Now, though there are a number of popular ERP software available in the market, SAP has become the top choice of most organisations, and that is primarily because of its ability to integrate and simplify the business processes like HR, finance, and the likes. It won’t be wrong to say that as ERP continues to gain importance in the eyes of the businesses, so does SAP. On that note, today, let’s find out what makes SAP the best ERP software in the market.

*Market share of the top 10 ERP Organisations – SAP leading the list*

**Suitability for all scales of businesses**

While most of the ERP systems are made to suit the specific scale of companies, SAP does not depend on the dimension of the business in its implementation. It not just offers facilities for direct implementation, but also makes transitions easy as the business grows. This is because SAP not only comes with multiple cloud solutions but also assimilates complimentary services such as PayPal and Google. It is for this flexibility that SAP offers, that the software is being used by Fortune 500 companies like Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and many other leading organisations across the globe.

**Quicker implementation and faster financial payback**

SAP is the most ‘value for money’ kind of an [ERP](https://timespro.com/how-sap-helps-organizations-attain-continued-business-growth/) software as it is not only highly useful for organisations in terms of raising the productivity, but also because it gives the fastest financial reimbursement. Moreover, the implementation time for SAP is pretty low, which means quicker success for businesses implementing it.

**There are no redundant functionalities**

Unlike other ERP software that are hard to learn, owing to their countless functions, most of which businesses don’t even use, SAP offers functionalities that a business actually needs. It thus becomes easier for both the organisations to implement, as well as for the employees to learn and work with the same without getting all confused.

**Needs less customisation compared to other ERP systems**

SAP needs minimum customisation compared to other ERP systems available in the market, and that also means it has a faster implementation time. However, this does not mean that there are no customisation options available for SAP. It’s just that using those options depend upon the demands and needs of the business, and even without much customisation, the software can work just fine.

**The latest upgrades are rolled in regularly**

SAP keeps on releasing newer versions of the system according to the needs of modern businesses. For starters, SAP r/2 was quickly substituted by SAP r/3, and then, by [SAP ECC](https://timespro.com/6-ways-major-technology-trends-are-benefitting-sap-users/). As SAP strives to stay relevant as per the current times, it also keeps the businesses ahead of the curve.

It goes without saying that all these advantages have made SAP quite indispensable for businesses. No wonder, there is a soaring demand for SAP certified professionals all over the world.  As such, professional training in SAP and a certification in the same can really give you an edge in the 21st-century corporate landscape. We, at TimesPro, regarded as one of the [Best SAP Training Institutes in Delhi](https://timespro.com/sap) and also one of the top SAP institutes in India, are here to ensure that you join the pool of skilled and certified SAP professionals with our hands-on, industry-centric SAP certification courses.

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

Our goal is to build DeFi 3.0 on the Avalanche network 🔥

Embr Finance is a new project from Avaware. We are proud to say that Embr Finance is the first Balancer V2 fork on the chain. Be ready to use next generation AMM protocols on Avalanche!

Embr is a one-stop decentralized investment platform on Avalanche.

Join us if you want to enjoy +700% APRs, a high quality team, an incredible community, and next generation finance tech.

✔ Project Utility and Features:

📈 Weighted Investment Pools:Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset.

💵 Stable Pools: For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve. These pools allow for larger trades of these assets before encountering significant price impact.

↔ Trade: Embr provides a Uniswap style trading experience, to allow for trading from one token for another. Behind the scenes, the Smart Order Router (SOR) intelligently sources liquidity from multiple pools so as to automatically figure out the best available price from all available pools.

🚜 Farm: Earn EMBR by staking your liquidity provider (LP) tokens.

💸 Earn Protocol Fees: Protocol fees will distributed to Liquidity Stakers. Provide liquidity in one of the 80/20 EMBR weighted pools to earn your portion of the protocol fees (% TBD).

And many more.

Finance and the financial industry is overhated,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rozz9c/finance_and_the_financial_industry_is_overhated/,nino3227,1,2021-12-27 00:15:54,0,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rozz9c/finance_and_the_financial_industry_is_overhated/,NaN,"In causal conversations, finance is often presented as the enemy, a harmful/worthless/parasite industry.

But I sincelery think the importance of finance and financial markets in a country's development should be stressed and appreciated  more often. It's no coincidence that the richest countries have strong and developed financial institutions, industry, markets. Country without those could not generate the wealth that allows for decent living conditions I fear.     
And I say ""generate"" deliberately because I don't think we'd be creating and enjoying as much wealth and jobs without those institutions and markets. If it wasn't for them we would probably need to rely on the government for funding and a host of financial services. (but I'm also open to a explanation of how a we could use a different system than today's?) 

And I'm not talking about government /public finance which though history has often be used to fund domination through wars. I'm talking about the hated private financial industry, which since the renaissance has been extensively used to profitably fund business  ventures.

Finance is not all about gambling on stocks. It's in my view and interesting precise and stimulating science with easy everyday applications, but the learning curve can be steep. 

Also I'm not saying there aren't selfish assholes in finance (I truly believe there are in all professions) but that as a whole we underestimate and under appreciate the importance of the financial industry on our daily lives, and that living without them would be an horrible experience in my view. 

English is not my 1st language so sorry for mistakes but I wanted to share this unpopular opinion."
Anybody struggling with economics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/rp3bzm/anybody_struggling_with_economics/,No_Consideration6513,1,2021-12-27 02:58:31,0,/r/CFA/comments/rp3bzm/anybody_struggling_with_economics/,Level 1 material,"Feb 22 candidate here. Left with Econs, covered the materials once in November (using MM's videos) and then did the EOC, averaging about 65% for the EOC. Now going through them for a second time, watched the review videos and even redid the pre-req videos one more time but find that i'm scoring even worst than before and the concepts just aren't clicking with me (EOC 50\~%)

Problem i'm facing is mostly in the micro-economics section; does anyone have an intuitive way to link the bulk of the graphs and the actual concepts together (i.e for oligopoly with the kinked demand curve, how does it relate to the actual characteristics of oligopoly?)  or should i just start from the scratch and do the reading videos again? Some of the graphs just make no sense to me.

Still have some time before mocks so i plan to take the next week just to focus purely on bringing up my economics. Would appreciate some advice on tackling the micro economics section.

About me: Course in NUS computing and part of an RC prog. Pulled up my GPA from 4.0 (2 graded mods) in Y1S1 to [4.55 in Y4S1](https://imgur.com/a/oAg4LIT). Honestly, I’m of average intelligence and not that hard working. Most definitely an average coder. 

The past 3 and a ½ years in university have been insanely hard. Through the process, I learnt and internalised a number of strategies via trial and error and decided to pen them down to spare some of the trial and error. Had some [f**king](https://imgur.com/a/J2AaME6) [crazy](https://imgur.com/a/dzfGkDL) semesters implementing this so I can assure you they are somewhat tried-and-tested ;)

The principles here are relevant if:
1. GPA is important to you as your target industry is highly competitive and any CV without ≥ 4.3 is rejected
2. You started out with a crappy GPA but you want to do better
3. You’re “average” and despite working hard, sacrificing weekends and applying study tips, still average a B+  (There’s a whole discussion on whether a B+ is good, let's not go there today)

A note on “strategy VS tactics”. In short, tactics are things you “do” on a day-to-day basis. For example, the following concepts would be considered tactics to me
1. Using flashcards and an anki system for memory-intensive modules
2. Making sure that no modules is untouched for &gt; 7 days
3. Always skimming through lecture notes before a class

Tips are great. Tips are helpful for students. However, I think there’s a huge under-emphasis on the concept of _strategies_ -- leaving a lot of people underachieving. I want to change that. Hence, we’re going to be more focused on strategies today!

Now that we have that out of the way, let’s jump right in!

## Strat 1 - Planning and Preparation  
*“He who plans to fail, fails to plan” - Winston Churchill*
It is crazy how little some of the people around me plan their academic journey and no, I’m not just referring to a 4Y module plan. I mean a plan of attack. Here are some questions and topics that have helped to focus my energies

* What’s the purpose of the semester? 
   * To pull up your GPA, to maintain it, to just “survive” because you’re doing a part-time internship and juggling full-time job applications? Think about what you want out of the next 4 months and work backwards
* Where to you want to go and how to get there
   * Let’s say you’re at 3.8 now and gunning for a 4.05 -- how are you getting there? Which semester do you want to end with a 4.0? Which modules are you aiming to get an A for? What about those technical modules that you know you’re likely capped at B+? 
   * Model your grades. There’s this concept in finance called “sensitivity analysis” -- this can be applied almost anywhere in life. Create a sheet and plug in some numbers. For example, if you’ve been average B’s the past 2 years, it might be a lil impossible to get straight A’s for the next 2 years. This modelling exercise helps to keep things in perspective and lets you know how difficult it is to get to where you want to go.
* [Assessment Criterias](https://imgur.com/a/ScUyWwA) - Updating your plan as you go along
   * Let’s try an analogy - if you’re running your 2.4km ippt and it’s 6 rounds around the stadium. Would you be checking your timing every round or only do it at the end once you’re done? Naturally, it’s important to systematically update the progress you’ve made in the middle of a semester.  
Have a sheet &amp; regularly input the results of what you think you’ve obtained (Make sure to be pessimistic) and results day will be much less of a surprise. You will also be much clearer on where you stand and can be planning on what to focus on for the last 4 weeks.
   * Furthermore, don’t just “input” an assignment grade and be done with it! Use the model to play around with your goals. For example, if you have component A and B done, you will have a much better sense of how much effort to place into component C to get your target grade.

## Strat 2 - Relationship Building  
*“Thinking that working hard is enough is a fool’s errand” -* /u/BroskiUnited
Let’s be honest. Humans have feelings. People often equate relationship building to sucking up when it is actually a lot more nuanced. Surprise! It’s possible to not be a suck up yet still build a relationship with someone. 

* Professors are humans too and want to be appreciated
   * Humans have feelings - focus on connecting with your professor on a genuine level. Genuinely engage via consultations, post-class questions and demonstrating a willingness to learn. It’s much easier for a professor to provide meaningful help or advice for a project/assignment if they remember you. 
   * Also, do not “just do this” because of a class participation criteria. You never know what a relationship with a professor might bring. For example, if a professor has a positive impression of you from class A, it’s much easier for you to excel in class B, if its also being taught by the same person.
* Seniors are like advanced characters that have already progressed through a dungeon
   * Imagine if you’re playing maplestory as a newb, isn’t it a no-brainer to either form a party with higher levelled characters or at least watch how characters have cleared a dungeon previously and get tips from them? 

I would like to reiterate that there is a nuanced difference from outright sucking up as opposed to forming a connection. Also, think about what you have to give? Everyone can be a “nice guy”. If you’re a loser that no one wants to connect with, what can you do about that?

## Strat 3 - Focus on your strengths  
*Would a bodybuilder participate in a marathon?*
Let’s be honest, not all of us are geniuses. I have seen this firsthand in coding modules: A problem that might take me half a week, 2 consults with the TA and a stackoverflow post was a quick 30 minutes for the person sitting beside me. I have been **crushed** in coding modules despite giving it my all. Why choose a place where you don’t have the high ground? (Anakin reference -- I hate that I needed to point that out)

* What are your strengths?
   * Are you an extrovert? Good at speaking and presenting? People person? Isn’t it then a no brainer to optimise for classes with significant class participation in the assessment criteria?
* What do you already know?
   * Are you a computer science major? Have you already taken 8 programming classes? What’s stopping you from taking an entry level analytics module (eg. DAO1k) and cracking the bell curve in return for 2-4 hours of work a week?

Focus on classes that will allow you to demonstrate your strengths, why start a fight when you’re already disadvantaged? Of course, there are some classes that you HAVE TO take to graduate - my only advice is this: (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5.

## Strat 4 - Learn to cut your losses  
I have no idea where the saying “Don’t take a class just to SU it” - I absolutely disagree with it. 

* A choice: To invest 10h of your time into a paper that is 5% of your grade or focus that time on an individual assignment worth 20% for another module?
   * Learn to recognise that despite all the planning and preparation you’ve done, you will hit week 11 and realised that you’re fucked. Imagine the following:  
It’s Sunday night and you have a deadline for 2 modules on Tuesday afternoon. One is a paper for a 4k module you’ve been struggling with while the other is a simple MCQ test for an economics 1k module. You’ve been doing relatively well for the 1k mod while the 4k mod has been a disaster and despite your best efforts, your past few papers consistently average B.   
Of course, things will rarely be so clear-cut but this is an example of learning to prioritise and focusing on what is likely to move the needle.
* Choose things that are worth your time
   * An A in a 4k coding mod is most likely A LOT harder to achieve compared to an A in “Intro to accounting”. Plan accordingly. 
* It’s fine to drop classes
   * The consequences and when to do it  
Drop a class before week 2: it does not appear on your transcript
Drop a class before week 7: it appears on your transcript as a W and your GPA is unaffected
Drop a class after week 7: you get a fail grade and your GPA is affected

For some reason, people are terrified of dropping classes in Singapore. Trust me - no one cares about that “w” grade on your transcript and in some cases, it has even helped to demonstrate my willingness to experiment and fail during interviews. 

## Strat 5 - You can’t have your cake and eat it too
You have 168 hours a week. That can’t change. You have to make certain sacrifices. Some people sacrifice sleep (although that affects your productivity down the road). Others sacrifice a social life and trade parties for +0.2 on their GPA. It is important to realise that *pulling up* your GPA is **fucking difficult.** Decide on what you are willing to sacrifice and plan accordingly.

# Important Note - Strategies do not always apply
A very important caveat is that some of the above strategies imply a number of things. For example

* GPA is insanely important (to you)
* Grades are (almost) everything (to you)
* You would rather prioritise GPA as opposed to learning
* You would rather take modules where you learn nothing to get good grades as opposed to taking modules for actually learning (altho imo you can have some of each)

I am fairly confident there will be a number of such comments on how a lot of the strategies mentioned are “incorrect” or subjective. Well, they ain’t wrong. I’ve come to realise that people come to university chasing different things. Some want to be on the dean’s list. Others would want to grow. Another could be focused on optimising for the highest compensation upon graduation. 
My point is - before jumping right into the strategies, it is very important to be conscious of how you would like to play this game! 

# Thanks for reading!

Welp - I hope this has been a helpful read for you - I noticed there’s quite a number of study tips lying around, be it on Instagram or /r/sgexams and youtube, but imo there’s so much more to university and getting a good GPA then just studying.

How Yield Farming on Curve Finance Is Quietly Conquering DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rph2pn/how_yield_farming_on_curve_finance_is_quietly/,Independent-Tailor43,1,2021-12-27 14:42:06,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rph2pn/how_yield_farming_on_curve_finance_is_quietly/,ANALYSIS,"#Introduction to Curve DAO

Until recently, Curve had been extremely under discussed, considering the major role it holds in DeFi across blockchains. Recent shifts in tokenomics led its native token, CRV, to become net deflationary; subsequently, the price is up 122% since the token became deflationary.

Curve is a decentralized exchange, known for its pegged-asset swaps like fiat-pegged stablecoins or assets that trade at a 1-1 ratio. With over $3 billion in deposits, Curve’s largest pool is known as 3pool and contains DAI, USDC and USDT.

The stablecoin pools have gained traction offering high liquidity and low fees (0.004%), because Curve uses its native token to reward liquidity providers instead of higher swap fees. Below you can see the results of swapping $75 million from USDC to USDT on Curve, Sushi and Uniswap, with Curve optimizing the swap with significantly less slippage than its competitors.

#CRV Tokenomics 

CRV holders may “stake” their tokens in the platform and lock them in fixed periods of between one week and four years to decide their voting weight. Depending on the amount of Curve locked and the length of time locked, stakers are given an adjusted amount of vote-escrowed Curve (veCRV). veCRV holders are then able to vote on how CRV rewards are distributed across Curve’s pools by assigning weight to the “pool gauge” aligning with their financial interests.

Subsequently, a system for bribing veCRV holders to vote in favor of specific gauge weightings has arisen.
Projects like Abracadabra has paid the equivalent of $1.9 million to veCRV holders willing to vote for their stablecoin pool in the last two weeks alone, now giving their pool 32.5% of the relative gauge weight.

The dynamic capabilities of veCRV have kept the demand for CRV strong, even with inflation, to match the demand for maximized yield and low-fee swaps. However, as seen below, the emission schedule has slowed because of the end of early user rewards. The demand for locking CRV has also increased, turning the asset net “deflationary.” 


[The CRV that is locked for voting is not considered part of the token supply, as it is non-liquid and the majority is locked for the next three to four years.](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MMFM5WBEZJHIPBJRFRFUZZI6RI.jpg)

#Summary 

Over the past six months, Curve has made just $34.1 million in swap fees, even though it has $16.5 billion in TVL on Ethereum’s main network and has kept its trading volume consistently high. Oftentimes, liquidity would migrate to exchanges with higher fee brackets for higher returns, and yet Curve has the lowest fees and more liquidity locked than any other exchange. The project’s real secret is subsidizing liquidity with the CRV token, keeping yields high enough for liquidity providers to stay in its pools.

Curve now has almost $20.2 billion in TVL across seven different ecosystems, making it the largest decentralized application, or dapp.

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: ~4-5 hrs per week, ~10-15 during exam weeks and proj2.

Pros:
• Probably the lowest workload upper div CS class
• Fun and interesting projects, 1 and 3 are not time consuming at all and can be done in a night. Project 2 is a large time sink but it was also fun and the class gives you a ton of time to do it even if you start late
• Amazing course staff - the course staff this semester was super accommodating and honestly the best I've seen in a CS class at Berkeley so far. Helpful extensions during stressful weeks, letting slip days carry over Thanksgiving break, extra hw drops, flexible exam procedures, quick piazza response times, discussion TA
• Reasonable exams - if you do past exams and make notes of the textbook/lectures on your cheat sheet it's on the easier side to do well on the exams compared to other upper divs (no weirdly hard exams compared to content like CS 188, past exams have questions that are slight variations of each other)
• Great online textbook, super easy to catch up with lectures by using it if you fall behind or don't want to watch lecture.

Cons: 
• Personally I wish the class went more in depth on some topics, but it is a survey class so it can't be faulted that much here
• Sounds weird, but the projects might be TOO easy. Projects 1 and 3 could be more in depth and I think it would be fun to have harder challenges than the ones that they currently have. (Project 3 in particular has easier questions than many intro level CTF questions on web security). Considering project 2 requires probably 30-50 hours compared to the ~6 for project 1 and ~4 for project 3, I think there could be a better balance especially when each is weighted equally. However, I still think that project 3 should be on the lighter side given that it ends up being close to finals week. 
• The midterm exam felt kind of pointless this semester. So many questions were thrown out that it seemed like it didn't matter at all and the scores ended up very samey. The course staff (again, amazing) did make the final clobber the midterm though so it made this less of a problem.

Overall, a great class and would highly recommend especially if you want to round out a busy schedule without adding too much extra work.


CS 162 (Ion Stoica)

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: ~20 hrs per week

Pros:
• You will definitely learn a ton. Probably the single class that has increased my computer science knowledge the most at Berkeley so far but also conceptually difficult.
• Adding onto the previous point, really interesting topics if you care at all about performance, systems, design.
• Rewarding - once I got a concept in this class or figured out the homeworks and projects it truly felt rewarding and I could actually say I learned something significant for pretty much every assignment.
• Good lectures - a bit boring and slow, but easy to follow and 2x is your friend.
• Good exams - studying definitely pays off, although a lot of it is just knowing terms + concepts (make a good cheat sheet) 
Cons:
• TONS of work - this is basically a 6-8 unit class. With the additions to the 2nd project, the workload  is even higher (proj 2 is definitely now the hardest one). Projects are all long and you constantly have one the whole semester, HWs are long and some are pretty much projects in other CS classes (spent more time on average per hw for this class than projects for 161).
• Course staff could have been a bit more accommodating w/ regards to projects. Proj 2 now has a new part which is basically 1 to 1.5 projects on its own. The project could have used a bit more guidance considering it's new and some parts required some tricky solutions that were quite confusing to grasp using just the spec + design review. Additionally, some extensions to proj 2 definitely would've helped considering it was during the busiest time of the semester as well. They did mention at the end of the class that the curve was adjusted to compensate for proj 2's increased definitely so that was great of them. 
• Discussion was mandatory and required camera on (some may not see this as a con, but it was annoying to me), some sections had participation that wasn't just based on showing up (? Could be wrong on this) 
• I would consider having a good group as a pre req for this class since the projects are a huge part of your grade, extremely time consuming, hard, and must be done in a group of 4. Make sure you have people you trust to work hard(at least 3/4) in your group or it will be a bad time. I was lucky enough to have 2 friends taking this class w/ me which helped a lot and our fourth group member(found through class) was also great.


CS W186 (Lakshya Jain)

Rating: 6.5/10

Workload: ~8-12 hrs per week

Pros: 
• Good transition to upper div CS classes, projects and topics use and build upon many skills and concepts from lower divs like 61B, 61C
• Lots of resources - web lectures, review lectures, discussion, class notes (really good class notes)
• Balanced workload over whole semester, can expect to spend the same amount of time each week and it's a reasonable amount of time even though you will always have a project going on.
• Exams are straightforward and similar to past exams while still testing knowledge
• Projects help you learn the material well
• Accommodating course staff - respound quickly, helpful extensions.
Cons:
• While it's a good intro to upper div classes, most of the concepts are systems concepts and are honestly just taught in a more general and better way in 162. So it might be more worthwhile to take this class before 162. 
• I personally thought the content was pretty boring.
• While exams are straightforward, much of it is calculation bash for I/Os or trying to figure out what some SQL does. This makes the exams straightforward, but long and tedious. 


CS 194-277: Decentralized Finance (Dawn Song, lots of profs from other universities)

Rating: 8/10

Workload: ~8-10 hrs per week. Weekly lecutre quizzes (completion), 2 labs, semester long group research project.

Pros:
• I loved the course content. Super new and exciting field and the class definitely hooked me into it. Lectures gave an overview of many DeFi topics and it was cool to hear lots of different professors speak.
• Great course staff - gave lots of help and extensions on the tough Lab 2 and helped w/ projects.
• The class has 2 labs, the second lab was really fun content wise and taught a lot about writing smart contracts (more of this later)
Cons: 
• This class is only 2 Units!!! It is far more work than a 2 unit class should be. At minimum thisshould be 3 units but I probably spent more time on this class than 161 and 186 (could be due to choosing and working longer on a harder project though, not sure how much they were expecting in the end)
•Lab 2 could have used a lot more guidance from the class itself. There was only one lecture on smart contracts and the lab required us to have a lot of underlying knowledge to complete that wasn't really available from the single lecture. To complete the lab, tons of documentation had to be scoured along with a super helpful guide a classmate wrote.
•i wish there were more hands on assignments scattered over the semester rather than 2 labs, the first of which was basically a small math assignment. Of course, this would mean more work but this assumes the class is now 3-4 units.


Math 128A: (Per-olof Persson)

Rating: 6/10

Workload: ~6-10 hrs per week, weekly psets, ocassional programming assignment, biweekly quizzes

Pros:
• Easiest required upper div applied math major class

Cons:
• HW length varied drastically, some later hw were easily 3x the length of some previous ones and I wished the use of my drops was in my control earlier in the semester. 
• slow grading of assignments, not too transparent with grades. Didn't really know my quiz grades or where my grade in the class stood at all the whole semester besides exam grades.
• I thought the topics were fairly interesting, learning how some numerical methods work, implementations and proofs, but overall still very boring compared to all of the other upper div math
• MATLAB"

# What is the synopsis?

I believe that the key to value creation in our age is the development of intangible assets. Their rise is the reason why value investing keeps failing as income statements become more and more redundant lagging indicators of corporate success. 

I am looking for companies building the dominant intangible assets of the future. I prefer platform technologies that - once established - can be leveraged for different types of value creation as they are generalized in nature. I believe these intangible assets will create natural monopolies over time, which can already be observed by the rising market cap concentration. I believe a great investment must be controversial to offer outsized returns. As a follower of the Muskanity, I believe scaling disruptive innovation is the crucial challenge to success. I want the leader in their industry before everyone knows they are the winner. 

I believe I have found what I am looking for in Amyris. They are building a great technological platform, the stock is controversial with its true strength likely under-appreciated. They have demonstrated best in class execution in terms of scaling their technology and have constantly reinvented themselves over the past decade, which demonstrates their skills and flexibility. Please note that I do not have an educational background in biology. Happy to stand corrected if anything I point out below is inaccurate.

## What is the company?

Amyris was founded in 2003 by UC Berkeley scientists and named after a plant that is known for strong scents. Its first initiative was to produce synthetic artemisinin for Malaria treatment, which was funded by the Gates foundation. They successfully completed this project in 2008. In the following years, the company tried to apply synthetic biology to develop and produce biofuels, which turned out not to be sustainable when the oil price started plummeting in mid-2014 from $100 to below $50. Amyris shares lost 95% between 2014 and 2017. During that period, the company pivoted from biofuels to consumer products based on the idea that synthetic biology works best for higher end, more expensive molecules as opposed to high volume low unit costs commodities. I view this as a similar strategy like Tesla. Applying a new technology to the low volume premium market segment and working the way down the cost curve to higher volume segments. In 2015, Amyris launched their first consumer brand, Biossance, for sustainable skin care. 

Today, the company effectively operates 2 segments: Brands and Ingredients. In Brands, they develop, produce and market molecules themselves. In Ingredients they operate as a contract manufacturer of molecules for strategic partners.

## What is the technology?

**Synthetic Biology**

At its essence, synthetic biology is about the realization that organisms can be programmed just like semiconductors because the building blocks of biology are also digital. Instead of storing and transmitting information in 0 and 1, biology uses Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine and Uracil. These are molecules consisting of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon, which are the building blocks for the molecules DNA (A, C, G and T) and RNA (A, C, G and U). DNA carries genetic instructions for organisms. It is the cell's source code from within. RNA exists outside of cells and serves for cell communication. It can tell the cell what to do from outside.

Synthetic biology is about reassembling A, C, G, T and U patterns found in nature to alter organisms to make them create desired molecules in biochemical reactions. Currently, all synthetic biology companies rely on Fermentation as the facilitating technology for this process. Fermentation is the equivalent of the electronic circuit in a microchip in which 1s and 0s are being shuffled around.

**Fermentation**

Fermentation is a metabolic process. A metabolic process is the conversion of energy in food to energy for cellular processes. This typically happens in a series of chemical reactions, which is called a metabolic pathway. Fermentation is the oldest metabolic pathway. Amyris also refers to pathways within the Fermentation category.

This conversion/energy extraction is triggered through enzymes. An enzyme is a protein that acts as a biochemical catalyst, i.e. it converts molecules (called substrates into other molecules (called products). Substrates can be various types of molecules, most common known are carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids. Amino acids are building blocks for proteins.

The metabolic process of Fermentation specifically refers to the extraction of energy from carbohydrates without oxygen. Carbohydrates are molecules consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The process of breaking these down releases energy stored inside the molecule.

In summary, Fermentation needs an organism in which the process can occur, it needs a substrate upon which the Enzyme can enact and it needs a product as a result. Below are three well known fermentation examples:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/feh1scysh6881.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9fcedf6282f26b27601e23ce8493c81bf01d6b

The fermentation applied by Amyris operates mainly with yeasts as organisms, which are fed sugarcane. The yeasts are reprogrammed through gene editing to produce the desired molecules as products.

The process of programming the yeasts and their metabolic process is highly iterative and a route can include up to 30 chemical reactions in a chain. Amyris is running \~600k yeast candidates through their high throughput screening (HTS) per month, only the top 100 of which are sent to Fermentation. These candidates are referred to as genotypes. A genotype is the entire genetic code of an individual organism.

**Genotype Specification Language**

For this process, Amyris has developed their own coding language called Genotype Specification Language (GSL). They have established &gt;20 pathways and defined &gt;500 target molecules (of in total 300k molecules occurring in nature) categorized in 15 chemical classes, of which they have produced &gt;250, 13 of which have reached scaled production and commercialization. Between 2008 and 2020 they have scaled from a manual development of 20 designs to a computational atlas of metabolism with &gt;120,000 metabolites (intermediate products of metabolic processes) and &gt;140,000 reactions. This is exactly the type of technology platform that Ginkgo is aiming for and claims to have an edge on. Amyris is the only company having scaled to this level and is gathering data at this speed. The data lead reminds of Tesla’s FSD edge. As they are scaling their development and manufacturing, they are continuously running into new issues. For instance, biochemical reactions in a plate can differ from the biochemical environment in a tank. As Elon Musk always says, lab/prototype is easy, scaling production is hard.

Amyris is applying machine learning algorithms to predict tank performance because it would be impossible to test this amount of throughput in tanks. They have a strong technological edge because of their data lead due to the scaling lead. This is a classic example of the conversion of Cathie Wood’s innovation platforms, in this case Genomics and AI.

Amyris is based in Fremont and apparently very heavily influenced by Tesla. They even borrowed from Tesla in their mission statement which is: Accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable ingredients. Tesla has taught a whole generation of innovation companies that scaling production is the hardest part of innovation, particularly relating to complex manufacturing revolutions. Key to success is vertical integration and a hyperfocus on product and manufacturing excellence. It appears that Amyris has fully understood this.

## What is the competition?

https://preview.redd.it/m813ke1vh6881.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7272d825c9f5e84fd66640bf5965131c44ee99ed

**Ginkgo Bioworks**

The closest competitor to Amyris is Ginkgo Bioworks, which was founded in 2008 by a team of MIT scientists with biology and software engineering backgrounds. Tom Knight stands out, who was a computer scientist for decades in MIT until he realized in the 1990s that biology is also running on digital code. Initially, I liked this detail, but I am more doubtful about what good of a data point it is because they have worked on this technology for so long in labs without tackling real world challenges. Amyris in contrast has been working on actual applications since 2003.

The biggest difference between Ginkgo and Amyris is the horizontal vs. vertical integration approach, a difference which is praised by Ginkgo bulls. While Amyris aims to take control of the entire value chain from research and development of molecules to manufacturing them at scale and even marketing them in their B2C business, Ginkgo mainly focuses on the R&amp;D portion, i.e. they develop suitable molecules for their partners/customers, who will then do the manufacturing and marketing themselves. This is viewed as a strength of the Ginkgo business model in that they focus on the most critical part of the value creation. The idea is that it is freeing up their resources on manufacturing and marketing to focus on developing the technology platform. This argument is presumably a significant driver for the substantial valuation gap between Ginkgo and Amyris (in addition to further reasons that I will elaborate on later). I find it deeply flawed because of the reasons listed below, which is an essential component of my investment case:

1. The argument rests on the assumption that Ginkgo is and/or will be better than Amyris in the R&amp;D part of the value creation, which is not substantiated by the current status of their technologies. Everything that Ginkgo claims to do, Amyris also claims to be doing. The difference is that Amyris’ claims are more commercially proven. 
2. Ginkgo’s business model is praised because they are taking equity/revenue share in their customers, enabling them to benefit from highly scalable almost pure profit revenues in the future. This is considered as an advantage over Amyris. This is a flawed argument for several reasons:

* The main value is the tech itself. The business model is just a question of how to monetize it best. If the viability of a venture capital approach is proven, there is no reason why Amyris should not be able to do the same.
* Ginkgo’s entanglements with the customers is actually concerning. Yes, it is great to take equity in them if they come to them as independent 3rd parties, but their biggest winner seems to be Motif Foodworks which if I understand correctly is their own spin-off. I do not want to be overly critical without having all the information, but it almost appears as if DNA just ‘downstreamed’ the production process to claim they are not engaged in it if it fails expectations. Where is the platform value if you effectively own your customers? Also, it makes the pricing and revenue recognition shady, which I think was also the essence of their short selling attack in October 2021. I haven't looked much into that though to know for sure.
* Taking equity/revenue shares in their customers as opposed to being paid in real cash may in fact be an indication of weakness. Their main customers are early stage companies that do not have the financial power to pay for the services. So Ginkgo’s choice of taking equity in them may not be their own decision. In contrast, Amyris works with established companies that actually pay for the contract manufacturing and their own B2C brands are demonstrating tangible commercial success.
* Valuing R&amp;D over vertical integration rests on the assumption that the hardest part is coming up with the suitable yeast strains and subsequent mass production of the molecules is the easy part. This goes against historical evidence in multiple industries, especially in complex manufacturing, where the scaling part is the difficult part. Production may even be less susceptible to commoditization than the R&amp;D part. Also, there is a direct feedback loop between the lab and the manufacturing plant in terms of process optimization. So, the closer these are interlinked, the better this feedback loop. The most successful companies on this planet share their skills in having the best execution, not in having the best ideas (Tesla, Toyota, Facebook, Amazon, Apple are good examples). Whoever is scaling the breakthrough tech first, will get a disproportionate share in value creation. It therefore appears flawed to say, Ginkgo is just outsourcing this critical part to focus on the molecule development. Especially given Amyris even appears to be better at that anyway. The argument is almost like claiming QuantumScape should be worth more than Tesla because they focus on the battery tech, the most important component of an EV, while Tesla has to deal with the actual car production. Well, Tesla actually adds value in that production process as their battery tech is embedded in the chassis production process.

Another substantial difference between Ginkgo and Amyris is their relationship with Covid-19. While the pandemic has impacted Amyris negatively since it delayed their production scaling efforts and they currently do not have a product in terms of vaccine development and/or testing, Ginkgo has actually benefited immensely through their testing services and biosecurity segment. About 60% of their 9M21 revenues relates to their Covid-19 testing. It may be a growth driver for them if the pandemic is here to stay, but it also may pose a risk if we overcome it eventually. Also, my interest in investing in synthetic biology is not to participate in milking the pandemic, but to participate in the multiple decade long run of the genomic manufacturing revolution of large parts of the economy.

On top of that, if the end of Covid-19 is a risk to half of Ginkgo’s revenues, its potential long term stay is a potential upside to Amyris as they are engaged in the development of next generation vaccines. One of their commercialized molecules, Squalene, is a potential vaccine adjuvant.  An adjuvant is a substance that helps stimulate the immune response to a vaccine. For instance, this can be inorganic (aluminium molecules), oils or bacteria. Squalene is a molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. It is an oil which is typically used as moisturizer and a key ingredient in Amyris’ acne treatment products. It was historically won through shark livers, until Amyris figured out how to produce it cheaper through fermentation. There were even news stories at the onset of vaccine development that the Covid-19 vaccines might cause a mass slaughtering of sharks. On November 8, 2021, Amyris announced a partnership with ImmunityBio to develop a next generation MRNA vaccine together to which Amyris would likely supply Squalene as the adjuvant. At this point, I believe it is unlikely that any of that is priced into the stock.

If all of that is true, then why is Ginkgo valued 8x Amyris? I can think of the following reasons:

1. Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo, has a better reputation than John Melo, the CEO of Amyris. He is younger, comes across in interviews more charismatic and is an MIT scientist by training. Melo in contrast is looked down upon for his oil &amp; gas past and he has overpromised and underdelivered in the past. Kelly’s past is completely clean. So far, he has not disappointed anyone.
2. Cathie Wood owns Ginkgo, but not Amyris, which gives Ginkgo visibility and likely a valuation premium over Amyris.
3. Investors are likely discounting Amyris B2C efforts, viewing it as a distraction from the core competencies in synthetic biology. It is possible that their synthetic biology skills are overlooked and investors mainly view them like a small scale consumer products/specialty chemicals company as opposed to a high tech company leading an industrial revolution. They are a biotech company without any pharmaceutical compounds (apart from their acne treatment). Biotech analysts are used to thinking about blockbuster cancer treatments and perhaps look down on them, while consumer products analysts do not understand their technology. It appears like they do not fit categories like Tesla has for a long time, when tech analysts were uninterested and auto analysts had the wrong tools.
4. Ginkgo is likely gaining additional visibility by being involved in the fight against the pandemic.
5. Their R&amp;D focus is likely getting more credit than Amyris gets. And investors like their start-up ownership.
6. Amyris’ stock price history has probably burned a lot of investors, who do not want to touch it anymore after all the disappointments. Both in the long term and in 2021, some of the drops have been unexpected and devastating.

**Zymergen**

Zymergen is known for developing Hyaline, which is a film for flexible touchscreen devices. It is produced through fermentation just like the products of Amyris. The company was founded in 2011 by previous Amyris employees, most importantly Josh Hoffman, who served as CEO until August 2021 after struggling with scaling production. This underpins a) Amyris’ technological leadership and b) that scaling of production is a key challenge for the synthetic biology industry. I see parallels of Tesla’s relationship with Lucid and Fisker. Both Peter Rawlinson and Henrik Fisker were previously Tesla employees involved in Model S development before they started their own companies. If a company breeds talent that moves on to compete with them afterwards, that is a highly important data point proving the hierarchical status of that company in their industry. Both Lucid and Fisker are yet to prove they can scale production. Just like Zymergen.

**Twist Biosciences**

Twist is effectively a supplier to Amyris, Ginkgo and Zymergen. Twist develops the genes used by these three in the reprogramming of the yeast strains. I can imagine their name  originates from the double helix shape of DNA. Genes are distinct sequences of the nucleotides (A, C, G, T) within DNA. If Amyris, Ginkgo and Zymergen are the equivalents of Amazon and Nvidia and Microsoft, then Twist is the equivalent of TSMC and perhaps Intel.

## Why is the stock price down so much?

The stock is down 75% from its peak in March 2021. The decline came in three stages: 1) 45% decline in April/May, 2) sideways trading Jun-Oct, 3) 60% decline since the horror Q3 earnings report.

The first correction in April/May was mainly the deflation of the bubble that had built up in growth/biotech stocks in 1Q21. ARK Invest had massive inflows, pushing up their holdings in the genomics space alongside which Amyris rose sharply. On top of growth/biotech stocks being in investor favour at that time, Amyris also benefited from the meme stock bonanza due to their substantial short interest. On top of that, the company had positive news, such as their strategic partnerships, which secured long term manufacturing contracts and large upfront payments for exclusive distribution of Amyris’ ingredients, which cleaned up their balance sheet and eliminated going concern doubts. The 45% decline in March was effectively a healthy correction of the 1Q21 mania.

The stock then traded sideways for half a year, which is actually not too bad given the constant selling pressure on biotech/growth companies, which fell out of investor favour due to the reflation trade that pushed up value stocks. The company had some solid investor education presentations over the summer in which Melo and his team painted a very rosy picture of the Company’s future, which likely supported the stock. They also explicitly reiterated $400M revenue guidance in their lab-to-market presentation on Sep 28, 2021, 9 months into the year.

On November 8, with only 7-8 weeks left in the year, they reduced their revenue guidance for the year to $330-370m, which is almost a 20% reduction when the year was almost over. This came as a shock. It sent the stock down 40% the next day and almost certainly destroyed a lot of credit in the management team. I think the reasons are understandable. Given the port issues, their inventory was down and they could not produce. But, what was probably the biggest concern is how management could not have been aware of this. It raises questions on their internal management controls. What also did not help was that they subsequently announced a convertible bond offering diluting the stock and the overall biotech/growth stock sell off continued. Tax loss harvesting probably also played a role and overall, sentiment in the stock is pretty disastrous now. Delays in the opening of their big plant in Brazil also contributes to the bad sentiment. Overall, I am used to manic swings following quarterly earnings report from my Tesla journey. Decade(s) long disruptive innovation stories often look messy from a quarterly perspective. In some phases, one or two weak quarters can give the impression as if the growth is over. I have heard that too often.

Now, where from here? The operating issues are clearly supply driven. Their products continue to be strong and the technological platform is convincing. Nothing has fundamentally changed in the long term story. Given how much investors have been burned in 2021 (and how much pain the stock has in general created in the 2010s), it is unlikely the stock will be hyped again soon. I therefore believe that the coming years will likely be climbing a wall of worry, which should be attractive for building the position. To do that with conviction, I need to have a view on the long term potential for the stock.

## What can the valuation be?

**Projections based on product launches**

Per McKinsey, almost 60% of physical inputs to the global economy could in principle be produced biologically. About ⅓ of those inputs are biological materials (plants, animals), ⅔ are non-biological (plastics, metals). The global chemicals market is worth $4tn. The long term market opportunity for Amyris is completely bananas, which makes developing long term projections almost pointless. There is effectively no demand-side barrier and the limit to their growth is solely their own ability to scale production competitively to traditional manufacturing processes in terms of cost and quality.

Currently, Amyris produces 13 ingredients at scale, has 24 in development and 250 in their library (i.e. having successfully proven the concept by producing them in a lab). There are in total 326,000 molecules occurring in nature and my understanding is there is theoretically no limit to synthetic biology producing these. It is mainly a question whether yeast fermentation is the most suitable production approach.

Amyris has stated the goal of developing and commercializing 4-6 new ingredients annually and scaling them to $50-100m annual revenue each within three years. Based on royalty agreements in the past, this would give each a $1bn brand value in the mid-term at a 8-10x revenue multiple. This implies $5bn in value creation annually in the midterm, which would be pretty crazy for a company with &lt;$2bn market cap.

Given how enormous the market opportunity is, there are tons of market segments to choose from and Amyris appears to take a Tesla like approach to start in high unit cost, low volume segments and then ride the cost curve down to higher volume, lower unit cost market segments. They chose these segments based on market potential, their expertise and experience. Their first campaign was in Flavor &amp; Fragrance (sweetener Reb M for instance). The second campaign was Health &amp; Wellness (mostly Squalene and CBD for skin care and pain), and the third campaign is now Personal Care (Hemisqualane for haircare, Terasana brand). Each new campaign is 2-3x larger with 30-50% lower volume costs and faster commercialization. This is a prime candidate for Wright’s Law, i.e. a constant % declining cost curve as a function of production volume. In the personal care segment, Amyris products target 80% of the global beauty and personal care market, which is worth $420bn today and expected to grow to $716bn by 2025. Clean beauty is growing twice that rate. This appears to be a triple exponential growth trajectory: Take market share from incumbents in a segment in an exponentially growing market that is itself growing faster than this market.

If they manage on average to commercialize 4 ingredients per year (the lower end of their target, which may grow over time as they further scale up) and bring each of these to 100m of revenues within 3 years, this means that their annual revenue growth rate could reach $400m within a few years, which is more than their current annual revenues. It will likely speed up from their as I expect the growth trajectory to be exponential, not linear.

**Tanaka model**

Graham Tanaka impressed me with his Youtube interview with management and his Seeking Alpha articles. He was an early investor in Intel and Tesla and his 2001 book on digital deflation proves he understood the main value creation forces in the digital era early on. He positioned his book against Shiller’s irrational exuberance book, which I like because that book did not resonate well with me when I read it. To oversimplify a little bit, I felt that Shiller sees exuberance anywhere where charts point up without consideration of actual drivers. It was almost annoying how he made that argument again and again without acknowledging that the positive drift of the underlying trends remained even after temporary bubbles deflated.

I also liked Tanaka’s summary of Amyris’ 5 platforms of growth:

* Continuing exponential cost decline in DNA sequencing for molecule development =&gt; accelerating development of new molecules
* Finding new applications for existing molecules
* Production of higher purity molecules with ‘clean’ stamps fits rising consumer awareness (makes them also relevant for ESG investing)
* Contract manufacturing: Nobody has the synthetic bio manufacturing scale, making Amyris a prime candidate for contract manufacturing, providing them with long term supplier contracts and upfront cash to finance growth. 
* Continuing improving fermentation performance =&gt; manufacturing prowess as differentiator

Tanaka published an excerpt from his detailed model on Seeking Alpha in March 2021, seeing the company scaling to $1bn in revenue by 2025.

**Projections Based on mgmt guidance**

Management has stated that they plan to hit a $1bn revenue **run rate** by 2023 and $2bn by 2025. The curious thing about this guidance is that it does not matter much if they miss it because nobody seems to actually find this goal credible. So, I view it generally as a long shot upside to the stock if they still manage to pull that off. After all, they must have some production plans underlying this guidance. It would definitely shoot the stock to the moon.

**Price targets until 2030**

Consolidating the thoughts above, I think the stock can roughly 10x over the coming 10 years without making overly aggressive assumptions:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ql8wuc5i6881.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e106d90f41898d2661eb04a4f31873ec564b887

A 5x terminal sales multiple is based on 20% operating margins and a 25x operating profit multiple. They target gross margins of 40-50% and this should be a decades long growth story if it plays out, which is why a solid multiple is likely by the end of this decade. Share dilution is assumed to be 3% annually, admittedly without putting too much analysis into it for now.

## What are additional thoughts?

**Short Interest**

Currently 34m shares are sold short. At 66% float and 308m shares outstanding, this equates to a short interest of 17%, which is quite substantial and helps derisking the position. It is at a level similar to Tesla at the onset of the 2020 run. If Amyris executes well, there can be potential for a surprise pop in the stock.

**Clean manufacturing**

Clean manufacturing is an investment and consumer theme that is just getting started, but will very likely gain strong traction in coming years since customers show rising moral standards in their consumption. Whether that is based on true feelings or just virtue signalling does not matter for investing purposes. What I observe in social media and what can be seen in the commercial success of companies like Beyond Meat is an important indicator for the coming years. Amyris is destined to gain visibility on this topic as it grows in size.

**John Doerr**

John Doerr is a venture capitalist who was early in Google and Amazon. He sits on Amyris’ board and owns 24% of the shares. This gives them a lot of credibility and access to great leadership advice on execution. He is also a great anchor investor who is unlikely to ever sell his position.

**John Melo**

He has a bad reputation, but I really liked him in interviews and presentations so far. It is actually interesting that he has a fossil fuel background since oil is not just an energy source, but also often used in consumer products (rubber, plastic). Pivoting this business to sustainable synthetic bio ingredients should feel natural for him even without having a science background. He also has been with the company for a very long time which adds to his credibility."

Unpacking reporting/investing situation (20+ year LTR) -- Improving my situation,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/rr2r0d/unpacking_reportinginvesting_situation_20_year/,RandomTerritory,1,2021-12-29 15:53:33,0,/r/JapanFinance/comments/rr2r0d/unpacking_reportinginvesting_situation_20_year/,Investments » Retirement,"I'm really at a loss of how to move forward with unpacking my current tax/investing situation. I'm a 20+ year resident of Japan, and I seem to behind the curve on every decision I'm making, frozen from acting due to fear of compliance. I'd really like to get on top of this because I can't put off investing for retirement any longer, and I want my kids to be in a better situation going forward.

Situation:

Resident of Japan for over 20 years (42 years old). 2 kids (both with JP/US citizenship), wife is Japanese (never been to US aside from travel). 15 years ago I thought it was a great idea to file taxes as married (filing jointly) to setup a paper trail for getting a green card, but I have no plans to return to the US now, and now filing jointly is looking like it was a bad decision (especially since I just found Japan Finance). I own a home here and I'd like to set things up for retirement.

I have term life insurance and I've got education insurance (学資) for my kids, all of which I setup before FACTA came into play. Term seems out of the scope of FBAR/FACTA, but I'm not sure about the education insurance (Eldest kid goes to high school in 2 years and youngest is in elementary school, so losing this would be pretty devastating).

My wife is starting to invest for the kids future, but that seemingly goes against PFICs?

I recently learned about Interactive Brokers so that seems like an option for future investing (I'm looking at FTEs), but at this point I feel completely overwhelmed. Are there any options available for us?

Going Forward:

I see a lot of people with investment accounts or IRAs setup before coming to Japan, but I've been here so long and I'm getting in so late that KYC is basically stopping me from everything (at least in my stupid, limited knowledge base).

I'd prefer to stay completely above board, and I report my bank accounts on an annual basis via FBAR, but I'm so far behind in getting ready for retirement because I don't know how to navigate this anymore. The worst for me is that knowing about PFICs, etc. I've just decided to avoid everything, and it's setting me up for failure and it sucks.

I would greatly appreciate if someone could help push me in the right direction so I can turn the new year into something a bit more positive. I've read through quite a few posts in this subreddit and my situation just feels worse and worse."

November Money Supply: Similar and Different to Nov 1972,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/rrevfu/november_money_supply_similar_and_different_to/,exploring_finance,1,2021-12-30 02:25:45,0,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/rrevfu/november_money_supply_similar_and_different_to/,Due Diligence 📜,"**M2 increased by $249.2B in November**. This represents a 1.16% MoM increase which annualizes to 15.1%. Although only a single month, 15.1% annualized growth exceeds the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year averages. At this rate, it’s hard to believe inflation will subside on its own. The Fed can taper their asset purchases, but shrinking the Money Supply is the only way to rein in inflation.

Speaking of tapering, last month showed [the balance sheet grew by $126B](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/what-taper-fed-adds-126b-in-november/), which was higher than the targeted $105B. Thursday will reveal the latest Fed balance sheet which, [according to Powell and the Fed](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details#monthly-details), should expand by less than $100B. It’s not looking good though given that [$92B was added in a single week](https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/worst-taper-ever-fed-adds-92-1-billion-to-balance-sheet-in-one-week/).

In either case, the Money Supply growth in the chart below shows that this year is closing even hotter than last year. Looking at Aug to Nov from the last two years shows that 2020 saw total M2 increase by $642B. In 2021, that number has climbed to $858B!

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 1 MoM M2 Change](https://preview.redd.it/tzk1hewuxi881.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ccd67ff235532fc1318f7d39078970e0abe6be)

***Comparison to November 1972***

Looking at a much longer historical perspective in the chart below shows the YoY growth rate for each November dating back to 1960. The current November clocks in at 13.1% which is behind only Nov 2020 (24.3%) and Nov 1971 (13.4%). The chart below shows this growth rate (bars) alongside CPI (black line) and the Fed Funds Rate (blue line).

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure: 2 MoM M2 Change](https://preview.redd.it/0dyzax9xxi881.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7b0c7697d3400a1ed8c8958631228e5231905fa)

As shown above, 1973 and 1974 is when inflation really took off, after two years of significant increases in the Money Supply. From 1969-1972 M2 annual increases were: 4.1%, 6.1%, 13.4%, and 12.7%. The 1969-1972 M2 setup looks quite similar to the 2018-2021 setup in the current environment, only this time is more extreme where M2 has grown: 3.3%, 7.0%, 24.3%, and 13.1%.

While the M2 growth looks similar, the current actions by the Fed do not. Unfortunately, the current Fed is way behind the Fed of Nov 1972. While Money Supply was growing at 12.7% in 1972, the Fed Funds rate was set at 5.1% against a CPI of 3.4%. In the current environment, with M2 growing at 13.1%, the Fed Funds rate is still at 0% while CPI is closing in on 7%.

In 1972, before inflation really spiraled out of control (and the CPI had been completely doctored), real interest rates were actually positive by 1.7%. Compare that to today where real interest rates are -6.88%! So, while money supply was growing at about the same aggressive YoY 13% growth, **the difference in real rates from 1972 to 2021 is -8.58%**. Forget being behind the curve, the Fed isn’t even on the same planet!

Simple math tells you why:  [higher interest payments](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/us-debt-the-landscape-has-changed-and-the-fed-can-do-nothing-about-it/) would blow a hole through the [Federal budget](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/tax-revenues-surge-20-compared-to-2020-and-2019-will-it-last/) and shatter the entire bubble economy. Therefore, the CPI has left the Fed in the dust...

yatirim tavsiyesi degildir cunku ozunde kaldiracli islem yapiyoruz aslinda. yuksek risk teskil ettiginden kaldiracli islemlerden uzak durmalisiniz ancak risk seviyelerinizi (yukarda bahsettigim likiditasyon orani) ve aldiginiz borcu ne kadar riskli bir yatirimda kullanacaginiza gore risk seviyelerinizi kendiniz belirliyebiliyorsunuz. ornegin, en riskli senaryoda eth + aaveyield + qi rewards dan gelecek gelir + alinan borc ile qi alip bir de uzerine qi nin fiyat artisin gelecek gelir ile kaldiracli islem yapmis oluyorsunuz. en az riskli senaryoda da likidistasyon oranini olabildigince guvenli tutup %0.5 geri odeme masrafina karsilik, balancer, curve, saber, beefy gibi stablecoin olarak yatirip %15-20 seviyelerinde (apy/apr) gelir elde edebiliyorsunuz. piyasalarin durumuna gore bu cok riskli ile az riskli arasinda gecis/dengeleme yapilabilir yani fiyatlar sistiginde stablecoin e gecip, dip yaptiginda da tam tersi yapmak gibi. likiditasyon limitleri (collateral to debt ratio) lari yakindan takip etmek gerekiyor ve riskinizin arttigini gordugunuzde borcunuzun bir kismini geri odeyerek bu orani optimum seviyede (qi kazancini kaybetmeden ama likidite olmadan) tutmak isin en cok efor sarfedilmesi gereken kismi. ben genelde coinalert gibi app lar ile once kendime en dusuk limit belirliyorum ornegin eth 3000 in altina dusmez diyorum ona gore bir strateji belirliyorum eger eth 3000 lere gelirse stablecoin yield farming pozisyonlarimi kapatip, borcumu kismi geri odeyip bu limiti daha da asagi cekmeyi planliyorum. bakalim nasil gidecek :) hersey tepetaklak olur likidite olursam da dipten eth satmis olacagim"
