Was awarded free COMP on Coinbase.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n1ysrb/was_awarded_free_comp_on_coinbase/,duh_metrius,1,2021-05-01 01:25:57,1,/r/Compound/comments/n1ysrb/was_awarded_free_comp_on_coinbase/,Question,"Hi everybody, I’m new to the crypto space and have been having a lot of fun reading, listening, and learning over the last couple of weeks. I’ve done some small buys on some mid-tier alts and have also been dollar cost averaging with BTC and ETH. The more reading and listening I’ve been doing, the more interested and excited by Ethereum I have become. There’s a number of projects I’m keen on, but for me, right now, the Ethereum network and ETH specifically are the things I have to struggle to not spend all my time talking about. 

Last night I was tooling around on Coinbase and got $9 (USD) worth of COMP. I’m holding onto it and trying to learn more about it. I was wondering (and please remember I’m very new at this) how COMP’s performance relates to ETH’s performance as both are part of the Ethereum network. 

Are there any pieces of news and development that have you feeling bullish for COMP? I’m so new to it that I don’t know what I don’t know, so it’s hard to even start the learning process. Hope you guys don’t get a ton of posts like that and are annoyed by them. Thank you for reading!"

I'm trying to use Compound for the first time but gas seems too high to use?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n24oi4/im_trying_to_use_compound_for_the_first_time_but/,BeatenDeadHorse,1,2021-05-01 06:08:41,16,/r/Compound/comments/n24oi4/im_trying_to_use_compound_for_the_first_time_but/,Question,"Hi! I just tried to use compound. I clicked on my token that I wanted to supply, I paid the ~$5 in ETH, but then nothing happened. When I click on my token again, it still says I can supply but now the ETH fee is like $24 to complete the transaction. Why did the fee go up? What happened the first time when I paid $5, did I deposit something? Seems like I lost money for no reason, and now paying $24 up front to get 2% on $1k worth of tokens makes no sense. 

How am I supposed to use this, or does using Compound only make sense if you have like $20k in a single token to deposit? Is there any reason why I should use Compound when I have 5 different tokens with about $500 worth of each?"

I knew it would be bad, but even after interest and COMP, I'll be enjoying only .57% APY TOTAL at the cost of about $20 in gas upfront. Yikes.

So at this point do I just leave my ETH in there until gas prices come back down? Or just chalk it up to inexperience and trade back in the cETH? Can I leverage the cETH somehow? Is there any other approach I should be considering? 

I think defi really has potential, and I want to gain experience but as I've read and now know firsthand, it's a whale's game until gas prices fall. I am not fond of the idea of Binance but I suppose they have a market for just this reason. Maybe I just need to play over there?

Thanks in advance for suggestions."

As you can guess it quickly caught my eye again recently as when I originally was interested the price was in the 460 range. 

I’m currently holding a little over .5 with an avg cost of $628 and I really want to have at least one full COMP VS. a partial. I’ve heard of a rule in stocks when buying only put in half of what you plan to (possibly 1/4) and then if/when it climbs 25% (I think) put in the other half (possibly just a half and then another 1/4 later)clearly not certain on the numbers but you get it. 

I think I’m beating around my actual question which is do you think this is just a pump or could this be the new norm? Wanting to wait for a dip but by the time that comes the current price could be the dip price. Thoughts?"

In these last year I started to invest in low market cap projects, like HBAR, ONE, HOT, BTT and in the last month I started to look to ICO/IDO to try to get projects in the very start.

First of all, ICO is much more risky than investing in projects in an advanced stage. That's why I decided to invest only a small amount of my portfolio on ICO generally. Always do your own research.

Here on the website you can find all the info about the ICO: [https://merchanttoken.org/](https://merchanttoken.org/?ref=YK5XR7MZ6)

Here the reasons will i decide to invest, i tried to resume much as possible:

1 - The project is amazing! In resume, they will provide consumer protection and concepts from the tradicional card payment industry to enable credit card terminals to accept any crypto with support for smart contracts, like Ethereum, Cardano or Solana.

It solves a real problem that is common to all merchants, the chargebacks. There are very interesting concepts like Automatic Dispute Management (ADM) and Community Dispute Management (CDM) you can find more about in details on whitepepper.

2 - The team behind the project is a Sweden company (Hips) and they work with POS terminals for payments using credit card, qrcode and others already processing payments for over 200,000 merchants globally. This gives the team the perfect background for the team!

3 - As the project is registered Finansinspektionen (FI), Sweden's financial supervisory authority under the number 80658. As it’s being registered in Sweden it will also be under Sweden laws, which gives me some peace to go sleep at night.

4 - It was already announced a partnership with The Payment House, to start in november this year to provide crypto as payment method for over 30,000 taxis in UK and Scandinavia.

5 - There are only 100,000,000 tokens as the maximum supply, with a fully diluted market cap only 120 millions! If this project reaches the market cap of only 1,2 bi it will make 1000% on the investment! As comparison some projects with similar market cap would be Bakery Token, Celo, Ankr, Kucoin and others around #87 to #93."

""Phase 91, already! 🚀🚀 It's moving in insane-speed now. We can just congratulate and high-five all MTO holders. The supply and demand  is clearly not in balance and we have chosen to increase the price per MTO from phase 93 and forward.""

### Good luck competing with that, sh*tcoins and ivory tower tokens! 👊🐶

### 🔥 BREAKING NEWS: HIPS and The Payment House, a leading payment processor for taxi companies, just announced their partnership, which will enable payment with Merchant Tokens in over 20,000 taxis in Scandinavia and 10,000 taxis in the UK! 🚀

(That is more than twice the number of cabs in entire New York City or more than 30 times the average number of cabs in the next bigger city in your area! Cannot even pay 30,000 taxis with Bitcoin. And there are more announcements to come!)

#### The Merchant Token Opportunity In A Nutshell?

This brings crypto to POS terminals and consumer protection to crypto via DeFi smart contracts. 

The missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to mainstream trust and electronic payment adoption:

&gt; ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

This is **HUGE** in my opinion. This to me looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (POS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) with the potential to go parabolic and explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days. 😱

The ICO will progress for a total of 100 phases. For each phase the token price will increase by $0.01 until it reaches ~~$1.20 at the end of the ICO~~ $1.11 in phase 92. After that, the token price will increase by $0.09 for each of the last remaining 9 phases until it reaches $1.93 in phase 100 at the end of the ICO, which is scheduled to be at the end of June. 

But because of the huge demand the ICO is already in phase 95 and will probably be sold out in the next few hours or days! (see [documentation](https://docs.merchanttoken.org/docs/ico-phases) and [twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/merchant_token/status/1389136821335044096))

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Limited to 100 **million** tokens – still at only **$1.38** in one of the last ICO phases right **NOW !**

Compare this to total supplies of 1 **billion** DOT, 2 **billion** Filecoin, 45 **billion** ADA, 100 **billion** Ripple and check their current prices.

Some analysts on social media already see it at $15 and even $100 in the future.

&gt; ""The Hips Payment Group is already partnered with over 200,000 merchants and as the widespread adaptation of digital payment systems continues to infiltrate every aspect of our consumerist society, I think it's fair to say that the possibilities for the Hips Merchant Protocol and the MTO governance token within the payment services industry and fintech sectors are seemingly endless, and the use case is rock-solid.""

**And the Best Part?**

**Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet!**

We now have on-chain exchanges like Uniswap. DEXs or DEX aggregators provide on-chain price oracles. What would need to happen for Compound to move off its legacy price feed towards a truly decentralized oracle?

I see that dollar prices wouldn't be provided anymore as Ethereum has no knowledge about USD, but that wouldn't really be an issue because you can lend only ERC20 on-chain assets anyways on Compound. Prices are all relative to each other so Dollar doesn't matter."

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

So in order to test the waters and get experience in using the app, i linked the compound app to my coinbase wallet which had 8$ in ethereum. So from there under the supply asset column my $8 of ethereum shows up. But when I click on it to supply it to earn interest and move to the next step, the pop-up screen that shows up has ""no funds available"" button grayed out and I can't complete the transaction. And on that screen it shows that I have 0ETH even though I have $8 worth.

So I don't know if it has to do with my $8 not covering the gas fees or if is something else. The app doesn't give you a feedback explaining what is the problem. Does anyone know why I can't supply my $8 to the network?"

Some thoughts on how to raise token price,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n6qns4/some_thoughts_on_how_to_raise_token_price/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 12:52:19,1,/r/Compound/comments/n6qns4/some_thoughts_on_how_to_raise_token_price/,NaN,"As MSI’s price continues to plummet just as my heart, I’ve been collecting my thoughts on how to establish solid fundamentals for Missile Farm going forward in the DeFi world, so that more investors might find this project worthy of staking-and-farming, and more importantly, valuable.

What makes token price keep rising?

I summarized 3 types of logic for rising token price.

What is the rational token economy model behind token price? How can some cryptocurrencies’ price keep solid in the long run?

Vitalik once mentioned in his blog his valuation for medium-of-exchange token based on Fisher’s formula: M * V = P * T

Here:

— M is the total number of coins;
— V is the velocity of money, that is, the number of times an average token changes hands everyday;
— P is the price level, this is the price of goods and services in terms of the token, so it is actually the inverse of the currency’s price;
— T is the daily transaction volume, which is the economic value of transactions per day

To put it simply, if there are M number of tokens, each of them changes hands N times a day, then there’s a daily economic transaction scale corresponding to the value of M * N tokens. If daily transaction volume is T, then token price is T / (M * N), and the average price level P is T’s reciprocal: M * N / T.

If we simplify the analysis, let H = 1 / V, then H represents the average time span a user holds the token. Let C = 1 / P, so C represents token price.

Then M * V = P * T can be simplified as M / H = T / C or M * C = T * H

We can come to a simple conclusion, purely from a market perspective, that when other basic conditions (M and T) stay the same, the longer a token stays in user’s hands (H), the higher token price would rise.

Of course, the above is a static model. In reality, demand and trading volumes keep changing.

In fact, this is an important reason the U.S. stock market has prospered all these years. A large number of institutional investors and even individual investors in the US stock market are holding stocks for a long time. The holding time is often measured in years.

So in DeFi perspective, what could make users hodl tokens for a long time?

Now we can talk about our main topic: the logic behind rising token price.

On the high level, we all know that creating more token usage scenarios and increasing demand for tokens certainly help promote the rise of token

From a token engineering perspective, successful blockchain projects with good token economy design can be roughly divided into three categories:

The First Category is Tokens with the Mining Logic：

When the token has good fundamentals, the mining token provides a passage for rising token price：

The feedback process of token price growth：Found price of mining coins as A -&gt; price rises -&gt; more miners join -&gt; mining cost increases -&gt; mining cost rises to high level

With a good fundamentals, tokens with mining logic provides a good price support.

The feedback process of price support works like this: the price of coin falls -&gt; price falls to the mining cost -&gt; miners reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; coin price stop falling

The more miners, the more stable the system will be. With the mining cost continues to rise, coin price gets a high support and the bottom of the mining cost to rise.

In the long run, as long as the feedback loop continues to go on, Bitcoin’s price (no matter as digital gold or as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash) will have a higher and higher price support.

Of course, mining is not something that all tokens should take. In some cases, a 51% attack can wipe out the entire value of a project. Mining logic is valid only if the value of the blockchain project itself continues to grow.

The perfect thing about Bitcoin is that the more miners, the more stable the system, the more obvious the network effect of Bitcoin, and this fact itself raises the value of the Bitcoin network.

The Second Category is Tokens with Delegated Proof-of-Stake

To some extent, EOS’s supernodes are like miners, and in order to obtain mining rights, supernodes need to buy EOS tokens in the market to obtain mining rights; EOS will allocate a part of the additional issuance of EOS to these supernodes.

It is important to know that there is a capital cost to participate in the supernode election due to the lock-up of EOS tokens. Furthermore, some of the EOS tokens of supernodes are borrowed, the costs above are to some extent the mining costs. The hardware cost, operation and marketing costs can also be considered as fixed mining costs.

The feedback process of token price rise：price rises -&gt; more people join supernode election -&gt; cost for being elected as a supernode increases -&gt; cost for being elected rises from B to B1.

The feedback process of price support: token price falls -&gt; price falls to cost B1-&gt; supernodes reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; DPOS token price stop falling.

During this process, it is more ideal for the supernode election to happen in real time. Since the DPOS tokens will inevitably need to have additional issuance, the demand for DPOS coins must be increased.

The Third Category is Platform Tokens:

By platform tokens we specifically refer to tokens from trading platforms that regularly distribute profits to token users. The most successful case is BNB from Binance Exchange.

Benefits of BNB: 20% of the quarterly net profit of Binance Exchange is used for BNB buyback, and the BNB tokens which got bought back are burned.

Now sitting at over 600, BNB’s buyback-and-burn mechanism is proved to be one of the most successful method for price-pumping.

The feedback loop of token price growth is that the buyback action will directly raise token price. Some people will buy tokens because they want to arbitrage, which will push up the price. So every time buyback happens, the price will be pushed up, which in turn will push up the cost of holding these platform tokens. In fact, a buyback program with token burn is very similar to a dividend program.

Another hidden logic for platform token is that: If platform token holders can enjoy the usage of the tokens, they will be willing to hold it for a longer time, otherwise the arbitrageurs will sell soon after buying. Similarly, platform tokens are not suitable for large-scale additional issuance.

Platform tokens perfectly conform to two characteristics:

The first is that all the holders of the token are protectors and even promoters of it.

The second is that the holders of the tokens are also the users of the tokens, so people will purchase platform tokens to use them.

It is obvious that the platform token logic is only valid when the value of the blockchain project itself has growth potential. In the case that an exchange can continue to prosper, the price of the platform token will continue to rise.

The bottom line of the price support for the platform token is provided by the value of the platform itself. If the exchange users are exhausted, the platform token might still drop to zero.

To summarize：

The three models above are summarized as follows: turning speculation into investment and allowing holders of the tokens to obtain stable return.

Of course, for methods like staking and mint-and-burn to successfully decrease the liquidity of tokens and increase holding time of tokens, it requires the support of the value of the project behind the tokens so that the tokens are actually used.

Team Missile Farm is determined to create more use cases for MSI so that it is granted an intrinsic value rather than a nominal value. Furthermore, we will adopt more of the buyback-and-burn mechanism to fully incentivize the market to hodl more of MSI. Last but not least, Missile Farm will develop more features to support its core feature-the farming aggregator such that investors will find MSI more valuable holding long-term than selling for speculative returns."

How does Missile.Farm work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n6u1jq/how_does_missilefarm_work/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 16:51:31,0,/r/Compound/comments/n6u1jq/how_does_missilefarm_work/,NaN,"**We** know that many have lost money in altcoins and have high levels of skepticism about this new opportunity.

So let’s break down what Missile Farm does in language as close as possible to how the current financial world works.

1. You know what interest is:

You have $10,000 in your bank account and you earn a 12.5% annual return on your investment. After 12 months, you receive a deposit of $12,500 as an interest payment. After five years, you have $16,250.

2. You know what compound interest is:

It’s interest on interest. You get interest on the initial amount you put in, and you get interest on the interest already accumulated from the previous years.

So with compound interest, after 5 years you won’t have $16,250, you’ll actually have $18,020.

So far, so good.

***But what if there was a “third way”?***

This is the question we asked ourselves as programmers.

3. Here’s what Missile interest is:

When you take your crypto and lock it up on Missile Farm we find ways to add to the compounding of your asset. If one of the platforms we use gives away a promotional coin on top of any interest, then we take that promo coin and sell it for more of what you staked.

‌���The result is a significantly higher overall annual return.

When Missile Farm combines your 3402% annual compounding interest with the 2480% interest of another site’s promotional coin, you get 5882% APY on Missile Farm.

Missile Farm’s wBNB vault is doing just that. At the time of writing, you get 6132% APY for your BNB.

***After just 1 month, that 10,000$ would already amount to 20684.5$. How about 12 months? An astounding 613,200$! ; even with a more realistic APY, which according to our predictive model would approach to 280% in 6 months, the 5 year ROI will be around 1,721,036.8$; all in the asset you actually staked!***

So first the background:
I bought ethereum through coinbase.com's app, and was able to link coinbase wallet and get it transferred over.

Now that the eth was in coinbase wallet, I was able to link the wallet with compound, paid the gas fee to enable the protocol for supplying eth, and was able to convert my ethereum to be able to supply and start earning compound with it.

Now I'm aware I can convert the cETH through coinbase wallet, but it seems wildly more expensive than doing it through the dApp for compound. 

When I go into the dApp though, it only shows my available wallet balance as .0007 eth, when the balance of ethereum (not cETH) in my coinbase wallet is closer to .006, thus giving me errors if I try to do any action that would require a gas fee.

So number one: which balance is it referring to in compound, and how would I be able to update it to the amount of ethereum in my wallet so I can move stuff around? For the sake of argument, let's say I do have .5 ethereum in my coinbase wallet.

I might have more questions if someone can possibly answer me, or point me in the direction of how to contact compound support."

It is a platform where you can get a crypto loan for just 5% APR. We also have other cool features like unlimited loan terms, no recurrent payments, and the loans are almost instant to take (unlike Nexo, for example). In fact, it usually takes about few minutes to receive your loan. 

Right now we are just walking around Reddit, trying to see if there are people in coin communities who would be interested in loaning/borrowing specific assets. And of course trying to spread a word about the update if the coin has been added already. 

So, the question is: Would any of you guys be interested in loaning COMP against USDT/USDC?

Even though we are a relatively young project there are some reputable partners working with us already such as ChangeNOW and Guarda wallet. Also, we continuously look for more great projects to work with!

Also, we’d be grateful for literally any feedback — be it positive or negative. If you like it, let us know. If you think it looks scammy/unreliable, PLEASE let me know. Cheers!"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock"

New to compound here. Can I ask  a newbie question? Or can you guys guide me to a newbie FAQ post? Much appreciated

Is there any significant risk of using compound to earn interest? I have read many people on other sub crypto reddit have posted that they use some yield farming platform and got their eth/crypto currency transferred away (damn scammers) story and they claimed they have never given their seed phrase otherwise.

I just want to understand some basic idea of how does compound work? 

1. When I stake ADA, for example, ADA always stay in my wallet (adalite) and I don't need to give my ADA to the staking pool manager, which makes it risk free to earn stake interest.  
2. When I stake ETH with coinbase, I have to transfer my ETH from my wallet to coinbase account, which is riskier because I have to trust coinbase can handle my asset safely.

So which format does compound take? 

Thanks

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

"Stuck on mainnet testnet, cannot make any withdrawals",https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/nl4td0/stuck_on_mainnet_testnet_cannot_make_any/,ksteezy16,1,2021-05-26 09:09:21,3,/r/Compound/comments/nl4td0/stuck_on_mainnet_testnet_cannot_make_any/,Question,"Pretty new to comp but finding myself frustrated here. 
I had been able to make withdrawals of dai and chainlink without issue at first that I had supplied to comp.
 Now however, when I attempt to withdrawal these balances, my pending transaction with fee goes through without issue but the hash provided is always invalid and the transaction never actually goes through.

I noticed at the top it says mainnet testnet when I first go onto the comp app dashboard but I dont see any option anywhere to get off of mainnet testnet?

Any help greatly appreciated!!"

three websites to earn some free crypto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/nmvmfj/three_websites_to_earn_some_free_crypto/,gio9619,1,2021-05-28 19:19:08,0,/r/Compound/comments/nmvmfj/three_websites_to_earn_some_free_crypto/,NaN," Hi everyone, I would like to suggest 3 website to earn some free crypto by watching shortlinks or ptc ads, they both allow to withdraw to [expresscrypto](https://expresscrypto.io/signup?referral=248634), [faucetpay](https://faucetpay.io/?r=1219077) coinbase or directly to wallet.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock"
