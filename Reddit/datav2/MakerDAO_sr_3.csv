I was poorly positioned and was liquidated March of 2020, the entire CDP was auctioned for 0 ETH, so a complete loss.  

I will be writing off the capital loss as my CDP was opened for investment purposes and not as a personal loan. 


My problem is how do I prove this event occurred? I have a hard enough time showing all my ETH moving into that single address, let alone the creation of a CDP and the liquidation event.

Just wondering if anybody has already done this or can recommend a way to provide documentation for tax purposes.

Yeah I know DAI is growing fast but others are growing faster. Yeah I know Binance it's centralized so it's a meh, but, is hard to swallow this fact

&amp;#x200B;

Can MakerDAO perhaps considering not being so conservative in terms of scaling and growing of DAI? Looking at ETH-B, there is a huge demand, but the debt ceiling has been hit for a while now and the governance is not considering increasing it due to the worry of huge liquidation, debt risk etc. Can the worry be re-considered? We are likely in a bull market now, it is a good time to grow DAI. If ETH were to soar, people will want to leverage with ETH-B. Other platforms like Compound AAVE also has similar collateralization ratio with ETH-B, and they are doing well. 

 

On another note, there are some emergency vote to increase debt ceiling recently and have to wait 2 days for the GSM. This has really limited DAI growth in terms of speed. Since now Maker is resistant to flash loan for voting now, why not considering lowering the GSM, so that all executive votes can be executed faster?"

Hey everyone!

I am currently writing my master’s thesis about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations at the University of Innsbruck and the purpose is to develop a design framework for DAOs (complete title: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - A Design Framework and Future Research Directions). Unluckily, the scientific literature out there is still scarce, therefore I would really like to rely on a case study and/or expert interviews. Thus, I am looking for DAOs (100% community-owned) or experts (i.e., developers or founders of 100% community-owned DAOs) that are willing to contribute to my research! The data in the thesis can of course be anonymized if desired. 

I hope to gain some new insights with my research about this amazing topic!

So like the title says, I made a rookie mistake due to multi-tasking and inattention. I was transferring DAO from one wallet to my Metamask wallet and, despite me telling folks to double-check the intended address, I pasted the actual DAO Erc-20 address instead. 

Why, you may ask? Because this was my first time interacting with DAO on Metamask and when you setup DAO on your Metamask wallet, you must add it as a custom token if it doesn’t show up. This requires pasting the token’s address in the custom field. 
I knew what to expect and did this in what I  thought was the most pragmatic, tested manner: I’d sent 10 test DAO to my wallet, and I expected to not see it in Metamask, so I went and pasted the DAO token address into the custom token field, and the 10 I’d sent were visible. 

THAT was the address stored in my phone’s memory when I pasted the address to send the remaining DAO I wanted to send to Metamask. 

Is there any way to retrieve these DAO tokens or are the lost to the wind? It’s around 31.7 DAO so not a king’s fortune - just expensive enough to be a hard reminder. 

If anyone can help - here’s the etherscan block explorer link and the transaction hash:

Of course the issue with using an auction is that an attacker could overbid to make the system think the asset in question is worth more than it actually is, but this is costly and could be detected and mitigated.

If you sell some DAI at auction for ETH, you will know with certainty that the value of DAI is less than or equal to the auction price, since an attacker cannot coordinate an attack that causes the DAI to sell for less than it's worth. This will give you an upper bound of what DAI is worth relative to ETH. You can then auction off the ETH (that you just bought) for DAI. For the same reason, this will give you a lower bound of what DAI is worth relative to ETH (i.e. an upper bound of what ETH is worth relative to DAI).

After both auctions you will know, with certainty, an upper and lower bound of the ETH-DAI exchange rate. If the spread between the upper and lower bounds is small enough, you could use their average as the price.

Problem is, an attacker could overbid on one of the auctions, causing the average of the upper and lower bounds to deviate from the actual exchange rate of the asset pair. But this will also have the effect of increasing the spread between the upper and lower bound, a clear indication  that an attacker has overbid in an attempt to manipulate the price.

If the spread is too large, indicating an overbidding attack, another pair of auctions must be held--one large enough to make an attack too costly to be profitable/feasible. A larger pair of auctions would of course have costs that must be internalized by the system (in the form of DAI inflation since, under normal circumstances, less DAI will be returned than were originally auctioned off). But luckily, an overbidding attack would be profitable to the system as it will end up with more DAI than it originally auctioned off. This profit could be used to offset the cost of the larger auction (by burning some of the excess DAI that were gained in the first auction). Hopefully this larger pair of auctions will result in a spread that is acceptably small. If not, an even larger pair of auctions must be held.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible questions/concerns:

But where do you get the DAI to auction off?     Just mint it. It shouldn't be enough to actually lower the price of DAI by very much, and even if it does, buying the DAI back in the second auction should drive the price back up to where it was originally. And because the market is aware that the selling pressure of the first auction will be immediately followed an equivalent buying pressure of the second auction, the price should stay pretty stable.

But the price feed oracles provide the ETH-USD exchange rate, not the ETH-DAI exchange rate. Won't this be an issue?     I don't think it will because DAI is pegged to the USD using the savings rate and the stability fee, which are both set by MKR holders, not by the system. The price feed isn't used in setting these rates.

Wont all these auctions take a long time?     If a small pair of actions is enough to result in an acceptably small spread between the upper and lower bound, I'd imagine it would be pretty quick. But if multiple successive rounds of larger auctions is forced to occur, it could take some time. It would pretty much be a very expensive DOS attack. In the end the price would be found, but the system would be without a price feed for a little while.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, thanks for hearing me out. If the idea has already been around or there's a glaring problem with it, please let me know. If you're upset about the clickbait title and want to argue about how this is a stupid idea, I will probably entertain your criticisms. Thanks!"

* The MakerDAO community will be launching an ‘official’ DAI on Optimism L2.
* Optimism requires a 7 day lockup period when withdrawing tokens back to L1.
* The Maker protocol can reduce this lockup period and allow near-instant withdrawals of DAI.
* This solution can be expanded to cover other token withdrawals in combination with an AMM.
* Initial bridge soon. Fast withdrawals Q3/Q4 2021.

The only way I know to let people know about this is to blast messages. If this gets more downvotes than upvotes, I’ll F off.

That said, guess what…it’s tourney time!

Maker is the #12 seed in the Tether bracket. Your opponent is 5 seed Terra. This is the 2nd consecutive year that both Maker and DAI are in the tournament. DAI is a 10 seed in the BNB bracket, taking on Avalanche.

Those familiar with March Madness, or remember this from last year, will get it right away. Starting tonight at midnight, on Twitter @ UltimateCrypto7, there will be a poll for each game, open to all. The coin with more votes after 3 days will be declared the winner and move on.

Like last year, the Ultimate Crypto Tournament pits the top 64 coins (by market cap) in a single elimination tournament. Crypto is a collaborative, cooperative space with room for all, but we can still have some fun.

So, vote early, tell your friends, and may the best coin win! The games begin at midnight tonight and run until 11:59 pm PT March 18.
