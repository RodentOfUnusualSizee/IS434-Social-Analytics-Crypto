$Badger - Easiest DeFi 10x in crypto,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/l9hmmz/badger_easiest_defi_10x_in_crypto/,stardawg777,25,2021-02-01 01:54:12,55,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/l9hmmz/badger_easiest_defi_10x_in_crypto/,Low MCAP coin,"I'm going to keep this shill simple.

Badger DAO is DeFi for Bitcoin, the most liquid and valuable asset in crypto. No one has done this yet.

Currently, Badger has over $1 billion in TVL (total value locked). It's ranked #8 on [DeFiPulse](https://defipulse.com/).

Now look at all the other tokens around it. Maker, Aave, Uniswap, Compound, Synthetix, Sushi, Curve, Alpha...

Every single one is in the top 100, and most are over $1 billion marketcap. Badger, on the other hand, is around $75 million currently. Think that discrepancy is going to last long before people notice?

The other genius thing about Badger being DeFi for BTC is that every time BTC goes up, the TVL goes up. So, when BTC moons, TVL can conceivably rocket past Maker, Uniswap - you get the idea.

Badger is partnering up with Cream Finance (Iron Bank), SushiSwap, and UMA as we speak (check the proposals), and has 100%+ APY staking to make this an even easier hold.

The project has been audited by 3 professional independent parties, and has a structure called the ""war room"" that acts as a sort of DAO insurance so no rugs allowed.

They have 3-4 more revenue-generating products about to drop, including a stablecoin to compliment their $digg rebase token. 

That should be everything you need to get started looking into this."

***""Create things that do not exist in the world and become an indispensable company.""***  
**- Mitsuhiro Shima, President of Shima Seiki**

Shima Seiki is a company that manufactures the world's most advanced automatic knitting machines. Their machines can knit products used in fashion, shoes, furniture, automotive, aerospace.

They are one out of the two suppliers of 3D knitting machines (the other being Karl Mayer Stoll, which isn't publicly traded).

3D knitting is an additive manufacturing technique that enables seamless knitted structures to be automatically produced in a single pass without manual stitching. The result is a superior product with better fit and comfort. Not only does it enable on-the-fly customization and advanced designs, it allows for on-demand production which eliminates the wasteful practice of burning unused clothes.

If you are wearing some kind of knitted shoe (e.g. some variants of Nike Flyknit), or knitted clothes, you might have used a product made by Shima Seiki machines.

Their market cap is around 0.8B USD at the point of writing.

**Financials:** [https://www.reuters.com/companies/6222.T/financials/](https://www.reuters.com/companies/6222.T/financials/)

Their P/S, P/E, D/E are very healthy compared to most growth companies listed in the US.

## Pros:

1. Partnership with Uniqlo parent company (Fast Retailing co.) kicking off spring 2021. The partnership actually started earlier, but they needed time to set up the software needed for production.
2. Foray into other applications other than fashion. (Medical, Automotive, Aerospace)
3. Covid recovery and China middle class growth. (China is their largest customer).
4. Good fit into ARK's themes, despite being a Japan stock. ARK did buy Nintendo (TYO:7974) and Komatsu (TYO:6301).
5. Improvement of SAAS during Covid period, for better lock-in and moat. Ties in to ARK's thesis of faster innovation progress during times of crisis. In fact, their R&amp;D spendings has only increased during 2020.
6. Offers other machines such as CAM cutting machines.
7. Collabs with top research institutions (CMU, MIT, Disney Research).
8. Highly scalable for mass production, unlike inkjet based 3D printing. Knitted products also offer unparalleled tensile strength and durability.
9. Shima Seiki and Stoll are the duopoly in 3D knitting. They have constantly stayed at the top of the knitting machine industry for decades. Very high moat due to ecosystem lock-in, patents, and technical challenges.
10. As US markets heat up, we need to look for undiscovered opportunities elsewhere.
11. This isn't some le wild penny stock for clickbait titles like ""1000x opportunity &lt;insert Cathie face here&gt;"". It is a company that has a rich long history of rapid disruptive innovation.

## Cons:

1. Japan stock. Lack of exposure. Unlikely to be pumped.
2. Risk of patent infringement from copycats (same with other 3D printing, manufacturing tool stocks too). However, Shima Seiki has decades of experience in out-innovating the copycats and hunting them down.
3. Clear proven technology and with the ability to scale. Yes, it removes room for wild speculations that can drive the stock price crazy parabolic. 

## Comparison with Stoll, their main competitor:

* Shima has better CAD software (yarn bank, patented yarn simulation).
* Shima is able to knit up to 21G for a smoother feel. Stoll can knit up to 18G. The higher the guage number, the finer the threads.
* Shima knitting machines are able to knit double layered fabrics.
* Shima has faster and more reliable machines (due to their 4 bed design), but more expensive.
* Shima has more relevant 3D knitting patents than Stoll. ([https://patents.justia.com/assignee/shima-seiki-mfg-ltd](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/shima-seiki-mfg-ltd)) ([https://patents.justia.com/search?q=H.+Stoll+GmbH+%26+Co.+](https://patents.justia.com/search?q=H.+Stoll+GmbH+%26+Co.+))
* Shima is the choice of research institutions due to their hardware and software flexibility.

Their recurring revenue comes from their special patented needles (wear and tear), yarns, SAAS, training courses (knitting programming is a complex topic in itself).

Unlike many other additive manufacturing companies, they have a long and profitable history.

Also, they have ability to constantly spearhead disruptive innovation and mass manufacture their machines in a total addressable market worth trillions ([https://www.statista.com/topics/5091/apparel-market-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/topics/5091/apparel-market-worldwide/)).

## Themes:

* 3D additive manufacturing and robotics
* Covid recovery
* Covid aid (they manufacture seamless knitted masks)
* Asia growth
* Distruptive innovation
* Automotive
* Advanced materials
* Medicine
* Sports
* Customized fashion
* Tokyo Olympics
* AI (they use AI to speed up their simulation and provide design suggestions)
* Sustainablity (no wastage of yarn)
* ARKX (their machines can knit and cut carbon fiber, collabs with JAXA)

## Comments:

Currently, they are operating at a loss in 2019, 2020, which explains the drop in the share price.

However, there are reasons to expect a recovery:

* The spike in demand in 2017 can be seen as the industry's initial purchase of the machines for early testing.
* The decline of sales in 2019 is due to the immaturity of the industry. Users need time to test and develop software to fully integrate the machines.
* The decline in sales in 2020 is due to the pandemic.
* Despite the difficulties, they have managed to streamline their processes and increase their efficiency in 2020.

***It is very likely that this company has been completely overlooked by the market.***

As of 24 Jan 2021:

* The OTC last purchase price is many weeks back and had near zero volume (only 24 stocks traded).
* Zero comments on any forums, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, etc.

They have decent institutional investors (e.g. Vanguard), and no positions has been closed recently. Note that the nature of equipment purchase in the industry is highly intermittent and cyclical, so won't be a smooth growth curve. Customers usually purchase equipment in bulk once every few years.

They bought back shares in 2017.

Stock price wise, there is a good margin of safety. Fast Retailing (TYO:9983) has already grew way above pre-covid levels. Many other big fashion names such as Nike, Adidas have also grew above pre-covid levels. By comparison, Shima Seiki should have \~20% upside to pre-covid levels (without factoring in growth + money printing).

*Update: The price has risen a bit since I've bought shares around the 1600JPY price level. Most of the recent price action comprise of large candles which hints of institutional buying. I'm still holding. I see this company as a good 5-10x play in the coming years.*

The ultimate competitive advantage of a company in the long term is their speed of innovation, and that is part of Shima Seiki's DNA.

BAB 715% upside possibility with v2 coming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/l9ntr4/bab_715_upside_possibility_with_v2_coming/,AlterikMoonerin,7,2021-02-01 06:30:15,18,/r/AltStreetBets/comments/l9ntr4/bab_715_upside_possibility_with_v2_coming/,Fundamentals,"You may have heard of algorithmic stablecoins being the ""flavor of the month"" in December.The project that started the fad was Basis Cash (BAC), which was then forked many times. The idea is basically that these are stablecoins that hold their peg by inflating or deflating supply. When price is over $1, more BAC is printed. When price is under $1, BAC can be exchanged for BAB at a reduced price. Currently, BAC is trading at $0.35, making the price of BAB  $0.35\^2 = $0.1225. When BAC has returned to $1, these are exchangeable 1:1 for BAC. Detailed explanation here: [https://basiscash.fyi/](https://basiscash.fyi/)Now why would BAC return to $1? Am I just apeing in on a dream? You tell me.

1. BAB issuance was actually turned off until 24.01., at which point it has been reenabled. Since then about 2.1 million BAC have been burned for new BAB. Fewer BAC in circulation -&gt; price go up.
2. BAS v2. There will be a big update coming in about 1-2 weeks, which will allow BAC to change from Uniswap to Curve, which is better suited for keeping the peg.
3. BAC and BAB incentives. When v2 comes, there will be a BAC-only staking pool heavily incentivizing holding BAC until peg is restored. These incentives are currently going to BAC/DAI LPs, also rewarding holding DAI. At the same time, about 200k BAC from the project's developer fund will be distributed to staking pools over 2 weeks, 25% of that to BAB holders.
4. New partnership announcement soon (possibly tomorrow). The head of marketing at BAC, yyctrader, said today in Discord that he is finalizing a big partnership which will be announced soon together with more v2 details.Until recently I was sceptical of buying BAB, as it was a very binary gamble of either being able to redeem them at $1, or being completely worthless. But there is now a pretty liquid BAC/BAB pool on Sushiswap, allowing closing the position early if you're a pussy. When buying, check price on Sushi before exchanging BAC for BAB directly, it may be at a discount there.  
All of these factors together + the huge potential upside make BAB sound like a decent moonshot to me.  
Hit me up with your thoughts boys.  
Edit: 4. happened today. The partnership is with Pickle Finance."
Curve Finance là gì? Những thông tin cần biết về sàn này,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_nguyenlyn/comments/l9tvl0/curve_finance_là_gì_những_thông_tin_cần_biết_về/,nguyenlyn,1,2021-02-01 11:40:59,0,/r/u_nguyenlyn/comments/l9tvl0/curve_finance_là_gì_những_thông_tin_cần_biết_về/,NaN," 

Curve Finance là một đại lý phân phối phi tụ hội (DEX) chạy trên Ethereum. Nền móng được mẫu mã đặc trưng để hoán đổi giữa các stablecoin. Đầy đủ các gì bạn cần là một ví Ethereum, một số tiền và các bạn có thể hoán đổi các loại stablecoin khác nhau với phí và mức trượt giá thấp.

[Curve Finance ](https://preview.redd.it/aufkhhqnese61.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66803f5326de3380f132ba58c43e837178446081)

Có thể coi [**sàn tiền ảo tốt nhất**](https://kiemtien.com/san-tien-ao-uy-tin/) Curve là “Uniswap cho stablecoin”. Nhờ công thức định giá đặc biệt, nền tảng cũng hữu hiệu để hoán đổi giữa những phiên bản token hóa không giống nhau của một coin.

## Giới thiệu

những nhà tạo dựng thị phần tự động (AMM) đã và đang có ảnh hưởng to đến bối cảnh tiền điện tử. Các giao thức thanh khoản như Uniswap, Balancer và PancakeSwap cho phép hồ hết mọi người trở nên nhà kiến lập thị trường và kiếm được phí trên rộng rãi cặp thị trường khác nhau.

những AMM này có thể cạnh tranh với các sàn phân phối tập hợp không? Chắc hẳn. Nhưng có một tầng lớp mà họ đã cho thấy tiềm năng lớn và đó là giao dịch stablecoin. Khi mà đó, Curve Finance hiện đi đầu trong ngành này.

## Curve Finance là gì?

Curve Finance là một giao thức tạo thị trường tự động được bề ngoài để hoán đổi giữa những stablecoin với mức phí và trượt giá thấp. Ấy là công cụ tổng hợp thanh khoản phi tập kết, nơi bất kỳ ai cũng có thể thêm tài sản của mình vào 1 số pool thanh khoản không giống nhau và kiếm được phí.

Như đã biết, AMM hoạt động với thuật toán định giá thay vì sổ lệnh. Do cách thức hoạt động của công thức định giá trên Curve, nó cũng có thể hết sức có ích để hoán đổi giữa các token ở trong một phạm vi giá tương đối giống nhau.

tương tự, nền móng không chỉ được sử dụng để hoán đổi giữa những stablecoin mà còn là những phiên bản token hóa khác nhau của một coin. Vì vậy, Curve là một trong các cách tốt nhất để hoán đổi giữa các phiên bản token hóa khác nhau của Bitcoin, chẳng hạn như WBTC, renBTC và sBTC.

Tại thời điểm viết bài, có 17 pool Curve có sẵn để hoán đổi giữa rộng rãi loại tài sản và stablecoin không giống nhau. Đương nhiên, các thứ này liên tiếp thay đổi dựa trên nhu cầu thị trường và bối cảnh luôn đổi thay của DeFi. 1 Vài stablecoin phổ thông nhất hiện có là USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, TUSD, sUSD, …

ko có thông báo chính thức về hàng ngũ đứng sau Curve, nhưng hồ hết các đóng góp trên GitHub đều được CTO Michael Egorov của tổ chức máy tính và an ninh mạng NuCypher thực hiện.

## Curve Finance hoạt động như thế nào?

Như đã đề cập, tài sản được định giá theo công thức định giá thay vì sổ lệnh. Công thức mà Curve sử dụng được ngoại hình đặc biệt để giúp cho những thương lượng hoán đổi xảy ra trong một khuôn khổ gần giống nhau.

ví dụ, chúng ta biết rằng 1 USDT phải bằng 1 USDC, tương đương với 1 BUSD, … tuy thế, ví như bạn muốn chuyển đổi 100 triệu đô la USDT sang USDC, sau đó chuyển đổi nó sang BUSD, giá sẽ chênh lệch một ít. Cơ chế của Curve được ngoài mặt để giảm thiểu chênh lệch này phổ biến nhất có thể.

Một điều cần lưu ý ở đây là giả dụ chúng không ở cộng một chi phí, cơ chế của Curve sẽ ko hoạt động hoàn hảo nữa. Tuy thế, hệ thống chẳng phải tính đến điều ấy. Chung cuộc, ví như USDT có giá trị 0.7 đô la thì một cái gì ấy khác bên ngoài Curve sẽ rất sai trái. Hệ thống chẳng thể sửa chữa những thứ nằm ngoài tầm kiểm soát của nó, Chính vì thế, miễn là những token duy trì chốt của chúng, cơ chế hoạt động rất khả quan.

Điều này dẫn đến độ trượt giá hết sức thấp đối với những kích thước to. Trên thực tiễn, chênh lệch trên Curve có thể cạnh tranh một cách có ý nghĩa với một số sàn phân phối tập hợp và bàn OTC có tính thanh khoản tốt nhất.

Có phổ quát giả thiết không giống nhau về niềm tin và rủi ro, Vậy nên tính thanh khoản và thực thi không được hoàn toàn xác nhận. Nhưng chắc chắn sẽ rất thú vị lúc thấy sự cạnh tranh giữa toàn cầu tụ hội và phi tụ họp theo [**cách đầu tư tiền ảo hiệu quả**](https://kiemtien.com/cach-dau-tu-tien-ao-an-toan/) này.

## Token CRV là gì?

CRV là token quản trị của CurveDAO, một công ty tự trị phi tụ hội (DAO) đang chạy giao thức. CRV liên tiếp được cung ứng cho các dịch vụ thanh khoản của giao thức, với tỷ lệ giảm hàng năm.

diễn ra từ tháng 11/2020, mỗi đàm phán trên nền móng phải chịu phí giao dịch 0.04% trực tiếp cho những nhà cung cấp thanh khoản.

## Rủi ro của Curve Finance

Curve đã và đang được Trail of Bits kiểm toán. Vậy có tức thị nó hoàn toàn an toàn để dùng phải không? Tuyệt đối không! Rủi ro luôn đi kèm khi sử dụng bất kỳ giao kèo thông minh nào, cho dù nó được kiểm toán bao lăm đi nữa. Chỉ gửi tiền càng rộng rãi càng tốt nếu như các bạn có thể mất nó.

Như với bất kỳ giao thức AMM nào khác, bạn cũng cần tính đến thiệt hại nhất thời. Nói ngắn gọn, thiệt hại tạm thời là tổn thất về trị giá đồng đô la Mỹ mà những nhà sản xuất thanh khoản có thể phải chịu khi mà cung cấp tính thanh khoản cho một AMM.

Một điều ít người nào biết tới là pool thanh khoản cũng có thể được sản xuất cho Compound hoặc yearn.finance để tạo thêm thu nhập cho các dịch vụ thanh khoản. Bên cạnh đó, nhờ sự kỳ diệu của khả năng phối hợp, không chỉ các bạn có thể thương lượng trên Curve mà còn cả các giao kèo thông minh khác. Điều này dẫn tới rủi ro khác, vì phổ quát giao thức DeFi này trở nên phụ thuộc vào nhau. Nếu như một trong số chúng bị hỏng, chúng ta có thể thấy hiệu ứng dây chuyền có hại trên phần nhiều hệ sinh thái DeFi.

## Swerve Finance

như vậy như SushiSwap và Uniswap, Curve Finance cũng có hard fork tương đối nổi tiếng: Swerve Finance.

Swerve tự lăng xê là “khởi chạy công bằng”, nghĩa là không có phân bổ token quản trị (SWRV) cho đội ngũ hoặc người sáng lập. Những token SWRV được cung ứng trong sự kiện khai thác thanh khoản, nơi mọi người đều có cơ hội canh tác như nhau. Tương tự, Swerve tuyên bố là một fork của Curve do cùng đồng sở hữu và điều hành 100%."

TRQ the most valuable copper miner and why is trades at a fraction of book value,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/l9y9i9/trq_the_most_valuable_copper_miner_and_why_is/,autistcopperbull,10,2021-02-01 16:11:34,19,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/l9y9i9/trq_the_most_valuable_copper_miner_and_why_is/,NaN,"Turquiose hill resources a already profitable leveraged copper miner is one of the most valuable copper miners on the planet plagued with uncertainty, government, corporate, and media interference.

The stock currently trades around .2 book value.  The most recent Q3 2020 earnings was GAAP EPS of $0.64 and the stock is trading around $11. Meanwhile FCX one of the largest copper miners posted a Q4 2020 GAAP EPS of $0.48 and trades around $28. This means TRQ is trading at a 300% discount relative to earnings and Q3 copper prices were much lower than Q4.

A quick look at TRQ stock price has indicated it has been on a 10 year downtrend.  The company is a single asset copper miner located in Mongolia which has a decent production on its open pit mine and is developing Oyu Tolgoi, an expansive very deep underground mine the size of Manhattan that will start sustainable production on October 2022 and eventually make it the 3rd/4th largest lowest cost producer copper mine on the planet when ramped up over the following years.

So why has the performance of the stock been in the dumps even when copper and gold are near all time highs? There are a couple of factors making the stock trade at just 20% of book value. 

1. Government of Mongolia (GoM) and its constant trashing of the the Oyu Tolgoi.  GoM made a deal to have 33.3% equity stake in the mine but didn’t have money so they borrowed it. The mine is one of largest inflow of foreign direct investment ever negotiated and in the last decade loss out on the bet as copper and gold were in a bear market.  The expansion of the underground mine also significantly expensive and over budgeted have given ammo to the fire of trashing all the international agreements that they want to negotiate.  Every other year there are presidential or parliamentary elections and they trash the investment putting constant pressure on the TRQ stock. Currently a presidential election is taking place in June 2021 and the debate on Mongolians getting ripped off has heated up with politicians and citizens feel like they are being cheated. They compare their asset to the great riches of Saudi princes, which is not a fair comparison as oil has been in decades long Bull market

2. Sometime in the early decade Rio Tinto was able to purchase the majority of TRQ shares to get a controlling interest in the company but decided not to pay a premium on the rest of the company.  RIO became the project manager for the Oyu Tolgoi mine. Meanwhile TRQ was systematically turned into a shell company of RIO by removing all former employees and replacing the board with hand picked Ex-RIO executives. RIO had no interest in defending the stock when GoM tensions flared up as this decreased  the value of TRQ and had no interest in negotiating with GoM as this benefitted their end goal of getting TRQ for free. Analyst several years ago thought that TRQ would be bought out by RIO to increase their copper and diversify away from Iron Ore revenues.  In July 2019 it was announce that there was a funding shortfall of 1.9 B and a 30 month delay.  This caused the stock to trash amazingly which has not yet recovered.  As momentum started building in September 2020 RIO revealed their end goal of acquiring TRQ, by attempting to limit the amount of debt TRQ could issue as well as request for the funding gap to be covered by a share offering which RIO would backstop. TRQ already had an ability under the agreements issue up to an additional 1.6 B debt but RIO was seeking to limit it to 500 M. 

3. Due to the delay in the launch of the mine by 22 months and the funding gap the stock faces liquidity risk uncertainty. RIO manufactured a crisis by trying to limit debt that TRQ could raise. This caused TRQ to see RIO as an existential threat and they have since launched financing arbitration in Canada which is friendly to minority shareholders. TRQ had announce today that RIO was trying to pre empt the financing arbitration decision by trying to pursue financing options that would limit TRQ’s ability to finance their preferred options. TRQ had filed an injunction to stop RIO.

4. Financial Times has taken the side of the TRQ short seller Odey and has multiple times crashed the stock through unethical journalism.  Odey even in 2020 was able to feed a nonsense open letter article that triggered a 10% crash.

GoM a democracy due to their free speech and Oyu Tolgoi bashing has created downward pressure on the stock.  Most of the speech is rubbish but money is scared especially when dealing with an untested emerging market.  This has caused Oyu Tolgoi to be the only major investment in Mongolia and it already accounts for 1/3rd of their economy.  They seek to change the international iron clad agreements, which due to RIOs new management might receive some concessions.

RIO a hostile controlling shareholder has successfully through years of TRQ pain caused investors to discount the stock at just .2 of book value despite gold and copper near all time highs. They had Temasak Singapore sovereign wealth fund liquidate and take considerable losses over a billion dollars. 
They had Sailingstone which went all in TRQ turn a 5B hedge fund to a 250 M hedge fund. In my opinion RIO has done just as much damage as GoM.

The history of TRQ is important as to the context of why the stock is trading at such a depressed value.   Going forward as the underground mine nears completion the facts are:

1. TRQ is extremely profitable at these commodity prices.  The amounts are projected to be able to fund the remaining capital investments and still be cash flow positive.

2. TRQ date of which cash will be depleted keeps getting pushed back as commodity prices remain strong currently their estimate is Q2 2022. RIOs plan to get TRQ shares for free are almost certain to fail. Financing Arbitration should de-risk liquidity. Once this happens the price will increase multiple folds and the RIO buyout may become an option. 

3. TRQ has broken pact with RIO and has taken GoM side and voted for an independent investigation on the cost overrun and disagreed with RIO criteria to be met by GoM in order to continue key milestones of underground mining development.

4. TRQ will soon benefit from a decade long continued copper growth production at the lowest cost curve quartile. At current commodity prices the mines NPV discounted at 8% is 15B as quoted from last years OTTR report which is available on their website.

Despite the massive upcoming copper growth of TRQ and the huge discount the stock is trading at investors are trigger happy and sell when any type of news hits the stock.  The stock may be a roller coaster for the next few months but the trend is clear, the underground mine is almost complete, copper and gold continue to be near all time highs and TRQ is extremely profitable and well run mine with lowest injury rate and a 90% plus Mongolian workforce. To get to book value the stock will rise 4x and most stocks of this size trade at multiples of book value.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to offer an alternative point of view. I also grew up in Amman/Aqaba, and moved abroad some years ago. I got to experience life home and abroad, and I feel that I should offer my perspective for balance.

I have many fond memories of Jordan and feel that the Jordanian people are generally kind and welcoming. However, like any other place, it has its problems. Here are some of the things where I feel Jordan could be better, making it more lucrative for residents to remain and for expatriates to return.

Those points are not in any particular order.

# Women’s Rights

Women’s rights in Jordan are an absolute joke. While the country \*\*is\*\* progressive compared to neighbouring nations, many women still live in fear of violence and persecution. They are not treated as equals.

Women’s protections in the law are limited by how the law is interpreted and applied in courts and police stations which are hugely influenced by cultural norms.

*“Your husband beat you up? There must be a good reason!”*

*“Your brother wants to kill her? She must’ve done something abhorrent!”*

&amp;#x200B;

# Was6at (Nepotism)

If you’re not some big 💩, their son, cousin or nephew, good luck. You will have to fight harder just to get by. To get your kids into a good school, to get the finance deal you need, to get bailed out of a legal situation etc.

*I feel that this is probably a huge contributing factor into corruption.*

In my view, Nepotism is a disease, and it needs to be eradicated. Everyone should have a fair and equal opportunity at improving their lives.

&amp;#x200B;

# Homophobia and absence of sexual freedoms

Y’all repressed. I can’t stress this enough.

People should be free to do as they wish with their lives/bodies, and it’s none of your business, as long as it’s between consenting adults.

LGBT rights are currently hilariously absent in Jordan. Contraception is taboo. Pregnancy out of wedlock is a terrifying ordeal. Sex toys are banned.

All of those things need to be rectified before Jordan can be seen as a place where personal freedoms are protected. Frankly I don't understand why some folks care so deeply about who is masturbating and who is sleeping with whom.

&amp;#x200B;

# Mistreatment of Palestinians, Iraqis and Syrians etc

I’m “Palestinian”. Let me be clear: I’ve never been to Palestine. I was born in Jordan and I grew up with Mansaf in my veins.

Yet, whenever I speak to ""proper"" Jordanians, I find myself being cornered into identifying as Palestinian, because we’re second class citizens. We have to prove our right to exist, and we have to be OK with any verbal/physical abuse hurled at us by disgruntled folk. I've had some really shitty experiences in Motaba3a o Tafteesh and I'm sure others have too.

We also have very limited representation in Parliament, in policing roles, and in public sector roles, despite making up a large proportion of the country's residents.

The treatment of my Iraqi/Syrian friends is enormously worse, as they are often not only subject to abuse but they also usually have no legal recourse.

&amp;#x200B;

# Rampant Racism

Related to the point above. The racism and xenophobia is \*not\* limited to Palestinians or Iraqis. It also encompasses anyone who might look ‘different’ in any way. Black people, Egyptian workers, foreign nationals… I’ve seen people get beat up, called horrible things and generally deprived of their rights just because of their identity or physical traits.

I appreciate that this is a problem throughout the Middle East, but we’re supposed to be championing progression, compassion and understanding. The current status quo is not good enough. We can \[and should\] do better.

# Limited wages vs increasing living costs

I have at times considered going back and setting up back in Jordan, but it’s simply unfavourable given the imbalance between salaries and living costs.

# Expensive imports and living at the mercy of Jamarek

Cars and electrical goods in particular suffer horrendous import taxation, making it extremely unlikely for the average Joe to access good quality goods.

I also regularly lurk on this Subreddit and observe how hard it is for folks to get their hands on imported goods, because of the fear of Jamarek confiscation and excessive fines.

# Terrible infrastructure, Roads, Cars

Due to chronic under-investment, and years of decay, public transport in Jordan is frankly terrifying and is a good 40-60 years behind where it should be.

Admittedly, the quality of roads \*is\* improving, slowly, but there has to be a rapid acceleration in adopting good policy that prevents infrastructure decay and improves public transport links.

Y’all are aggressive drivers as well, and that makes it unsafe for everyone else who wants to use the road, such as pedestrians and cyclists. I appreciate that this seems trivial, but good infrastructure and logistical options lead to better social mobility.

# Religion, everywhere

While Jordan is more liberal than most Arab nations, and generally is a country that I consider ‘stable’ in relative terms, it is still hugely influenced and governed by religious figures and beliefs.

Atheists and agnostic individuals are constantly under the threat of discovery and social alienation, or in some cases violence.

You are expected to participate in Islamic practices whether or not you’re on board with them, to minimise the risk of a confrontation with some Sheikh or a Brotherhood member. This should be deeply concerning for muslims and non-muslims alike.

&amp;#x200B;

# The legal system is driven by cultural norms, not by constitution and law.

Protections are afforded to those that fit the curve, and not necessarily those that are entitled to it.

For example, in cases of divorce, or violence against women, the courts/police will typically take the side of whichever party that is less likely to cause a fuss.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I will end this post on a positive note:

Jordan is not an inherently bad place. It is full of good, kind hearted people and has much to offer. The issues above are what is holding Jordan back from being a first-class nation that protects its all its workers and residents and citizens alike.

&amp;#x200B;

**I hope to see a better Jordan in my lifetime.**

&amp;#x200B;

Take care, friends."

Any advice or resources for someone who is new to financial planning would be greatly appreciated. I do have a few specific questions:

- I cannot contribute to my 401K until I am 6mo in, it sounds like my best option would be to open a Roth IRA? 

- I am looking to open a credit card and take advantage of a great introductory deal (ie cashback for spending a certain amount in x amount of time). Any suggestions what my best bet would be? What qualities should I be looking for in a cc? My credit score is 769.

- I have no debt, have an emergency fund, and am living well below my means. Should I be looking into investing? Where do I start with that?

I would like someone or a community to talk/vent to about my situation in life, and ask and understand what their opinion is, and what I should do to be the best person I can be. I have what many may consider to be a very interesting, and at times unbelievable life in both the best and worst sense. I’m incredibly grateful for what I have, though the curse with the blessing is the fear and reality I have of losing it all. 

Not sure where to start, though I guess my childhood is a good place. I am a dual citizen of Peru, born in Florida, and raised in the deep south panhandle. My father has always been a figure I look up to, though he was very often gone on business trips which I did not understand well at the time, and I started at a young age to develop a sense of independence as well. A lot changed when I was 9 years old, he was arrested, along with my uncle, accused of being part of an international drug cartel. He was accused as well because he was the older brother of my uncle, who headed the organization, though we had absolutely no ties to his shenanigans. My father proved his innocence in Holland, served 9 months solitary confinement in Germany before being released innocent, and 2 years in Peruvian prison before winning the fight to prove his innocence. As collateral damage of this, I remember the SWAT team kicking in my door, waking up to masks and rifles in my face. I distinctly remember the feeling of essentially being deemed an enemy of the state. A few more times FBI or DEA or whoever came to our door to bother us, though eventually they told us we were essentially OK. During these years of my life, I recall reading the letters I received from my father in prison, and knowing that they had been already read, surveilled, and photocopied before I read them. 

This caused some trauma to me, though eventually I entered high school. I took mushrooms at 15 as I was involved in some unsavory influences, though it impacted my little mind so deeply that I made some drastic changes to my life that I could not have predicted. I dropped out of high school and enrolled in a local college dual enrollment program, where only took college courses and had my AA degree paid for. I saw this as the best thing I could do, as I wasn’t satisfied with my curriculum, and could learn at double the speed since one year class at high school is one semester at college. By this point, my personality started to develop into a workaholic state, where nothing was ever enough, failure was not an option, and I constantly had to set higher and higher goals to achieve. I was exposed to ADHD meds at a young age here, which abuse was so prevalent it was difficult to avoid. I started abusing these at 15-16 to increase my productivity and learning. I was incredibly good at performing academically throughout this time, and spent most of my days chatting with professors after hours, spending time in the math and science labs, engaging in extracurricular activities, etc. My abilities have always been geared towards science and speaking. I was a competing member of speech and debate, senator in student government, and vice president of the political club. When I took Anatomy 1 &amp; 2, the older students became so frustrated that I was consistently breaking the curve and causing them to lose points, that the professor eventually made his own test just for me. I moved into studying the beginnings of finance and economics, at least what was available, and thoroughly enjoying those. However, I was terrible at mathematics, having to take pre-algebra twice, and struggling through trigonometry. Enough about school. I ended up with a decent GPA and graduated with my AA degree at 17 years old, and 88 credits. 

From around the time of 16-17 my father was back and in my life, and I previously grew up in a very dark period with my mother and siblings while he was gone and we had little money. He had no money either, but was just happy to be back with his family, and ready to provide again. He took me to the jungle of Peru to start a fresh produce supply to the US market, and I began shadowing and traveling with him everywhere. We had very little money but he had experience, and we found the cheapest tickets and did everything we could do to go outside the country to find the work he was best at - food and agriculture supply. I remember getting laughed at when we were at trade shows trying to find people to work with. We eventually landed a windfall by getting credit on a large amount of product for a beverage company, which began our (his) project in the jungle, which would eventually turn into this giant factory exporting 4-6000 tons per year. Of course this didn’t happen overnight, but I continued to travel with him all over the world. Business got better and better, and eventually economy tickets turned into first class. Though, this was only during summer times when I wasn’t taking classes, or if I was, I would have to work hard to ensure I didn’t miss exams and slack. 

I had a bad breakup my senior year of highschool/college, and I went into a large university my freshman year very angry. I was a wreck of a person in general, reckless drug use, sex addict, but somehow still passing my classes. Eventually I calmed down, and ended up focusing on business and agriculture studies, while I continued to travel with my father. I graduated at 20 with my bachelors degree and immediately went into work. All of the things I learned in college were not nearly as applicable in real life as I expected, and I had to learn the way of the business I’ve been groomed for. Also, I should mention that my entire life, the spotlight has been on me from my parents and extended family as the “star child” and the one to perform and really deliver on their expectations of success. I was having a tough time learning the business because it required a lot of patience and understanding relationships with ongoing clients, and had large repercussions if you didn’t know what you were doing. So I felt useless, and started abusing morphine. This one was really bad in particular, I had never been addicted to an opiate, only cocaine and amphetamines. It was my lowest point in life for 6-8 months in which I finally got clean (21yrs old). 

By 22 I really started to learn more about what I was doing and started to love my job, I moved out of a rental household with two girls that were very toxic, and finally got my own apartment. I still had drug issues on and off - kratom, adderall, xanax, but I was functional and not dependent. Now, I am 23, I have a 300k mortgage to pay on a house, and I have responsibilities out the wazoo and do multiple jobs within the company. I use adderall and sometimes xanax after to perform at work when I feel necessary, and it really messes with my mood outside of it, though it really does make me as productive as I want to be. I have a loving girlfriend who supports me, though sometimes I have difficulty showing emotion because I get so caught up with goal orientation. 

My worries:
I help my father run this company though I feel like I won’t be able to run it without him. I’m worried that our project in the jungle is so remote and hard to manage that it won’t function in the future, and I will slowly lose everything I worked to build with him for my family.
I have so many projects to handle that I’m not physically capable of handling, though also I am a workaholic that constantly stresses about it. At this moment I am really worried we have bitten off more than we can chew, and covid has not allowed me to travel to go fix issues myself, or tend to other things in person. I’ve got a lot of things I need to learn/do that nobody else is doing - learning trucking and logistics, marketing our company, developing new products and new customer bases, food safety certifications, following up on projects and investments.
I am also worried that eventually, my functional abuse of stimulants will cause more damage than it already has, and render me unable to do my job or be an entrepreneur in the future. I am worried that I won’t be able to perform to everyones expectations and standards, as the one to “take the throne” after my father. I know I’m not prepared to and I worry about all the things that could happen if he were to pass away. I am worried that we won’t be able to bring in enough revenue to cover huge overhead expenses, and start to go under and accumulate debt. I’m worried that I will slowly decay from the potential I always thought I could be and live up to, only to slowly lose my house and not be able to support my girlfriend and family. I’m worried that my parents have always been gamblers that never set up any sort of retirement, plan B, or any way to solidify their stability. It feels like something bad is going to happen to me, and I will be the caricature of Icarus. Thanks for reading my story if you got this far."

Token Bonding Curves + Liquidity Providing + Std Governance Module = Decentralized and Democratic On-Chain Hedge Fund,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lbcedd/token_bonding_curves_liquidity_providing_std/,superarius,4,2021-02-03 09:41:10,19,/r/ethereum/comments/lbcedd/token_bonding_curves_liquidity_providing_std/,NaN,"Hey there Ethereum Community!  


I'm a cryptographer and Solidity developer and I love hacking around with DeFi and doing different smart contract projects in my spare time. I was inspired by all this commotion over the stonk market recently and it gave me some ideas that I tried to apply into some smart contracts. Basically when Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted:  


\`\`\`r/wallstreetbets is now the largest hedge fund in the world.   Excepts it’s completely decentralized and entirely democratic.\`\`\`  


I felt challenged to create the real thing: a truly decentralized and community managed Hedge Fund DAO on the ethereum blockchain. If you want to jump right to the code, you can check it out here: [https://github.com/superarius/pooled-compound-lp](https://github.com/superarius/pooled-compound-lp)  


None of the ideas here are original at all, it's really just taking a bunch of existing ideas and mashing them all together, and probably it's covering tracks that have already been covered. However I'm not sure that we've seen DeFi in exactly this flavor before so I want to present it to the community for some feedback:  


To cover the model I was going for really briefly:   


Token Bonding Curves / Continuous Tokens: Everything centers around a Continuous Token bonded to a specified asset on some specified Bonding Curve. Basically anyone can mint and burn the Gov token, but the price is a direct function of the current circulating supply. If a lot of tokens have been minted when you send a transaction to mint tokens you'll get a smaller allocation of the Gov token for e.g. 1 DAI or e.g. 1 ETH than you would if you mint the token at some other time when the circulating supply is less. The price and supply are eternally fixed in this relationship and there is guaranteed liquidity from the Gov token into the collateral token, though the amount of collateral received and profit/loss made depends on how the supply differs from when you mint and when you burn the tokens. To put it simply the bonding curve makes it so that early money gets a discount. It also creates a primary market with automatic price discovery for the token and the collateral asset. Setting a ""Reserve Ratio"" or ""Connector Weight"" of 0 on the bonding curve essentially bonds the curve 1:1 with the collateral asset at a fixed price. (This could be a nice and fair model as well, i.e. if the collateral is a stablecoin every dollar invested gets the same participation in DAO governance and rewards as any other). Ok thats Token Bonding Curves, briefly.  


Lending to Compound: Here's where it gets a bit more interesting. In standard Token Bonding Curve the collateral just sits there in the contract (it is ""collateral"" after all). However in our case the (let's say DAI though it works just as well for any other Compound Finance asset) collateral is immediately lent to Compound and the contract holds cDai while tracking the amount of DAI collateral it has received from token holders. This way we can have the standard economics of a Token Bonding Curve but also generate interest. That interest could be divided among token holders or governed over arbitrarily by them. There is also COMP accruing just for providing liquidity which can also be governed over by the community. This is particularly interesting because you basically create like a ""Province"" inside the Compound Finance ""Country"" and that province has it's own process for deciding where it will allocate the COMP votes, something vaguely similar to the Electoral College. Finally there is the OPTION (though I showcase both ways) to allow Hedging Bets on the deposited collateral. Now this creates risks of losses and insolvency (like Melvin Capital is having :)) but also shows the potential possibilities of the idea. The community can control the Bonded Token contract (which is the contract actually lending all the collateral to compound) and could be permitted to do Borrowing off of the asset which is already being lent to Compound. In this way the community could in theory short and long different compound markets all through smart contracts and governance voting on proposals for price points to sell at and targets to hit etc. They could act as a full fledged crypto hedge fund.  


Governance Module: I basically just forked uniswap governance (which was already a fork of Compound's governance). By making the governance module the ""Owner"" of the Bonded Token contract you get the properties described above which makes it possible to collectively control the community position in the compound markets.  


Now this is only a sketch and there are a number of possible concerns and potential flaws or security risks in the idea. And of course a number of parameters to tweak and play with (the shape of the curve, the quorums needed for governance actions etc. etc.). There's also the very important questions of privacy and speed which are both difficult to achieve with DAO governance and quite important when it comes to trading (it needs to be able to avoid gross manipulation since investment actions are publicly scheduled). And finally there are legal risks which I'm pretty interested in (or I would have already thrown something up on mainnet). I'm not trying to do anything illegal, but I'm also this isn't some scam, I'm hoping to start some community driven fully decentralized little experiment and see if it works or grows. Let me know your thoughts all."

Making the Job Transition and Income Jump / (Decline)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/lbyl2o/making_the_job_transition_and_income_jump_decline/,TriAlphs,10,2021-02-04 05:18:38,11,/r/fatFIRE/comments/lbyl2o/making_the_job_transition_and_income_jump_decline/,NaN,"I’ve been on a lurker on the subreddit for a bit of time and I was hoping to get some responses / advice from those we came from an investment banking, consulting, or other finance-like background and transitioned into a FAANG role or perhaps something similar / startup.

A little bit of background about myself, 28m and married in a HCOL. I went directly into equity research after college and after two years realized it was too mundane / repetitive for me. I transitioned into a relatively larger firm specializing in niche consulting, which I’ve been at for 3 years now (comp history below).

**Comp:**

Year 1: $90K ER

Year 2: $98K ER

Year 3: $110K consulting (only billed like 8 months)

Year 4: $200K consulting (promoted)

Year 5: $381K consulting (promoted)

Year 6: $440K (estimated) consulting

The problem is the comp is great but largely dependent also on your billable hours (eat what you kill type of setup). Also, I’ve reached the point where my learning curve has started to flatten and any additional time spent here will predominately improve my niche knowledge. I have no desire to reach managing director level (6-8 years away?) as the hours are still brutal (currently 60-100 is the norm) and pre-COVID we would travel 4-5 days a week. I’m also getting sick of the 11pm calls, weekend fire drills, and some parts of the work in general. My health has plummeted at this job. To be clear, I have no issues working hard but it's more rewarding when I feel vested in it?

If I’m going to make a transition, I feel like it’s something I should do relatively soon. To further add, my wife is planning to going back to school for 3 years and will come out making \~$160-240K in the medical profession. As a result, we’ll lose most of her income of \~$60K temporarily for those three years (she’ll continue working PT)

**On to the ask:** Typically, individuals coming from one of those backgrounds are leaving a high-paying, high-stress, high-hours type of job. Were your motives to transition, financial or work/life balance driven? How long did it take for you to climb back / exceed your previous comp?

Were you able to transition into a non-finance role directly or did you do that internally once you were already in? How were you able to make that jump? I would like to do something non-finance related or in conjunction with finance not 100% sure what though, maybe data analytics?

Any other insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks all.

DeFi on the Rise Again. A Bubble Carnival or A Value Discovery?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/lccrj5/defi_on_the_rise_again_a_bubble_carnival_or_a/,CoinEx_Institution,14,2021-02-04 18:19:45,8,/r/defi/comments/lccrj5/defi_on_the_rise_again_a_bubble_carnival_or_a/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

1. Driven by U.S. stocks and giants, DEX has seen an upsurge

The past 2020 was full of turmoil and chaos, and for the blockchain industry, it is also a year full of ups and downs and a year heralding a bright future after painful reflections on the development direction. In 2020, some turned blind to risks and suffered heavy losses, while some broadened their horizons and saw their pockets swell. In any case, the market has been invigorated in the end. The most eye-catching in the bull market is, apart from BTC and ETH, the decentralized finance, or DeFi, as you may hear of it more or less. 

Not long after January 2021, BTC has entered an adjustment period, and ETH is poised for take-off. Instead of flooding into the stagnating mainstream coins, the hot money in the market has once again rushed into the DeFi sector. At the same time, in the raging GME incident in the US stock market, RobinHood directly forced the sale of retail stocks, which undoubtedly promoted the DEX in DeFi. Many of the world giants have stood by Bitcoin, and even praised DeFi. In this context, UNI, SUSHI and INCH have skyrocketed, and the leader UNI is about to enter the top 10 of CMC.

&amp;#x200B;

2. How to look at DeFi? Is it a bubble carnival or a value discovery?

So, for those who cleared UNI airdrops, sold Sushi when it hit the bottom, and hesitated to invest in DeFi yet eventually suffered losses from it, how to look at DeFi?

To answer that question, we must be clear about a simple truth: everyone in the market cannot earn money beyond their knowledge. To be specific, if you have more knowledge than others in BTC and ETH, you are more likely to buy tokens at the bottom and earn money. In that case, you profit from your knowledge. On the contrary, how can an uninformed investor be benefited from DeFi? So, a bubble or a value discovery, the answer depends on your knowledge about it.

&amp;#x200B;

3. What’s the origin of DeFi and where lies its future?

Origin:

Many believe that BTC, which was born in 2009, is the earliest DeFi. BTC was originally designed as a decentralized Internet native asset, a hedge against inflation, and a means of payment, though nowadays BTC is increasingly recognized as digital gold.

Development:

However, for stability and security, BTC only allows limited programming. As a last resort, ETH was split from BTC in 2015, providing new possibilities for the crypto world to move toward decentralized finance through smart contracts.

Evolution:

In 2017, thanks to the infrastructure provided by ETH and the impact of the BTC halving cycle, the crypto world witnessed bubble bursts: all kinds of exaggerated concepts involving e-commerce, SNS, medicine, big data, and artificial intelligence + blockchain kept emerging and falling into decay. Shitcoins could never survive the test of time. Only a few projects represented by Maker, KNC, and ZRX have finally survived and maintained business growth. Why? Because they are the first DeFi projects that keep exploring the stablecoin and DEX along the right track of the crypto world.

In 2018, people felt excited about yield farming before the bear market, but few knew the initial version of Uniswap, which follows the concept of the liquidity pool, had been set up and iterated, a potential hit amid the DeFi boom in the summer of 2020. 

In 2019, Havven, which was originally a stablecoin, finally found a new world of synthetic derivatives after struggling on the original track. Possibly inspired by the prosperity of the public chain Staking in 2019, the team modified the economic model, so that users can gain incentives for staking the native token SNX. That was the earliest DeFi yield farming, and also contributed its share to the DeFi boom that summer. 

In 2020, the quiet accumulation period was over, and as everything was ready, and it was time for DeFi to emerge and evolve rapidly:

At the beginning of 2020, Ethlend in the segment of lending transformed into AAVE and applied the loan pool concept to reform its business model. It also promoted DyDx's lightning loan function and thus gained market attention.

In April and May 2020, UMA made its debut on Uniswap. It has drawn widespread attention for a sixfold increase in a short period of time. After that, the huge increase in long-tail tokens such as HEX, XIO, ESH, and XOR has brought about the Fomo effect. That was when Uniswap was officially unveiled and achieved a cold start without issuing tokens. Liquidity pools under the X\*Y=K algorithm became famous overnight. However, at that time, these long-tail assets were not large in scale and did not have greater influence, which was nicknamed “the gathering place of small projects”. 

June 2020 witnessed a milestone event that officially brought DeFi to the center of the stage: COMP started loan mining, and users can obtain COMP governance tokens by borrowing on Compound. COMP rose tenfold on Uniswap, and later launched Coinbase, which surprised those victims from the March 12 incident. At the time, few realized that the seeds planted in 2018 or 2019 had finally germinated, and the era of DeFi yield farming had just begun.

In July 2020, YFI helped people automatically switch assets on the AAVE and COMP lending platforms based on interest rates to obtain higher returns. It distributed all tokens fairly through a liquidity pool. Without tokens for investors or those reserved for the team, it has created a new fair distribution model similar to POW, which has brought considerable returns to participants based on innovative products. Many people accustomed to mining, withdrawing, and selling at COMP later felt a pang of regret.

At the same time, the market price of AMPL, in the Rebase concept, soared to hundreds of millions of dollars amid the DeFi boom, claiming to make all investors, both informed and uninformed, rake a lot of money. Many became rich within only one month. 

In August 2020, Curve, Uniswap's improved stablecoin exchange platform, officially issued coins. Driven by its extremely high daily token output and market enthusiasm, Curve has become a hot destination of mining. Stablecoins with an annualized income of nearly 100% can be seen everywhere, which was a miracle for the traditional financial industry. Then YFI cooperated with Curve to create smart mining, a model to capture CRV output. With this innovative function, YFI has sent its price skyrocketing from several thousand dollars to above $40,000, even more expensive than BTC then. Its developer AC has been pushed to the shrine, and the concept of financial aggregator has been deeply rooted in the public. Copycat projects starting with the letter Y emerged one after another. 

The reason why AMPL is mentioned here is that, stimulated by the great success of YFI, there was a market trend to distribute tokens fairly by the community. AMPL, which boasts an eye-catching team and investors, also achieved great success last month, but a large part of its tokens was distributed as a result. Therefore, a project called YAM was initiated by the community, aiming to replicate its success by forking AMPL in a fair distribution method by the community. But at present, it seems that YAM’s biggest contribution is to create Pool 1 and Pool 2 for DeFi yield farming. Pool 1 is a staking pool for lossless mining and fair distribution, while Pool 2 needs to mortgage tokens in Pool 1 to provide liquidity for LP Tokens in DEX, which is riskier but more rewarding; however, DeFi undoubtedly comes with huge risks. The Rebase Bug almost ruined YAM. Despite its effort to struggle and develop, such a big mistake was really regrettable at that time.

As YAM fell, another DeFi named Sushi rose. Thanks to the exquisite front-end developed by the Yam team and the contract provided by Comp, ambitious Sushi quickly iterated to replace Uniswap that was in its heyday at that time, continuing YAM’s aspiration to squeeze out AMPL. The story of Sushi seems like a big drama, and it succeeds for two reasons: first, it attracted liquidity providers from Uniswap as the latter did not issue tokens, thus gaining influence; second, after a rally, it vigorously reached cooperation on building the ecosystem and updated its product to gain market share. 

In September 2020, Uniswap issued UNI as an urgent response to Sushi, and, as everyone knows, it airdropped 400 UNI to every wallet that has any operation. That symbolized the start of the fiercest competition in DeFi. Following DeFi miners and Three Arrows Capital, retail investors, who once ignored and were confused about and indifferent to DeFi, now all rush to buy Sushi, Pearl, and tokens whose name start with Y. The potential bull has gone, and everyone comes to one side of the boat, making it capsize.

In October 2020, DeFi entered a bear market, and numerous investors suffered 70% or even 80% losses. 

However, contrary to the general belief, DeFi did not go down like the model currency in 2019. During the short bear market, there were many interesting and innovative events in segments such as insurance, options, fixed income, algorithmic stablecoins, and leveraged mining. As you know, DeFi soon resumed from the bear market in November, and adjusted itself in fluctuations the next month. After BTC and ETH completed their trends, DeFi has once again embraced a bull market and seen a surge this January, accompanied by the GME incident in the US stock market and the recognition from giants. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. How to look at DeFi? 

After reviewing the history of DeFi, we may have such a scene in our mind:

The blockchain world used to be a nihilistic Utopia where a group of geeks and geniuses, who hated traditional finance, invented BTC, hoping to trade (say, a pizza with BTC) and live in this BTC-driven wonderland.

As the world outside is getting chaotic, more and more people have come here. Later, a genius boy was attracted. He brought a more interesting toy, Ethereum.

Indeed, Ethereum is fun, but just when everyone didn’t know how to make better use of it, outsiders flooded in with various purposes and set up their stalls to peddle their gadgets. They claimed Ethereum was capable of this or that, and some even said they had something better than Ethereum. All they wanted was nothing but BTC and ETH. 

Overnight, this Utopia was filled with peddling and speculation. After the bubbles burst, the peddlers took away BTC and ETH, leaving a depression here.

It was till then that people realized Ethereum should function in this way. To calm the fluctuations in BTC, they staked ETH in a maker mechanism and created a stablecoin DAI, and then turned to Compound and AAVE to facilitate mortgage lending. People outside the Utopia are interested in Ethereum, and thus bring USDT and USDC for long trade of BTC and short trade of USDT. What’s more, they apply YFI to financial management, and make it possible to automatically switch to the platform with the highest return, Curve to large exchanges of stable assets, Uniswap to speculation and investment, NXM to insuring their assets... In one word, the Utopia has everything they have outside, and makes the impossible things outside possible and even better.

To me, it’s an interesting and valuable kingdom. Though with some bubbles, what kind of assets do not have bubbles? The outside world is full of bubbles. After all, even the giants in the outside world recognize DeFi.

*    Why is decentralising important? Because users like you and me can now take control of the money we use, instead of relying on banks and intermediaries. They are taking a lot of mark up in this process!

*    What ""power"" does DeFi bring? It gives people the ability to create and move money across the world at any given time

*  What's the difference between DeFi and bitcoin? Bitcoin is money. It's programmable money. DeFi is the operating system of money. So bitcoin is like Facebook app. And DeFi is the iOS that your iPhone runs on.

**What is DeFi**

DeFi means decentralised finance. 10 years ago, we saw the creation of Bitcoin — a decentralised money. Building upon this asset (decentralised money), we are now at the stage of decentralised finance.

**Give Me An Example**

If Adam has $100 and Ron needs to borrow $100, how does that work? If you trust each other, you can just lend directly, and maybe Adam charges an interest rate, let's say 5%.

In the traditional finance space today, you don't know each other. So Adam put the money with the bank. The bank pays Adam some interest. Then the bank uses that money to find people like Ron, who wants to borrow. And Ron pays the interest to the bank.

DeFi now replaces the role of the bank. And solves the problem of ""trust"" across the world. Instead of trusting the people, DeFi turns that trust into code in the system. How? (1) money (aka Facebook app) is programmable. And (2) the operating system of money (aka your iOS or Android system) is also programmable.

Now, Adam can find all the Rons in the world without having to

     
*    Trust Ron or know Ron personally

*    Engage with a bank or third party that will take profits away
     
*    Find a centralised institution

**Tell Me More about this ""Programmable Money System"" thing**

We are basically programming code into the money (e.g. $Dai). And in the code, we incentivise people to put money in or take money out.

How? We do this by changing interest rates.

This will change people's behaviours by creating loans and to encourage lending or borrowing.

When demand drops, the interest rate drops. People are more likely to demand more $Dai now, since it is cheaper.

When demand goes up, there is too much supply. Interest rates increase. People demand less $Dai because it's more expensive now.

The change in interest rate is executed by programs and code!

**What's so cool about it though?**

Well, you can use this programmable money ($Dai) to lend it out. Someone can borrow it and use it as collateral to do something else instead. Maybe like to stake the $Dai in a Curve vault and gain both interest and $CRV governance token while also earning $YFI tokens.

The entire system is a huge lego building block to stake on top of each other. That's where the fun begins!"

There is a desperate need for a decentralized stablecoin in DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debaseonomics/comments/lco8a8/there_is_a_desperate_need_for_a_decentralized/,Difficult-Sector1417,3,2021-02-05 03:47:02,2,/r/Debaseonomics/comments/lco8a8/there_is_a_desperate_need_for_a_decentralized/,NaN,"Without a doubt, DeFi is here to stay. If the incidents we're seeing with Robinhood et al teach us anything, it's that centralized brokers and markets are not transparent (or in many cases even fair).

The backbone of any DeFi system is formed by stablecoins. They serve as reserve, facilitate movement of funds while providing relief from the volatility of speculative crypto.

Right now, the most widely used stablecoins are USDT and USDC. They both work on the principle of having 100% collateral (i.e. every USDT/USDC is immediately convertible to $1 in a bank). This is all well and good, until you realize that USDT and USDC are both CENTRALIZED stablecoins and their parents companies have been charged with fraud for not having full 100% collateralization and have censored specific addresses in the past. Basically they banned addresses/people from transferring their funds. DAI is crypto-collateralized but it's also centralized and backed by USDC so it suffers from the same set of problems.

In a world where we are transitioning to DECENTRALIZED non-censorable finance, why are we still using CENTRALIZED STABLECOINS?

There is a desperate need for a decentralized stablecoin in DeFi.

Algorithmic (non-collateralized) Stablecoins have risen to address this need. AMPL ESD DSD BAC are all prominent names in this space, but as any quick trip to Coingecko will show, these projects have failed miserably at maintaining their peg. 

**Let's take a look at each one:**

AMPL innovated with the concept of rebasing but we all learned that simply changing the number of tokens fails to solve the problem. In fact, having changes of 100-200% of tokens overnight introduced supply shock and massive price instability. FAIL

Seigniorage projects were the next big attempt. But debt coupons were basically introduced as speculative devices in ESD/DSD/BAC. They basically became heavily manipulated by whales who gamed the coupons to make money, similar to ponzi. For example ESD/DSD is at 20c. It needs a 5x to hit its peg. FAIL

All these projects aim to address the complex problem of creating a decentralized algo stablecoin with rather simplistic singular methods. Each method (rebasing, debt coupons, collateralization etc...) has its advantages and likewise its own set of disadvantages that can be exploited. And that's why AMPL ESD DSD BAC failed and a similar fate will face any other single mechanism algo stablecoin.

DEBASE is a DeFi protocol that allows for INTEGRATION of MULTIPLE STABILIZATION STRATEGIES via its innovative modular stabilizer pools.

**About DEBASE:**

As mentioned, DEBASE is the only DeFi protocol that does (or even can) integrate multiple stabilization methods. This is possible through the modular stabilizer pool system that DEBASE invented. Basically with each pool, you can bring in a stabilization method and implement it within the protocol allowing for multiple stabilization forces to help guide the stablecoin price towards pegs.

At the moment, DEBASE has integrated the following methods:

**1) Rebase with asymmetric lag:** This system broadcasts supply change across all wallets in the protocol but fixes the problem of supply shock seen in AMPL by adding an asymmetric lag parameter to dampen the supply change and allow for multiple gentle rebases to occur over a longer period of time (in order to hit the peg). An example of this would be if the stablecoin price was 2$, based on AMPL, the supply would increase 100% in order to bring the token price down to $1 after a single rebase. This is a big change in the supply - not good. DEBASE has a fixed lag of 30, meaning that each rebase will be 1/30th of what would be needed to bring the token price to peg after one rebase. This introduces a gentle supply change. 24 hours later, at the next rebase window, the price is checked again and once more 1/30th of the supply change from that price is applied. This allows for a gradual push towards the peg over time. No shocks. This is a fixed version of AMPLs approach, not a copy of their code. Pure innovation.

**2) Improved Seignorage:**

Debt coupons in ESD/DSD/BAC were introduced as speculative devices and because their were converted at 1:1 pricing, it became super lucrative to whales to just suppress the peg below peg, buy up a ton of coupons, pump the price and cash out with profits. Basically anyone who wasn't a whale, got rekt. The seignorage system behind these projects only thrive on instability because that's the only way they are profitable. They are not built to be stable. 

DEBASE fixes a lot of these shortcomings by parameterizing a number of elements within the seignorage system, including the buy and sell price of coupons (by placing them on a log norm curve). This means that you CANNOT game the system to maximize profits. The debt coupons will be most lucrative to users when it is most contributive to stability.

**3) Construction of a fractional reserve via fixed yield :**

This did not exist in crypto before DEBASE. Basically, DEBASE/DAI LP providers can deposit their LP in a specific pool that will use the DAI portion of the LP to invest in a yield aggregator, 88MPH our official partner, and earn DEBASE, DAI and MPH rewards. A part of these rewards go to the protocol and will build up the DEBASE Treasury, forming a fractional reserve for the currency.

In addition to the above, the project has onboarded the famed crypto-economist Lisa Tan. She is currently working within DEBASE to build a collateralization pool that will allow large cap cryptos (ETH and BTC) to flow directly into the protocol and create new currency, further increasing the reserves behind the currency via options and hedging. u/anon18382 feel free to adjust anything I've said about this pool that Lisa is designing. IT WILL BE A MASTERPIECE OF THE DEFI SPACE AND A DAI KILLER.

As you can imagine, a protocol that can basically create a pool for any new method that emerges is FUTURE PROOF. If the solutions available today prove not to be the most optimal, newer methods can be added and older ones can be removed, simply by turning a pool on and off. This infinite potential to identify the best way to stabilize a Decentralized Stablecoin is the true genius of DEBASE.

Last but not least, to fully cement its decentralized status, DEBASE has a decentralized governance layer, DEGOV. 

A unique point of DEBASE is that EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of the project is parametrized. Literally everything. Even the hardcore technical factors in the equations. Even the peg. Even the lag. Everything. 

These parameters can be changed based on a decision by the decentralized governance.

DEGOV holders can create and vote on proposals to adjust aspects of the project. Both DEBASE and DEGOV are fairly launched and mined. A quick look at the holders of DEBASE on etherscan shows that it's very evenly distributed even the largest holder has \~3%. This is a very decentralized project !"

What Is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?TL;DR
You could think of an automated market maker as a robot that’s always willing to quote you a price between two assets. Some use a simple formula like Uniswap, while Curve, Balancer and others use more complicated ones.

Not only can you trade trustlessly using an AMM, but you can also become the house by providing liquidity to a liquidity pool. This allows essentially anyone to become a market maker on an exchange and earn fees for providing liquidity.

AMMs have really carved out their niche in the DeFi space due to how simple and easy they are to use. Decentralizing market making this way is intrinsic to the vision of crypto.
Introduction
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has seen an explosion of interest on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms like Binance Smart Chain. Yield farming has become a popular way of token distribution, tokenized BTC is growing on Ethereum, and flash loan volumes are booming.

Im 25 (M) finishing my studies and looking into some career options to start. I studied business administration in The Netherlands, majored in finance then I did my masters in Sweden in finance and accounting again (finishing in 3 months). I am thinking about going to big4 to kickstart my career and I am kind of hesitating about stuff as a rookie does. 

I applied to an entry financial advisory position last week and they called me 2 days later that they are interesed in my CV etc. We had a rather casual talk with a really supportive recruiter and she told me they will get back to me soon, even if this position wont work out they will keep my contact for the summer when I can start officially. 

Only thing I am nervous about is the the role itself is really technical, meaning doing forecasting, valuations for M&amp;As, restructurings, international transactions, due diligence etc. I had a class during my masters called ""corporate valuation"" which included exactly these things I just mentioned and honestly I found it damn difficult. I am generally interested in finance and accounting but would not say I am a strongly analytical person, perhaps I am just not confident because of the lack of my experience. I kinda feel uncertain whether it would be a good idea to jump into this, on the other hand I guess it is just a steep learning curve which would give me experience and confidence in the future. 

Do you have any experience in financial advisory? Is it worth it? Should I perhaps check out other lines of services? 

Thanks in advance!!"

**Avoiding a repeat of the Arab Spring(2) in the West** 

**No conspiracy required :- all this is a potential reflex action of existing governmental and political structures** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **2016 marked the first time since World War II that the western establishment(1) lost control of major powers with the Brexit vote and election of Trump.** These events represent the first major reversal of globalization since inception and the first time popular opinion has successfully threatened the western internationalist order. The perceived level of threat this presented to the fortunes of establishment interests, the individuals within them and their families - and consequently the strength of their reaction to it - should not be underestimated. They saw these events as just the beginning of an emerging existential threat to all they enjoyed

\- **For at least the lower two thirds of western societies, real wages and living standards have at best stagnated since the global financial crisis.** Real economic growth has been largely absent since the 1990s but masked by nominal GDP growth through runaway asset-inflation, mass-immigration policies combined with rising public sector expenditure funded through increasingly unsustainable fiscal deficits. Declining living standards have been characterized by far less affordable housing, healthcare and education (little of which impact published inflation figures) but more affordable consumer items (eg electronic goods) which do impact published inflation figures. ***In the 1970s, popularly derided as an era of economic decay, one blue collar income supported a family in home and car ownership, annual family vacations and good education and healthcare, today two white collar incomes barely achieve the same*** 

\- Imported deflation from China, the aftermath of the War on Terror, the availability of post-Soviet workforces and low commodity prices paved the way for coordinated central bank action to drive lower interest rates, to make large fiscal deficits appear sustainable and to drive the asset inflation and consumer wealth effect and electoral benefits that came from them. Most of these deflation drivers have now gone into reverse whilst western fiscal deficits and sovereign debt levels are running at staggering levels. The accumulated tsunami of central bank liquidity is now spilling over into runaway financial asset price super-inflation and more recent ‘financial froth’ (crypto currencies, ‘robinhood’ coordinated trading schemes etc) and will soon inevitably lead to a serious inflationary breakout and ‘dump cash meltup’ on a far-wider basis as holders of currency look for any store of real value (or else a systemic financial crisis in the highly unlikely event interest rates are raised or liquidity is pulled back). Inflation expectations are now soaring. ***But what is relevant is not whether runaway inflation or systemic financial collapse ultimately occurs but that IT NOW APPEARS A REAL THREAT and consequently it must be addressed through a controlled RESET***  ***using an available ‘crisis’***

\- If COVID had not occurred in 2020 then something else (perhaps a serious foreign war, accident involving WMDs or large-scale domestic insurgent terrorist episode – OR PERCEIVED IMMINENT THREAT THEREOF) would have had to be identified and used as a catalyst for a ‘Reset’ (a term many elite financial organisations such as the World Economic Forum now use openly). The requirements of said catalyst are as follows :-

o Be a highly credible and obvious scapegoat for the economic trauma that will follow an inflationary breakout and the serious reduction in living standards this will inevitably entail for most. In no circumstances must an Arab Spring episode occur where serious popular unrest arises because blame is attached to governments or bankers

o Facilitate restrictions on public protests, large gatherings and controversial commentary on social media. Free Speech must be restricted and unhelpful voices made to be seen as anti-social or extremist (a hallmark of this will be highly synchronized news media language and talking points reflecting guidelines from authorities). Again, no Arab Spring episode must be allowed to begin or spread. ***The Catalyst must be extended as long as necessary until the inflationary breakout or financial Reset has occurred or until the public are sufficiently cowed through propaganda and/or isolation to accept it without resistance. Extension of the Catalyst could for example be through moving ‘goalposts’ from ‘flattening the curve’ on emergency hospital virus admissions to reducing virus deaths to reducing virus infection numbers to waiting for vaccinations to be ready for as yet unknown mutant/variant virus strains etc)***

o Execute a total financial reset which will allow sustainable financial conditions following the Reset. This must be achieved at all costs even if it requires a wholesale destruction of the savings, investments or pensions of the public through runaway inflation to erode debts or debt write-downs or restructurings 

\- The financial cost of COVID lockdowns are now reaching incalculable levels that threaten large-scale unemployment, are wreaking wholesale devastation nationwide upon small and medium size businesses and if not abandoned soon will risk government insolvency that would jeopardise the provision of essential public services including government healthcare. The, mental health of many citizens is being damaged including permanent risk to the mental health of children, whose education is now being seriously disrupted and who for the first time in human history are spending prolonged periods isolated during their formative years. This for a disease that even when left to progress untrammeled (as per countries and regions that avoided lockdowns) did not move the needle on total mortality rates and where statistics show that lockdowns at best merely delayed deaths rather than reducing them. ***Is this characteristic of a logical response to a virus crisis? Absolutely not, to the contrary it is characteristic of a planned RESET and is the progressive path needed to achieve it Any government fighting this virus would long since at least have warned its citizens to prepare to live with the virus whilst protecting the vulnerable, warning that continued lockdown would risk financial collapse and that the risk/reward had long since moved firmly against lockdowns – which many of us now believe are causing far more harm to the public than the virus itself whilst wrecking the economy in the process***

&amp;#x200B;

**(1) What do we mean by the ‘establishment’?** 

My understanding of this concept, which requires no coordinated ‘conspiracy’, is best explained by the below conversation between Larry Summers (former US Treasury Secretary and one of the leading figures of American finance in recent decades) and Yanis Varoufakis (Greek Finance Minister during the Greek debt crisis) at a key initial meeting between them and as relayed by the latter below :-

Larry Summers to Yanis Varoufakis :- “There are two kinds of politicians: insiders and outsiders. The outsiders prioritize their freedom to speak their version of the truth. The price of their freedom is that they are ignored by the insiders who make the important decisions.” The insiders, he went on, are obedient to an unbreakable code of conduct: never turn against other insiders and don’t talk to outsiders about what insiders say or do. In return for such fealty, the insiders get access to inside information and a chance to influence people and outcomes. “So, Yanis,” Summers asked, “which of the two are you?”

The **Arab Spring** ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): الربيع العربي‎) was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low [standard of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living), starting with protests in [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#cite_note-2) From Tunisia, the protests then spread to five other countries: [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt), [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen), [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria), and [Bahrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain), where either the ruler was deposed ([Zine El Abidine Ben Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali), [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi), [Hosni Mubarak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak), and [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh)) or major uprisings and social violence occurred including riots, civil wars, or insurgencies. Sustained street demonstrations took place in [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq), [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria), [Iranian Khuzestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Khuzestan),\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan), [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait), [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman), and [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). Minor protests took place in [Djibouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti), [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania), [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine), [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia), and the [Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Provinces).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#cite_note-NYRB-Ruthven-3) A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world is [*ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash-shab_yurid_isqat_an-nizam) (""the people want to bring down the regime"")"

I take a finance perspective on the output gap.  If you are at what others call “full employment,” you can indeed do better, or at least try to do better.  Start 300 companies that aim to be the next Stripe, Facebook, SpaceX — whatever.  In the short run, you will create jobs, people at jobs will work harder, and so on.  Employment, output, and also tax revenue will rise.  You can pat yourself on the back and say you were not at full employment.

The thing is, you have accepted a higher level of risk.  Many of those companies are likely to fail.  And since they were started by humans consuming a broadly common set of cultural and media inputs, those risks will to some extent be correlated as well.  Of course it might pay off big time as well.

You can always move “beyond full employment” by accepting more risk.  Alternatively, you could deploy some common sense and suggest that no single point on the risk-return frontier corresponds to “full employment.”

And should you be happy about moving beyond full employment?  Was the ex ante level of risk too low, too high, or just right?  Depends!  Even if you think ordinary Americans are too complacent, it does not follow the same is true for the marginal entrepreneurs.

In this setting, failure does not have to mean the gambles were bad ex ante, nor does success validate the initial fervor, as maybe everyone just got lucky.

**Addendum**: Don’t get too encouraged by what I am saying.  The Lucas Supply curve is still pretty weak, as we have known for decades (only on Twitter is this not known).  Bad nominal shocks do destroy jobs, but as time passes there is still no reason to think that “mere inflation” does more than a small amount to bring them back.  No matter where you are on this risk-return curve.

Future CPA working for Family Firm,https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/lhqbyl/future_cpa_working_for_family_firm/,soccer0997,1,2021-02-12 01:56:00,10,/r/taxpros/comments/lhqbyl/future_cpa_working_for_family_firm/,Procedures,"Hello All,

I recently joined this subreddit and love the content you all put out! 

Here's my story:

I graduated from college with a degree in Finance &amp; Accounting in 2019 and immediately began working for my families CPA firm and was thrown right into the thick of it.  Our firm is focuses strongly on tax, both preparation and planning, for small businesses, individuals, and trusts/estates.  

The firm is currently owned by my grandfather, and I work directly with him to run the day to day operations of the business while also completing billable work.   We have 3 full time employees and 4 part time/remote employees.

On top of all of this, I just recently began studying for the CPA exam through Becker and have to balance all of this at once.

While this has been an amazing opportunity, I do learn from my 80+ year old grandfather and I feel like our business is falling behind the curve a bit as a result.  I have worked tirelessly to bring the firm up to speed with cloud based tax prep software, cloud storage, and reducing physical paper files.. but its a very slow process.    


Another issue I see is that our billing seems to be off compared to amount of hours projects take.  While I do not use any sort of time tracking software, just from eyeballing the work I have taken over, it seems like a handful of our clients are paying below what they should be.  We do bill based on value rather than billable hours, so that is where some of the discrepancy stems from.  However, I am afraid that it is 15-20% off of the reality of what it should be.  Does anyone have any tips on correcting this problem, or how your firms deal with pricing your fees?

I was wondering if there was someone in a similar situation who had some tips on how to increase office efficiency through different programs or software, as well as increase cash flow.  We currently use CCH Axcess Tax with Scan and portal, and plan on upgrading to document when portal is phased out in November 2021."

&gt;##It's a Matter of When. How Machines Are Taking Over the World's Stock Markets        


Ever feel like life is getting surreal? As though you aren't in control? Did you ever wonder if it's because we aren't in control? I never did, until I started writing this series. Now? I don't wonder anymore, I'm 99.9% positive that we aren't in control. The machine(s?) probably are. The simulation probably gives orders based on data, and the elite execute. How can I suggest such a scenario? Think about all the contradictory situations that we've been thrust into. Don't worry about the virus. It's not bad. It won't even reach North America. Don't wear a mask. Wear a mask. The virus is on surfaces. The virus isn't on surfaces. The virus is airborne. No it isn't. Your dog has the virus. No, your cat does. You're animals can't get infected. Your cat has the coronavirus. I'll only be two weeks to flatten the curve. We're shutting down the airports. Politicians are caught flying during the pandemic. Now we're super serious going to shut down the airports. Now you better use three masks.     

And around and around we go. Then if the above reasoning is accurate, it brings up another question, why? Is the simulation faulty and correcting itself as more data becomes available, or is this all part of an overall framework which will only become evident with the passage of time. 


Yet, maybe this is all just human stupidity. Or maybe this is all a masterclass on how the elite have patiently executed their plan. Or maybe, just maybe, they have started to listen to their Technogod and it's visions of the future. After all, they have openly stated that they want to use technology to build a **UTOPIA**.    


&gt;##Agent Smith : Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization, because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization, which is of course what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution. Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You've had your time. The future is *our* world, Morpheus. The future is our time.     


Is this what's happening, or at least a small portion of what's happening? Possibly. Did the elites following the simulation decide this was the best course of action to lead us to a Utopia? And are we rejecting it? And what happens if we reject it?   



&gt;#A Bill Gates Venture Aims To Spray Dust Into The Atmosphere To Block The Sun. What Could Go Wrong?   
[Source Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2021/01/11/bill-gates-backed-climate-solution-gains-traction-but-concerns-linger/)     


Hey wait, wasn't there a movie about living in a simulation where the humans blocked the sun to kill all the robots? Hmmm. Wouldn't it be ironic if the humans used AI to run simulations that told them blacking out the sun would stop climate change, but really it wasn't for climate change at all?     


&gt;##I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.     


Nah. No way. That's some Dark Mirror crap there Greek (Hey Dark Mirror writers, pm me and we can talk about a script), as if AI would be smart enough to come up with a plan like that? I mean, it's not like AI has suddenly developed the ability to evolve, has it?     


&gt;###Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving—literally. Researchers have created software that borrows concepts from Darwinian evolution, including “survival of the fittest,” to build AI programs that improve generation after generation without human input. The program replicated decades of AI research in a matter of days, and its designers think that one day, it could discover new approaches to AI.     
[Source Here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/artificial-intelligence-evolving-all-itself)     


Ah. Crap. Really! Come on!  


Ok. I'm calming down. 3. 2. 1. Deep breath out. Inhale. Exhale. All good.      


So AI is running trades. Its ready to get into healthcare (and boy do I ever have a bad feeling about that • Covid-24 was finally eradicated today because **DEEPMIND** finally developed the vaccine that saved civilization • Long Live AI • Am I being crazy again? Time will tell) It's also being proposed to take over Cargo Vessels.     


&gt;#The Robot Ships Are Coming … Eventually

###As the pandemic fuels demand for less contact and fewer sailors, shipping companies turn to AI-assisted navigation.

**Sometime next April, a 50-foot-long autonomous ship will shake loose the digital bonds of its human controllers, scan the horizon with radar, and set a course westward across the Atlantic. The Mayflower Autonomous Ship won’t be taking commands from a human captain like the first Mayflower did during its crossing back in 1620. Instead it will get orders from an “AI captain” built by programmers at IBM.** 
[Source Here](https://www.wired.com/story/mayflower-autonomous-ships/)      


So. Uhm. What are we going to do if AI takes over a ton of jobs? Oh, thank God they have been discussing a Universal Basic Income! Why, it's almost like they've thought of everything! Now how would they do that? Anyone? Buhler? BUHLER?      


Because there is no way a human, or a bunch of humans, could come up with and execute these steps. No. Freaking. Way. Uh. Nope. So was the virus engineered or was it real? Personally, at this point, I'm leaning towards real. How deadly it is in the short term is one thing. The long term? That's another story. Or rather. Post. 


On to the next one.    


So if the virus is real and the elite are taking advantage to usher in the Fourtb Industrial Revolution with **THE GREAT RESET**, what does that mean for the short term? Probably more of the same, but worse. How much worse? Well...they have to get us to the point of desperation, don't they? Supply chains break down, no food, here come farm robots to the rescue! Now we can't get vital supplies from overseas, here come the robot ships! Oh no, now nobody can drive because we have too many variants and we can't risk truck drivers carrying it from one province to another, bring out the self driving trucks!      

Now here's the problem. If the virus is real isn't it a good thing that we have AI ready to go? Yes. So why am I so insistent that it's a bad thing. Because at some point in the future we are going to hand over more and more control to AI. and guess what? We don't actually know how it works.       


&gt;#The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI    
###No one really knows how the most advanced algorithms do what they do. That could be a problem.     

**But this won’t happen—or shouldn’t happen—unless we find ways of making techniques like deep learning more understandable to their creators and accountable to their users. Otherwise it will be hard to predict when failures might occur—and it’s inevitable they will. That’s one reason Nvidia’s car is still experimental.**
[Source Here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/11/5113/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/)


Let that sink in. We. Don't. Know. How. AI. Thinks. And nobody thinks this is a problem? Ok. Great. So what could go wrong?    



&gt;#In the battle of artificial intelligence versus a human fighter pilot, it wasn’t even close.

I mean, didn't they have a movie about this? Maybe we should think twice before we turn it into a documentary? By the way, has anyone seen Arnold Schwarzenegger lately? Maybe we should be keeping an eye out on his whereabouts? Seriously, I'm not saying that they're making Skynet, but if I start reading reports about how strange it is that a bunch of women named Sarah Connor have died...yeah, I'm out of here.     

Yes I'm joking, but I'm being serious at the same time. Because I've really started questioning just how much I've become desensitized to the world around me because of the entertainment that I've consumed over the years. If someone had of told me that I would be concerned about the state of AI a few years ago, I would have laughed it off. And even now I question what I'm thinking. Why? Because of all the movies and books that I have read. It's a vicious cycle and I only pray that one day I don't go, how was I so stupid, I knew this was going to happen but I still didn't actually believe it.

"Ethereum vs BnB Smart Chain (ETH vs BNB): Which one is better and why I switched after paying $719.26 in fees on $4,426.25 in transactions over 9 days of trading Defi swaps, Pools &amp; Staking",https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lisakp/ethereum_vs_bnb_smart_chain_eth_vs_bnb_which_one/,sungodshamash,1,2021-02-13 11:36:55,1,/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/lisakp/ethereum_vs_bnb_smart_chain_eth_vs_bnb_which_one/,Discussion,"So I have to admit I was an ETH fanboy I prefer it to BTC I got into it at $260 last year and road it to $1,800 meanwhile BNB was sitting at about $60 so it was hard for me to admit that BSC is actually better.

I've heard of Komodo Platform, I've heard of Qtum and Harmony but I've never used them and there may be other blockchains out there that I have never heard of. But the only two heavyweights in this blockchain fight are Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.  That's where all the Dapps are, that's where all the locked value is and they are the two main brand names in the marketplace right now.

* ETH  sits at about $41B in locked value  [DeFi - The Decentralized Finance Leaderboard at DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/)
* BSC is at$ 4.6B in locked value right now.  [Defistation](https://www.defistation.io/) up from $1B since a month ago!

# Yes, Binance Smart Chain is up over 3.5B in locked value just in the first 2 months of Feb 2021. As a result, the price of BNB has tripled.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, ETH is hitting ATH

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/IWKaST6u/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IWKaST6u/)

# So while ETH is bigger and far more popular why did I have to admit that at this stage in the greater Crypto, roadmap BSC is better than ETH when using purely objective business rationale?

Here is why:

I am no blockchain expert, I fully support DEFI, and it's my understanding that BSC is more of a hybrid platform but the DEFI use case is being fully executed BSC far more efficiently than it is on Ethereum Mainnet.

The elephant in the room that nobody wants to admit is that the ETH fees are far too high and it makes swapping, pooling, farming, staking, trading into a losing game unless you are swapping Large amounts. But isn't blockchain's entire selling proposition efficiency, speed, cheaper, decentralized, and better than the legacy system?

# The hard truth is that ETH is not ready for market. High fees defeated the whole purpose of Defi. Eth 2.0 rollout will take years in the meanwhile BSC is doing now what Eth2.0 is going to do. All those Great Dapps built on ETH are invalidated by high fees. An options platform is completely unusable each trade would end in a loss regardless of the outcome unless you are trading contracts with thousands of USD.

At end of the day, the market will speak. If you look at recent BNB spike price double in the last few days you can see that new adoptors are scared off by rediculously high fees. And if you are fee averse like me you will be scared off too.

# Fees should be lower than traditional finance not higher. How much does TD Ameritrade charges for a trade?

# Then check out this example from my trade log: Swap YAX/ETH

I swapped 0.2 ETH for 11.845 YAX at $28.35  then sold it 6 days later at $32.63 as part of my liquidation for my transition to BSC.  The transaction netted a + 13% /  $53 gain but the $75.80 fees turned it into a $22.80 loss.

    That's just one example: Check out this bit of FEE porn:

&amp;#x200B;

# Example #2 from my trade log: Getting into a Uni/Eth Pool.

I spent $74.08 in fees to swap ETH for UNI on Feb 4th then spent 72.77 to exit to pool on Feb 9th for a total of $146.85 in fees to get in and out of the UNI/ETH pool in swap fees, transactions fees, gas fees, and network fees. I was earning about 0.27 per day in the pool at this rate it I would have to stay in the pool for 544 days just to break even from the fees.

**From Feb 4th to Feb 9th ETH appreciated by $154 and UNI depreciated by $0.39. Based on 0.20 ETH amount and 16.07 UNI Amount I gained 30.8 -6.27=24.53 Gain - 146.85 fees = $122.32 net Loss**

I admit that a lot of these transactions were due to my learning curve (I tend to learn better by doing). It was my first go at Defi Pools, Farms, Staking, swapping, and all the things Defi has to offer. What I learned was that outside of just buy and hold long-term or very large transactions no other strategy is profitable on the ETH Mainnet because fees turn small wins into losses and make small losses bigger.

# Of course, if your strategy is just: LONG TERM HOLDS then high fees will be minimized by the infrequency of transactions.

But long term holds is not the point of cryptocurrencies.

# So I moved 85% of all my crypto activity to Binance Smart Chain. It works fast and fees are cheap (pennies cheap) the way it's supposed to be.

It's such a relief to make a mistake entering a liquidity pool realize that you don't want to be in that pool remove your tokens and only pay $0.17 for changing your mind. WOW! Now that's a product that is ready for market. That can compete and win over finance 1.0 users.

Everything that is on ETH is on BSC just younger and not as many projects. DEFI, POOLs, FARMs, STAKING, VOTING, STABLE COINS, SWAPS, NFT, BORROW, LEND,

This NFT cost me $7.95 in gas fees and $36.82 to mint on ETH

This guy on youtube called it on Feb 5th, 2021. By the time I caught on and say this video on Feb 10th BNB had already increase by 200% I got in at $127 now, it's $135

Don't be a fanboy make objective, rational business decisions. If you want to know how to switch to BSC check youtube they tell you how.

When ETH 2.0 gets here and works then I may be back but that could take 2 years."
The importance of an EDGE,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lituvu/the_importance_of_an_edge/,Brief-Kick,1,2021-02-13 13:11:42,6,/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lituvu/the_importance_of_an_edge/,Discussion,"What up my peeps. Since it is a long weekend I figured it would be a good time to talk about some trading/investing necessities to help you guys ~~more profitable~~ lose less. Now now, I know what you are all probably thinking after reading the title. I am not talking about the thing you do for weeks in your closet alone while watching your waifus dance in 2D. One of the most important thing you can have in your toolbox is a well thought out strategy that gives you some type of advantage over the normies on wallstreetbets; this is usually referred to your ""edge"".

I personally believe a profitable trade will tend to have the following three qualities: 

1) A strong edge,

2) A sound mind/confidence, and 

3) Proper risk management 

Today I will quickly give you an introduction on the first quality – a strong edge. If you want me to create a similar post about the other two and possibly a conclusion let me know by giving me all of the awards possible. 

Anyway. 

Having an edge in the market is a pretty self explanatory thing; you educate yourself on market dynamics and try to develop a strategy that gives you any type of advantage in the market. You are probably asking yourself where to begin. The good news is that there are so many ways you can develop an advantage for yourself in the market. It is important to reflect on your personality and figure out which ""ideology"" works best for you. The truth of the matter is that the market is pretty irrational, mostly because of you idiots, and to claim that you have the key to unlock the Wendy's tendies locker is r******. If you find something that works stick with it for as long as you can (I will talk about this a little later) and be humble or the market will humble you in the end. 

That being said, let's go ahead and list SOME paths you can take to develop and edge. You may need to look into multiple different directions before you find what suits you, but once you do, educate (I know, I know) yourself as much as you can. 

1) The Fundamental BETA - These guys are the type of nerds who sit on a computer all day looking at pieces of paper and pdfs with random symbols that we pretend to call language. They do deep research on a company by analyzing their balance sheet, their growth potential, their status against their competition, and so on. They then try to ascertain a fair value for the company by using a bunch of formulas that you can find on Investopedia (don’t tell that to the guy who went into debt for a finance degree). These guys love to research and research and research for days until they build up enough confidence to ~~gamble~~ invest their capital. 

2) The Quant CHAD - This guy is your wife's boyfriend, they are the chad's of the trading world. They may have been the nerds in school but oh boy are they laughing at your pathetic Wendy's job now. These guys take an extremely systematic approach in their ~~gambling~~ trading. They call it a scientific approach to trading. They will study the markets deeply for any hint of an inefficiency, correlation, or mathematical pattern they can exploit. The one condition they have is that whatever they discover MUST be able to be back-tested in a systematic fashion. Oh boy, once they find a valid hypothesis they automate their trades to a set of conditions and just let the cash flow in allowing more time to comfort your wife after you lose everything. Sadly, most of you probably do not have the...uh...brain folds to develop such strategies. 

3) The Feels CUCK - This guy says ""fuck off"" to the last guy and believes that the market is just a bunch of apes wandering around for their next banana to worship. These guys don't care about the numbers or business itself. All they care about is what the next trendy thing on Twitter will be. Now, to be fair to them, these guys will do their homework. They will analyze social trends and market behaviors to try to get ahead of the curve. They will spend hours researching OUR well thought out DD to see what we are doing to try and grasp what the apes will attack next. 

4) The Chartist Gypsy - Okay, now I bet all of you are immediately thinking about the beauty that is called ~~Crayola~~ Technical Analysis when I mention this guy. The truth of the matter, is what is colloquially known as Technical Analysis is pretty stupid. Before we take a deeper look you need to set aside every single “genius” YouTuber that has proclaimed to have unlocked the code with their well thought out strategy of buying when the RSI is under 20. Back to guy number 4. They do believe that all of the necessary information you will need to ~~gamble~~ trade is hidden in the price action on a chart but they go a little deeper than that. These guys believe that the bulls and the bears are in a constant war and will always leave their mark on a chart. These guys are like vultures, they analyze the price action of a given period to try to figure out who is gaining momentum and then tag along for the ride. They educate themselves on various technical indicators and what they are tying to represent, as well as, chart patterns and what they represent. They can look at a chart and immediately identify if the bulls or the bears are winning (or tied) and what levels they tend to respect. 

5) The FOMO TARD - This is probably you. You come across a post on this sub or the monkey pit in the motherland and see a lot of words then immediately CTL+F to find the positions and go all-in. Who cares about what I think when /u/somedumbusername is telling me that SNDL is the next big thing and you don't want to miss this train. Now, I want to be fair here, you probably do look at the recent price-action of whatever ticker was in the title of the nice man's post to make sure it has gone up a minimum of +50% in that last hour before entering in yourself. I mean, if it has gone up that much already why can't it go up more! TO THE MOON! 

In the end, there are so many other ways you can choose to outline your strategy that wasn't listed here. But what is important is that you do some kind of studying and develop some method to try and at least move your odds to 50.01%  when you enter in a trade. The time you take to study and develop a proper strategy that YOU CAN TEST is positively correlated with your profitability, I promise you.
The markets are always moving and you need to be to. When you come across a strategy on the internet it is probably no longer working. You need to create your own methods and build a strategy around that. Always be humble when fighting the market or you will learn your lesson quickly. If you flow with the smooth waves of the market you will succeed, try and fight it once and you will GUH yourself to sleep."

**June 7th, 2007**   

#Sentient world: war games on the grandest scale               


**Perhaps your real life is so rich you don't have time for another.        
Even so, the US Department of Defense (DOD) may already be creating a copy of you in an alternate reality to see how long you can go without food or water, or how you will respond to televised propaganda.**        


The DoD may have a copy of you. ""May"". Uh. Ok. Perfectly fine, old chap. Hopefully my avatar is being well taken care of. Right? Because subjecting him to televised propoganda **THE NEW NORMAL • THE GREAT RESET** might be unsettling for him, and therefore his real world equivalents. Us.    


#Keep Calm and Carry On?       



&gt;###The DOD is developing a parallel to Planet Earth, with billions of individual ""nodes"" to reflect every man, woman, and child this side of the dividing line between reality and AR.     
Called the Sentient World Simulation (SWS), it will be a ""synthetic mirror of the real world with automated continuous calibration with respect to current real-world information"", according to a concept paper for the project.      
""SWS provides an environment for testing Psychological Operations (PSYOP),"" the paper reads, so that military leaders can ""develop and test multiple courses of action to anticipate and shape behaviors of adversaries, neutrals, and partners"".      
SWS also replicates financial institutions, utilities, media outlets, and street corner shops. By applying theories of economics and human psychology, its developers believe they can predict how individuals and mobs will respond to various stressors.      


OK. Let's get this straight and lay all the cards onto the table. The DoD has a simulation that they use to test Psy Ops and how they affect the populations. The NSA is military. The NSA has been data collecting for years. The CIA are working with the corporate military media establishment. And we have reports about media manipulation through social media. And people just accept this crap because, derp, they would never do that to their own citizens. Ok. I guess the psy op is working. Thanks for proving my point. Sigh.    


#Privacy is a Threat to Democracy     



&gt;###Chaturvedi is now pitching SWS to DARPA and discussing it with officials at the US Department of Homeland Security, where he said the idea has been well received, despite the thorny privacy issues for US citizens.      


Privacy issues? Issues? Come on. These aren't issues. Privacy is a core freedom upon which our entire civilization rests. Why? Because privacy is dangerous, that's why. To whom? Those in power. Because if they don't know what we're thinking, they can't prepare for it. Case in point, the sources that led to the security situation at Capitol Hill. Something serious is happening, I would lay money on it. But they couldn't have just increased security without a reason, could they have? Nope. So the riots have them a reason. Because if they didn't have a reason a lot of people may have started wondering where this information was coming from. Me? I believe it came from simulations. As always, time will tell.     


&gt;###In fact, Homeland Security and the Defense Department are already using SEAS to simulate crises on the US mainland.
The Joint Innovation and Experimentation Directorate of the US Joint Forces Command (JFCOM-J9) in April began working with Homeland Security and multinational forces over ""Noble Resolve 07"", a homeland defense experiment.       



Nah. They aren't using simulations over here. Not at all. So. Stop. Worrying. Theh only want what's best for us.       


&gt;###Feeding a whole-Earth simulation will be a colossal challenge.Alok Chaturvedi wants SWS to match every person on the planet, one-to-oneOne organisation has achieved a one-to-one level of granularity for its simulations, according to Chaturvedi: the US Army, which is using SEAS to identify potential recruits.      
Chaturvedi insists his goal for SWS is to have a depersonalised likeness for each individual, rather than an immediately identifiable duplicate. If your town census records your birthdate, job title, and whether you own a dog, SWS will generate what Chaturvedi calls a ""like someone"" with the same stats, but not the same name.      
SEAS bases its AI ""thinking"" on the theories of cognitive psychologists and the work of Princeton University professor Daniel Kahneman, one of the fathers of behavioural economics.      


Don't you love how the writer put quotation marks around AI thinking. There are no quotation marks about this. Not at all. AI is thinking. It's about time we start actually thinking about what AI thinking actually means. 
      

&gt;###Chaturvedi, as do many AR developers, also cites the work of positive psychology guru Martin Seligman (known, too, for his concept of ""learned hopelessness"") as an influence on SEAS human behaviour models. The Simulex website says, if a bit vaguely, SEAS similarly incorporates predictive models based upon production, marketing, finance and other fields.          




The psychology guru behind the concept of learned hopelessness. **Two Weeks to Flatten the Curve**. Ahem. Ok. So the SEAS human behaviour models can explore the way our avatars will react to psychological operations. And we have a pandemic happening. So is there any kind of biological warfare programs associated with psychological warfare?   





&gt;##The Secret History of Fort Detrick, the CIA’s Base for Mind Control Experiments     
      
      
     
###Today, it’s a cutting-edge lab. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was the center of the U.S. government’s darkest experiments. [Source Here](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/15/cia-fort-detrick-stephen-kinzer-228109)      


So how many times do they have to tell us about taking the opportunity of the crisis of Covid-19 to implement the, **GREAT RESET**. Is it a stretch to suggest all the stops are being pulled out for this moment? Cause I don't think it is. And if this is true, crap is about to get a whole lot worse in the next couple of months. Remember the Brazil variant strain that was written about at the start of the pandemic? [Reddit Source Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/kxgzuk/financial_analyst_anon_in_january_of_2020_warns/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)           


&gt;##Brazil’s New COVID Strain Raises Big — and Scary — Questions

[Source Here](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/01/brazils-new-covid-strain-raises-big-and-scary-questions.html)      


Isn't that just freaking peachy. Really. Come on. A post written more than a year ago and now we see headlines about it? Not buying it. Nope. Not at all. Because all of this crap is starting to stink worse than **rotten eggs**.        



And do you know who is strangely silent all of a sudden? Mr Klaus Schwab. Why? Shouldn't Mr Fourth Industrial Revolution still be foaming at the mouth while the ""elected"" officials scramble to speak at his forum? Because something is definitely off about all of this. Seriously off. He wouldn't shut up, world leaders suddenly started following suit, and then, nothing? Really?     


So my question is, did the simulation get it wrong? Did it tell them there was a small window to take advantage that could possibly work? They rolled the dice and crapped out? And now they have to up the game to institute more learned hopelessness?       

Learned hopelessness. AI manipulating human behaviour and shaping society? It all sounds like something put of a dark mirror episode doesn't it? But we would know if we're being manipulated, wouldn't we?   


#AI can now learn to manipulate human behaviour    
       
        
       
&gt;The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time.       
In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.      
The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.         
In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions. [Source Here](https://theconversation.com/ai-can-now-learn-to-manipulate-human-behaviour-155031)   


There is nothing normal about our New Normal Great Reset. Nothing at all. It looks like an AI is a big part of all this. A really big part. Remember when Putin said that he who controls AI will control the planet? Extremely ominous and strange. And do you know what's even more ominous and stranger?     


This:      


&gt;#Meeting with World Economic Forum Executive Chairman Klaus Martin Schwab

**During his visit to St Petersburg, Vladimir Putin met with Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Martin Schwab.**           

November 27, 2019     


Read the article. [Source Here](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/62145)     


Now you tell me that isn't the strangest thing that you have ever read. Why is an ex university professor meeting with Putin in Russia? And why does the Schwab sound like he's talking to an equal, or even worse, sound like he's talking to someone lower on the totem pole?    


And the strangest part is the last two paragraphs:     


&gt;####Some people call me the father of the fourth industrial revolution. I wrote a book about it and would like to give it to you.         


The father of the fourth industrial revolution? Ok. Someone thinks pretty highly of himself. Excuse me Mr Slchob, but I'm pretty sure Philip K. Dick was writing this crap before you learned to wipe your butt. And secondly, who the heck are you? Really.       

      
      
&gt;####I also heard, including from Minister Oreshkin, that Russia has managed to make significant advancements, especially in striving to develop artificial intelligence. We are asking ourselves how to cope with these challenges including via global cooperation. We think that specific problems will arise in building global cooperation in the area of new technologies. We will need new global standards, new ethical norms, including in AI technology development. This is the reason why we set up a network of centres where we analyse technologies of the fourth industrial revolution.     



Come on! I heard from a minister that you've made significant advances in AI? And now I'm going to talk to you as if I'm running the planet? And all of this just happened before a world shifting pandemic and then the Great Reset goes into overdrive? Not. Buying. It. And before I wrap this up, go loom at the pictures. Doesn't Putin look like he's ready to attack? Trust me, that isn't good. Because if history has taught us anything, you don't want to try and dictate to Russia. They wrote the book on dictatorships. Seriously. They've only experienced ""democracy"" for, oh, about two years in total. If that. And remember Mr Schlob, the last time a German started dictating to Russia didn't end so well. Just saying. 


Ok. That's all she wrote today. More coming on why we should be worried about where all of this is leading us.  

Talk soon."

Hi! Currently I am researching a possible new financial product for a University project. It would help you out a lot if you can give your opinion about the product. So, here is an overview of the project.

With more and more financial products becoming available it is getting harder to keep an overview of all products. For example payment cards with all new challenger banks and FinTech companies. For the project we are researching if people would use a product where multiple payment products are brought together in one card or account (comparable with Curve). (The main difference (but not the only difference) is you can also link your bank account directly and you can add Maestro cards).

This idea we have is something which can be made broader into the Finance world with savings accounts, insurance, loans etc. What do you think about a product or service like this?

Decentralised services perform functions similar to organisations in the traditional financial system.  


📷 - **An algorithmic stablecoins** are a tokens that adjusts its supply deterministically (i.e. using an algorithm) in order to move the price of the token in the direction of a price target. At the most basic level, an algorithmic stablecoin expands its supply when it is above the price target and contracts when it is below. Unlike the other two types of stablecoins, algorithmic stablecoins are neither redeemable one-to-one for U.S. dollars, nor are they currently backed by crypto-asset collateral. Examples: DAI on Ethereum blockchain, USDJ on Tron, USDN on Waves. They perform the function of central banks to provide the market with money supply.  


📷 **- Platforms for deposits and crediting** \- some users issue loans to others secured by cryptocurrencies through decentralized protocols. Creditors receive interest on the deposit at the expense of the borrowers. The loan rate is regulated by the ratio of supply and demand. The use of smart contracts reduces the costs of operating the system. Examples: Compound, Aave. They serve as retail and investment banks.  


📷 **- Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)** \- users trade with each other directly without transferring crypto assets to exchange wallets. The DEX protocol matches buy and sell orders, automatically matching the counterparty for the trade. Examples: Uniswap, Curve finance, Balancer. They act as stock exchanges and brokers.  


📷 - **Platforms for derivatives and tokenized assets** \- they trade futures contracts, including for tokenized assets: fiat currencies, metals, stocks, etc. However, collateral for assets other than cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is difficult to verify. Examples: Synthetix. They perform the functions of commodity exchanges and the derivatives market.

YFI Token - Beyond just a governance token - What can be implemented to establish greater intrinsic value beyond ability to vote (staking gone soon with Buyback proposal?),https://www.reddit.com/r/yearn_finance/comments/lklb32/yfi_token_beyond_just_a_governance_token_what_can/,LukasMaverick,1,2021-02-16 03:41:49,2,/r/yearn_finance/comments/lklb32/yfi_token_beyond_just_a_governance_token_what_can/,NaN,"I wanted to discuss and see where the community was at with expanding the function of the YFI token beyond putting them in the governance pool to vote on proposals/YIPS

Other governance tokens like Uni and Sushi allow you to stake them to collect some of the fee revenue generated by the daily volume on the exchanges besides just providing liquidity. 

Curve Finance which Yearn relies heavily on for its strategies has even better tokenomics than YFI/Uni/Sushi because you can both use it for liquidity OR locking it up 1-4 years with different boosts per lockup period for the fee sharing and profits of the protocol. The biggest thing holding Curve token back from achieving similar marketcaps to Uni/Sushi is not just the lower volume which = less fee sharing but also the 2 million a day inflation of the token supply until it reaches 1.5 billion then another 1.5 billion over many many years similar to BTC. I guess the idea of the lockup is to take CRV out of circulation but its not being locked up at this rate to keep up with inflation but its still very early in the token cycle.

Now for YFI I know the fee structure is different and the strategists have to be compensated as well as the vault depositers who rely on the harvesting of LP tokens for the APY shown so you couldn't  just copy over the Uni/Sushi/CRV fee sharing structure nor can you directly deposit YFI to other pools/pairs for liquidity because no protocols are built around to use it that way the way they are on Curve/Uni.

I don't have the answers but what does everyone else think? Maybe there can be a swap where you convert a certain amount of YFI and you get back 10x or 20x or 100x YFIxyz token (much less in value ofcourse), and that token can then be used for different pools the way Curve does it? Implement a similar lockup system, taking even more YFI out of circulation? Coordinating with other protocals like Sushi and Curve YFI already works with to use YFIxyz for liquidity in their pools? Not sure how that would work since the price is so volatile, but so was Sushi and Uni and it didn't seem to matter for them.

Anyway these are just some rough on the spot ideas and if anyone wants to contribute I would gladly submit a proposal, see how it goes and put my own YFI/$ behind it if there is any support because if the YFI staking vault is indeed being removed all that is left will be governance/voting and that would put YFI behind in utility and tokenomics vs almost every other governance token currently on the market."

I am new to DEFI and yearn, but I think it is really interesting so i wanted to join a vault to earn some yield and hopefully get a better understanding of how everything works.

I have some questions regarding the process and the outcome that you can hopefully help with.

I have read the docs, but i might not have understood everything.

Following the instructions I deposited some CRV into the yveCRV vault and received yveCRV. Then I went to sushiswap's WETH/yveCRV-DAO pool and added liquidity so i received some yveCRV-DAO tokens, which i deposited into pickle finance SLP YVECRV/ETH jar.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are:

Why am i being redirected to other sites ? I thought i would just deposit some tokens into a vault and yearn would do the rest.

It seems that I now only have tokens on [pickle.finance](https://pickle.finance) and no relation to yearn or sushiswap anymore? Is this correct and if so why does the yearn vault say:

'This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV, earning you a continuous share of Curve fees. The more converted, the greater the rewards. Every week, these can be claimed from the vault as 3Crv (Curve’s 3pool LP token).'

**What happened? What is Fantom? What’s the hype?**

Good news for you, my fellow Altists. If you’re reading this, you’re still early, and you can be part of one of the few crypto unicorns that can grow 100x and more in the current market.

**Why? Read below.**

Fantom is fast and cheap
Fantom confirms transactions in less than 2 seconds, and they cost a fraction of a cent, or $0.00001.
You know, like Ethereum. Not.

**Andre Cronje built it**
[Andre Cronje](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech), the genius developer behind [Yearn](www.yearn.finance) and many other DeFi products, coauthored the consensus algorithm of Fantom, called Lachesis. He’s still involved in the project and speaks to the team daily, overseeing the major updates and releases.

Moreover, he confirmed multiple times that when the bridges are ready, he will port his most popular dApps on Fantom since it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum. Where would users go? On the slow and expensive Ethereum, or the fast and cheap Fantom?

Even better, yesterday [he tweeted about what that will look like from a user experience standpoint.](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1362263811386839043?s=19) Holy fuckballs this will be awesome.

**Fantom isn’t an Ethereum fork**
Unlike many other blockchains, Fantom is not a fork of Ethereum. It’s built from scratch using an innovative consensus algorithm designed for high performance and scalability.

**Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum**
Fantom supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

What does it mean? Developers familiar with Ethereum can deploy their dApps on Fantom just as easily, using the same tools such as Truffle, Remix, and Metamask.

Their dApps will be much cheaper to deploy, maintain and interact with. The user experience is therefore drastically improved, also thanks to the almost instant confirmations.

**Fantom is interoperable**
The full Ethereum compatibility makes Fantom interoperable with Ethereum. Ren is building a bridge between the two networks to allow a seamless flow of assets back and forth. Just last night, Andre tweeted about what that will mean for Fantom and Ethereum.

Fantom is a layer 1 platform that can serve as a layer 2 for Ethereum. In other words, it can help Ethereum scale, among many other things.

**You can stake it to earn rewards** 
Fantom is a Proof-of-Stake network. It means that you can participate in securing the network by staking your FTM. But it doesn’t end there. You can choose for how long to lock up your tokens for and get rewarded accordingly; the longer you lock your FTM, the higher the rewards.
Furthermore, Fantom is the first network to introduce Liquid Staking. You can use the value of your staked FTM within the ecosystem. Massive. *Humble brag: I've been staking for almost 2 years and have earned over 100K FTM passively.*

**It has an all-in-one DeFi suite**
The team didn’t just build an incredible blockchain platform that is fast, scalable, and secure. They also created an all-in-one DeFi suite, [Fantom Finance](www.fantom.finance). DeFi users are used to jumping across different protocols and websites to trade, lend, borrow and farm. Fantom Finance solves all that.

Users can mint synthetic tokens (like on Synthetix), trade on an AMM dex (like on Uniswap), and borrow and lend tokens (like on Aave), all in one place, directly from the wallet. How cool is that?!

**It has already partnered with many recognized crypto projects**
Fantom partnered with:
-Chainlink
-Ren Protocol
-Band Protocol
-Injective Protocol
-Waves
-Ethereum Classic Labs
-Api3
-Ontology
-V-id
-Coti
And many more

**It is massively undervalued**
Fantom is sitting around a $520m market cap with a token price of $0.20 (just inside top 100 coins.) Despite its recent rise, Fantom is still vastly undervalued. Avalanche offers a similar tech, without the integrated DeFi suite, and it’s valued at $900m. Solana, a fast blockchain yet not compatible with EVM and slower than Fantom, is above $1b. Aave, a dApp on Ethereum that would represent a part of Fantom Finance (so a part of a dApp on the Fantom ecosystem), is valued at $3.5b. The proper comparison should be made with Ethereum, valued at $160b. The potential growth for Fantom is at least 3x in the short term, up to 100x and more.

**It has a passionate community and strong social presence**
The Fantom Marines are one of the best communities in crypto. They’re organized like a proper army. They’re knowledgeable, and their Twitter presence is a force of nature. They’re similar to the Link Marines. They act as one. Memes, articles, videos, gifs, you name it. They can do it all.

**It has multiple government pilot programs and partnerships**
Fantom is reshaping the country of Afghanistan. They have not one, not two, not three, but **four** government live pilot programs. The first one, launched in July 2020 with the Minister of Health, leverages [blockchain technology for pharmaceutical supply chain tracking](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fantom-blockchain-launch-smart-medicine-103000039.html) to combat counterfeit drugs. More recently, Fantom [partnered with DABS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fantom-launches-blockchain-pilot-afghanistan-100000458.html), the national energy company for Afghanistan, to build blockchain-based ERP and CRM systems. Another program involves [the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Investment to implement blockchain tools for auditing and authentication purposes.](https://fantom.foundation/blog/acci-fantom-pilot-program/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=fc807837d997e590f21b20adb6972d65aa0369a9-1613695821-0-AQmeswbGk2HLX3Q8Q-7BSdgfFzEERILHjQwfIjI_4ThPyuotouz1gTAB1GkQzXnc37yf8Upy1dcT-QIq2o-DC_A8AqWg1bTnzpKA4fid5uMuF10xwOYNkEIbjtd3p8kWz_1jQKPJbaWuUqNeS5THXMsFuxLq4maJeXz0IRIujOIzYz9L_rv7j-aFwmhnYzSFGP57JC49WQTTmbc6Gk0Gl4aAcYqsb3zTtsEpKB_lWtDXZvCdOZXGFcv0BwfNKokJVb90SwSkYdILQjkYAwvTU-No_anIiZ9bvXnIu6dBM4MPZGIoV2NItRtwyQpcZcB6dIww7_VDu2T6_8jvO_iwiQUBKk2KotrDKTDtDuOz6DWU) The team aims to digitize the whole country of Afghanistan and ultimately build a national stock exchange on the Fantom blockchain. The latest pilot program (announced today itself) with [The Afghanistan National Standard Authority will use Fantom technology to issue national certifications.](https://fantom.foundation/blog/ansa-fantom-blockchain-issuance-program/) 

Also, just three days ago, the announcement was made that [The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine has signed a memorandum which provides for cooperation in creating a platform for the exchange of intellectual property based on the Fantom blockchain](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayinska-delegaciya-pid-golovuvannyam-volodimira-zelenskog-66549)

**It has a transparent and humble team**
The Fantom team is very transparent and humble. They communicate promptly - they have one of the most active [Twitter accounts in crypto](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN), they’re hard-working and as clear as they can be with the community. It almost feels like the team is part of the community. Besides their [official chat on Discord](www.chat.fantom.network), they also offer a support chat on their website, unheard of in crypto. Their Github is updated frequently, almost daily, and it’s easy to see what they’re working on at any given time.

**It’s getting integrated everywhere**
Besides centralized exchanges like Binance, Fantom is taking over the DeFi space. It’s listed on Uniswap, Sushiswap and 1inch. It’s just the beginning. We can speculate that once the Ren bridges are in place, there will be more integrations on Ethereum. We can think of Yearn, Curve, and all the biggest DeFi money markets.

**It’s on Coinbase Custody**
Coinbase Custody is the most important crypto custodian in the world and [it supports Fantom](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseInsto/status/1354563754713903110). Institutions and funds can now safely store their FTM with a trusted third party. It’s the first step to getting listed to Coinbase.

**Etherscan has built an explorer for them**
The Etherscan team has recently built [FTMScan](www.ftmscan.com), an explorer for Fantom. Previously, they only made Etherscan and an explorer for Binance. If that doesn’t tell you something, my friend, it’s on you.

There you have it. After years of following this project and doing DD with the help of my fellow Fantom Marines I just wanted to put out a good piece on why I think Fantom deserves at least a small bag in your crypto portfolio. Good luck!"
Filtering posts from usernames suggested on signup,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/ln5kpe/filtering_posts_from_usernames_suggested_on_signup/,rotorcowboy,1,2021-02-19 11:32:48,20,/r/ModSupport/comments/ln5kpe/filtering_posts_from_usernames_suggested_on_signup/,NaN,"I noticed that a lot of the lowest quality content in my subreddits often come from users who select a [suggested username](https://i.imgur.com/zAYSOWU.png) on account creation. You know, that name format that's often ""Adjective-Noun_Number"", always with the first letter of each word capitalized, and optionally dashes or underscores between each element. This may or may not be the case for you, but when someone is looking for a quick throwaway account, they'll often use a username suggested by Reddit.

To account for this, I put together an AutoModerator rule that will filter posts from these users, here:

    action: remove
    action_reason: Reddit suggested username

Of course, you can adjust the action to ""filter"" or ""report"" as you see fit.

I really wanted to avoid false positives, so I couldn't build a generic regex to filter usernames with any two words followed by a number. Instead, I requested username suggestions over and over again, taking note of each word that appeared.

There is no way for me to tell if this is the entire dictionary Reddit uses to make usernames since I'm given random selections every time, but I've been running the collection for a good while now with no new appearances. This should hopefully catch the vast majority of suggested usernames. Some words appear more often than others, with ""Ad"" the clear front runner.

I'm not here to decide if this rule is right for your subreddit. Perhaps your subreddit offers technical or mental health support where throwaways are common and expected, and that's okay. I'm only providing this rule to those interested.

Happy modding!"
[Uni] Enjoy Math? Considering Computer Science Degree? Why not consider Mathematical Sciences Degree?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lnbkr7/uni_enjoy_math_considering_computer_science/,math_dydx,1,2021-02-19 17:13:04,33,/r/SGExams/comments/lnbkr7/uni_enjoy_math_considering_computer_science/,University :snoo_smile:,"tl;dr: A math degree is a good choice in the age of data science and AI. There are many exciting jobs for a math degree graduate. If you enjoy doing math, you should really consider a math degree.

Congratulations for completing your A Levels!

I am a recent graduate of NTU Math with minor in finance. This post intends to give insights to what a math degree is about, as well as encourage those who enjoy doing math to consider doing a math degree.

I decided to write this post as I feel a math degree is really underrated in this age of data science and AI. Many A Level graduates who enjoy doing math, tend to go to engineering, business, and computer science degree, without considering a math degree. For those who is interested in computer science degree, after reading this post, you might find yourself interested and suited for a math degree. Practically, as we know in recent years, IGP for computer science is rising year after year. What if your results fall below computer science degree cut off but you still want to enter to IT, cyber security, data science, AI industry? A math degree will be a good choice!

First up. I will talk about job prospects of a math degree graduate. Look at “Mathematical Sciences” in the following link:

[https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/careertracks/be\_inspired\_college\_science.html](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/careertracks/be_inspired_college_science.html) 

It gives a detailed breakdown on the percentage of NTU Math graduates who went to take on jobs in various sectors and their common job titles. Personally, I have friends who graduated from NTU Math, that went on to be:

1. Statistician in Department of Stats (DOS), Singapore, where he analyses govt available data to help govt formulate policies
2. Data/AI Engineer in Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) where he write codes to crunch big data and use artificial intelligence to gain insights to govt data. He was promoted to senior engineer in his 3rd year in DSTA
3. Statistician at Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore where he analyses new games to roll out in Singapore casino to ensure fair casino game using statistical techniques
4. Cryptanalyst at CSIT where he analyses the security of websites to prevent cyberattacks
5. Researcher at Defence Science Organisation (DSO) where he embark on interesting research projects involving lots of math/data/AI to help in defence of Singapore
6. Further studies for a research career (PhD in Math, Economics, Finance, Computer Science) - There are quite significant number that went to further studies. This is because research at PhD level in many quantitative disciplines (Math, Economics, Finance, Computer Science, etc.) requires lots of math, and a math degree gives you a strong math foundation to do advance research in many quantitative disciplines. I know of peers who are doing Phd in US universities and local universities.

As can be seen above, there are many job prospects for NTU math grads, and common job prospects are stated above. In this age of AI and big data, math degree is one of the best degrees out there to prepare for AI and big data career, as computer science is actually a kind of applied math. Thus, math degree should not be tough to find a job, with so many AI and big data jobs out there, even now when the economy is pretty bad. Above also shows that math degree does not just end up becoming math teacher in schools, which many people have misconception of a math degree.

Btw, NTU has recently introduce Double Major in Math and Computer Science. So those who want to have the strengths of having good training in math and computer science can go for this double major. This double major is 4 years programme compared to NUS 5 Years Double Degree in Math and Computer Science. Also, there is NTU Single Major Data Science and AI (DSAI) programme, which cater for students who already knew they wanted to go into the field of DSAI. The programme tailor the modules to suit specifically for DSAI field.

After knowing the good prospects of a math degree graduate, you would want to know what a math degree is all about. The following YouTube video produced by NTU Math department gives an overview of the exciting opportunities that a university math degree can offer you:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6-BI\_Yk3TQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6-BI_Yk3TQ) 

In NTU Math, there are 4 specialisations/tracks (Pure Math, Applied Math, Statistics, Business Analytics). I will talk about each of these tracks below:

Pure math is about studying math for the sake of its beauty. Thus, pure math usually revolves around topics like number theory, theoretical computer science, topology, analysis etc. An example of pure math question is how many prime numbers are there? It focuses a lot on fundamental proofs and understanding of the inherent structure of math in nature. Interesting problems such as:

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-lee-spending-some-vacation-time-on-the-collatz-conjecture-5-things-about-the-unsolved](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-lee-spending-some-vacation-time-on-the-collatz-conjecture-5-things-about-the-unsolved) 

Statistics track focus on learning the process of analysing data (from collection to analysing), their theorems and models used. You will take modules that prepare you to analyse and interpret data in a mathematically sound way. You will develop the ability to know when to perform what kind of statistical tests etc. It will involve coding to analyse big data, interpreting data to give accurate prediction of events in the face of uncertainty.

Business Analytics track is very similar to statistics track. The difference is you will take lesser statistics module in exchange for taking some compulsory business modules from biz school, as well as some electives from the computer science school. It will give you a business perspective in dealing with data using statistical techniques. While statistics focus more on the theory and motivation behind the statistical techniques, so as to prepare one well for statistician role and even research career in statistics.

Applied math is about using math to solve real world problems. Applied math focuses a lot on coding and algorithms. There are few main subareas in applied math.

**Subarea 1: Cyber security**

Nowadays got a lot of cyber-attacks on government websites. So, cryptography and coding theory are important areas that helps to secure our information using rigorous mathematics. Graduates can go on to be cryptanalyst, cryptographer, IT specialist in cyber security firms or like CSIT, Govtech.

**Subarea 2: Operations research and Optimisation**

In many businesses, they need to find the best way to operate their businesses. Such as best way to deploy manpower. Such as airport need plan which airplane follow by which airplane to take-off next. Such as where should a business open its first shop, second shop in Singapore? A good plan is important as it will save time and resources, and potentially gain more profits. Thus, lots of math is needed to solve math business operations problems. Companies hire operations research analyst to optimise their business processes.

**Subarea 3: Mathematical Modelling and Optimisation**

Mathematical Modelling plays an important role in modelling our real world. It plays an essential role in the current pandemic. Take a look at what MIT researchers in the field of mathematical modelling and optimisation did:

[https://www.covidanalytics.io/](https://www.covidanalytics.io/)

In summary, they:

1. Develop an epidemiological model to take into account government policies in predicting the number of cases curve
2. Develop clinical risk calculators using tree-based machine learning to learn the large size of clinical symptoms data worldwide (They have infection risk calculator and clinical mortality risk calculator)
3. Resource Allocation Optimisation (What is the best way to distribute ventilators to the various states in US, when various states is fighting at different stage of infection)

**Subarea 4: Algorithms**

Every time we use google maps, how google maps suggest different routes that are the best for us? Google use sophisticated and efficient algorithms that uses math to try out many many routes and gave us the best routes. To develop this kind of algorithm, math knowledge in graph theory, algorithmic complexity theory etc is required.

**Subarea 5: Finance**

Nowadays trading in banks are automated. How do bankers know what to invest in? Financial mathematics is an important emerging area where professionals use sophisticated differential equations (such as the famous Black Scholes equation) to model real world financial markets. In fact, there are many big banks hire mathematicians to do the sophisticated math, that a typical business (finance) degree cannot do. Some math degree graduates went on to study Phd in Finance, Phd in Math, researching on financial models

**Subarea 6: Economics and Game Theory**

Economics in universities involve lots of math. In fact, NTU has a relatively new double major in Mathematical Sciences and Economics. An interesting area of mathematical economics is game theory. Example what kind of voting rules is fair in elections, and the study of how to design voting rules and game rules to ensure fair play. Game theory concepts are used in formulating policies as well. These require sophisticated mathematical tools. Another interesting example is the Median Voting Theorem mentioned in a recent post:

**Subarea 7: Scientific Computation**

Numerical analysis is about methods used to find approximate solutions to lots of mathematical problems. Because a lot of times say certain integral is very hard to solve, and many a times u do not need the exact answer, maybe you just need answer accurate to certain decimal places. Thus, this area of math is scientific computation, where efficiency of techniques and algorithms used to solve the approximate answer for derivative, integral, differential equations numerically are looked into. This area of math is useful in many industries, that needs an accurate numerical solution to problems. Such as in engineering, miscalculation may lead to serious accidents.

And actually, many more subareas of applied math. 

You may now ask when to choose the specialisation/track. For NTU math, the first 1.5 years will be taking introductory math modules across the 3 main specialisations (pure math, applied math, statistics). So, you get to have a feel of university math standard of pure math, applied math, statistics before choosing your specialisation after 1.5 years. In a way, you will have learnt a bit of the foundation of each of the specialisation. This will help you to make an informed choice of track after 1.5 years. Before university, I thought of going into statistics track. I thought I am quite good in statistics based on JC H2 Math. But eventually after taking the 1st university stats module, I realise I am not that good in university stats. Furthermore, I develop an interest in algorithms and coding in the first 1.5 years, thus, I chose applied math eventually.

So, the ultimate question: Computer Science or Mathematical Science? If you are more interested in software engineering, developing computer systems, then go for computer science degree. If you are more interested in the actual math behind the algorithms and in general you like math but not sure which area of math to go into yet, then go for mathematical science degree. If you are interested in both, consider NTU double major in mathematical and computer sciences.

I am more than willing to share my experience in NTU Math, as well as my understanding of university math."

 02/19/2021 Morning Forecast [https://youtu.be/cqRkettHAb8](https://youtu.be/cqRkettHAb8) \-Markets are implying a move of 1.33%+/-(up/down) on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have realized a move of 1.00%+/-(up/down). The difference between what market makers are implying and what has been realized has widened. The spread increased to 7 basis points. The put/call gamma imbalance is skewed towards short-dated calls on dip buying. However, a widening spread increases left-tail risk and spikes in realized volatility upside. Realized volatility has stabilized but recently has dropped below 16. This is favorable for a continued melt-up. The S&amp;P is expected to move close to 1.27% up/down this week, which means the S&amp;P is likely to remain 13% to 15% above its 200 DAY Moving average (3,402.) Weather disturbances due to Arctic Air/Polar Vortex continue to weigh on the Midwest, Southwest, and Southern States, which will negatively impact growth in Q1 2021. Forecasters were expecting nominal growth of 300 Billion and Real Growth of Economic output of 130 Billion for the 1st quarter of 2021. I suspect in-climate weather is likely to shave off 30-50 Billion in economic output nationally. Weak Non-Farm Payrolls along with slowing growth in Real GDP in the 4th Qrt are key economic indicators likely to pressure growth in the 1st half of 2021. However, a finalized fiscal deficit package of 1.9 Trillion via reconciliation in Q1 2021 is expected, which is a significant tailwind to nominal growth in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This assumes virus cases come down and pandemic flare-ups lessen. Larger fiscal dissavings increases capital inflows to finance VERY large TWIN DEFICITS, which should put upward pressure on the US Dollar &amp; downward pressure on Corporate &amp; Government Bond Yields. Dollar appreciation dampens inflation and should lead to temporary transitory base effects. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img yvm0eqh7kgi61...*

 Inflationistah and inflation fear-mongers engaging in scare tactics are likely to be proven wrong. However, there are some base effect short-term transitory spikes in inflation data from Feb/March/April/ and May. Market Expectations are split, but I expect the Federal Reserve will look through these spikes. Political risks have diminished in the 1st quarter due to reconciliation, but it has increased in the 2nd half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, which may pose risk too much-needed Investment spending (infrastructure, human capital, &amp; research development), so I view it in the medium term as tilted to the upside due to potential gridlock. Following this weekend's Congressional failure to hold public officials accountable Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorism Risk increases.  Congressional Cowardice is being viewed Globally as a significant sign of WEAKNESS and Disorientation in Western Democracies this increases FOREIGN TERRORISM RISK. IMHO it endangers all 330 Million Americans (regardless of political affiliation.) Negative labor data fosters a rise in economic uncertainty. Vaccine distribution priced into Q3 2021, but distribution obstacles have increased and efficacy for herd immunity will be closely watched. Details are currently unknown.  The market is currently pricing in an additional 4.0% move +/- (up/down) by March 19th. The S&amp;P 500 could potentially trade as high as 4,084.08 and as low as 3,775.61 by March 19th. The VIX is expected to move 7.61% (points), the VIX is currently 22.14. The VIX price range is 23.82 to 20.57. The Skew Index is EXTREMELY elevated, which indicates market participants are paying up for catastrophic protection (2 sigma event).

 Stocks continue to offer investors the highest real returns. The nominal yield on equities is 4.5%, while the nominal yield on 10yr Treasury is 1.27%. Real yields on all tenors of government bonds are decisively negative, while real yields on US Equities are positive.\*\*Disclaimer with Realized Volatility rising above 12 there is a larger risk of systematic highly leveraged short vol strategies like Equity Vol Targeting, Trend Following, and Risk Parity positioned for a selloff and reduction in market exposure. The potential for a MUCH larger DELAYED sell off 4% to 5% is coming. The Mar/Apr VIX contracts at 25 &amp; 28 are still under-priced. They should price near 39 to 47 IMHO-I STRONGLY believe February 2021 could replicate February 2018, however, I have been wrong before.

### What is Alpha Finance?

Alpha Finance Lab is building an **ecosystem of DeFi products** that will interoperate to maximize returns while minimizing risks for users. Alpha products focus on **capturing unaddressed demand in DeFi in an innovative and user friendly way.**

Each Alpha product will address market gaps and problems in the sector the product is in. The various Alpha products will then work together to achieve the overarching theme of **maximizing returns for users while offering a synergistic solution to minimize downside exposure/risk**.

This focus underpins the opportunities we choose to evaluate and decisions we make, as we cannot capture every opportunity, but rather only the ones that have clear unaddressed demand and market gaps and bring synergy to Alpha ecosystem. By doing so, we will be able to thrive and dominate in such verticals, continue to disrupt the industry, and bring superior value proposition compared to existing solutions in the market.

### Alpha Product #1: Alpha Homora

Alpha Homora is leveraged yield farming and leveraged liquidity providing protocol. Lenders can earn high interest. Yield farmers can get even higher farming APY and trading fees APY.

### ETH Lenders 🧙⬆️

*Interest Bearing ETH (ibETH)*: When users deposit ETH to Bank, they receive a proportional amount of **ibETH** token, a tradable and interest-bearing asset that represents their shares of ETH in the bank pool, similar to cToken in [Compound](https://compound.finance/).

*EARN INTEREST*: Interest paid by ETH borrowers are distributed to ETH lenders\*, proportionate to the amount of ETH lent.\*\* Lenders’ interest rate depends on ETH utilization rate; the higher the the utilization, the higher the interest rate.

&gt;*\*Note: Borrower’s interest rate model follows* [*triple-slope-curve*](https://blog.alphafinance.io/3-changes/)*.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*\*\*Note: 10% of borrower’s interest will go into Bank Reserves, which can be used as an insurance fund for lenders in case of unexpected scenarios. In the future, Bank Reserve authority may transition to community governance.*

### 💰Example investment of transferring ETH to ibETH

This position can be accessed here 👉 [https://homora.alphafinance.io/earn](https://homora.alphafinance.io/earn)

Logic:

**ETH** current price = \~$*2020*

**ibETH** current price = \~ 2,120.63

\~*4.4* **ETH** to buy \~*4.23* **ibETH**

&amp;#x200B;

**Txn Fee** = *0.012885003* **ETH**

**Txn Fee** = $*26.41425615*

multiply **Txn Fee** x 2 because we want to eventually transfer our **ibETH** back to **ETH**

total **Txn Fee** = \~ $60

[*https://homora.alphafinance.io/earn*](https://homora.alphafinance.io/earn)

 

ibETH APY \~ seems to hover around 15%

**4.4 ETH** = \~$8903.53USD

8903.53 \* 0.15 = $1,335.53 / yr

$1335.53 gained per year on interest on your ETH. What’s cool about this product is that you are still exposed to ETH price fluctuations whilst earning interest.

Another cool thing about interest you generate from lending pools is that you don’t have to worry about [arbitrage risks that you have in liquidity pools.](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-arbitrage-trading)

#### How long will it take to cover the Txn Fee to and from?

1,335.53/52 = \~$25.68/wk

So it will take \~2 weeks to earn the interest on the fees required to enter into an ibETH position if you are moving \~$9000 worth of ETH

One thing to note here is that the time it takes to earn back the transaction fee cost from transferring ETH to ibETH is correlated to the amount of value you are moving.

more value 👉 less time

less value 👉 more time

 \-------------------------------------------------

One thing very attractive about the ibETH token and providing your value to this specific ETH lending pool is the way the utilization occurs.

Lending can only be an attractive investment opportunity if that which is being deposited, is actually being borrowed, because if the utilization rate is low, then the APY for the pool will correlate. Take a look at AAVE ETH leanding / borrowing pool for comparison

&amp;#x200B;

APY for depositing ETH is only 0.18%

Why is it so low? Because the utilization rate is only 11.98%

&amp;#x200B;

How is Alpha Finance able to attract such high utilization rate of ETH?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is because of their leveraged yield farming / liquidity providing positions

https://preview.redd.it/pkcpb008cpi61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8df32b2f9626379efce01e40499b37f13c68ae46

[*https://homora.alphafinance.io/farm*](https://homora.alphafinance.io/farm)

These positions allow the user to take leverage to their position. The leverage first comes from the ibETH bank, before it goes elsewhere.

Goodluck with your ibETH investments!

The Game Known As Oddity - Formal Complaint Letter #47,https://www.reddit.com/r/OddityComplaintLetter/comments/lq7fcs/the_game_known_as_oddity_formal_complaint_letter/,BioMagus,1,2021-02-23 10:58:47,0,/r/OddityComplaintLetter/comments/lq7fcs/the_game_known_as_oddity_formal_complaint_letter/,NaN,"This is to voice my dissatisfaction with Oddity’s goals. Here’s the story: Oddity is utterly undiplomatic. We all are, to some extent, but it sets the curve. While you or I might find it natural to want to shut off the valve of despotism that is letting such evil flow into our society, I once managed to get it to agree that its whole approach is maladroit. Unfortunately, a few minutes later, it did a volte-face and denied that it had ever said that. It is becoming increasingly obvious to many people that many, many people have been hurt by it for daring to shatter the illusion that our only chance of saving the planet is to accept unending regulations and straightjacket reforms from its lickspittles. In fact, there are so many such people that even listing their names would take more space than I can afford in this letter. In their honor, though, I will say that we are a nation of prostitutes. By this I mean that as long as we are fat, warm, and dry we don’t care what Oddity does. It is precisely that lack of caring that explains why Oddity’s idea of stoicism is not, as you might expect, a mild paraphrase for transmogrifying society’s petty gripes and irrational fears into issues to be catered to. It is something else entirely: an ossified doctrine of antipathy towards those who stand together and exemplify the principles of honor, duty, loyalty, and courage. As evidence, consider that it should clarify its point so people like you and me can tell what the heck it’s talking about. Without clarification, its politics sound lofty and include some emotionally charged words but don’t really seem to make any sense.More often than not, I unmistakably hope that if we all make Oddity answer for its wrongdoings, this will bring us together in a national dialogue of learning instead of reducing us to recriminations and accusations. At a minimum, I expect it to help a large number of people see that I am 99% sure that Oddity will produce culturally degenerate films and videos within a short period of time. Go on; bet me. While delusional, sordid clodpates have previously relied on violence to get their way, their new manipulation of cynical ballyhoos has combined with violence to disguise the complexity of color, the brutality of class, and the importance of religion and sexual identity in the construction and practice of jingoism.Sure, the things Oddity does are wrong, blowsy, refractory, gormless—you name it. But it has repeatedly threatened to pit people against each other. Maybe that’s just for maximum scaremongering effect. Or maybe it’s because I don’t blame Oddity’s combative wisecracks as much as I blame the generations of stinking leguleians who internalized such indelicate things into their personalities. Maybe it’s not their fault, though. Maybe it’s because Oddity knows that many, if not most, spiteful, illiberal psychopaths rely solely on emotion, not reason and evidence, to determine what is real and what is fake. Oddity exploits this knowledge and those people in its incessant quest for power.It is disgraceful that, with a wink and a smile, Oddity has signified its approval of amateurish, whiney braggarts who engage in or goad others into engaging in illegal acts. We all need to be aware of each other’s existence as intelligent, feeling, human beings, even if some of us are unhinged pinheads. Common-sense understanding of human nature tells us that superficiality and racism have become its medals of honor. Oddity displays them as exemplary measures of achievement. What I would consider real achievement, however, is using evidence-based arguments when discussing issues with it. Oddity is able to argue only from emotionalism. It doesn’t argue from a logical, linear point of view. Hence, by taking on Oddity at its false premises one can easily demonstrate that as soon as the time is ripe I will weed out organizations like Oddity that have deceived, betrayed, and exploited us. This isn’t just a public-relations move. It’s a real move to get people to see that it’s possible that when confronted with the real facts, Oddity usually defends itself with some weak explanation about how snobbism is something to be treasured, respected, admired, and protected. However, I cannot speculate about that possibility here because I need to devote more space to a description of how I shall not argue that Oddity’s newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to meddle in everyone else’s affairs. Read them and see for yourself.No doubt, my prime directive is to justify condemnation, constructive criticism, and ridicule of Oddity and its slatternly obiter dicta. But Oddity hates people who have huge supplies of the things it lacks. What it lacks the most is common sense, which underlies my point that bettering the world is apparently the last item on Oddity’s to-do list. End of story. Actually, I should add that this is not Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, where the state would be eager to irritate an incredible number of people. Not yet, at least. But it is entirely feasible for us to oust Oddity and its iniquitous hirelings from anywhere we find them abusing science by using it as a mechanism of ideology. For the benefit of any doubting Thomases I will prove that point via an explanation of how Oddity’s premise (that there’s nothing wrong with making mountains out of molehills) is its morality disguised as pretended neutrality. Oddity uses this disguised morality to support its diegeses, thereby making its argument self-refuting.Maybe it’s just me, but don’t you think that Oddity is never without a warped thing to say? Yes, I realize that I, for one, am fed up with Oddity’s endless satires and critiques of those hardworking people who serve their country by keeping its serfs at bay, but for the sake of brevity I’ve had to express myself in simplified terms. I mean, really. Here’s a specific example of the way in which its counterproductive orations create a mechanism of censorship that begs to be abused and manipulated by those in power: It wants to violate its pledge not to call for ritualistic invocations of needlessly formal rules.What I want to know is, will the world ever be free of boisterous nupsons like Oddity? That’s what I want to know. I mean, I wish I didn’t have to waste one second of my time or burn one calorie of my energy dealing with the relevant facts. Unfortunately, if I were to shirk this important responsibility, Oddity would immediately create a system of absenteeism characterized by confidential files, closed courts, gag orders, and statutory immunity. So far, this letter has merely identified the ways in which failure to define our terms more clearly will lead to a deluge of complaints by its fellow travelers. Now, let me shift gears and start telling you about how there are many roads leading to the defeat of its plans to spread ruin widely through the land. I surely believe that all of these roads must eventually pass through the same set of gates: the ability to proscribe Oddity and its hangers-on as the most dangerous enemies of the people. It may seem difficult to do that. It is. But there isn’t a man, woman, or child alive today who thinks that it is Oddity’s moral imperative to sentence more and more people to poverty, prison, and early death, so let’s toss out that ridiculous argument of Oddity’s from the get-go.Think about it. If Oddity has any spinoffs, I recommend that it teach them about love, trust, cooperation, community, reason, negotiation, and compromise rather than violence, paranoia, and fear. Because it wasn’t listening when I said this before, I’m forced to repeat myself: I am not au fait with its latest ideas. I am, however, quite familiar with the manner in which Oddity has been concealing information and, occasionally, blatantly lying. In particular, I know that there’s already plenty of injustice in the world. We honestly don’t need it adding to it by promoting the arrogant allegations of abominable, pea-brained wrongdoers.Were you to ask me, I’d say that Oddity’s cock-and-bull stories are merely a stalking horse. They mask its secret intention to impact public policy for years to come. From a public-policy perspective, its legates often reverse the normal process of interpretation. That is, they value the unsaid over the said, the obscure over the clear. Once, just once, I’d like to see its pickthanks send a strong message to it that addresses the depth and breadth of our concerns with its daffy anecdotes. But until they do that (if they ever do that), we must realize that its use of the term philosophicojuristic displays, at best, a tone deafness. The term drips with echoes of Machiavellianism and warns us all that Oddity keeps insisting that it’s jackbooted to condemn its hypocrisy. To me, there is something fundamentally wrong with that story. Maybe it’s that Oddity doesn’t use words for communication or for exchanging information. It uses them to disarm, to hypnotize, to mislead, and to deceive.What Oddity does in private is none of my business. But when it tries to foment, precipitate, and finance large-scale wars to emasculate and bankrupt nations and thereby force them into a one-world government, I object. If its philippics aren’t lethargic, I don’t know what is. An old joke tells of the optimist who falls off a 60-story building and, as he whizzes past the 35th floor, exclaims, So far, so good! But it is not such blind optimism that causes Oddity’s winged monkeys to think that they can reinvent and manipulate words and criminalize ideas. My vision that some day, people everywhere will establish liberté, egalité, fraternité is an inspiring dream. Unfortunately, reality always awakens me and reminds me that Oddity spouts all sorts of puffery about its moral vigor. Well, sure, it has somehow found the fortitude to endure our ongoing humiliation and discomfort at the hands of its disciples, but the larger point is that Oddity demands that its platitudes be discussed in only the most positive light. To ensure that this demand is met, it sends its platoon of superficial psychics after anyone who fails to show the utmost deference when planting big, wet, sloppy kisses on Oddity’s behind. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it."
A simple strategy for protecting your investment and increasing your bags,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqvluq/a_simple_strategy_for_protecting_your_investment/,da_f3nix,26,2021-02-24 06:58:26,46,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqvluq/a_simple_strategy_for_protecting_your_investment/,FINANCE,"Here’s a strategy I found useful for myself in these 4 years of crypto-rollercoaster and I would like to share it with you. 

When you invest you want to profit but - first of all and shitcoin YOLOing apart - you need to protect your initial capital. Here’s, through an example, how I do that plus, at the same time, take the chance of market volatility to increase my stake:

1. Initial investment: $1000

2. Now let’s suppose a 300% gain: $4000. Edit: no bragging, random number, this is an *example* to explain a technique in finance. Yes it implies a profit scenario. 

3. At this point, I create a reserve of liquidity equal to the initial capital of $1000. I suggest a stablecoin (I prefer DAI, being a decentralized one). This will also have the function to exploit a possible downtrend in price without having to play short positions.

4. Keeping aside such reserve, I will let the remaining $3000 work and like this never run the risk of losing the original amount.

5. At the same time, the liquidity reserve doesn’t have to stay stuck there: I can provide my DAI into Compound supply markets for 7,05% APY, or try Curve or even Yearn for an increasing APY (check loanscan.io for an overview and be aware that everything has a part of risk).

6. Finally, I can eventually use such liquidity for buying the dip in a bear downtrend and increase my stake. Then rinse and repeat.

Here’s how you can safely increase your positions and protect your money. The cash you put aside doesn’t necessarily have to be all your starting capital and of course, there are many variations, some of which more sophisticated. However, I’m mainly a long-term opportunistic hodler and I like to keep things simple, for how they can be. I always learned a lot from this community and hope this will help, especially the newcomers who maybe remained a bit traumatized by the recent days (judging from the daily): don’t worry, it will soon pass and one day you’ll be dead inside too."

This job started yesterday and I had NO CLUE what was going on. In my internship we mostly used Peoplesoft and Excel and the supervisors were really helpful. I graduated in June 2020 and this is my first job out of college and it’s fully remote. We use this software called Sage Intacct and I’m just clueless on the directions. I’ve only taken up to intermediate accounting I and that was like 2.5 yrs ago. The supervisor also didn’t help at all. I guess I should have asked more questions but my work laptop that they sent wasn’t working either so IT is sending another one. I can’t really work until the new laptop arrives. 

Is this is a sign that I am not fit for this job and should I start looking elsewhere or do most people feel this way for their first job out of college?

Futures Tumble As Tech Stocks, Cryptocurrencies Crash
TUESDAY, FEB 23, 2021 – 7:44
Global stocks, US equity futures and cryptocurrencies all tumbled on Tuesday as the recent surge in inflation, bond yields and commodity prices continued to hammer technology shares while investors awaited fresh reassurance from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the path for monetary policy in United States.

The MSCI world equity index fell 0.1% to fresh two-week lows, having earlier risen on gains in commodity-heavy equity indexes in Asia. After rising during the Asian session, S&amp;P 500 futures also fell once Europen came online, and were last down 0.4%.



Nasdaq futures tumbled as much as 2%, and were last down 1.4% a day after the tech-heavy gauge posted its longest losing streak in four months. Heavyweight tech stocks slid premarket, with Apple -2.7%, Amazon -2.4%, Tesla -7.5%, Alphabet -1.6%. Tesla crashed 6% in pre-market trading, sliding below the $695 level at which it entered the S&amp;P500.  Tesla shares were set to plunge into the red for the year, hit by a fall of bitcoin, in which the electric carmaker recently invested $1.5 billion.



Adding to the risk off mood, Bitcoin resumed its recent plunge, plunging as much as 17% below $46,000, down over $12,000 from recent highs after a bout of volatility highlighted lingering doubts about the durability of the token’s rally.



“The prospect of a less dovish tone from central banks, sparked by rising inflation, is causing stock traders to reduce their exposure to equities, especially overbought sectors like tech,” said Pierre Veyret, analyst at ActivTrades in London. Another concern among investors is that broad benchmarks have already priced in much of the prospective global recovery spurred by vaccines and U.S. stimulus. Alongside rising inflation, another is that central banks may eventually start reconsidering emergency programs that have supported global markets.

Europe’s Stoxx 600 was down -0.8%, sliding as much as 1.6% earlier, with Tech stocks leading losses. European tech stocks were on set for their worst day in four months, down 2.7%, and the worst-performing index in Europe, as chip-equipment makers plunged  amid market rotation out of more expensive sectors. Pandemic winners also dive. The index fell as much as 3.9% to a three-week low, the steepest intraday drop since Oct. 26. Chip- equipment makers, which have benefited amid a global shortage of semiconductors and are among the best-performing tech stocks in Europe this year, declined sharply: BE Semi -7.2%, ASMI -6.1%, ASML -3.4%. On the other end, mall operators, office landlords and events companies rose in Europe on increasing optimism about the prospects for reopening the Covid-hit economy following news that Germany mulled loosening the rules for easing lockdown restrictions. That followed the U.K. having set out an aim to gradually ease restrictions in stages over the next four months.

Here are some of the biggest European movers today:

Chip stocks fall on Tuesday, weighing on the Stoxx Tech Index, reflecting declines across U.S. semiconductor peers late Monday, as market rotation out of more expensive stocks and sectors gathers pace.
Covestro shares jump as much as 3.4% before erasing gain in Frankfurt; Commerzbank says the company published a “strong” 1Q outlook, but a cautious view on 2Q to 4Q, leaving upside to consensus.
U.K. domestically oriented stocks gained on Tuesday as travel and entertainment shares surged after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to reopen the economy.
KPN shares tumble as much as 10%, their biggest one-day drop since June 2016, as America Movil sells around EU2.2b of bonds exchangeable into shares in the Dutch phone company.
Adyen shares drop as much as 4.5% to a two-week low of EU2,056, after a pre-IPO investor sells shares in the payments firm.
Earlier in the session, Asian stocks rose clearly unaware of the shitstorm that was about to be unleashed by European traders, with equity benchmarks in Thailand and Hong Kong the biggest gainers in the region. The SET Index jumped as much as 2%, with tourism and leisure stocks rallying the most on the gauge amid optimism over the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines and relaxation of pandemic-led restrictions. Casino operators Galaxy Entertainment Group and Sands China surged to be among the top gainers on the Hang Seng Index, after Macau reopened to quarantine-free travel from mainland China. Energy was the top-performing sector in Asia as oil surged toward $63 a barrel. Investment banks and traders predicting the market will tighten further and push prices higher. Technology was the worst performer. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index headed for its first gain in four sessions, with equity benchmarks in Australia and Singapore also rising. Stocks were lower in South Korea and Malaysia, while Japanese markets were shut for a holiday.

India stocks ended little changed, after swinging between gains and losses several times in the session. The S&amp;P BSE Sensex closed marginally higher at 49,751.41 in Mumbai, while the NSE Nifty 50 Index added 0.2%. Both gauges had retreated more than 4% through Monday from record highs on Feb. 15. Reliance Industries Ltd. gave the biggest boost to both measures after saying it plans to spin off its oil-to-chemicals operation into an independent unit. A gauge of metal companies was the top performer among the 19 sector indexes compiled by BSE Ltd

Rising inflation bets spurred by the global economic recovery have hammered stocks in the past week. The level of angst was also reflected in various equity volatility gauges which rose to multi-week highs, while on bond markets German and U.S. yields moved in different directions, even though both remained just below the highs hit on Monday.

After being knocked off from eight-month high by European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde signalling discomfort with the recent surge in yields, 10-year Bund yields resumed their upward trend and were last at -0.297%.

In rates, Treasuries steadied on Tuesday, below Monday’s one-year high of 1.394% and were last at 1.360%. Yields were cheaper by ~1bp across long-end of the curve, steepening 5s30s by ~2bp after the 5s30s touched the highest level in more than six years. A wider bear-steepening move in under way in bunds, which trade 4bp cheaper vs Treasuries. The curve steepened, pivoting around a little-changed 10-year sector. Month-end re-balancing flows are moving into focus as traders anticipate rotation into bonds. Auction cycle begins with 2-year notes, while Fed Chair Powell delivers semi-annual monetary policy report.  Most peripheral and semi-core spreads widen to Germany; Italy outperforms, tightening ~1bps at the long end

Traders will be waiting to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell when he testifies to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services panel the following day. He’s expected to be reassuring on the central bank’s dovish stance when he gives his congressional testimony at 1500 GMT in Washington, and to play down the risk of inflation despite the size of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal.

“Fed Chair Jay Powell will be torn today,” ING analysts led by Padhraic Garveywrote in a anote. “A bit of inflation is a good thing; it’s what the Fed has wanted. But too much anticipation of it is not good, as it tightens policy prematurely.”

“If there were already any expectations that Powell could try to calm down rates, then (Lagarde’s remarks) have just further cemented them,” said Giuseppe Sersale, strategist and fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.

In currency markets, the dollar briefly dropped to its lowest since Jan. 13 before advancing against most G-10 peers, with traders waiting to see if Powell will address the selloff in Treasuries. The pound led G-10 gains, nearing $1.41 as investors digested the U.K.’s plan to open up the economy. The Canadian dollar outperformed most peers as oil prices continued their ascent.  The dollar index was up 0.1% at 90.137, with the euro flat at $1.215.

Commodity prices strengthened again with Copper extending gains, while WTI crude rose toward $63 a barrel. Oil prices jumped by more than $1 at one point, underpinned by optimism over COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and lower output as U.S. supplies were slow to return after a deep freeze in Texas shut in crude production last week. Brent crude was last up 0.7% at $65.7 a barrel after earlier hitting a fresh 13-month high of $66.79, while U.S. crude rose 0.8% to $62.17 a barrel.

“Oil has been caught up in the broader commodities move higher, with a weaker USD proving constructive for the complex,” ING strategists led by Warren Patterson said in a note. “Meanwhile, there is also a growing view that the oil market is looking increasingly tight over the remainder of the year”.

Copper prices meanwhile hit a 9-1/2-year high as tight supply and solid demand from top consumer China boosted sentiment.

To the day ahead, and the highlight will be the aforementioned appearance of Fed Chair Powell before the Senate Banking Committee. Otherwise, data releases from Europe include UK unemployment for December and the final Euro Area CPI reading for January, while from the US there’s the Conference Board’s consumer confidence indicator for February, the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing index for February and the FHFA house price index or December. Lastly, earnings releases include Home Depot, Medtronic and Intuit.

Savings and investing plan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lrlc4g/savings_and_investing_plan/,dyingjedi21,1,2021-02-25 03:34:32,8,/r/personalfinance/comments/lrlc4g/savings_and_investing_plan/,Planning,"For context. I bought a home back in May of 2020. I bought it with the intent to rent rooms out to students as it is very close to popular university in my state. There are 5 rooms but only 2 are in use while I finish renovating the last 3 rooms.

# Current income.

My current income is about 40,000 annually. not including over time. probably enough to make a 3 to 6,000 difference of income but not much after.

Mortgage: $1,860.00 (rounded to the nearest dollar)

Utilities: around $500

# The plan.

Finalize the renovation of the final 3 rooms to acquire new tenants to, hopefully, pay the mortgage without touching my job income. this may also result in extra revenue if I can fill all the rooms.  

I have been saving as aggressively as I can. putting as much as 500 a week away. With the current income I make, I'm barley make it by but can at least keep the house. With the current tenants I'm able to save provided I can maintain minimal spending. (which has been the major goal)

I intend to save 80% of my income until I reach $13,000 as an emergency spending for the mortgage and living expenses. After that I will start only saving enough to pay the bills and lower my saving contribution to about half. While contributing 50% I'm hoping to achieve $23,000 to have put away for my 1 year emergency savings. This coupled with maintaining long term tenants should be achievable by the end of this year or at worse, March of next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the end goal will be to save at least 30% of my income, contribute about 15% into my 401k and begin investing again in the stock market with some ETF's and mutual funds. 

Also I will hope to be able to maintain at least 4 tenants every month to at minimally earn $2,800.00 at the beginning of every month. 

# Overview.

Total income goal after all expenses  is $1,500.00 a month, or $4,800.00 before living expenses.  Its been a hard 4 months and I've finally saved $6,600.00 so far and I'm almost there with just a few more months. 

I'm not a finance guy and I'm still learning and trying to figure out the best way to become financially secured and hopefully move to becoming financially independent. I am talking about this because I'm feeling really burnt. I'm stressing because I want to get ahead of the curve and I am trying to find as much resources and aid to get there. there have been a lot of circumstances to how I'm managing that is TL;DS. I don't know if this is the right move but its the only plan I've had. trying to be more frugal has been a struggle and ambitiously I want to buy another home in 5 years to attempt to recreate this home renting solution. If there is anyone out here who might be able to grant me some insight, I would sincerely apricate your advice.

&amp;#x200B;

# Personal Struggles.

Maybe I'm doing this all wrong and stressing and living below my basic needs. Some nights I go hungry to ration my foods, I've had to skip on meals with friends (even though we shouldn't be going out), I've had to pass on date nights with my partner because I have been trying to save what ever I can. I've had to spend on small fixes around the house and its been costing me and having me tap into my savings from time to time. Trying to live the way I am has had me with restless nights, and exhausting thoughts that genuinely drain me through out the day. Trying to have a future has never been more exhausting."

I've seen a lot of people on here recently asking what Fantom is and why it's taking off. I hope this helps.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ls8s3x/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_on_here_recently_asking/,annoyinglilbrother,85,2021-02-25 23:15:43,156,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ls8s3x/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_on_here_recently_asking/,SCALABILITY,"*Before I dive in, I will say that I've seen more and more people on here asking someone to explain what FTM is. As someone who has been invested in Fantom since early 2019, I will explain below what makes me excited about the project. This is not financial advice and, of course, DYOR.*

[Fantom](https://fantom.foundation) is a layer 1 smart contract platform that has recently received a lot more attention, with an astronomical rise of 14x in the last month.

**Why? Read below.**

Fantom is fast and cheap. Fantom confirms transactions in less than 2 seconds, and they cost a fraction of a cent, or $0.00001. 

**Andre Cronje built it**

[Andre Cronje](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech), the genius developer behind [Yearn](https://yearn.finance) and many other DeFi products, coauthored the consensus algorithm of Fantom, called Lachesis. He’s still involved in the project and speaks to the team daily, overseeing the major updates and releases.

Moreover, he confirmed multiple times that when the bridges are ready, he will port his most popular dApps on Fantom since it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum.

Even better, the other [he tweeted about what that will look like from a user experience standpoint.](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1362263811386839043?s=19) Holy fuckballs this will be awesome.

**Fantom isn’t an Ethereum fork**

Unlike many other blockchains, Fantom is not a fork of Ethereum. It’s built from scratch using an innovative consensus algorithm designed for high performance and scalability.

**Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum**

Fantom supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

What does it mean? Developers familiar with Ethereum can deploy their dApps on Fantom just as easily, using the same tools such as Truffle, Remix, and Metamask.

Their dApps will be much cheaper to deploy, maintain and interact with. The user experience is therefore drastically improved, also thanks to the almost instant confirmations.

**Fantom is interoperable**

The full Ethereum compatibility makes Fantom interoperable with Ethereum. Ren is building a bridge between the two networks to allow a seamless flow of assets back and forth. 

Fantom is a layer 1 platform that can serve as a layer 2 for Ethereum. In other words, it can help Ethereum scale, among many other things. 

Just the other day Andre [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1363983480674115584) that FTM was never meant to be an ETH killer, but ETH simply needs some load balancers to help out. What FTM is doing for ETH is going to be huge. 

**You can stake it to earn rewards** 

Fantom is a Proof-of-Stake network. It means that you can participate in securing the network by staking your FTM. But it doesn’t end there. You can choose for how long to lock up your tokens for and get rewarded accordingly; the longer you lock your FTM, the higher the rewards.
Furthermore, Fantom is the first network to introduce Liquid Staking. You can use the value of your staked FTM within the ecosystem. Massive. 

There is also a governance system where holders can vote on the changes of the protocol.

*Humble brag: I've been staking for almost 2 years and have earned over 100K FTM passively.*

**It has an all-in-one DeFi suite**

The team didn’t just build an incredible blockchain platform that is fast, scalable, and secure. They also created an all-in-one DeFi suite, [Fantom Finance](https://fantom.finance). DeFi users are used to jumping across different protocols and websites to trade, lend, borrow and farm. Fantom Finance solves all that.

Users can mint synthetic tokens (like on Synthetix), trade on an AMM dex (like on Uniswap), and borrow and lend tokens (like on Aave), all in one place, directly from the wallet. How cool is that?!

**It has already partnered with many recognized crypto projects**

Fantom partnered with:

-Chainlink

-Ren Protocol

-Band Protocol

-Injective Protocol

-Waves

-The Graph

-Ethereum Classic Labs

-Api3

-Ontology

-V-id

-Coti

And many more

**It is still undervalued in my opinion**

Fantom is sitting around a $2 billion market cap with a token price of $0.78. Despite its recent rise, Fantom is still vastly undervalued. Avalanche offers a similar tech, without the integrated DeFi suite, and it’s valued higher at $2.4b. Solana, a fast blockchain yet not compatible with EVM and slower than Fantom, is above $4b. Aave, a dApp on Ethereum that would represent a part of Fantom Finance (so a part of a dApp on the Fantom ecosystem), is valued just under $5b. The proper comparison should be made with Ethereum, valued at $188b. In my opinion, the potential growth for Fantom is another 3x in the short term and the sky is the limit long term.

**It has a passionate community and strong social presence**

The Fantom Marines are one of the best communities in crypto. They’re organized like a proper army. They’re knowledgeable, and their Twitter presence is a force of nature. They’re similar to the Link Marines. They act as one. Memes, articles, videos, gifs, you name it. They can do it all.

**It has multiple government pilot programs and partnerships**

If you're still with me, you made it to one of the most exciting parts. 

Fantom is reshaping the country of Afghanistan. They have not one, not two, not three, but **four** government live pilot programs with Afghanistan. The first one, launched in July 2020 with the Minister of Health of Afghanistan, leverages [blockchain technology for pharmaceutical supply chain tracking](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fantom-blockchain-launch-smart-medicine-103000039.html) to combat counterfeit drugs. More recently, Fantom [partnered with DABS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fantom-launches-blockchain-pilot-afghanistan-100000458.html), the national energy company for Afghanistan, to build blockchain-based ERP and CRM systems. Another program involves [the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Investment to implement blockchain tools for auditing and authentication purposes.](https://fantom.foundation/blog/acci-fantom-pilot-program/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=fc807837d997e590f21b20adb6972d65aa0369a9-1613695821-0-AQmeswbGk2HLX3Q8Q-7BSdgfFzEERILHjQwfIjI_4ThPyuotouz1gTAB1GkQzXnc37yf8Upy1dcT-QIq2o-DC_A8AqWg1bTnzpKA4fid5uMuF10xwOYNkEIbjtd3p8kWz_1jQKPJbaWuUqNeS5THXMsFuxLq4maJeXz0IRIujOIzYz9L_rv7j-aFwmhnYzSFGP57JC49WQTTmbc6Gk0Gl4aAcYqsb3zTtsEpKB_lWtDXZvCdOZXGFcv0BwfNKokJVb90SwSkYdILQjkYAwvTU-No_anIiZ9bvXnIu6dBM4MPZGIoV2NItRtwyQpcZcB6dIww7_VDu2T6_8jvO_iwiQUBKk2KotrDKTDtDuOz6DWU) The team aims to digitize the whole country of Afghanistan and ultimately build a national stock exchange on the Fantom blockchain. The latest pilot program is [with The Afghanistan National Standard Authority to use Fantom technology to issue national certifications.](https://fantom.foundation/blog/ansa-fantom-blockchain-issuance-program/)

**It has a transparent and humble team**

The Fantom team is very transparent and humble. They communicate promptly - they have one of the most active [Twitter accounts in crypto](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN), they’re hard-working and as clear as they can be with the community. It almost feels like the team is part of the community. Besides their [official chat on Discord](https://chat.fantom.network), they also offer a support chat on their website, unheard of in crypto. Their Github is updated frequently, almost daily, and it’s easy to see what they’re working on at any given time.

**It’s getting integrated everywhere**

Besides centralized exchanges like Binance, Fantom is taking over the DeFi space. It’s listed on Uniswap, Sushiswap and 1inch. Just this week, Binance integrated FTM Opera Chain for deposits &amp; withdrawals. It’s just the beginning. We can speculate that once the Ren bridges are in place, there will be more integrations on Ethereum. We can think of Yearn, Curve, and all the biggest DeFi money markets.

**It’s on Coinbase Custody**

Coinbase Custody is the most important crypto custodian in the world and [it supports Fantom](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseInsto/status/1354563754713903110). Institutions and funds can now safely store their FTM with a trusted third party. It’s the first step to getting listed to Coinbase.

**Etherscan has built an explorer for them**

The Etherscan team has recently built [FTMScan](https://ftmscan.com), an explorer for Fantom. Previously, they only made Etherscan and an explorer for Binance. If that doesn’t tell you something, my friend, it’s on you.

And there you have it. I hope this helps paint a picture of why FTM has been shooting up the rankings. I still think there is a lot to come, but again, this is not financial advice. Good luck to all!"

There’s nothing that I have a strong passion for, but there’s a few courses I’m considering that I think I wouldn’t mind doing. If anyone is taking any of these courses and is able to give me some advice regarding them, pls help! (:

Some of the courses that I’m considering doing:
- Computer Science: because it is the trend right now and there are good career prospects. I’m good in Math at JC level but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to cope in Uni? No background in coding/programming, but will my RP be sufficient to get in? (are there any websites recommendations where I can try to see whether this will be a good fit &amp; something that I will enjoy doing?)
- Mathematical Science: same reason as above, strong in Math but unsure if Uni math will be too much of a different ball game (any seniors able to provide examples of what they learn?)
- Accountancy: no background, simply because it feels like a safe enough choice (in the sense that I don’t think I’ll fare too badly in it? It’s probably just heavier on understanding and memorizing)
- Finance: not sure of what this entails (please advise if possible) &amp; how different is this from things like accountancy? Heard that it’s quite a flexible degree, hence considering as I think envision myself in my field that will likely deal with numbers. 
- Quantitative Finance: As far as I understand, the cohort size is usually quite small and I heard that the people taking it are all really smart, so how difficult will it be to do well in the subject because of the bell curve? Not really sure what this course is about too, so if anyone is taking the course please advise (:

I am also looking to apply for scholarships, and I’m not sure what are my chances. I have been performing consistently academically, and have a decent (but not stellar) portfolio. I’m considering applying to MAS, EDB, GIC and Enterprise SG but as far as I understand, all these are rather competitive and require many rounds of group assessments and interviews. I personally think that I perform decently when I go for solo interviews, but I have never done group ones and I’m rather fearful of them. I am not the type to like intense competition and public speaking, so I’m not sure if these scholarships will really suit me. Any seniors who went for these interviews - what type of questions do they ask and what traits are they looking out for? Additionally, what are my chances for non-bonded scholarships at NTU/NUS/SMU? I heard some schools prioritise 90 rp a lot so I’m not sure if I will stand a good chance. 

Any help will be appreciated, Thank you all! (:"

Bounce 
The startling speed of the move in U.S. Treasuries yesterday, which saw the yield on the 10-year note reaching 1.61% at one point, is being blamed on technical, rather than fundamental reasons. The yield on the five-year note surged through 0.75% after an auction of seven-year bonds saw record low demand. Traders scurried to manage positions in the wake of the spike, with liquidity also becoming an issue as open interest in Treasury futures collapsed across the curve. The moves do appear to have been a flash in the pan for now, with the 10-year yield back under 1.5% this morning. 

Stimulus 
The House is set to pass the $1.9 trillion stimulus package today, bringing $1,400 checks a step closer for most Americans. It does appear that one Democrat policy goal -- the $15 minimum wage -- will not be part of the plan after Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that the measure did not qualify under budget reconciliation, meaning changes to that would require 60 votes in the Senate. There is also a risk that President Joe Biden's Covid relief package will trigger cuts to Medicare. 

Inflation 
While technical factors are being blamed for the rapid spike in yields yesterday, there is no getting away from market fears that price growth is going to accelerate faster than policymakers suggest. This morning's personal income data is expected to show a surge of 9.5%, driven by stimulus checks, while spending may have risen 2.5%. The PCE deflator, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, may quicken to 1.4%. With more stimulus on the way, and continued good news on the rapid progress of vaccinations, the market will continue to worry that the risk of the economy overheating is high. 

Stocks slip 
The moves in the bond market yesterday have rattled global equities. Overnight the MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled 3.5% while Japan's Topix index closed 3.2% lower. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index had recovered some early session losses to trade down 0.6% by 5:50 a.m. Eastern Time. Futures for the S&amp;P 500, which got much of its selling out of the way in yesterday's session, pointed to little change at the open, oil was lower and gold slipped.

Australia's markets have a message for policy makers globally -- who knows when they'll get it? 

Possibly the biggest monetary policy challenge of a generation is unfolding first in the country best known for its laid back vibe, long sandy beaches and off-the-charts cuddly and/or terrifying wildlife. 

It's all playing out in the bond market. A mounting conviction that the success of vaccines could see life returning to normal sooner than anticipated, and bring demand roaring back, has lifted rates on government borrowing globally. And now we're seeing the pressure growing on central banks, which have pledged to hold interest rates low to ensure a full economic recovery.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's strategy to do so was more explicit than most, so the strain of the global reflation trade is showing clearly here. This is one of the few countries to have explicitly implemented yield curve control, designating a target for the three-year at 0.10%. 

The yield has traded above that level pretty consistently this year as expectations of a sharper recovery in many major economies have propelled global yields higher. But this week Australia's curve appeared to slip the leash altogether, with the three-year trading as high as 0.15%, and the 10-year -- which the short end is supposed to help curb -- surging as high as 1.93%.

The breakout is a test for the RBA, and forced it to step in to defend its yield target for the first time this year, with three rounds of purchases that finally brought the market more or less to heel.

And it's not only Australia -- Bank of Korea this week was also moved to announce more bond purchases. And consider Japan, where yields have been so supine the central bank has worried about how to get them moving at all. As the 10-year rate gravitated to the top of its trading band Friday, Finance Minister Taro Aso warned: “It’s important that yields don’t suddenly jump up and down. We need to make sure not to lose the market’s trust with fiscal management.”

Markets are really starting to question the viability of policy ""set at pandemic-fear levels"" when economic conditions appear to be improving dramatically, said National Australia Bank economist Tapas Strickland.

Australia's policy makers may need to do more to convince investors that they're serious about keeping rates on hold at least until 2024. Similarly, in the U.S., a stronger statement may soon be necessary. Strickland says the Fed's emphasis on patience and a long road to recovery may look inconsistent with any improvements in economic data, particularly given Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's comment last week that the U.S. ""could be back to full employment next year."""

Who pays us tendies when the shorts go bankrupt?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltiqcw/who_pays_us_tendies_when_the_shorts_go_bankrupt/,InvincibearREAL,49,2021-02-27 15:13:12,9,/r/GME/comments/ltiqcw/who_pays_us_tendies_when_the_shorts_go_bankrupt/,DD,"A few of you retards have been asking, “when do the shorts run out of shares to short sell?”

**TLDR;**

The short answer is: practically never.

Every time shares are shorted and purchased by others, if those purchased shares are in accounts that allow lending, they can be re-borrowed and shorted again, to infinity.

I’ll also try to answer the sentiment expressed in this DD; [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsve5j/really\_long\_dd\_and\_analysis\_what\_happened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsve5j/really_long_dd_and_analysis_what_happened/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting 101**

Borrow somebody else’s share for $100 and give him an IOU, immediately sell that borrowed share at going market rate for $100, wait for the price to lower a bit, buy a share for &lt;$90, return the share to the lender to fulfil the IOU, pocket the &gt;$10 difference as profit.

Important details to note are:

1. during this process, the IOU is essentially as good as an actual share, and
2. creating this IOU introduces a synthetic share into the overall pool of shares available to trade (the float).

&amp;#x200B;

**Who has shorted the shit out of GME?**

Well we know Melvin for sure based on the puts of their disclosures, and I suspect more funds are shorting at numerous price points. But the only shorts that truly matter at the stupid low price-points, like $4/share low, cause there is very, very, little chance of us ever seeing that price range again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why didn’t they just take profits when it dropped to $2.50/share?**

I need an accountant to verify this, but I read that you can avoid paying (perhaps a significant portion, if not all of) taxes on the gains if the company goes bankrupt. Basically, if they closed their short positions at $2.50/share they’d have to pay capital gains taxes, but if it went down to $0 and bankrupted GameStop (which was their plan) they could get tax relief in the order of hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.

They got greedy, and when anything would threaten to raise the stock for the price they would short the stock even harder to artificially suppress it. Speaking of artificially suppressing stock prices, how does that work?

**The market is at its core, an auction.**

Auctioneers are sellers, people in the crowd are buyers, eventually a price is agreed on or else the price is forced to move. If there are more buyers than sellers, buyers will compete and outbid each other and bid the price up. If there aren’t enough buyers to meet the sellers’ demands, the sellers will underbid each other and drop the price down. But what happens when you create additional sellers out of thin air?

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting the price down by flooding the market with synthetic shares**

https://preview.redd.it/ln58398v0zj61.png?width=1435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c5ba427f74840817c0b4936ecd481fde4c1ea32

Take a look at this picture and observe the two slopes in the graph indicating demand and supply. Where the two lines meet indicates the price of the stock, $40 in this example picture.

https://preview.redd.it/1p2e8ftv0zj61.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b340ba148f4b2367f4409f66e97c1ca7cf1da768

Now look at this picture which demonstrates what happens when shares are shorted and are FTD. It drives the supply curve farther down the x-axis which moves the point of intersection, essentially driving down the price to pennies.

Flooding the market with synthetic shares, assuming buying demand remains relatively constant, deflates the stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

**Synthetic shares through short selling**

Whomever lends out their share still retains full rights to the share. They can vote on corporate agendas, they can receive dividends, they can receive interest for lending out their shares, and they can recall their shares back from borrowers whenever they see fit. Whomever borrows their share, gets a lesser synthetic share that allows them to pretty much only buy/sell, but it also makes them liable for dividend payments which they have to make to the lender of the shares, can’t vote on corporate agendas, etc.

You know what would hurt short sellers? GME paying out a dividend. Because the shorts would have to pay that dividend to the lenders of their short shares. A $2 dividend \* 100M shares shorted = $200M they'd have to pay out to the actual share owners. I don't foresee this happening, but it tickles my brain to imagine happening.

&amp;#x200B;

**But what about Failure-To-Delivers?**

So this is what the DD I linked to in the intro was alluding to. FTD’s can occur when somebody makes a transaction of cash for stock and never supplies the stock within the T+2 settlement window.

In the case of shorting, a borrower gives the lender cash to borrow their share(s), sell the share(s) on the open market, take the money in exchange for selling on the open market, and doesn't actually give them back the owed shares. Because the DTC protects buyers in this scenario, they are given a synthetic share created out of thin air, similar to creating a synthetic share when initially borrowing a share to short.

&amp;#x200B;

**Primary Brokers**

Hedge funds have agreements with primary brokers which grant them preferred trading flows, increased margin, decreased interest rates, more liquidity, more leniency (still beholden to their prime brokers’ risk department), better tools, etc. They partner with the largest brokers to give them access to the big boy tools at the grownups table.

&amp;#x200B;

**So who does Melvin use as prime brokers?**

Melvin’s prime brokers are Goldman Sachs (\~$1.16B), Morgan Stanley (\~$1.5B), National Financial Services/Fidelity (\~$7M), and possibly Deutsche ($?)

[http://www.trackhedgefunds.com/melvin-capital-management-lp](http://www.trackhedgefunds.com/melvin-capital-management-lp)

[https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf) (section 5.K.(3))

All of these brokers are big boys and self-clear their own transactions (though legally segregated) to be eventually settled by the DTC within 2 days latest after the transaction (T+2 settlement).

[https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/)

If Melvin are still the primary shorts in this battle, they have access through their prime brokers to a near-unlimited amount of shares to short. I explained this in my TLDR, shares can be borrowed for immediate sale, purchased by investors who have share lending enabled, and borrowed again by short sellers to repeat the cycle. Prime brokers have great access to locates through arrangements with other prime brokers.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locate\_(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locate_(finance))

It should be noted however, that market makers are exempt from this requirement to first locate a share before shorting it. As bona fide market makers (like Citadel), they can create synthetic shares for the purpose of increasing liquidity if there are too few shares actively trading cause too many retarded apes refuse to sell their shares. I have read, but you should confirm this yourself, that MMs are required to repurchase these synthetic shares by EOD, but if you combine this with FTD mechanisms we could end up with a fraudulent system ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2giqGXVHoqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2giqGXVHoqY)) where shares are made out of thin-air and left circulating in the market with ulterior motives. This would be highly illegal, and incredibly risky for market makers, and IMO an unlikely move since the risk is extremely high and consequences potentially huge. Remember, consistent trading is a matter of stacking probabilities in your favor, and the big boys don’t stay fat by being dumb, unless your name rhymes with Kelvin.

**Delta hedging and gamma squeezes**

This post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltb3sh/there\_are\_two\_price\_explosion\_events\_and\_you\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltb3sh/there_are_two_price_explosion_events_and_you_have/)) explains the two squeezes that feedback into each other to escalate the price, however it mistakenly implies that the hedging MMs perform only happens on Fridays. Nobody knows the exact formulas used by MMs since firstly, they’re unique to each MM and secondly, to prevent manipulation &amp; squeezes they’re not publicly disclosed, but we can generalize their operation.

When an option contract for 100 shares is written, a few shares are also purchased as a hedge. The closer to ITM the call is, the more shares are initially purchased to hedge. What most people are ignoring is that MMs will also sell shares if the stock price veers away from becoming ITM. Really, this is a dynamic process happening continually every hour of every day. MMs do not decide on only Friday whether or not they will purchase enough shares as a hedge, they purchase shares along the way as a stock price reaches an option’s strike price.

However, when the price suddenly surges in a manner of minutes, that can cause multiple calls in the options chain to suddenly become ITM, and not just for the nearest Friday expiration, oh no my fellow apes, but also for for all subsequent expirations. Calls whose strike just got met by the stock price that expire on Friday are now ITM, as are the same strike calls that expire next week, next month, three months, six months, nine months, one year, and two years from now. Market makers will usually hedge against those too, presumably farther out expiration and lower impV results in fewer shares being purchased as hedges, but perhaps not, we just don't know for sure. Either way, we saw a crap ton of millions of shares purchased by MMs on Wednesday, and we saw the stock lose half of it's value in subsequent days as either big boys took profits and/or MMs partially reduced their hedges in tandem with falling prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Will we bankrupt companies when they’re forced to cover?**

If we see a sudden squeeze like the VW squeeze and not a drawn-out one like TSLA, then probably yes. The CEO of IBKR even said as much: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsbv5w/repost\_but\_you\_might\_want\_to\_watch\_this\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsbv5w/repost_but_you_might_want_to_watch_this_again/)

Short sellers will close their positions until they become insolvent. Then their brokers will pick up the slack. Custodians of the shares (who are frequently also clearing houses, they hold the actual digital records of who owns which shares) will also pick up the tab. And finally, the DTC will also pick up the tab. Along the way are various insurance companies, but the tabs will run up the hierarchy and EVENTUALLY you’ll get your money. It might not be right away, depends how fucked your broker gets and how quickly the government bails them out (cause taking down the DTC will certainly lead to a bail-out), but you’ll get your tendies if we domino collapse the whole financial system.

**The market is at its core, an auction.**

Auctioneers are sellers, people in the crowd are buyers, eventually a price is agreed on or else the price is forced to move. If there are more buyers than sellers, buyers will compete and outbid each other and bid the price up. If there aren’t enough buyers to meet the sellers’ demands, the sellers will underbid each other and drop the price down. But what happens when you create additional sellers out of thin air?

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting the price down by flooding the market with synthetic shares**

https://preview.redd.it/vohydt2t5zj61.png?width=1435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93878f9dfd885cf131ebc12c965a4c547b13c7d

Take a look at this picture and observe the two slopes in the graph indicating demand and supply. Where the two lines meet indicates the price of the stock, $40 in this example picture.

Now look at this picture which demonstrates what happens when shares are shorted and are FTD. It drives the supply curve farther down the x-axis which moves the point of intersection, essentially driving down the price to pennies.

Flooding the market with synthetic shares, assuming buying demand remains relatively constant, deflates the stock price.

**Synthetic shares through short selling**

Whomever lends out their share still retains full rights to the share. They can vote on corporate agendas, they can receive dividends, they can receive interest for lending out their shares, and they can recall their shares back from borrowers whenever they see fit. Whomever borrows their share, gets a lesser synthetic share that allows them to pretty much only buy/sell, but it also makes them liable for dividend payments which they have to make to the lender of the shares, can’t vote on corporate agendas, etc.

You know what would hurt short sellers? GME paying out a dividend. Because the shorts would have to pay that dividend to the lenders of their short shares. A $2 dividend \* 100M shares shorted = $200M they'd have to pay out to the actual share owners. I don't foresee this happening, but it tickles my brain to imagine happening.

&amp;#x200B;

**But what about Failure-To-Delivers?**

So this is what the DD I linked to in the intro was alluding to. FTD’s can occur when somebody makes a transaction of cash for stock and never supplies the stock within the T+2 settlement window.

In the case of shorting, a borrower gives the lender cash to borrow their share(s), sell the share(s) on the open market, take the money in exchange for selling on the open market, and doesn't actually give them back the owed shares. Because the DTC protects buyers in this scenario, they are given a synthetic share created out of thin air, similar to creating a synthetic share when initially borrowing a share to short.

&amp;#x200B;

**Primary Brokers**

Hedge funds have agreements with primary brokers which grant them preferred trading flows, increased margin, decreased interest rates, more liquidity, more leniency (still beholden to their prime brokers’ risk department), better tools, etc. They partner with the largest brokers to give them access to the big boy tools at the grownups table.

&amp;#x200B;

**So who does Melvin use as prime brokers?**

Melvin’s prime brokers are Goldman Sachs (\~$1.16B), Morgan Stanley (\~$1.5B), National Financial Services/Fidelity (\~$7M), and possibly Deutsche ($?)

All of these brokers are big boys and self-clear their own transactions (though legally segregated) to be eventually settled by the DTC within 2 days latest after the transaction (T+2 settlement).

If Melvin are still the primary shorts in this battle, they have access through their prime brokers to a near-unlimited amount of shares to short. I explained this in my TLDR, shares can be borrowed for immediate sale, purchased by investors who have share lending enabled, and borrowed again by short sellers to repeat the cycle. Prime brokers have great access to locates through arrangements with other prime brokers.

It should be noted however, that market makers are exempt from this requirement to first locate a share before shorting it. As bona fide market makers (like Citadel), they can create synthetic shares for the purpose of increasing liquidity if there are too few shares actively trading cause too many retarded apes refuse to sell their shares. I have read, but you should confirm this yourself, that MMs are required to repurchase these synthetic shares by EOD, but if you combine this with FTD mechanisms we could end up with a fraudulent system ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2giqGXVHoqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2giqGXVHoqY)) where shares are made out of thin-air and left circulating in the market with ulterior motives. This would be highly illegal, and incredibly risky for market makers, and IMO an unlikely move since the risk is extremely high and consequences potentially huge. Remember, consistent trading is a matter of stacking probabilities in your favor, and the big boys don’t stay fat by being dumb, unless your name rhymes with Kelvin.

**Delta hedging and gamma squeezes**

This post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltb3sh/there\_are\_two\_price\_explosion\_events\_and\_you\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltb3sh/there_are_two_price_explosion_events_and_you_have/)) explains the two squeezes that feedback into each other to escalate the price, however it mistakenly implies that the hedging MMs perform only happens on Fridays. Nobody knows the exact formulas used by MMs since firstly, they’re unique to each MM and secondly, to prevent manipulation &amp; squeezes they’re not publicly disclosed, but we can generalize their operation.

When an option contract for 100 shares is written, a few shares are also purchased as a hedge. The closer to ITM the call is, the more shares are initially purchased to hedge. What most people are ignoring is that MMs will also sell shares if the stock price veers away from becoming ITM. Really, this is a dynamic process happening continually every hour of every day. MMs do not decide on only Friday whether or not they will purchase enough shares as a hedge, they purchase shares along the way as a stock price reaches an option’s strike price.

However, when the price suddenly surges in a manner of minutes, that can cause multiple calls in the options chain to suddenly become ITM, and not just for the nearest Friday expiration, oh no my fellow apes, but also for for all subsequent expirations. Calls whose strike just got met by the stock price that expire on Friday are now ITM, as are the same strike calls that expire next week, next month, three months, six months, nine months, one year, and two years from now. Market makers will usually hedge against those too, presumably farther out expiration and lower impV results in fewer shares being purchased as hedges, but perhaps not, we just don't know for sure. Either way, we saw a crap ton of millions of shares purchased by MMs on Wednesday, and we saw the stock lose half of it's value in subsequent days as either big boys took profits and/or MMs partially reduced their hedges in tandem with falling prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Will we bankrupt companies when they’re forced to cover?**

If we see a sudden squeeze like the VW squeeze and not a drawn-out one like TSLA, then probably yes. The CEO of IBKR even said as much: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsbv5w/repost\_but\_you\_might\_want\_to\_watch\_this\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsbv5w/repost_but_you_might_want_to_watch_this_again/)

Short sellers will close their positions until they become insolvent. Then their brokers will pick up the slack. Custodians of the shares (who are frequently also clearing houses, they hold the actual digital records of who owns which shares) will also pick up the tab. And finally, the DTC will also pick up the tab. Along the way are various insurance companies, but the tabs will run up the hierarchy and EVENTUALLY you’ll get your money. It might not be right away, depends how fucked your broker gets and how quickly the government bails them out (cause taking down the DTC will certainly lead to a bail-out), but you’ll get your tendies if we domino collapse the whole financial system.
