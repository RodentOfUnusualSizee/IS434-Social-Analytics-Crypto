They introduced a new “bailout” mechanism.  Such a mechanism was necessary for the market, as automatic auctions did not solve the problem of liquidations of bad debt.  Due to this, the situation with MakerDAO in March 2020 will not happen again.

This counteracts the bull view, which is that at current stability fee rate, MKR is trading at only 20x earnings and growing rapidly. If I could get comfortable around above issue, I’d say buying MKR at these levels is a no brainer

Tập đoàn đầu cơ nhà nước Singapore tham gia đợt cung cấp tiền 300 triệu đô la Mỹ cho sàn Coinbase

Theo như những thông tin được biết trong khoảng trang web chính thức của GIC, quỹ này được có mặt trên thị trường để quản lý dự trữ ngoại ân hận của Singapore với hơn 100 tỷ đô la Mỹ tài sản tại hơn 40 đất nước trên toàn toàn cầu.

khi mà đấy, Coinbase tiết lộ họ đã huy động được 300 triệu đô la Mỹ trong vòng tài trợ vốn chủ nhân Series E vào tháng 10 năm 2018, đưa trị giá tiền sau huy động của nó vào thời điểm đấy lên đến 8 tỷ đô la.

Với vòng tài trợ do đơn vị đầu cơ Tiger Global Management dẫn dắt, Coinbase tiết lộ thêm vào thời điểm ấy một loạt các người ủng hộ lừng danh với các khoản đầu tư vào ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử – như Y Combinator Continuity, Wellington Management, Andreessen Horowitz và Polychain, cộng với những đơn vị khác. Singapore GIC không nằm trong số những nhà đầu cơ có tên nhắc trên.

Bloomberg cũng trích dẫn các tài liệu được Báo cáo bởi hãng tin này vào năm ngoái, đã chỉ ra rằng Coinbase dự báo doanh thu năm 2018 của họ sẽ chạm mức gần 1,3 tỷ đô la – chính yếu đến từ huê hồng của nền móng thương lượng và các cơ quan nắm giữ tài sản tiền điện tử độc quyền của nó.

Vào mùa hè 2018 – giữa bối cảnh thị trường gấu kéo dài – các nhà phân tích Đánh giá rằng doanh thu được cho ra từ các sàn phân phối tiền điện tử sẽ tăng hơn gấp đôi, có thể đạt đến 4 tỷ USD vào năm 2018, lúc [**đăng ký trên sàn Coinbase**](https://kiemtien.com/huong-dan-dang-ky-san-coinbase/) ước tính chiếm 50% tổng doanh thu thương lượng.

The case for $200 UNI - A short thesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/kqtoi2/the_case_for_200_uni_a_short_thesis/,sexydefi,1,2021-01-05 15:58:20,3,/r/ethtrader/comments/kqtoi2/the_case_for_200_uni_a_short_thesis/,Discussion,"UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, which is the most used decentralized exchange ever and likely will be. And it is going to $200 in the coming alt-season, in my humble opinion.

Uniswap's daily volume yesterday crossed $1 billion, not for the first time but it looks like it will sustain at such levels in coming days, weeks and months as ETH has crossed $1000 without much hype and with much criticism. Liquidity is over $2.7 billion, even when there are no incentives.

Institutional liquidity is flowing into Bitcoin and it will soon flow into Eth too. Eth will get it’s CME futures, the OCC has given banks a go ahead for launching stablecoins on public blockchains and Ethereum has the ecosystem and toolset ready for everything that is about to come. After Bitcoin &amp; Eth, DeFi governance tokens will be tokens people would want to hodl. And in that, the top ones. And when the HNIs &amp; institutions (non crypto-native ones) start looking into DeFi, the first thing they’d come to know about is the likes of UNI, Comp, etc., the products which are not much difficult to understand and have good reputation and are decentralized. By the time this happens, Uniswap will also likely be on Optimism with the cash-flow switch turned on. With the interest rates close to zero and negative, P/E ratios can virtually be infinite. That’s another point to add to the value proposition. And don’t forget Uniswap v3.

Besides this, Uniswap is deeply integrated into the DeFi ecosystem and all the projects. MakerDAO now accepts Uniswap LP tokens for minting Dai. And also, think about this as betting on the Uniswap team. We know what the team is capable of and we know they’re highly competent and innovation won’t stop at v3. 

At $200, Uniswap's fully diluted valuation will be $200 billion. So, really, am I being stupid here? Nope. $200 UNI will happen when BTC is above $100k, ETH is over $10k. When we're back to a Jan 2018 type of scenario. I'm not saying that it's an 'if', but a 'when'. Cardano, for context was trading at a fully diluted value of $40 billion in last cycle's alt-season, without any product or users, pure hype.

And of course, $200 won’t be sustainable for the next couple of years at least, but we are early. Even crypto people from 2017 don’t want to hold crypto tokens for a few months. They just want to flip and most end up burning their ETH &amp; BTC. Just by buying now and holding patiently would be rewarding imo.

UNI is between $5 and $5.50 now and I’m putting this out here that UNI is going to $200 in the coming alt-season.

The ""major"" competitor to Uniswap is Sushiswap, but at the end of the day, Sushiswap is just a fork project. They can add new features, refresh their front-end and blah blah but it is what it is- a fork. Sushiswap has volume and liquidity right now only because of its ongoing liquidity incentives. And Uniswap doesn't have it going right now. Look at what happened to Swerve (the Curve fork)- I think that is what will ultimately happen to Sushiswap. Sure, Sushiswap is now a part of Yearn Finance but you don't see new projects providing liquidity for their projects on Sushiswap, you don't see projects celebrating Sushiswap listings. Uniswap is the king in the DEX space.

Balancer and other such tweaked and more innovative AMMs are good but the volume and liquidity on Uniswap speaks for itself.

The high gas fees problem- retail can't use it. Uniswap has shown us already that it can work well on Optimistic Rollups. And Optimism is starting their launch this month. In a few months, this won't be a problem and so we don't have to worry about AMM volumes being drained away to other blockchains.

So what I'm saying is, SEND IT!!!

And above all, do your own research. This is not financial advice. Don’t buy UNI just because I said so. Think for yourself. I'm not responsible for your losses or profits.

I would love to hear what you all think about this :)"

**Description:**

The  Spartan Protocol is a protocol for incentives liquidity and synthetic  assets (assets pegged to the price of another asset) on the Binance  Smart Chain. The core piece of the protocol are liquidity pools, similar  to Uniswap, but instead of a fixed-rate fee model a liquidity-sensitive  fee model similar to THORChain’s slip-based fees is used.

Currently,  liquidity providers (and traders) are penalised on automated-market  maker protocols, such as Uniswap, because of manipulation from  value-extracting arbitrage bots. These arbitrage bots have been around  for a long time now, and suck up millions of liquidity from unknowing  users on a weekly basis.

As  well as, synthetic mining protocols such as MakerDao and Synthetic use  illiquid collateral/markets to liquidate collateral on, which makes it  vulnerable to a downwards spiral which has already caused multiple chain  liquidations in the past.

Spartan  wants to solve these issues through an AMM protocol, through the use of  a single settlement asset and protocol-wide incentives to grow  liquidity. A slip-based fees model is used to reward liquidity providers  rather than slippage bots, a solution discussed and researched a lot by  THORchain. Finally, collateralised pool shares (synthetic assets) are  used instead of liquid collateral. Synthetic assets are generated  through the protocol, using price anchors offered by the liquidity  pools, collaterised by liquidity pool shares. These shares are  on-market, value-stabilised and can instantly be liquidated. Thanks to  this, positions can be liquidated within causing downwards spirals.

The  protocol aims to be community-driven and therefore uses a DAO  (governance) set-up for fee rates, time factors and upgrades of certain  parts of the code (voted on by holders who get incentivised to do so).  But, doesn’t overcomplicate governance or sets high requirements for any  proposal to pass.

Because  the protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain, BNB is required to  use the protocol and pay for fees. Similar to how ETH is used to pay for  gas on the Ethereum Network.

**Summarised, I got interested in Spartan Protocol because:**

* It took the best parts from the most popular AMM protocols, combined them and created a very solid protocol by doing so.
* The  protocol was launched on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a very  unique value proposition at this point, subject to Binance exposure.
* Higher leverage, lower fees and much faster then $SNX
* The SpartanDAO is build directly on smart contracts"

What happens if DAI loses it's peg and goes to $2 for example?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/kt403z/what_happens_if_dai_loses_its_peg_and_goes_to_2/,TheCurious0ne,1,2021-01-08 22:56:06,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/kt403z/what_happens_if_dai_loses_its_peg_and_goes_to_2/,NaN,"So, please bare with me and imagine this scenario.

At 15th Jan, NYAG decided Tether is fraud and/or Tether is unbacked throwing the full power of the US government against it.

Tether obviously loses it's peg and starts racing to $0, that wouldn't be huge deal but it's in every DEX AMM pool with other stables 

So let's make this simple example

in AMM DAI/USDT pool, USDT goes to 0 and DAI goes to $2

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly people that have borrowed $300 worth of DAI against $1000 worth of ETH (at relatively safe margin level of 300%+)

Owe $600 instead of $300.

At the same time other with riskier margin levels get liquadated and ETH price dumps as well, causing even the safe guy above being under collaterized with $600 worth of DAI against $100 worth of ETH (if ETH drops 90%)

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldn't that crash the whole system? And not just makerdao of course but pretty much everything?

I realize this is unconfirmed black swan FUD at this point, but black swans do happen from time to time and I just woud like to know if the above scenario is ralistic if that does happen, your thoughts?"

So where will blockchain go? (Short timeline included),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kthl27/so_where_will_blockchain_go_short_timeline/,cehhiro,1,2021-01-09 10:09:42,15,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kthl27/so_where_will_blockchain_go_short_timeline/,TRADING,"As a quick recap:

1. Bitcoin came with Script code. Very simple, not Turing-complete. (11 years)

2. Peercoin and Namecoin came with purpose-specific uses. Both are active projects but their price is but a shadow with no hopes of recovery. (9 years)

3. Ethereum came with a general-purpose VM. Active project and price is still going. (7 years ago)

4. Token and their projects are basically an application of Ethereum, so they don't count as a ""wave"". (5 years ago)

5. Zilliqa and Aelf came with cross-chain communication to solve sandboxing with prices down 90%. (3 years ago)

6. Uniswap existed before, as well as MakerDAO, but swaps got a lot of public attention with Uniswap 2. Price is still in discovery. (1 year ago)

So the big question is, what's coming this year? A trend is a trend until it isn't, but it seems like every 2 years some new idea is sparked in the community and explodes into the latest fashion. Where are your bets on what's the upcoming bubble?"
MakerDAO CDP compatibility with consistently increasing (once per day) rebasing asset?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ktjgbc/makerdao_cdp_compatibility_with_consistently/,cryptodenier,1,2021-01-09 12:02:38,5,/r/MakerDAO/comments/ktjgbc/makerdao_cdp_compatibility_with_consistently/,NaN,"Is it possible to allow an asset that triggers a rebase once a day to be used as collateral in a Maker CDP? Assuming that the collateral is always rebased positively and not negatively. The rebase works by increasing the asset balance (eg. 0.5 asset to 0.6 asset now locked in CDP)

Possible? Any thoughts? Any work-arounds? Thanks!"
Volume of assets stuck in DeFi protocols exceeded $ 20 billion,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_boneexchange/comments/ktpnj0/volume_of_assets_stuck_in_defi_protocols_exceeded/,boneexchange,1,2021-01-09 19:56:40,0,/r/u_boneexchange/comments/ktpnj0/volume_of_assets_stuck_in_defi_protocols_exceeded/,NaN,"
DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols generate $ 20.18 billion in crypto assets.

Indeed, the pioneer of the segment, MakerDAO, leads the DeFi Pulse ranking. The value of stranded funds (TVL) in this project exceeds $ 4 billion.

Next, the Aave Landing Project and the leading non-depository stock exchange Uniswap follow MakerDAO closely. The TVL of these projects is $ 2.68 billion and $ 2.53 billion, respectively.
In addition, a DeFi user recalls that barely a year ago, the total TVL of the decentralized financial sector was only $ 1 billion.
Finally, we note that recently, DeFi Pulse did not include the so-called “bitcoins on Ethereum” in the overall rating. Their TVL is $ 4.76 billion. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) accounts for almost 80% of the market share in this segment."

An upcoming research stream and different companies that explore the future applications of block chain technology illustrate the influence of this seminal technology. Business from different industry domains[hire dedicated block chain developers](https://dxminds.com/hire-blockchain-developers/)for business growth. Although there are promising use cases of this emerging technology, research and practice on modifying current and developing new business models are still in their infancy.

Benefits of block chain technology in business

**Decentralised**

Decentralisation is also its main asset, being one of the most interesting features of the blockchain. The block chain framework is fully decentralized instead of being stored at some single stage, which implies that it is not possible for an overarching authority to advance its own agenda and manipulate the network. In addition to being a fair district structure, decentralisation often translates into more stability.

**P2P network**

As information between network participants is exchanged and continuously registered, the network becomes stronger with a growing number of participants. An integral and important aspect of block chain technology is a P2P network. Under the block chain network, the word 'peer' applies to the computer system. In this network, a user simultaneously makes use of and provides the basis of the network. Each peer is called a node, and it is considered equal to each of them. 

A peer offers certain services to other users, such as bandwidth, processing speed and disk capacity, without any servers or hosts being centrally coordinated.

**High Security**

Once every block is cryptographically locked, copying, removing or editing is impossible, guaranteeing the digital ledger's immutability. Owing to the very existence of network decentralization, central points of error or failure within the system should never occur. With the lack of weak points for hacking inside the device, there can be zero chances of malicious, which increases the r of the network. In addition, each transaction involves the digital signature by both private and public keys that use distinct cryptographic schemes to ensure maximum encryption.

**Transparency**

In a public, decentralized ledger, it is possible for users to verify and monitor transactions. The entire record of transactions can be seen by any person. Besides, any modification of data is extremely difficult for the program, which is open source. With several eyes glued to the network, any modification is sure to be seen in the logged data, adding to the block chain's transparency and protection.

For companies that want to streamline business processes and issue digital properties, block chain technology has become an integral part of the enterprise software stack. Not all companies need a block chain solution, but the technology can be revolutionary for those who do the technology can be transformational. India is one of the best outsourcing destinations for block chain  development, companies from different industry domains [hire dedicated block chain developers in India](https://dxminds.com/hire-blockchain-developers/) for better block chain solutions.

Block chain can also alter the way you run your company, which includes the following five applications, from day to day.

**Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts are like normal contracts, except that the contract rules are executed on a block chain in real time, which removes the middleman and brings standards of transparency to standard agreements for all parties involved in a way that is not possible. This saves time and money for companies, while still ensuring enforcement from everyone involved.

**Cloud Storage**

Another application that organizations should take advantage of would be cloud storage. Storj, which is still in beta testing at the time of this writing, is one such company that provides stable cloud storage while decreasing dependence.

**Paying Employees**

Since the block chain has its cryptocurrency origins, it only makes sense that it could be used as an employee compensation application.

Let's take a look at some of the real-world block chain technology implementations across different industries,

&amp;#x200B;

* Chainlink
* Brave
* EOS Dynasty
* MakerDAO
* TRACEDonate
* Circulor
* Cipher

In the coming years, the future of the block chain will increase.

(Turkish Review MKR),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/kvd0ch/hello_makerdao_turkish_review_mkr/,Dontcrymebaby,0,2021-01-12 05:48:03,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/kvd0ch/hello_makerdao_turkish_review_mkr/,NaN,"[https://kriptohayat.com/maker-token-mkr-nedir](https://kriptohayat.com/maker-token-mkr-nedir)

# Maker Token (MKR) Nedir?

  
 

**Maker coin**, [**Makerdao (MKR)**](https://makerdao.com/) **merkeziyetsiz** uygulamaya sahiptir. Bu uygulamanın işlevleri ise, Maker karşılığında **DAI** (Stablecoins) basmanıza izin veren bir alt yapısı bulunmasının yanında **merkezi olmayan** kredi alma ve kredi verme platformu olmasıdır.  


Geleneksel piyasada basılan paraların ne yazık ki bir dayanağı yoktur. Merkez bankaları tarafından basılan paraların ucu bucağı yoktur. Hatta bazı merkez bankaları ne kadar para bastıklarını dahi yayınlamamaktadır. Bu paranın doğasına bir ihanettir.  


Makerdao ise Maker kripto parasının işlevlerini ortaya çıkarabileceğiniz bir platformdur. Maker platformu merkeziyetsiz topluluklar tarafından yönetilir ve en küçük paydaş dahi yönetime katılabilir. Maker tokeni DAI basmanın yanında asıl önemli işlevi, bir yönetişim tokeni olmasıdır.  


Maker platformunda yönetişim modelinde yer almak ise oldukça kolaydır. Merkezsiz cüzdanınızda bulunan maker kripto paranız ile yönetimde alınacak her karara katılabilirsiniz.  
**Cüzdanlar, Merkezsiz finans uygulamaları (dApps) ve merkezsiz finans (DeFi)** entegrasyonu olan bu platform yüzlerce ortağa sahiptir. Bu uygulamaların hepsi yönetişime bağlıdır.  


MKR sahipleri, aynı zamanda **Dai stablecoin** için politika ayarlamayı, yeni teminat türlerini seçmeyi ve yönetişimin kendisini iyileştirmeyi içeren Maker Protokolünü yönetmekle de sorumludur. Herkes MKR sahibi olabilir ve herkes merkeziyetsiz finansın yani DeFi’nin geleceğini şekillendirmede projeye katılabilmektedir..  


## Makerdao Kar Payı Veriyor Mu?

Makerdao, maker token üzerinden dolaylı yoldan kar payı dağıtımı yapmaktadır. DAI oluşturma ücretlerinden belirli bir komisyon alan ve buradan sağladığı gelir ile maker token burn mekanizması oluşturan bir platformdur.  


**Token burn** (token yakma) mekanizma mantığı ise **akıllı sözleşmeler** ile belirlenmiştir. Her yeni Dai basıldığında ve Dai’ler geri verildiğinde platform ücreti üreten bu platform, ekosistemine bu ücretleri dağıtarak akıllıca bir ekosistem yaratmayı başarmıştır.

## DAI Kripto Dijital Para Birimi Nedir?

DAI tamamen merkezi olmayan, tarafsız, istikrarlı **kripto para birimi**dir. 1 DAI=1 ABD DOLARI olarak eşitlenmiştir. 1 DAI her zaman 1 dolara eşit olacaktır. DAI’nin bu işlevi istikrarlı bir para olma isteğinden gelmektedir.

DAI ile aynı zamanda bir mesaj göndermek kadar kolay ve hızlı para gönderebilirsiniz. Kripto dijital paranız her daim sizin kontrolünüzde olacaktır. Dijital cüzdanlarınızda DAI’lerinizi saklayabilirsiniz. Böylelikle aracı kurum riskini de ortadan kaldırmış olursunuz.

## Maker (MKR) Analiz, Yorum:

Maker token (MKR) Yorumumuz ise oldukça merkeziyetsiz bir proje olmasından dolayı olumlu yöndedir. **Ethereum** ekosisteminde, ethereum ekosistemi ile uyumlu çalışan ve bir çok siber saldırılara dayanıklı **blokzincir** altyapısı ile insanlara güven vermektedir.  


Henüz yeni çıkmasına rağmen 2021 yılı itibari ile 5 Milyar dolarlık kredi platformu her geçen gün artmaktadır. 2021 yılının başlarında her gün %10 büyüme kaydeden bu miktarın yıl sonunda 100 milyar dolara çıkabileceği beklenmektedir.  


Kripto para platformuna katılan yeni insanların ve yeni yatırımcılar ile beraber çok daha hızlı bir şekilde büyümesini sürdüreceği kaçınılmaz bir gerçekmiş gibi duruyor. **Merkezsiz finans (defi)** uygulamaları arasında kapsayıcılık bakımından lider konumda olan maker platformu, paranızın kontrolünü tamamen sizin elinizde tutmanız açısından da oldukça iyidir.

### Maker token (MKR) fiyatı

**Maker token fiyatı** 2018 de ilk zirvesini görmüştür. 1800 dolara ulaşan ve daha sonra tüm kripto paralar gibi düşüş göstermiştir. Coinbase, Binance gibi büyük kripto para borsalarında işlem gören bu kripto para 2021 yılında büyük bir atak yapmıştır.  


2021 yılı itibari ile zirve fiyatı olan 1800 doları aşarak 2000 dolar seviyelerine ulaşmıştır. Her geçen gün merkezsiz finansın rağbet görmesi ile birlikte, **maker (MKR) fiyatı** da yükseliş göstermeye devam ediyor.

The main goal of DeFi is to become an alternative to the banking sector by implementing open source protocols. That is, open access to decentralized lending and new investment platforms for a large number of people. And let them receive passive income from cryptocurrency assets, as well as save on fees for transfers, loans and deposits.  


Most of the existing DeFi are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and the most famous project is MakerDAO, a decentralized lending protocol.   


**Advantages of DeFi applications:**  
\- Any user can get one or another financial service, for example, lending, bypassing the bank.   
\- Decentralized landing protocols minimize risks and open access to borrowed funds 24/7.   
\- The procedure for creating your own digital asset and its introduction to the market has become noticeably easier and has become available to almost everyone.   
\- Payment processing does not last several days, but a maximum of a couple of hours  
\- interest rates and commissions have become much lower.   
\- For developers, the ease of creating applications is becoming a clear advantage due to transparency and open source, in addition, DeFi projects can be developed on any platform that interacts with smart contracts.  


**and disadvantages:**  
\- in times of high volatility, DeFi users will have to pay higher commissions to timely fulfill the necessary obligations to services, which in turn can lead to a sharp increase in commissions or to massive liquidation of assets.  
\- the risk of hacking smart contracts, since there remains a need to trust the smart contract code that is written by a person.  
\- centralization of data flow.  
\- DeFi loans are inferior to loans in the traditional finance sector, since the amounts that can be obtained with the appropriate collateral are relatively small.

UniLend Finance - Unlocking the True Potential of Decentralized Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jamm77_/comments/kvvbgj/unilend_finance_unlocking_the_true_potential_of/,jamm77_,1,2021-01-13 00:47:50,0,/r/u_jamm77_/comments/kvvbgj/unilend_finance_unlocking_the_true_potential_of/,NaN," Since the launch of DeFi Applications in the crypto space, the sector has exploded and I believe it will be even bigger in 2021. DeFi which stands for Decentralized Finance, essentially cuts out the middleman i.e. banks via the use of Decentralized Applications (Dapps) allowing users to have more control over their finances no matter who they are, their background and where they live making it extremely appealing. You can also earn interest on certain assets at a much higher rate when compared to a traditional bank which is a big attraction for many too. For more information on DeFi please check out my other post- [What is DeFi?](https://www.publish0x.com/cryptojamm/what-is-defi-xyvkkzy)

The more prominent Dapps in the DeFi realm currently are MakerDAO, Compound, Aave as well as others. There is however one project that has recently come to light and is bridging the gaps that other projects are lacking, they are UniLend Finance. Currently the DeFi space is rather fragmented, as users with specific requirements will find themselves hopping between multiple Dapps to fulfil their requests making the experience not so streamlined and convoluted. UniLend Finance wants to change this for the better by streamlining processes and incorporating everyday useful features into their DeFi solution such as:

* Spot Trading
* Lending/Borrowing
* Governance Model
* Tokenization of Assets
* Permission-less Listing of Tokens

## What is UniLend?

I first heard of UniLend Finance back in September 2020, where they raised $3.1M in seed and private sale rounds and gained attraction from some of the biggest companies and individuals in the crypto industry including Woodstock Fund, Signal Ventures, Bibox, TRG Capital, Sandeep Nailwal (Matic Network co-founder) and many others. A full list can be found here: [https://unilend.medium.com/unilend-successfully-raises-3-1m-7dc6f950dfa](https://unilend.medium.com/unilend-successfully-raises-3-1m-7dc6f950dfa)

From doing further research I was intrigued and very much interested in what they have set out to achieve and have been following them ever since. UniLend Finance is essentially a DeFi protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and services through smart contracts. Thereby creating a permission-less and decentralized platform for users to engage with for all their finance needs by providing them an all-in-one solution, something that has yet to be done in the DeFi space and thus differentiating it from other products. UniLend has been built from the ground up to truly revolutionize DeFi.

The limitation with existing DeFi platforms is that they act as a gatekeeper in selecting which projects to be a part of their pool which means other viable assets are blocked and unable to participate in the DeFi ecosystem. UniLend does not behave in such a way and allows for a permissionless listing which enables any ERC20 token to be listed making it a truer decentralized and fairer platform.

In conjunction with permissionless listing, the UniLend platform incorporates spot trading functionality for its users allowing them to trade their assets in-platform, meaning users don't have to leave the platform for this specific requirement. These two unique features make UniLend a very appealing product as they are the first DeFi platform to do this. Other features of the UniLend platform include:

* Lending and Borrowing - Assets can be used as collateral to be borrowed against as well as for lending to earn interest.
* Liquidity - By becoming a liquidity provider (LP) users are able to receive fees in proportion to their liquidity pool stake, allowing participants to earn additional tokens on idle assets.
* Governance - The UniLend protocol will be governed through its token holders via proposals ensuring that any adjustments to the protocol are made with a majority consensus.
* Native Utility Token - The native utility token of UniLend will be $UFT the UniLend Finance Token. This token will have numerous use cases for governance, platform utility and much more.

## The UniLend Team

As for the team in charge of the Unilend project, they have a wealth of experience that I strongly feel will help bring the platform to fruition. The Co-founder and CEO Chandresh Aharwar was Vice President of Marketing and Strategy at Matic Network, another successful and popular crypto based project. He therefore brings a lot of knowledge and experience to the table from his work at Matic. Suryansh Kumar is the CTO and prior to this co-founded MetaTransact protocol, which is also another crypto platform that allows users to pay gas fees in tokens instead of Ether. And Tarun Malik who is their CPO also co-founded MetaTransact together with Suryansh. Together with the other team members, UniLend can achieve big things in the Defi realm.

## UniLend Features

As discussed earlier in this article, there are already some established DeFi Dapps, however all have a missing functionality and thus do not provide that all in one solution that will cater for various DeFi users. This means users will have to keep swapping between those Dapps that will help fulfil their requirements. UniLend has plugged this hole, and has released a series of articles on how they differ. Let us start with:

##### UniLend Vs Compound

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 05\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/ysruw2o7jxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b04e1a4c2a7abce5035b634ff6d028130bc2c093)

Compound does not have the ability to support any asset without the involvement of community proposals and voting, UniLend on the other hand allows users to list any Ethereum-based asset in a permission-less manner. Spot trading is another feature missing from Compound which UniLend have incorporated that will allow users to participate in decentralized spot trading of listed assets.

##### UniLend Vs Balancer

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 07\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/i4dqut5ajxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64996ace2a47241484598373ac9da3ce789812be)

From the image above the main differences between UniLend and Balancer is that Balancer lacks lending and borrowing services as well as the option for users to tokenize their assets. Borrowing and lending services is a fundamental part of DeFi as it allows users to borrow against their assets by using it as collateral, and also earn interest through lending it is therefore great to see that it will be part of the UniLend protocol. Tokenizing ones assets will also play a big part for users as it permits them to unlock the farming potential of any assets they hold. Farming is the process of obtaining extra tokens by providing liquidity to liquidity pools enabling the user to maximise returns on their holdings.

It is important to note that UniLend recognise the Balancer DEX platform as one of the leaders in the space so much so that $UFT can be traded seamlessly on the Balancer protocol.

##### UniLend Vs Maker

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 11\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/5pmwlokdjxa61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6105cd0d39be02d178f116935593d2c35b7c35d5)

The differences between UniLend and Maker are quite distinguished, Maker primarily centres around the stablecoin DAI and therefore is limited in the number of assets it supports. There is no spot trading facility as the Maker protocol's main initiative is to regulate the DAI supply, therefore their lending and borrowing services will pay any interest in DAI as well generate DAI against collateralized assets. UniLend's money market on the other hand is a free market, where any ERC20 token can be listed, borrowed and lent out as well as traded.

As someone who has used the Oasis.app platform, which is Maker's DeFi Dapp I can say that it is rather limited and not very exciting to use.

##### UniLend Vs Uniswap

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 17\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/fjuni73fjxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28e1747e6f2db651afecaeccc34a89bdba072ce0)

Uniswap at the time of writing is the most popular decentralized exchange according to [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/) based on the Total Value Locked (TVL) but still does not offer users a complete one-stop shop for their DeFi needs. As Uniswap is essentially a DEX it does not offer any borrowing or lending services, whereas UniLend places huge emphasis on being a platform that allows people to borrow and lend any ERC20 asset. UniLend also intend on being an interoperable platform meaning that they will be able to list assets from other blockchains and not be restricted to just Ethereum. The main similarity to point out is that both platforms allow for permission-less listing, permitting users to list any token onto the platform creating a free market for trading tokens and increasing liquidity. I believe this is an important attribute to have for any platform as it opens up the platform to a much larger market and will give users flexibility.

Unilend have openly acknowledged that they hold Uniswap in high esteem especially as they are the current market leader for DEXs, and as a result have taken inspiration from them which is definitely understandable and a great thing for them to do. But UniLend are also expanding on this by opening up their platform to those who wish to borrow or lend their assets as well as tokenize them. which will cater for those who want this facility creating a truer DeFi experience.

##### UniLend Vs Aave

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 24\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/6hvhe12hjxa61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99ba3e9923d038981269a50e1bd1a4d32c181729)

Aave is one of the largest cryptocurrency money markets currently and has been growing in popularity since its inception, playing an important role in the world of DeFi. And they have managed to achieve this without incorporating 2 features that I feel are critical to DeFi- the support of any ERC-20 asset and spot trading. By not having the mechanism to provide a permission-less listing means Aave are limited in the number of assets they can list and therefore limited in the type of user they attract. And by not offering the ability to spot trade in-platform will more than likely result in users going elsewhere for this facility. UniLend have opted to have an in-platform spot trading facility and this is something that I feel is better to have than not have and will result in users not having to leave the platform for this feature. It is important to recognise that Aave have come a long way in a short span of time and are continuously pushing the boundaries in the space.

##### UniLend Vs bZx

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 12\/12\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/vx67fufjjxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48a29e5ae50761038f9356aa124238242a47413d)

From the image above, bZx is missing 3 key features and thus denying these benefits to their users- the ability to support any asset, spot trading and the tokenization of assets. With UniLend they will be supporting any ERC-20 based asset which opens the market up for users making it more appealing knowing they can trade practically any asset without any restrictions. UniLend will also permit the tokenization of assets making it possible to farm additional tokens in return.

##### UniLend Vs Cream

When comparing UniLend with Cream Finance the main difference is that Cream does not support the listing of any asset without first going through a governance process, whereas UniLend does not making it easier for users to list assets. Based on user feedback it also seems that while Cream does have the ability to trade assets, users can only do so if they are providing liquidity to the said token, which can act as a hinderance. In addition to this, there is also an issue with the lend/borrow feature as users must make many transactions in order to achieve their goal, again making it difficult for users to participate in. UniLend have recognised these issues with the Cream Finance UX and have confirmed that their UX will be seamless.

Above is a side by side comparison of all the aforementioned DeFi protocols.

## Roadmap

Since UniLend's inception in Q3 of 2020, they have so far completed the following milestones as per their roadmap:

* UniLend Swap Feature
   * This feature consists of an automated market making pool which negates the need for centralized components and maintains the liquidity needed to support trading in addition to lending and borrowing, in a completely decentralized manner.
* UniLend Lending Smart Contract
   * UniLend's lending smart contract works differently to existing lending protocols and it thus required a complete custom development. This was completed in Q3 of 2020. Instead of going down the normal route of using multi-asset pools, the UniLend protocol consists of separate pools for different assets (multi-pool system). Creating separate pools for each token is an essential architecture-level advancement that opens up UniLend for permissionless DeFi options whilst limiting exposure of lenders and borrowers to any potential risks associated with all tokens in a specific pool.
* UniLend's Alpha Release - Initium is now live
   * Released on 29th December 2020.
   * This release contains four main functions relating to the lending and borrowing functionality - Borrow, Lend, Redeem and Repay. Borrow and Repay are functions for borrowers on UniLend, and Lend and Redeem are functions for lenders.

Updates to look forward to in Q1 of 2021:

* Liquidity Mining/Staking
   * Liquidity providers are a key component in ensuring the sustainability of a decentralized finance protocol by facilitating liquidity within the protocol. Once the full-featured platform is launched, LPs will be rewarded for their service with governance rights in the form of UFT tokens, in addition to a percentage of trading and borrowing fees.
* UniLend Beta Release
   * This release will entail the launch of a production-level platform which includes all the comprehensive features of the UniLend protocol.
* Comprehensive Audit Report Release
   * UniLend have been working with the best audit teams in the industry since the early days of the project and they will undergo comprehensive audits to ensure the platform is secure and not prone to any vulnerabilities. This report is then to be shared with the community.
* UniLend Mainnet Launch
   * The fully-featured UniLend protocol/platform will launch towards the end of Q1 of 2021. By this point the protocol will have been battle-tested and will offer all of its comprehensive features, including decentralizing trading, lending/borrowing, and liquidity mining all running on mainnet. UniLend will then be accessible to anyone and everyone for all DeFi functionality.
* Integrations and UniLend Ecosystem Expansion
   * Pending third-party integrations upon launch of mainnet include:
      * Wallets - Confirmed Frontier Wallet
      * Aggregators
      * Partner Platforms (external integrations) - Confirmed partner includes CryptoLocally
      * Partner Platforms (internal integrations) - Confirmed partners include OpenDeFi, CyberFi and 3Commas
* Fusion Farming
   * Is a mechanism by which users will be able to attain multiple tokens via liquidity mining for certain assets. Farming campaigns will be initiated for certain projects' tokens which are listed on UniLend. During these campaigns, users who provide liquidity for specific tokens will be able to secure both UFT and the token in question via liquidity mining,

## Partnerships and Integrations

##### [CryptoLocally](https://cryptolocally.com/en)

UniLend have teamed up with CryptoLocally, who are a community run P2P trading platform. CryptoLocally will also use UniLend's lending and borrowing services, allowing for more ERC20 based staking within their Finance Wallet. As a result of this partnership, UniLend's native token UFT has been added to the CryptoLocally platform for trade.

##### [CyberFi](https://cyberfi.tech/)

CyberFi is a non-custodial intelligent automation platform that is reshaping the DeFi experience. This partnership with UniLend will make all their tools accessible to UniLend users, which includes automation tools that will allow users to automate their lending and borrowing as well as execute a borrow or lend position on a token based on a specified price. It is thought that  the tools CyberFi is integrating into the UniLend ecosystem will add immense value to the community making it much more convenient and efficient especially as it allows for smart lending solutions.

##### [StaFi](https://stafi.io/)

Staking finance protocol StaFi will be joining the UniLend ecosystem in bringing their unique rTokens onto the platform. rTokens have the ability to enable users to utilize their staked tokens on DeFi protocols such as UniLend, and integrating these tokens opens the door to a new stream of liquidity on the UniLend platform that will enable users to take advantage of new avenues of yield generation.

##### [CoinDCX](https://coindcx.com/)

UniLend has entered into a strategic collaboration with Coinbase funded CoinDCX, India's largest and safest cryptocurrency exchange with daily trading volumes exceeding $15 million. Through this collaboration, CoinDCX users will have access to new DeFi capabilities, powered by UniLend from directly within the exchange and includes UFT farming. CoinDCX is spearheading the crypto revolution for both retail and industry players and has chosen to become UniLend's official liquidity provider.

##### [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/)

ProBit, one of the largest and most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges in the World, joins the UniLend's ecosystem to offer DeFi functionality to their users. It is thought that ProBit's strong user base and global outreach will increase the strength of liquidity on UniLend whist contributing to the overall momentum of DeFi together. This collaboration will accelerate DeFi adoption by bringing CEX users into DeFi. The partnership between UniLend Finance and ProBit Exchange will explore possibilities for ProBit users to interact with tokens listed on UniLend without leaving the ProBit platform via UniLend's permission-less listing capabilities. This will include the ability to liquidity mine $UFT tokens by providing liquidity to UniLend. And for UniLend users this will mean the farming of $UFT tokens. ProBit is currently one of the top 20 cryptocurrency exchanges in the World with over 800,000 monthly active users and with over 100,000 members in their community.

##### [3Commas](https://3commas.io/)

3Commas is a cryptocurrency trading tool platform with the goal of making trading easy via automated trading bots. They are now looking to break into the DeFi space via their collaboration with UniLend. The 3Commas platform works with most major cryptocurrency exchanges and includes features such as dollar-cost averaging bots, portfolios, and more. They will thus be bringing this suite of sophisticated tools to the UniLend protocol including the Smart Trade Bot, which enables traders to take profit, utilize stop loss features and sell at multiple targets in a manually automated trading fashion.

##### [OpenDeFi](https://opendefi.finance/)

This collaboration will allow UniLend to offer trading, lending and borrowing of synthetic real-world assets. This will also give rise to a larger addressable market cap of these assets, which has now increased by an additional $15 trillion. The OpenDeFi protocol will facilitate bringing physical real-world assets (such as gold and silver) into the DeFi space, so that they can be integrated with DeFi protocols. OpenDeFi will assimilate real-world assets onto the blockchain by utilizing synths, or synthetic assets, that can tokenize real-world assets. On OpenDeFi, all of the tokenized versions of the real-world assets will be backed 1:1 by the real-world assets themselves. These assets will be held by a custodian, and not the company to ensure investments are secured. It has been noticed that there is a growing demand for real-world assets to be integrated into DeFi markets, which UniLend is capitalizing on by leveraging the OpenDeFi protocol.

##### [Fire Protocol](https://fireprotocol.io/)

Fire Protocol enables cross-chain asset support while offering new and robust money markets and DEX/swap features, all while maintaining high speeds, cost-effective transactions, and security via Huobi Eco Chain. The integration with UniLend is set to bring more assets onto the Huobi Eco Chain allowing it to grow frictionlessly alongside those on Ethereum. In addition to this, both teams are working together to explore wrapped $UFT on the Huobi Eco Chain, which will open a vast array of opportunities for holders. Interoperability is also a common interest and both teams agree this will play a big part in the DeFi realm, Fire Protocol has their own cross-chain technology.

##### [Nord Finance](https://nordfinance.io/) (Most Recent)

Nord Finance will integrate UniLend Finance into the Nord Advisory portion of their tech stack. This will enable new DeFi investing strategies for the DeFi community. In addition to this, the UniLend protocol  will be used in conjunction with Nord's proprietary algorithm, which ultimately assists with users' goal-orientated diversified portfolio management. Nord Finance has been designed as a block-chain agnostic platform with multi-chain interoperability, where their aim is to offer users easy access to a plethora of financial products including, but not limited to, yield-farming aggregation, funds management, robo-advisory and loans against assets.

## Conclusion

UniLend have clearly made an impact in the DeFi space since their inception just 3 months ago. Within this time they have made important partnerships and integrated with numerous exchanges, this shows they are a serious player in the DeFi sector. They have been listed on India's biggest exchange CoinDCX and also ProBit in South Korea, with the latter allowing them to tap into a huge market of over 800,000 monthly active users. Many of these partnerships will  not only give access to a wider audience but also a broader range of user. India as well more recently have taken a softer stance towards crypto based projects and I believe have recognised their value towards the economy. India is also home to 1.3 billion people where the average age is 29, a prime demographic for DeFi related products.

The UniLend mission is to become a one-stop shop for all your cryptocurrency borrowing, trading or lending needs. They have recognised that existing DeFi protocols will have one specific feature such as lending/borrowing but then lack another, creating a merry-go-round for the average DeFi user that is looking to maximise the potential of their assets. With UniLend they have all the major DeFi bases covered catering to all kinds of users allowing them more control over their assets. The permission-less listing of tokens feature will give users access to over 6000 tokens allowing UniLend to tap into a $16.7 billion untouched market, I should also point out that this is not a standard feature found on most other platforms. The facility to allow spot trading from within the platform will mean users won't have to leave the platform in order to trade one token for another. The tokenization of assets and governance model will enable users to farm tokens and also vote on key changes respectively. Borrowing and Lending is the bread and butter of the DeFi world and therefore has been incorporated into the UniLend protocol but now having access to over 6000 token will attract many more users to the platform. Attracting users to the platform is something that the team have really mulled over and have come up with a number of incentives for those who utilize the UniLend protocol from LPs to general platform users. Their governance model will allow $UFT holders to vote on proposals which require a majority consensus to be implemented. Ecosystem participants who use UniLend for lending, borrowing, or trading will be rewarded with governance power in the form of $UFT tokens, the same will go for any LPs. 15% of the total $UFT token supply will be allocated to liquidity mining and yield farming rewards. UniLend have definitely ticked all the right boxes in ensuring their product will reach as many people as possible in bringing the benefits of DeFi to those who want it. 

But at the end of the day the crypto industry is about bringing out working products as per the whitepaper and roadmap, and UniLend have stuck to their roadmap with the launch of their Alpha Release- Initium. As mentioned previously this release contains a sleek interface that exhibits 4 main functions relating to the lending and borrowing functionality, it can be found here- [https://app.unilend.finance/](https://app.unilend.finance/) . This is a good indication that the team can deliver what they have set out. And therefore I look forward to the launch of the UniLend mainnet towards the end of this quarter Q1 2021. The team leading this project have done extremely well thus far and based on their crypto backgrounds I believe they are well qualified in taking this project to the finish line. I very much look forward to using the platform for maximising any gains especially as UniLend have ensured that all coding will be audited by external teams and this will be a huge comfort to participants. Enter [UniLend Finance](https://unilend.finance/), the protocol that will enable users to fully unlock the true potential of decentralized finance.

As of 12/01/2021 the $UFT token is trading at $0.49 and can be found on:

An essential feature of today’s cryptocurrency markets is high volatility. The prices of crypto assets can rise one day and plummet the next day. While some crypto investors have experienced serious losses, smart investors are using stablecoins to reduce risk.

Taking into account that stablecoins are starting to become truly mainstream, and are turning into a useful tool for managing price volatility and reducing risks, we’ll focus on several important aspects of stable coins that every cryptocurrency investor should be aware of.

## What Is a Stablecoin?

Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency which keeps a stable price and is not affected by a rise and fall in the market. Tether (USDT) is one of the most popular stablecoins. It’s a crypto coin that is consistently priced at $1. As the market continues to become unstable and unpredictable, stablecoins are gaining more popularity. The more the crypto price drops, the more people are being drawn towards stablecoins. Investors convert some of their regular cryptocurrency into stablecoins so that even if the market collapses, the actual holding price in USD remains stable.

Imagine this situation. After buying Bitcoin for 5,000 USD, it went up to 10,000 USD, but the market started to crack again. If you keep holding BTC, you may end up losing some of your profit. If you want to keep the dollar value stable, you can invest in stablecoins whose prices rarely change.

## What Are The Types of Stablecoins?

There are several [types of stablecoins](https://defiprime.com/stablecoins), depending on the backing used to make their price stable:

* Stablecoins backed by fiat.
* Stablecoins backed by crypto.
* Stablecoins backed by assets and commodities.

Depending on the platform used, stablecoins can be based on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), EOS (EOS), and more.

### Stablecoins Backed by Fiat

This is one of the most popular types of stable coin. The crypto coins with fiat backing are the easiest to create because they are pegged to a fiat currency like the USD. This stablecoin is created in such a way that a certain number of currencies (typically USD) are collected, and then cryptocurrencies are pegged at a 1:1 ratio to this backing currency.

Nonetheless, this type of stable altcoin requires regular checks to ensure that the backing currency from which the stablecoin was issued is not removed. This method of creating a stablecoin should involve a third-party custodian who acts as a guarantor that the fiat currency truly supports it. Examples of stablecoins with fiat backing are [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [USDC (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), and [TrueUSD (TUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/).

### Stablecoins Backed by Other Cryptos

Crypto-pegged stablecoins are the second type of cryptocurrencies with stable prices. These classes of crypto coins made a recent appearance on the market. Some examples of this type of stablecoin are: [Dai (DAI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/), Ethereum-based stablecoin. [EOSDT (EOSDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eosdt/), USD-pegged decentralized stablecoin based on the EOS blockchain and the Equilibrium framework. [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/) backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio.

### Stablecoins Backed by Assets and Commodities

These types of crypto coins are backed by commodities, such as gold, silver, oil, and other commodities and assets. The value/price of these stablecoins is, again, stated in fiat currency, typically USD. An example is [Digix Gold Token (DGX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/digix-gold-token/) where 1 DGX reportedly represents 1 gram of gold on Ethereum.

## Stablecoins Pros

Stablecoins come with several benefits. Let’s see why stablecoins are popular with traders and the entire cryptocurrency market.

### Safety in Unstable Times

The biggest advantage of stablecoin is the fact that it provides security during periods of market fluctuations. This can be seen when the market experiences a sharp collapse. Crypto coins like Tether (USDT) and other stablecoins help traders stabilize during these turbulent times in the marketplace. By ensuring that the price remains stable, the trader’s holdings remain the same. Traders can reinvest in the market when the price starts rising again.

### Store of Value

This feature applies to both stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, one of the great features of stablecoins is that it serves as a store of value and can be utilized as a digital currency, and can be used for buying goods or services online. In this case, stablecoins are especially useful.

### Standardization

By acting as a standard store of value, a stablecoin could be a benchmark in the economy of cryptocurrencies. Given that stablecoin is consistent across a variable dominant market, these collateral-pegged currencies are useful for those searching for a unit of measure to compare market values. Conventionally, the price of stable coins remains unchanged irrespective of the rate the market moves at.

Stablecoin has also been widely used in countries where the government shows less interest in cryptocurrencies. For example, many people in India started buying stablecoins. As the central bank bans transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges, Indian crypto investors are converting their assets into stablecoins.

## Stablecoins Cons

Stablecoins also have their disadvantages. Let’s take a closer look at some of them.

### Dependent on the Asset

These currencies can be risky because they are completely dependent on underlying assets. If the price or value of the underlying asset weakens, it affects the token and all its holders. This is exemplified through the Saudi Riyal fiat currency. Saudi Riyal is pegged to the US dollar, and anytime the global value of the US dollar rises or falls, the same is replicated on the Riyal as well.

Crypto-pegged stakes can be much riskier. If the crypto market falls sharply and the cryptocurrency falls to a very low price, the stablecoin backed by such a crypto will also face a sudden collapse, causing losses.

### Not for Investors

Stablecoins are designed to keep their value/price stable which might be a plus for holders (hodlers). But they do not grow in value over time. If you buy stablecoins for 1,000 USD, their value will most probably be the same $1,000 after a year or five years, which won’t give you any profit.

### Not Completely Decentralized

For real crypto enthusiasts, decentralization is the key point. But stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies and other assets are not completely decentralized.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tether (USDT)

[Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) is a well-known and largely utilized stablecoin. This cryptocoin is fixed to the US dollar at a ratio of 1:1, meaning 1 USDT equals 1 US dollar. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of dollars in reserves that should be equal to the number of USDT in circulation.

### Passive Income With Tether (USDT)

Instead of term deposits with returns usually lower than the rate of inflation, you can use staking when you lock your crypto assets at an exchange, typically for a year.

&gt;**Staking USDT at** [**DEXFIN Exchange**](https://trade.dexfin.com/) **earns you 11% per year; on top of that, you can get 11% per year with DEXFIN (DXF) token, 4.8% with BTC, and 20% with VICTORIA VR (VR).**

### USDC (USDC)

[USDC (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) is another stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Every USDC in circulation is backed by USD that should be held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, states that USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions. The Centre Consortium has two founding members – the Coinbase crypto exchange and the peer-to-peer payment services company Circle. This consortium is open to other crypto companies.

### Dai (DAI)

[Dai (DAI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) stablecoin wasn’t launched by a private company but via a software protocol by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The currency is backed by the US dollar, but it’s fully supported by Ethereum. The price of each Dai is one US dollar. To maintain price stability, DAI is collateralized by a mix of cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart-contract vaults every time new DAI is minted.

### Binance USD (BUSD)

[Binance USD (BUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/), launched in September 2019, focuses on maintaining 1:1 ratio with USD. BUSD is a digital fiat currency, issued as ERC-20 token, supporting BEP-2 (Binance Chain Evolution Proposal 2).

### TrueUSD (TUSD)

[TrueUSD (TUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/) is another widely utilized stable coin. TrueUSD is a stablecoin launched by its parent company TrustToken and described as “the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US dollar.” This cryptocurrency is fixed at the ratio of 1 TUSD to 1 USD. Nonetheless, with regards to the market cap, it is far from the Tether (USDT), and from USDC.

### Diem

Diem Coin from [Diem Association](https://www.diem.com/en-us/association/), formerly known as [Libra](https://blog.dexfin.com/crypto-world/libra-takes-it-all/), is one of the latest additions to stablecoins. Diem Coins are set to be backed by a reserve of assets made up of fiat currencies or cash equivalents and very short-term government securities.

### CBDC

Central banks in over 45 countries (as of May 2020) are exploring ways to create a stable [CBDC](https://blog.dexfin.com/crypto-world/central-banks-exploring-blockchain/) (Central Bank Digital Currency), often with the use of a limited form of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). Some of the reasons for doing so is the issue with the current fiat money printed out of thin air.

## Stablecoins Among the Top Players

Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that differs from others because it comes with a stable value that doesn’t change. Nonetheless, one of the biggest concerns about stablecoins is whether they’re pegged to the fiat currency or the commodity they claim, given that there is considerable ambiguity in investigating and confirming these collaterals.

Currently, Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) are among the top players in the industry, and as additional names like USDC, BUSD, and DAI come up, more and more investors might appreciate the value and usefulness of these stablecoins. As one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value, Tether’s incredible success shows that stablecoin could be an important element to have in your crypto portfolio these days."

&gt;Децентрализованные финансы (DeFi) продемонстрировали свою значительную роль в криптографических деньгах, особенно поздно. Благодаря таким предприятиям, как UniSwap, Compound и MakerDao, децентрализованные деньги превратились в нечто большее, чем катастрофа ICO на поверхностном уровне 2017 года, центром которой были токен-сделки и краудфандинг, а не сертифицированное бескорыстное развитие.  
&gt;  
&gt;У DeFi многое делает решающий шаг, от этого нельзя отказаться. Соглашения о ссуде, торговые возможности, самоуправляемые обмены - все это через исполнение неразрешенного хитроумного соглашения. Предприятия DeFi 2020 проделали особенно невероятную работу по расширению области кредитования и получения и включают в себя очевидные существенные препятствия в нынешней крипто-атмосфере, аналогично централизации криптовалютных сделок.

**Проблема DeFi**  
Это ни в коем случае не проверяет проблемы, с которыми сталкивается DeFi прямо сейчас. Добавьте к этому растущие расходы на газ, незащищенные строгие соглашения (один сломанный фрагмент кода может привести к полной потере активов), нестабильную организацию, отсутствие защиты ресурсов и не очень хороший UX, для того, чтобы решить эти проблемы. Очевидно, много задач по силам. Например, причиной проблемы с DeFi на удивление является отсутствие децентрализации.

В основном это связано с тем, что новые задачи, подобные, например, DEX, не готовы к работе с огромной клиентской базой без, вероятно, некоторых экспериментов. Без устранения ошибок и аварий тонна наличных денег может быть потеряна или даже распылена. Реформистская децентрализация - это полуновая методология, при которой администрирование предлагается клиентам в течение длительного времени, а не в то же время, когда дела могут быстро пойти на юг без наилучшего возможного направления.

**Ставки** \- это способ заинтересовать вашу криптовалюту путем утверждения обменов в публичной цепочке блоков, и это не новость. С момента зарождения криптовалюты существовали разные его циклы. Подумайте о майнинге, но без всего оборудования, высоких счетов за электроэнергию, постепенного уменьшения вознаграждения и, очевидно, постоянной опасности нападения 51%. ставка криптовалюты похожа на хранение денег в банке. В любом случае, у обычного банковского вклада есть очевидные недостатки, во-первых, вы добились централизации.

**Swan Finance** \- это расширение между вселенными инкорпорированных и децентрализованных денег. Он дает лучшее из двух вселенных. SwanFinance предлагает простой в использовании интерфейс для получения процентов, в то время как SwanCredit предоставляет децентрализованный этап совместного кредитования.

Swan Finance is a Blockchain innovation based environment that is turning into a scaffold between a unified customary monetary framework and a decentralized framework through the environment created by their group, which will give another Blockchain-based environment in which the environment incorporates two frameworks into one spot. Their environment offers a stage with a simple to-utilize interface for things like procuring interest on resources conveyed, distributed loaning, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Its clients store their resources on the Swan stage to procure interest through alluring APYs, what's more, clients can utilize their crypto assets as guarantee and loan to others to get extra interest when utilizing the stage in the environment. The environment created by Swan Finance has different other intriguing highlights, for example, a completely utilitarian trade and edge exchanging, interests in which clients can appreciate similar capacities as conventional frameworks, a wallet that gives a spot to securely store resources, exchanging with the stage, which can be coordinated with AI and an installment work that permits clients to utilize their crypto resources for pay for different administrations or different things. Their biological system is exceptionally finished and disentangles the client experience without utilizing another stage. Recently, fortified by globalization, mechanical headway and fortifying overall competition, there has been a creating design towards the extending institutional and land gathering of financial systems and markets. All the while, there has been mounting insightful and methodology premium in the financing issues looked by new and little firms, which are commonly considered to encounter the evil impacts of a subsidizing hole. These twin headways give the motivation to this paper, which attempts to throw some theoretical and observational light on whether the spatial relationship of the cash related system impacts on the movements of subsidizing to little firms across regions. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has exhibited to be a critical part in cryptographic cash, especially beginning late. With adventures like UniSwap, Compound, and MakerDao, decentralized cash has set up itself as more than the surface-level ICO catastrophe of 2017, whose middle was token arrangements and crowdfunding instead of genuine, unselfish turn of events.

&amp;#x200B;

 That isn't regardless, checking the issues defying DeFi at this moment. Append rising gas charges, unprotected sharp arrangements (one broken piece of code can achieve a complete loss of resources), an insecure association, a nonattendance of asset insurance, and a not excellent UX, it will take some immense basic intuition aptitudes to address these issues. Clearly, a ton of assignments are fit. For example, a supporter of the issue with DeFi is  surprisingly  a nonappearance of decentralization. This is generally because new errands, like a DEX for example, aren't set up to manage a colossal customer base without presumably some experimentation. Without working out the bugs and wreck ups, a huge load of money could be lost or even pounded. Reformist decentralization is a semi-new procedure, where organization is offered out to customers as time goes on, versus simultaneously where things can quickly go south without the most ideal bearing. Swan Finance goes probably as a framework between the universes of united and decentralized cash. It gives the best of the two universes. SwanFinance offers an easy to use interface for securing interest, while SwanCredit gives a decentralized stage to shared crediting. While the crypto stores are securely made sure about on the SwanFinance stage obtaining income, customers can use their crypto stores as an assurance and advance to others to procure additional interest on the SwanCredit stage through an Automatic Credit Swap. We use an ERC20 token called SWAN. Use the SWAN token to get the prosperity rate. Stake SWAN tokens to acquire higher premium, up to 20% APY on SWAN tokens, and up to 12% APY for various computerized types of cash recorded underneath. You can pick one month or multi-month store lockup periods. Interest is paid out at standard stretches using the SWAN token.

 works as an expansion between the joined and decentralized cash universe. It gives the best of the two universes. SwanFinance offers a simple to-utilize interface for procuring interest, while SwanCredit gives a decentralized stage to common credits. While the crypto shop is safely made sure about at the SwanFinance phase of procuring, customers can use their crypto shop as protection and loan to others to acquire additional interest at the SwanCredit stage through Automatic Credit Exchange. SwanFinance is a decentralized cash stage where customers acquire significant yields from advanced monetary standards that they choose to keep in front of an audience. By marking SWAN tokens, enlisted customers can procure a lot higher charges, up to 20% APY. We began with SwanFinance. Nonetheless, this is just the start of the Swan Ecosystem which will include: SwanCredit, SwanInvestments, SwanPay, Swan.Exchange, SwanTrade, and SwanWallet. There will be more ways to deal with increase and cutoff points for marking and misusing SWAN tokens.

Hi everyone  
I am new to MakerDao and the MKR token and very intersted.

I  have noticed that the circulating supply is different then the total  supply, I was wondering how does that work, and where are the funds that  are ""out of circulation"" but still part of total supply?

How can I find out how many are in and how many out of supply?

Thank you :)"

Peanut partners with Curve. Protection from slippage and from skewing can be ported to MakerDAO ecosystem with Peanut,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/l0n4a0/peanut_partners_with_curve_protection_from/,Useful_Platform_,1,2021-01-20 00:21:34,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/l0n4a0/peanut_partners_with_curve_protection_from/,NaN," Peanut will connect its protocol to Curve to balance price of trading pairs. In addition to the unique formula for equalizing the value of tokens in Curve trading pairs (more information in this article), Peanut will create for Curve users an additional layer of protection from slippage and from skewing the tokens value.

Due to the high volatility of the crypto asset market, the lack of unified trading platforms, as well as dynamic changes in supply/demand for a particular asset, crypto traders are quite often exposed to slippage as one of the negative factors.

Curve protects its users from slippage by using a unique formula for determining the value of assets in trading pairs. Additionally, Peanut protocol will integrate with Curve which will result in reducing negative effect from slippage and mitigating risks of impermanent loss. Due to the system of a two-level pool of assets operated by Peanut, placing even a very large order will have only temporary instant effect. When large buy/sell orders are executed, the Peanut pool automatically and simultaneously makes the corresponding deal on two levels, that is, on other DEX and CEX, and provides additional liquidity for specific trading pair. As a result, slippage in trading pair disappears.

At the moment, the Peanut team is winding up with integrational settings for Curve trading platform. In a few weeks Curve will be connected to Peanut protocol on the regular basis.

Speaking about Curve, Alex Momot, CEO at Remme and founder of Peanut said:

“The main challenge for us during the testing period is to check the ability to resist one-block flash loan attacks. Successful results will significantly improve AMM mechanics and will give much more confidence to all market participants.”

&gt;*Michael Egorov, CEO of Curve, said:*  
*“Balancing prices by exploiting liquidity on both DEX and CEX platforms is really a good idea. And also very promising. It will be very interesting to see the results of Peanut testing on Curve.”*

Peanut solves existing problems inherent in both centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Namely, the loss of customers as a result of slippage. And we are doing everything we can to improve our algorithms.

This is my first time interacting with Maker or Oasis at all and I'm relatively new to Ethereum. I've been following [this guide online](https://media.consensys.net/how-to-open-a-makerdao-cdp-and-earn-interest-on-compound-a-walkthrough-guide-b9e9f9584000) (which I now realise is somewhat out of date) with the intention of sending my DAI to Compound. I bought 0.12 ETH to use for the vault as this was what I had to spare. Selected ETH-A and went to the 'Generate DAI' tab where I only just find out there's a minimum amount of DAI (500) that I have to generate, and my balance could only generate \~101 DAI (from what I remember).

&amp;#x200B;

So since I could not generate DAI, I clicked back to the dashboard, when I realised my ETH balance had dropped to 0.056! Went all the way back to the 'Generate DAI' tab and surely enough, my balance still somehow said 0.056 instead of the 0.12 ETH I had sent. Same with my Coinbase Wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely confused, what happened to my ETH?? How did I end up losing half my balance without even doing anything??

[edge wei](https://medium.com/@WeiEdge?source=post_page-----dc6a391d5842--------------------------------)

&amp;#x200B;

The lending platform is one of DeFi’s main models. Its future development direction and innovation opportunities have been the focus of DeFi practitioners, with attempts in directions such as introducing “credit loans” and new collateral. This paper analyzes from the perspective of the characteristics of DeFi lending platforms and the demand of market liquidity, and presents how lending platforms would develop in the short-term and the long-term, as well as providing specific designing suggestions for the mortgage model of some assets, which can be viewed as references for platform developers and operators.

# 1. What is the DeFi Lending Platform?

# Interest Rate Protocol and Money Market

A few months ago, Jake Chervinsky, general legal counsel for Compound, published the article *DeFi Protocols Don’t Do “Lending”*, and in the article, he discusses the difference between “interest rate protocol” or “money markets” and the traditional concept of “borrowing” in the financial sector. The article clarifies some of the misconceptions about DeFi lending protocol and, to a certain extent, explains its current status: most existing DeFi lending protocols follow the interest rate protocol or money market model presented in the article, rather than the traditional credit-lending model.

However, the article did not fully answer a series of questions: why participants entered the “interest-rate market”; what value the market brought to them; why the pledge rate was generally set at 50–75%, a similar ratio to mortgage lending, but not higher or lower.

# The Pawn Model

In my opinion, all types of existing DeFi lending platforms are closer to a kind of pawn model at the level of protocol. The pawn model has the features of mortgage lending and money market, so over-emphasizing on one aspect can lead to misunderstanding and deviation of development direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cjhdh3e1x1e61...*

On one hand, as the article discussed, if we understand this business model as borrowing, we would inevitably develop towards a broader lending model, such as credit loans (unsecured), which is exactly what some DeFi platforms claim to do. From this point of view, I agree with Chervinsky that this is an area that DeFi protocol should not involve in. At least for now, smart contracts know nothing at all about men’s credit and repayment ability in the real world, and recording credit information on block-chain is far less effective than the centralized model of combing big data with risk control.

On the other hand, simply emphasizing the characteristic that borrowers do not have to repay their loans does not fully portray the real motivation behind borrowing, and thus does not explain the value of the market. For example, if money markets reflect only the supply-demand and interest-rate differences between currencies, why not just imitate the foreign exchange markets? Stable currency exchange market applies this model. The essence of this model is Exchange, but not the current mortgage-lending model. Thus, we cannot deny that the essence of DeFi borrowers is to collateralize their borrowing with excess mortgage assets to gain the value of borrowed assets, whether it acquires liquidity by buying value-added assets or takes profits by selling short, they ultimately have to repay to cash in real gains. As Chervinsky says, “Borrowers are free to leave and never have to repay, without any additional risks to lenders.” This is just a possible outcome, not a motivation.

The characteristics above are very similar to pawn. On one hand, pawn is a standard pledge model, and pawnshops generally do not have the ability of banks to create money, so the source of its funds is simply self-owned funds or third-party funds (Mortgage loans appear to be similar to DeFi lending protocols and pawn models, but involve credit derivatives in their essence, so it is a completely different financial model, which will not be discussed here). The source for fund pools of DeFi platforms is consistent with this. The pawnbroker, on the other hand, is essentially a model of exchanging the pledge of low-liquid assets for liquidity. In the end, if the pawnbroker fails to redeem the pawn in time, the assets will be cleared. The difference between DeFi lending and pawn-holders is only in terms of the conditions for clearing, counter-parties and processes.

This latter point is crucial, although, on the surface, the pawn shop and DeFi lending platform have completely different roles in the process of financing and clearing, but, in nature, they are the same in the direction of assets and funds transfer, which can be compared to the difference between self-owned e-commerce and platform e-commerce. Therefore, the existing DeFi lending system/interest rate protocol/money market is essentially a “third-party pawn platform business”, which provides the protocol infrastructure, connects the supply and demand parties, and charges the interest rate spreads and the service fee.

# 2. Liquidity provision is the core value of the DeFi protocol

All financial systems are essentially liquidity-providing mechanisms, such as exchanges, lending, insurance and derivatives. Pawnshop is one of the standard liquidity-providing mechanisms. In many articles and courses, the author has expounded that DeFi is a better liquidity-providing model, and thus a better financial service system due to its liquidity carries features of transparency, borderless nature and contract certainty. Therefore, we should analyze the role of DeFi platform from the perspective of liquidity provision, and then decide where its future development is heading.

# Who are the real demanders for mortgage loans/pawns

In the author’s pinion, as a pawning model, DeFi lending can satisfy their needs only by giving the pledgee the ability to exchange low-liquidity assets for high-liquidity assets, which is the fundamental reason for their entry into this market.

Looking from this perspective, we can see that mainstream lending platforms, such as Compound, generally support only a few basic currencies to “mortgage” with each other, (even recently added some currencies but it is still a small deposits), and these currencies are actually high-liquidity assets that can be cashed in at any time, and even buy other assets as basic currencies (e.g., ETH) in exchanges. Therefore, storing these basic currencies as collateral to borrow other basic currencies actually reduces the total liquidity (since the ratio is usually 50–75%, significantly less than the value of the original assets). For the people who store these assets to borrow, they are not real liquidity buyers, and many of them are arbitrageurs revolving collateral based on the logic of rising currency prices. For the whole market, the overall liquidity has actually shrunk (because more liquidity has been locked in, not into the market), that leverage has risen, and the risk of assets being liquidated has increased, which is not necessarily a healthy model.

Therefore, who are the real demanders of liquidity in the DeFi market? There are generally two kinds of people: one is those who own non-mainstream currencies, such as investing in projects that hold large amounts of tokens (commonly referred to as “small currency”), but at a price that is not properly cashed in. Another is those of the DEX market makers, whose funds provided to DEX can obtain market-making income, but they get the liquidity pool voucher (LP) itself is a kind of illiquid assets. If they go to the secondary market to sell, they lose the underlying assets, fee income and all other rights. So, their liquidity was frozen by market making.

For both groups, mortgage lending is clearly the main, if not the only, model that can help them access liquidity. But for platforms, the first group has asset prices that are volatile and their use as collateral is clearly inappropriate, so the platforms are cautious about opening up lending in small currencies, at least by setting their collateral rates very low. For the LP of the DEX, it is obvious that the asset value of mainstream currency transactions is guaranteed, even if for the “XXX-USDT”, half of which is small currency, and another half is mainstream currency transactions, the volatility of LP is less than single currency volatility, and at least 50% of the value is guaranteed. Meanwhile, considering that the LP has market-making income, LP mortgage lending is allowed to be used, which is similar to the model of stock pledge: assets, rights, earnings still belong to themselves, but they can get new liquidity, or be further invested in other assets. In the future, it can be redeemed only with pay interest, which is the real model of raising liquidity.

Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that, DEX market-makers are the real players in the DeFi market at this stage, who have the right assets for mortgage lending (pawning) and the need for liquidity. Lending platforms should design mortgage-lending models for such assets and encourage this group to borrow.

# The Current Status of LP Mortgage Lending and Improvement Measures

When we look at the current mortgage market, we see an obvious phenomenon: LP mortgage lending is hardly going on: Compound does not open up mortgage lending at all, and AAVE has opened up some UNISWAP LP’s lending pool, but which was left there without almost anybody to care for it. The status quo seems to be contradictory to the conclusion made above. To do this, we need to analyze from the platform and the mortgagor’s point of view respectively:

First, from the platform perspective, LP is a low-liquidity asset, in other words, they are less likely to be loaned. After all, the people who borrow the assets intend to get liquidity to invest in other assets. As a result, the storage of LP becomes a mere “liquidity taker” without providing liquidity to the platform, which leads to differences between TVL and the total liquidity. If the difference is large, it can be consider there is a risk of a liquidity imbalance across the platform, which means there is a relative shortage of money to borrow. Of course, this can be improved by adjusting algorithms and parameters, such as reducing the pledge rate for LP assets, or placing them in a separate pool like AAVE, which does not take up the borrowing capacity of other pools and can also raise their lending rates. As we discussed in previous paragraphs, LP mortgage lending is “rigid demand” for DEX market makers, and clearly these measures do not affect their borrowing needs.

Second, from the point of view of LP holders, there are two problems that may affect their storage willingness (AAVE, after all, has launched LP lending without a lot of storage). The first is that LP has fee income. From the contract level, during the mortgage, LP is not in the hands of the platform, and there is double about whether contract will get LP corresponding fee assets. In addition, after platforms such as Uniswap have launched liquidity mining, some LP can be mortgaged to these platforms to mine, if the lending platform does not have the ability to help users with mortgage, LP holders would lose potential mining profits. Second, if LP assets can be loaned out, the problem above is more serious: it is good for borrowers to have fee income and mining income before the borrower returns, but the original holder lost revenue. In addition, borrowing LP can be a bit of a hassle for borrowers, because lending interest is denominated in LP, so borrowers have to operate by themselves to increase liquidity, so they can return all their assets, which is also a cumbersome process. To solve these problems, it can consider the labeling LP as a “non-loanable” asset, so that the holder has no risk of transaction fees or mining losses. At the same time, the platform should be able to transfer the assets to the corresponding mining platform to obtain mining proceeds for users (also depends on the premise that LP assets cannot be borrowed). As a result, the lending platform has the same ability with some of the platform dedicated to helping users with LP mining platform, while at the same time it can allow users to borrow to increase liquidity, which will reflect a clear competitive advantage.

# 3. Development Directions and Opportunities of DeFi Lending Platforms

Overall, DeFi Lending Platform is a platform that provides users with liquidity through mortgage lending/pawn models. It finds users with liquidity needs, and designs corresponding mortgage lending models for their illiquid assets, which should be the main direction of the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 7nru9m4bx1e61...*

The second part of this paper takes the LP assets of DEX market-maker as an example, analyzes the liquidity demand of the holders, and gives the ideas and key points of designing mortgage and loan products for LP assets. In this basic model, DeFi lending platforms should develop in the direction of looking for other collateralised assets to serve a wider user base.

At present, we see that platforms, such as MakerDAO, even are not a model of borrowing, but are also greatly expanding the type of mortgage assets. Especially with the introduction of “real world assets” rather than native digital assets as collateral, it is a very important step. For DeFi lending platforms, the people who own such assets, is apparently the demander of liquidity, to whom the platforms should provide with mortgage lending services. At the same time, their demand for asset mortgages is closer to LP assets rather than high-liquidity assets, such as a person who wants to mortgage a house for liquidity, apparently he or she does not want his or her house to be “loaned” by others on the platform. Therefore, LP’s design can basically extend to digital voucher mortgage lending models of real-world assets.

As we all know, “physical asset chain” is a commonplace problem. There is no perfect “Trustless” solution, so it must be based on the credibility of asset managers. For example, the house chain must have the real estate management organization to cooperate with, so it can guarantee that the house ownership can transfer to the liquidator hand when the asset clears. Gold, dollar and other assets must also be digitized by the financial institutions that manage them, so that they can enter the DeFi world. In this process, financial institutions, which are the same as the concept of “**digital banking**”, should have inherent advantages. The term “digital bank” refers to a financial institution that, on one hand, has a commercial banking license, and can engage in asset management, mortgage and currency issuance, while on the other hand, it can convert a legal tender into a stable currency on a block chain, and can digitize vouchers such as gold and property.

This kind of financial institution is the bridge between the real world and the digital world. The author has always called it “the bridge of the parallel world”. The platforms, such as DeFi lending, can cooperate with this kind of financial institution to further improve the efficiency of providing liquidity, which is the major opportunity for the development of DeFi lending platforms, and is also the only way for future continuous improvement of DeFi’s overall scale.

*DeFi platforms allow traders to freely operate their digital assets in a decentralized market.*  

*Until recently, one of the best and most sought-after tools for connecting users with products like stablecoins, loans, and interest-bearing accounts has been MakerDAO. However, with the launch of Kava's new-generation decentralized bank which Forbes magazine describes as “the hidden gem of the decade”, traders have much more room to maneuver.*

*Taking the principles of MakerDAO as a basis, Kava.io has become its main alternative and according to analysts at QDAO DeFi, it is going to demonstrate steady rapid growth.*

**What is Kava?** 

Kava.io is a multi-chain DeFi platform for collateralized decentralized loans. It allows users to operate digital assets outside the Ethereum blockchain in order to mint Kava's own stablecoin - USDX. 

The scheme is quite transparent. The user signs a smart contract (a CDP) by depositing some amount of currency into Kava as collateral. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cisx3r61s2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265601d8419e902606a0480f484bf3f6320e00b3

Thus, the user then has the opportunity to mint a fixed amount of USDX, depending on the size of the collateral, for further usage. The Kava stablecoin can be operated on various blockchain networks, leveraged, hedged with interest or just held as a stable asset.          

The collateral is held by the platform until the USDX loan is paid off. All transactions on the platform are conducted in BNB but the developers are planning to integrate BTC, XRP, ATOM and other major cryptocurrencies.  

**Why Kava?** 

\- It is fully interoperable with CosmosCDK. It means that, unlike MakerDAO, this platform provides the opportunity to operate different cryptocurrencies via different services.

\- Kava.io doesn't oblige traders to conduct KYC verification or provide credit history. 

\- Traders using Kava.io can get USDX minting rewards. In order to qualify for KAVA distributed from the rewards pool (74,000 per week), the user has to generate a USDX loan. The amount of reward depends on the loan size. 

*The main risk of such loans is connected with the collateral price. If the BNB rate goes down, the platform will ask the trader to deposit extra currency. Otherwise, the collateral is liquidated.* 

**How to use the platform** 

As mentioned above, Kava.io supports different blockchain systems. There are 2 ways to deposit digital assets and start minting USDX. You can access the platform by creating a CDP via Kava-supporting wallets: Cosmostation, Frontier etc. or directly through Kava's Web App. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img otm0183yr2e61...*

The built-in interface shows all the information about your digital assets: the amount of collateralized (locked) and available BNB, borrowed USDX, borrow limit and wallet balance. At the very top you can find the collateral liquidation price and current market price of your locked assets. 

Kava's Web App is intuitive and allows you to stay on top of the needed parameters, so let's suppose that we picked it to start minting stablecoin. 

**Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the Kava developers' software.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2zlkd7kwr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bdf14157b0e9c7f3345f2466273f8d20eaa45ce

First of all, you need to attach your wallet to the platform. Click on “Start Earning” on the Kava's official site.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fwlf7t4vr2e61.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0826503dbdab02f4131059c309b33cccef3a8735

Now you should choose a wallet to connect. We are going to pick Trust Wallet. If you don't have one, you can download it from the App Store (IOS) or Play Store (Android). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/70d8rortr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=384dd9423d06a05686f7288cf451c9f7897558b2

Make sure that Kava is enabled in your Trust Wallet. Search for “Kava” and turn it ON. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z3ecueisr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d291b693e207a33ef51a9c9b40bc25dc42aa8b20

You need some BNB to make a transaction, so send the currency to your Trust Wallet. Copy your Binance Chain address and use it as the transfer recipient. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2e2y2xzqr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9ca7205bcf488bd466759950bb194af06ca9fd1

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/opxa1f54r2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2da905a7b08f28e684ce231b30a08554d224e0f4

&amp;#x200B;

Now you can attach your wallet. Go to Kava's Web App, press “Trust Wallet” and scan the QR-code provided by Kava's Web App. 

To do this, you need to open Trust Wallet on your phone and press the Gear (Settings) button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then choose “WalletConnect” and scan the code using the camera. Then press “Connect”. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw6opkyor2e61.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ba981dbc4fd45c9de2ccd3cf3c0d9badf78d965

Now you need to transfer your BNB to the Trust Wallet Kava address. Once you've attached your wallet, the platform recommends that you make a transaction. 

Enter the amount of currency you want to deposit or press the “MAX” button to automatically fund all your balance. Then you need to confirm the transaction in the pop-up on your Trust Wallet app and press “Done” once the transaction is complete.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p5vvtfqlr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f272eba6c181e04156a9424b5b468882d1ba4f68

Voila! Now you can take out a loan. Although you’ve transferred 1 BNB, the amount shown is a bit less due to transaction fees.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 3snbbux7r2e61...*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9em458gir2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da46675eab8710a30741e99907b71fcb12c30ff7

Press the “Borrow” button in the “USDX Borrowed” window on the main page of Kava's Web App. Enter the amount of BNB to lock and the amount of USDX to borrow. You can see the information about your balance, the current market price of BNB, and liquidation price as well. 

Confirm the transaction in the Trust Wallet App. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9euhr6yfr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9a18d8312a5aa72c52bc131ff2dc03e5b929568

Now you are the holder of USDX stablecoins. 

Our team recommends that you regularly check the BNB rate in order to avoid collateral liquidation. Lock more BNB or repay USDX in order to protect your borrowing and be especially careful when leveraging the assets received.

I've been reading a lot about DeFi lately and I thought about sharing some information about what DeFi is and what it consists of, especially for beginners.   
I’ve started the Case Study series with 2 coins of choice ([ADA and VET](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jve3mz/case_study_ep1/)), however, this time I’ll focus on DeFi as it is getting a lot of attention in the last few days, especially because of the GME stock case (check r/wallstreetbets if you don't know nothing about it). Most of the people don’t know what DeFi really is and we should try to educate them since we believe it is indeed the future of our economy and financial system. If this post gets attention, I might make more case studies explaining in a more detailed way what you can do thanks to DeFi.

I also want to promote discussion within the community, all of us are here for a reason and I don’t think pumping Doge is that reason. I want to learn as well as there’s still so much stuff to know. **Fool is one who wants to learn what he already knows.**

DeFi is expected to grow further in the coming years as you might be noticing in the last months.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Decentralized Finance?**

DeFi is the movement that allows users to utilize financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without the need to rely on centralized entities. These financial services are provided via Decentralized Applications (Dapps), in which a majority of them are currently deployed on the Ethereum platform.

DeFi is a set of products and services that acts as a replacement for institutions ranging from banking, insurance, bonds and money markets. 

In order for DeFi Dapps to work, it usually requires collateral to be locked into smart contracts. The cumulative collateral locked in DeFi Dapps is often referred to as the Total Value Locked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Decentralized Finance vs Traditional Finance**

It’s tough for the unbanked to compete on a level field. The DeFi movement is about bridging these gaps and making finance accessible to everyone without any form of censorship. DeFi opens up huge windows of opportunities and allows users to access various financial instruments without any restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

Banks enable money to move around the world by providing value transfer services and much more. However, banks are managed by humans and governed by policies that are prone to mismanagement and corruption.

DeFi seeks to build a better financial landscape made possible by the advent of the internet and blockchain technology, particularly in three key segments of the banking system:

**Payment &amp; clearance system:**

Remittances involving banks worldwide typically take a few working days to complete and involve all sorts of fees. There may also be issues with documentation, anti-money laundering laws, privacy concerns, and more.

Cryptocurrencies that powers the DeFi movement allow you to bypass intermediaries who take the lion’s share of profits of these transfers.

**Accessibility:**

The World Bank estimates that as of 2017, there are 1.7 billion people who do not own an account at a financial institution and more than half of them are from developing nations.

Accessing DeFi Dapps only requires a person to have a mobile phone &amp; internet access, as opposed to going through lengthy verification processes. The World Bank estimates that two-thirds of the 1.7 billion unbanked have access to mobile phones.

**Centralization &amp; Transparency:**

There is no way for regular investors like us to fully know what financial institutions do, however we did get a glimpse the last week with everything that is happening at wall street.

It will be different with DeFi. DeFi protocols built on top of public blockchains such as Ethereum are mostly open-sourced for audit and transparency purposes. They usually have decentralized governing organizations to ensure that everyone knows what is happening and that no bad actors can single-handedly make bad decisions.

DeFi protocols are written as lines of codes which run exactly as they are programmed to, and any flaws quickly become evident as it is open for public scrutiny. At the end of the day, DeFi’s biggest strength lies in being able to cut out intermediaries and operate with zero censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

**The DeFi Ecosystem**

DeFi Dapps stand to revolutionize traditional financial services by removing the need for any middlemen. However, it should be noted that DeFi in its current state is still highly nascent and experimental with many projects being rapidly improved upon daily.

**How Decentralized is DeFi?**

DeFi can be centralized, semi-decentralized and completely decentralized.

**Centralized**:

Characteristics: Custodial, uses centralized price feeds, centrally-determined interest rates, centrally-provided liquidity for margin calls.

Examples: Salt, BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius

&amp;#x200B;

**Semi-Decentralized** (has one or more of these characteristics but not all)

Characteristics: Non-custodial, decentralized price feeds, permissionless initiation of margin calls, permissionless margin liquidity, decentralized interest rate determination, decentralized platform development/updates.

Examples: Compound, MakerDAO, dYdX, bZx

&amp;#x200B;

**Completely Decentralized**

Characteristics: Every component is decentralized.

Examples: UniSwap, SushiSwap

&amp;#x200B;

**DeFi Key Categories:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Stablecoins**

The prices of cryptocurrencies are known to be extremely volatile. It is common for cryptocurrencies to have intraday swings of over 10%. To mitigate this volatility, stablecoins that are pegged to other stable assets such as the USD were created. 

Decentralized stablecoins are created in a decentralized manner and are governed by decentralized autonomous organizations. Its reserves can be publicly audited by anyone. Stablecoins are important in making DeFi applications more accessible to everyone by having a stable store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lending and Borrowing**

Borrowing from banks comes with other restrictions such as having a good credit score and having sufficient collateral to convince the banks. Decentralized lending and borrowing remove this barrier, allowing anyone to collateralize their digital assets and use this to obtain loans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchanges**

To exchange one cryptocurrency to another, we can use exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance. Exchanges like these are centralized exchanges, meaning they are both the intermediaries and custodians of the assets being traded. Have you ever heard of “not your keys, not your coins”? Users of these exchanges do not have full control of their assets, putting their assets at risk in case the exchanges get hacked and are unable to repay their obligations. 

Decentralized exchanges aim to solve this issue by allowing users to exchange cryptocurrencies without giving up custody of their coins. Without storing any funds on centralized exchanges, users do not need to trust the exchanges to stay solvent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Derivatives**

A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from another underlying asset such as stocks, commodities, currencies, indexes, bonds, or interest rates. Traders can use derivatives to hedge their positions and decrease their risk in any particular trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fund Management**

Fund management is the process of overseeing your assets and managing its cash flow to generate a return on your investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lottery**

Putting a DeFi spin onto lotteries allows for the removal of custodianship of the pooled capital unto a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. With the modularity of DeFi, it is possible to link a simple lottery Dapp to another DeFi Dapp and create something of more value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Payments**

A key role of cryptocurrency is to allow decentralized and trustless value transfer between two parties. With the growth of DeFi, more creative payment methods are being innovated and experimented.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insurance**

Insurance is a risk management strategy in which an individual receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company in the event of an unfortunate incident. While most projects have gotten their codebases audited, we never know if the smart contracts are truly safe and there is always a possibility of a hack which may result in a loss.

&amp;#x200B;
