Since the project on the exchange, it has aroused much discussion and attention from users. 

According to the latest news disclosed by the Golff team, Golff will focus on developing three sectors: Aggregate Lending, Vault2.0 and the Gas Tokens.

Golff's one-click aggregated lending service will continue to aggregate current mainstream DeFi lending platforms, such as MakerDAO, Compound, AAVE, dYdX, etc. This will greatly expand the underlying assets that can be used for lending, enhance the user's asset liquidity, and also optimize the best interest rate, reducing the user's borrowing cost. It is expected to be officially launched in mid-February.

Golff will use the Gas Tokens chain fee replacement to solve the Ethereum's high-rate issue, significantly reducing fees and lowering the barriers to user participation. This model is very beneficial to chain arbitrageurs and bulk traders who originally had excessive gas costs.  

Golff Vault 2.0 supports multi-currency participation and supports more strategies for Golff Vault V2 to switch.  As long as users deposit assets with one click, they can obtain the optimal returns. This means that the Vault has enhanced the ""strike range"" and supports the aggregation of more DeFi products. 

Golff community volunteers initiated a vote on the improved version of the Vault to supported the products on the Huobi public chain Heco, and diversified the ecosystem. It is expected that Golff will support both Ethereum and Huobi Heco at the same time. In this way, the huge user base of Huobi can be a diversion for Golff.

The most important thing for any project is the value of its tokens and the potential for future growth. GOF is a native functional token of Golff. GOF holders have the right to participate in governance while also sharing platform profits. In addition, holding GOF can also participate in liquidity mining in the Golff system. From the perspective of GOF itself, whether you want to dig GDAO to participate in governance or Vault revenue, GOF is the core.

 
In the second outbreak of DeFi recently, the DeFi currency continues to pump new highs. So users can keep paying attention to YFI and GOF, especially compared to the YFI that has skyrocketed, GOF has more potential to rise."

As Yearner Finance just launched five new pools on Uniswap with amazing yield farming rewards, we want to tell you more about the tokens you can deposit. We’ll start with DAI, the world’s largest decentralized stable token.

**Main facts about DAI**

DAI is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Its value is pegged to the US dollar, so 1 DAI is always worth $1. DAI is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the DeFi industry, and its current market capitalization is $1.6 billion. The dollar peg is maintained by a set of smart contracts: if the price moves away from $1, the system will either burn MKR (Maker) tokens or create new ones to bring the exchange rate of DAI back to $1.

As DAI is a regular ERC-20 token, you can store it in most Ethereum wallets, send it to other wallets and exchanges, trade it etc. The best non-custodial wallets for DAI are MetaMask and MEW. There are also DeFi projects that ‘wrap’ DAI to use it on other, much faster and cheaper blockchains, for example, xDAI and rDAI.

**Who issues DAI?**

The issuer of DAI is the MakerDAO lending protocol, designed by the famous developer Rune Christensen. Note that it’s not issued arbitrarily by a company or group of people, but rather by an algorithm. The emission is completely automated: when users deposit crypto as collateral in MakerDAO, new DAI tokens are created

**Is DAI backed with anything?**

Yes. It is backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies deposited by users as collateral on MakerDAO. Currently the platform supports 18 collateral currencies, including ETH, WBTC, LINK, COMP, BAL, USDT, USDC, UNI, BAT etc. Every DAI token is backed by a corresponding amount in one of these 18 collateral currencies. This is the peculiarity of DAI: it’s pegged to the USD but backed by crypto.

By the way, originally the MakerDAO token had only one type of collateral — Ethereum. It was known as single-collateral DAI, or SAI. This system was shut down when the multi-collateral DAI was introduced in March 2020.

**Is DAI better than USDT or USDC?**

DAI is decentralized and 100% transparent. You can always check how much collateral is deposited in the smart contracts and match that amount with the current number of DAI in circulation. There’s no company or person administering DAI, so even if the founding team of MakerDAO were to leave the project, it will still continue working. This is very different from Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which are run by Tether and Circle respectively. You can’t really check yourself if the collateral in US dollars is indeed stored in their bank accounts. In short, USDT and USDC are not transparent at all.

**How can you earn money with DAI?**

MakerDAO’s Oasis app allows you to deposit DAI into a sort of a savings account to earn a small interest. You can get a bit more by locking your DAI into other lending protocols, such as Compound and Aave. (Once we launch Phase 2 of Yearner Finance, you’ll be able to earn much more, by the way.)

If you want to maximize the income, however, the best way to do it is through decentralized trading and yield farming. When you lock DAI in the Yearner Finance pool on Uniswap, you’ll get a part of all the trading fees that the pool generates. If the trading activity is high, you can earn up to 20% on your deposit easily. But this isn’t the main source of income: the real advantage is getting the yield farming rewards in YFNR tokens.

For each Ethereum block, we will distribute 2 YFNR to the DAI-YFNR pool as rewards. Your share will depend on how much liquidity (YFNR and DAI) you submitted to the pool. But since the block time in Ethereum is only 13 seconds, 2 YFNR per block turns into circa 600 YFNR every hour, and that’s a lot of money!

Only in the first week after the launch of the pools, we are offering a x10 farming bonus: we’ll pay not 2, but 20 YFNR per block. This is an opportunity you should not miss. Head over to [Yearner Finance website](https://yearner.finance/) for additional info, then stake some DAI in our Uniswap pool and start earning!"

Teaser: The Spartan Protocol combines UniSwap, THORChain, Synthetix and MakerDAO features, but will be launched on Binance Smart Chain as its own separate protocol. The most powerful product is the synthetic assets on Binance Smart Chain which boosted SNX on Ethereum from 10M mcap to 2B mcap (x200) within 1 year. The Synthetics launch is expected in Q1 2021 on Binance Smart Chain.

Tokenomics:

Initial Start Price:
The initial value of SPARTA was set at $0.30 per token, meaning most current token holders paid $0.30 per token, where it’s currently trading at $0.30. New ATH and price discovery coming.

CZ CEO of Binance highlighted Spartan Protocol:

Copy this: ""youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4610&amp;v=8vg-6mMdHYo&amp;feature=emb_logo""

Description:

The Spartan Protocol is a protocol for incentives liquidity and synthetic assets (assets pegged to the price of another asset) on the Binance Smart Chain. The core piece of the protocol are liquidity pools, similar to Uniswap, but instead of a fixed-rate fee model a liquidity-sensitive fee model similar to THORChain’s slip-based fees is used.

Currently, liquidity providers (and traders) are penalised on automated-market maker protocols, such as Uniswap, because of manipulation from value-extracting arbitrage bots. These arbitrage bots have been around for a long time now, and suck up millions of liquidity from unknowing users on a weekly basis.

As well as, synthetic mining protocols such as MakerDao and Synthetic use illiquid collateral/markets to liquidate collateral on, which makes it vulnerable to a downwards spiral which has already caused multiple chain liquidations in the past.

Spartan wants to solve these issues through an AMM protocol, through the use of a single settlement asset and protocol-wide incentives to grow liquidity. A slip-based fees model is used to reward liquidity providers rather than slippage bots, a solution discussed and researched a lot by THORchain. Finally, collateralised pool shares (synthetic assets) are used instead of liquid collateral. Synthetic assets are generated through the protocol, using price anchors offered by the liquidity pools, collaterised by liquidity pool shares. These shares are on-market, value-stabilised and can instantly be liquidated. Thanks to this, positions can be liquidated within causing downwards spirals.

The protocol aims to be community-driven and therefore uses a DAO (governance) set-up for fee rates, time factors and upgrades of certain parts of the code (voted on by holders who get incentivised to do so). But, doesn’t overcomplicate governance or sets high requirements for any proposal to pass.

Because the protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain, BNB is required to use the protocol and pay for fees. Similar to how ETH is used to pay for gas on the Ethereum Network.

Summarised, I got interested in Spartan Protocol because:

    It took the best parts from the most popular AMM protocols, combined them and created a very solid protocol by doing so.

    The protocol was launched on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a very unique value proposition at this point, subject to Binance exposure.

    Higher leverage, lower fees and much faster then $SNX

    The SpartanDAO is build directly on smart contracts

Coinbase’s Earn Dao issued out Ethereum to convert to Dao. It took me a while to get to this point with my memory, and I’m not sure if I’m getting this right but they sent like .004 ETH or something like that and your mission was to convert using CDP on makerdao cdp.makerdao.com
I don’t remember this ever being on your wallet otherwise you would’ve just kept the ETH , coinbase locked it in this CDP so that you would have to convert .

The issue is 

At the time it was around $5 of ETH and I tried to convert but wondering if anyone else had the same issue , it wasn’t enough to pay for the gas. So there it sat in CDP. 

Maybe this is a reach, but it seems like makerdao sort of ran off with the ETH that coinbase gave them. With the current rise of ETH I’m looking to go back to my account and recover what’s there. 

I had to write this post just in case anyone else ran into a similar issue we can both rant together haha . 

If makerdao ran off with the riches it could be something big"

If you have small amounts to play with or even bigger you should probably look into investing in something that will explode right? You will gain more exposure to the market by hedging here.

"Excellent report on DeFi, highlighting Maker, from St. Louis Fed",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/lfv9fm/excellent_report_on_defi_highlighting_maker_from/,scottrepreneur,1,2021-02-09 13:11:01,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/lfv9fm/excellent_report_on_defi_highlighting_maker_from/,NaN,"&gt; To illustrate the concept, let us use the example of MakerDAO, a decentralized protocol that is used to issue the USD-pegged Dai stablecoin. First, the user deposits ETH in a smart contract classified as a collateralized debt position (CDP) (or vault). Subsequently, they call a contract function to create and withdraw a certain number of Dai and thereby lock the collateral. This process currently requires a minimum collateralization ratio of 150 percent, meaning that for any 100 USD of ETH locked up in the contract, the user can create at most 66.66 Dai.6 
&gt; 
&gt; Any outstanding Dai is subject to a stability fee, which in theory should correspond to the Dai debt market's maximum interest rate. This rate is set by the community, namely the MKR token holders. MKR is the governance token for the MakerDAO project. As shown in Figure 3, the stability fee has been fluctuating wildly between 0 and 20 percent. 
&gt;
&gt; To close a CDP, the owner must send the outstanding Dai plus the accumulated interest to the contract. The smart contract will allow the owner to withdraw their collateral once the debt is repaid. If the borrower fails to repay the debt, or if the collateral's value falls below the 150 percent threshold, where the full collateralization of the loan is at risk, the smart contract will start to liquidate the collateral at a potentially discounted rate.
&gt; 
&gt; Interest payments and liquidation fees are partially used to ""burn"" MKR, thereby decreasing the total MKR supply. In exchange, MKR holders assume the residual risk of extreme negative ETH price shocks, which may lead to a situation in which the collateral is insufficient to maintain the USD peg. In this case, new MKR will be created and sold at a discounted rate. As such, MKR holders have skin in the game, and it should be in their best interest to maintain a healthy system.
&gt; 
&gt; It is important to mention that the MakerDAO system is much more complicated than what is described here. Although the system is mostly decentralized, it is reliant on price oracles, which introduce some dependencies, as discussed in Section 3.2. 
&gt; 
&gt; MakerDAO has recently switched to a multi-collateral system, with the goal to make the protocol more scalable by allowing a variety of cryptoassets to be used as collateral. 
&gt;
&gt; [cont'd]
&gt; 
&gt; There is a large variety of lending protocols. Some of the most popular ones are Aave (Boado, 2020), Compound (Leshner and Hayes, 2019), and dYdX (Juliano, 2017). Figure 5 shows the asset-weighted borrowing and lending rates for Dai and ETH. For Dai, the figure also includes the MakerDAO stability fee, which should always be the highest rate in the system. Surprisingly, this is not always the case, meaning that some people have paid a price premium in the secondary market. As of September 2020, Dai accounts for almost 75 percent of all loans in the DeFi ecosystem.

National AI policy, REM strategy, 8000 crore for Quantum Technology research, UPI and IndiaStack, 2 of our private companies have developed fully indigeneous 5G systems. We are developing cutting edge space (MOM, Gaganyaan) and defence tech too (5 gen jet, hypersonic delivery vehicles, AI swarms).

But now its time for a bigger action.

Prime Minister Modi should launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold.

India should launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold. More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.

We make this case below. But if you haven't been following cryptocurrency closely, or India's proposed ban, don't worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should buy Bitcoin rather than ban Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.

**1. Cypto is now a Trillion Dollar Industry**

Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by a pseudonymous engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto. His creation solved an unsolved problem in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.

Yes, you read that right: trillion. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of today, it's $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That's more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.

A trillion here, a trillion there, soon you're talking real money!

So in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s. And like all great innovations, it's led to the creation of remarkably valuable companies (like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken) and technologies (like Ethereum and Zcash). But people still don't get how large the space is. Let's give some more numbers.

Ethereum, the number two cryptocurrency, is worth &gt;$100B. It extends the concepts introduced in Bitcoin to permit so-called smart contracts, which allow engineers to write programs that can send and receive money.

Ethereum has given birth to an entire sector called decentralized finance (""defi"") which is to traditional finance (""tradfi"") what the internet was to paper-based media. Almost $30B in assets are now held in defi for the purpose of earning interest, taking out loans, or trading assets.

The Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were used to send &gt;$1T in volume in 2020, more than PayPal.

So-called ""stablecoins"" built on Ethereum have allowed the transfer of stable US dollar equivalents to anyone in the world; they too transact billions of dollars in volume every 24 hours.

The website [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) has a higher Alexa ranking (#324 at last check) than the website [wsj.com](https://wsj.com/) (last ranked as #440). In other words, a crypto website that lists the price of cryptocurrencies is more popular than the Wall Street Journal's official website! And that flip first occurred in 2017.

The research paper describing Bitcoin has been cited at least 13,000 times by professors at places like Stanford, Harvard, and MIT, and cryptocurrencies have stimulated innovations in applied cryptography and distributed computing.

More than five billion dollars in venture capital has been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups by the world's top tech investors, including Marc Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures.

Annual crypto transaction volumes are now in excess of $1T.

Thousands, millions, billions, trillions – the numbers start to stun after a while. So here's some qualitative commentary from prominent people and institutions to supplement the quantitative barrage.

Elon Musk: The world's richest man has said that Bitcoin is ""inevitable"" and changed his Twitter bio to simply ""#Bitcoin"".

The IMF: Cryptocurrency could ""completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills"" and ""could be the next step in the evolution of money.""

The World Bank: ""Cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are

part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and commerce are organized.""

Larry Summers, Former US Treasury Secretary: ""Bitcoin is here to stay"" and the ""financial industry will adopt the technology underpinning bitcoin.""

At this point you should realize that this crypto thing is kind of a big deal. And that there's an enormous gap between the economic impact of crypto versus its portrayal in the popular press, and that it might seem a little hasty to cut India off from an emerging trillion dollar industry.

But it's actually even more important than that. Because crypto isn't just an economic sector, it's a civilizational advance on par with the internet, and – if embraced rather than banned – can actually solve many of the issues facing modern India. Starting with national security.

**2. National Security: Crypto means India can’t be deplatformed**

As noted above, a recent bill introduced in the Indian parliament proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee. One of the likely justifications is to protect India's national security. But as we'll see, Bitcoin and allied decentralized technologies are actually essential to India's national security.

Bitcoin prevents financial deplatforming

First, some definitions. A digital rupee would be a centralized currency controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized international cryptocurrencies that no single actor has control over. The administrators of the digital rupee at RBI would be able to issue wallets, freeze accounts, and reverse transactions. But Bitcoin is more akin to digital gold, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.

It is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated 3,378 tons of gold from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.

Ethereum prevents social deplatforming

Similarly, for the same reason that Mexico, Germany, and France expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be national replacements for Twitter, but non-Indians won't be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That's what crypto permits.

Note that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too that millions of Indians are currently dependent on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like SWIFT, PayPal, or Google Pay.

What could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A fake photo of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the invasion of Brazil. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it's India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.

In short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the TikTok ban, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India's national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.

**3. Foreign Investment: Crypto brings capital to India**

A second concern often voiced as a rationale for the proposed crypto ban is that cryptocurrency will cause capital flight. But the opposite is true.

After all, what do Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Naval Ravikant, Chamath Palihapitiya, and countless CEOs, founders, angels, and venture capitalists have in common? They all support Bitcoin. So do Russian and Chinese ancestry entrepreneurs like Pavel Durov and Changpeng Zhao. The value of Bitcoin is something leaders in the global tech community agree on, like the internet or open source.

Estimates vary, but if and when Bitcoin hits $200,000 per BTC, my colleague Olaf Carson-Wee at Polychain Capital estimated that roughly 25-50% of the world's billionaires will come from cryptocurrency.

As such, if India bans cryptocurrency, it doesn't just criminalize the holdings of countless innocent Indians. It repels a trillion dollars in crypto capital from coming to India in the first place. The proposed crypto ban would itself cause capital flight.

And capitalist flight. Lest we forget, Indian entrepreneurs are highly mobile. Major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are already worth many billions of dollars; so are cryptocurrency mining companies and new digital currencies like Ethereum. All the Indian analogs to those services would happen overseas, as Indian founders are once again forced to move abroad.

Conversely, the right crypto policy would cause not capital flight, but capital landing. Visualize billions of dollars in cryptocurrency landing in India. And note that far-sighted technology capitals and financial centers like Switzerland and Singapore have taken positions that are highly favorable to cryptocurrency, because they want the world's top entrepreneurs and investors to alight in their country.

**4. Remittances &amp; Remote: Crypto enables the remote economy**

While thinking about crypto's impact on Indian capital flows, consider the following facts:

* 1.More than 400M Indians have recently come online thanks to Reliance Jio.
* 2. COVID means many more jobs can now be done over an internet connection.
* 3. India is already a world leader in business process outsourcing, earning \~$150B+ per year.
* 4. India is also the world's top recipient of remittances, receiving about $80B annually.
* 5. Cryptocurrencies work across borders, at the speed of the internet, and are globally popular with tens of millions of users worldwide. Here are some stats from 2019, before the current boom.

If you put those facts together, India is poised for an absolutely massive boom in remote work and remittances, with crypto serving as the conduit for large flows of money into the country to pay Indians for performing remote work.

Now, as a believer in global free trade, I think this will benefit both sides of the arrangement. But even a mercantilist would find it difficult to argue that a crypto-catalyzed surge in remote work and remittances is not at least in India's national interest.

**5. Strengthened Monetary Policy: A digital rupee backed by digital gold**

Another issue sometimes raised is that decentralized cryptocurrencies may hamper the Indian government's monetary policy. Yet the smart use of Bitcoin will actually strengthen India's monetary policy.

Begin by noting that monetary policy doesn't happen in a vacuum. Why does the Reserve Bank of India hold 600+ tons of physical gold? Because in an economic crisis, the rupee may need to be gold-backed. Well, by analogy, a digital rupee may need to be digital gold-backed.

Central banks in their own words on why they hold gold reserves: here. Table from here.

In more detail, every national currency trades against every other currency in a global foreign exchange market. Excessive money printing can devalue a currency. And this is part of the reason why central banks around the world say they continue to hold gold: because it's a hedge against inflation, highly liquid, a safe haven in a crisis, and internationally accepted.

That's why India holds 600+ tons of gold, worth tens of billions of dollars. And if it issues a digital rupee, it's going to want to acquire digital gold. Because the digital transformation of the economy won't just stop halfway. Digitization of national currencies will be accompanied by digitization of precious metal reserve equivalents.

That means the single highest value thing the RBI and the government could do for India today is not to ban Bitcoin, but to buy Bitcoin. Even a $3B purchase of BTC might appreciate to be on par with India's gold reserves given another 10X appreciation in the Bitcoin price. If RBI makes the right decision on Bitcoin in 2021, it could save India many billions of dollars by 2025. This is true even if the RBI doesn't want to peg the digital rupee to digital gold right away, but to simply hold BTC as a strategic reserve.

Remember also that India has had a multi-millennia long love affair with gold, and is the world's largest importer of gold. Gold was never a threat to India; gold has always been an asset for India. And Bitcoin is valuable for all the same reasons gold is valuable. It’s an internationally accepted store of value, it's highly scarce, and it's a so-called bearer instrument that can't be seized with a keypress. Like gold, it even has industrial utility; for example you can store files undeletably on a blockchain, or use it to prove the existence of a digital file for the purposes of establishing priority. But most importantly, like gold, Bitcoin will soon be the asset that sovereigns use to back or supplement their national digital currencies.

In short: digital gold is not a threat to India, digital gold is an asset for India, just like gold itself. And digital gold will be a crucial component of India's digital monetary policy.

**6. Deterring Financial Fraud: Crypto means mathematically provable accounting**

Deloitte thinks blockchain is a game-changer for accounting as it enables triple-entry bookkeeping.

Here’s a little known fact: the big four accounting firms (PwC, EY, KPMG, and Deloitte) now use Bitcoin and Ethereum as a gold standard of truth when auditing firms that engage in cryptocurrency transactions. See for example PwC's Halo, which ""interrogates the blockchain to independently and reliably gather corroborating information about blockchain transactions and balances.""

That corroborating information is trustworthy because blockchains, by their nature, use cryptography to create an immutable global record of who paid what money when to whom. So even if a company has a bug in its internal database of Bitcoin transactions, it can reconcile that payment by reference to the entry recorded on the blockchain!

Deloitte and others have called this triple-entry-bookkeeping, a ""game-changer"" for accounting, a way to ""vastly automate accounting processes in compliance with regulatory requirements."" It's perhaps the most important innovation in accounting since the invention of double-entry bookkeeping…which historians believe led to a little thing like the modern financial system!

The key concept is that on-chain accounting doesn't just make it easy to perform audits, it makes it easy to automate them. There are technologies like proof-of-reserve, for example, that allow firms to continuously certify that they have the needed cash on hand. This would prevent scenarios like the allegations in the Vijay Mallya episode, where false evidence of reserves was allegedly presented to gain access to loans. A blockchain-based loan platform (like MakerDao) would never get fooled by such a trick, because it requires cryptographically provable on-chain collateral.

If this sounds fancy, don't worry. The internet did too, once upon a time. The main takehome point is that blockchains reduce the burden on regulators by allowing them to write programs that certify that financial actors are continuously in compliance with regulations.

Blockchains also allow regulators to replay transactions for so-called market surveillance, to delegate some enforcement to smart contracts, and to even permit on-chain issuance and custody of stock certificates to enable real-time settlement. And as India contemplates permitting technology companies to enter banking, blockchain-based accounting can empower regulators to monitor their activities and conduct risk management.

By combining IndiaStack and the digital rupee, India could leapfrog the world by mandating on-chain accounting, payment, and stock issuance for all firms by 2030. Putting all financial flows on-chain would reduce corruption, increase trust in the financial system, and attract more foreign direct investment because international investors could be confident in the accounting.

In short, you can think of this as a regulatory flip. Just like the United States government initially sought to ban encryption in the 1990s, and then turned around to mandate it, so too could smart Indian regulators recognize that blockchains can actually prevent financial crime and increase trust in the system through mathematical, cryptographic proofs of compliance.

**7. Technological Development: Crypto is the financial internet**

Crypto is creating a financial internet. This CBInsights map is just a subset of what's happening.

As Marc Andreessen (creator of the graphical web browser) noted in 2014, the invention of the Bitcoin blockchain is comparable to the advent of the internet itself. Because if the internet was about sending information, blockchains are about transferring value. Specifically, until blockchains, we didn't have a digitally native representation of scarcity. Yes, you could copy data from one user to another through the internet, but you couldn't prove that the original user no longer had access to that data.

Blockchains solve this problem. The details are technical, but the end result is that you can now provably transfer assets between people over the internet, rather than simply copying data from computer to computer. And this works for virtually any asset. Just like the internet digitized books, movies, newspapers, and music, blockchains enable a financial internet that is digitizing currencies, commodities, stocks, bonds, real estate, and every imaginable variety of financial instrument.

A crypto ban would prevent all of that innovation from happening in India. It would cut India off from this financial internet, just as it's hit a trillion dollars in value. It is like banning the internet in the year 2000 or smartphones in 2010.

Just to underscore this point, decentralized finance is a rapidly growing alternative to Wall Street, and Indians would be locked out of the next stock market. Decentralized crowdfunding is a way to raise funding without access to American VCs, and Indian entrepreneurs would be prevented from using it. Bitcoin is displacing gold as a hedge against dollar inflation, and Indian investors would be prevented from adding it to their portfolios.

And these are just the applications that are already at scale! Waiting in the wings are concepts like:

User-generated capital. Right now users on social networks don't get paid for the content they generate. But new crypto-based tools allow creators to make money, not just social media corporations.

Decentralized data feeds. Today people pay for feeds of price data from companies like Bloomberg and Reuters. Chainlink and other crypto oracles have developed tools to put this kind of data – among others – on blockchains so it's freely visible to the world and accessible to any application.

User-controlled identity. Ethereum has been used to build an alternative to Facebook Login and Google Login called the Ethereum Name Service, which allows users to control their identity rather than Facebook and Google.

Decentralized stock markets. Engineers have figured out how to put stock prices, stock certificates, and capitalization tables on blockchains, which allow any country to build their own Wall Street.

User-controlled notifications. Two companies control push notifications to billions of smartphones: Apple and Google. But developers are building decentralized notification systems that are outside of American corporate control.

Decentralized social networks. Twitter and Facebook can deplatform anyone at any time, but blockchain developers are working on platforms controlled by users and communities instead of US companies.

You don't need to understand all these things to understand this: crypto is rapidly decentralizing power away from American corporations, and India has the talent to take advantage of this opportunity. But if Indians can’t even buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, let alone develop new smart contracts and crypto protocols, India will not be internationally competitive in the next generation of technology.

On the other hand, if India embraces and fully legalizes cryptocurrency, Indian entrepreneurs can build global protocols – not just companies – to fill the role that American technology companies are now abdicating to the world's surprise and dismay. The financial return from launching these protocols would come back to India to enrich the country, and the international usage of these protocols would strengthen India's reputation on the world stage.

**8. Digital Independence: Crypto is the open source alternative to foreign corporations**

The Indian government already encourages the use of open source over proprietary code when available:

The Government of India shall endeavour to adopt Open Source Software in all e-Governance systems implemented by various Government organizations, as a preferred option in comparison to Closed Source Software.

The government should prefer crypto APIs over corporate APIs for the same reason, because blockchains aren't just open source, they're also open state and open execution. That means:

Open source. Every user can view a blockchain's source code.

Open state. Every user has root access to the entire blockchain database.

Open execution. Every user can replay every action executed by a blockchain.

This is very different from a centralized service like Twitter. Twitter is closed state, so you can't download every tweet. It's also closed execution, so you can't look at Twitter's server to see what it's doing in realtime. This means Twitter can ban you from viewing its tweets, or downrank your tweets silently so that you don't know if people are seeing them.

Blockchains can fix this. Indeed, they've already fixed it by providing open source alternatives to many financial services. You can use Bitcoin instead of SWIFT, stablecoins instead of PayPal, crypto crowdfunding instead of Kickstarter, and much more.

[Defipulse.com](https://defipulse.com/) has a great list of all the ongoing open source finance action, but the point is simple: India should prefer crypto APIs as the open source alternative to corporate APIs whenever possible, just as it prefers the open source equivalent in other areas.

**9. Foreign Policy: India Should Back Neutral Crypto Platforms**

India is the #3 power in the world. It is not America, and it is not China. It should play a different game.

Right now, the US and China are on a financial collision course. The US wants all countries to accept the dollar, while China may push its digital yuan through the Belt and Road. Europe wants to stay out of this developing Cold War, but there isn't an obvious alternative yet.

The Decentralized Movement

India can reposition the non-aligned movement as a decentralized movement that advocates crypto protocols as a successor to the rules-based international order, beginning with its own financial system: a digital rupee backed by digital gold.

As noted in the Diplomat, India has already started to recognize that a renewed non-aligned movement will play a balancing role in the coming US-vs-China Cold War. And cryptocurrencies give an intellectual framework to economically align the otherwise disparate nations of this movement.

Unlike America and China, which will try pressuring nations to accept the dollar or digital yuan respectively, India can recognize that each country will ultimately want to use its own national currency domestically and a neutral platform internationally. Bitcoin and crypto protocols provide that neutral platform, a demilitarized zone suitable for international trade and communication, similar to the role that gold played in the past and that the Law of the Sea plays today.

Put another way, every nation not named America or China has the following preference ranking when it comes to the financial system.

Our country should be in charge (domestic national digital currency)

No one should be in charge (international cryptocurrency)

Others should be in charge, like the US or China (dollar or digital yuan)

This is true for India as well. Unlike the dollar or yuan, the digital rupee is not a candidate to become the reserve currency of the world. Thus, while India can be in charge of the digital rupee domestically, internationally it would prefer that no one be in charge – least of all the increasingly unpredictable US or China. And that equates to a preference for the use of cryptocurrency in international finance. Indeed, every sovereign that isn't the US or China will likely eventually align behind crypto for international trade because it's an acceptable second choice, a platform where you can't be deplatformed.

Digital Internationalism

This is a creative way of thinking about Indian foreign policy. India would still broadly line up with the West rather than China, but it would stand for the values of the West: free speech, free markets, and international law – all principles that the US has hastily abandoned and that China is in no hurry to pick up.

We should also remember that India is not a member of the UN Security Council. India is not a root user of the SWIFT system. India doesn't have Wall Street or Harvard or Silicon Valley or the New York Times. India really isn't that invested in the current system. But unlike the US, which has turned against the rules-based international order, and unlike China, which makes no bones about pursuing its national interest, India could adopt crypto to build new, provably fair digital institutions for billions around the world – a new Wall Street, a new SWIFT, a new Bretton Woods – just as it built IndiaStack for a billion Indians.

This would be digital internationalism, the pursuit of enlightened self-interest through international decentralized platforms. And it would play to India's strengths: software, finance, remittances, and above all the flexible and adaptable nature of the international Indian.

China could never make this leap, because China thinks about everything in terms of the narrow national self-interest of the Chinese people. That may be fine for them, but it is a turnoff to everyone who is not Chinese.

America likely can't make this leap either, at least not right now, because the East Coast establishment now loses in a world of truly free speech and free markets. Wall Street loses to random Reddit users without a thumb on the scale, and legacy media is outcompeted by social media in the absence of censorship. That's why the US establishment has soured on the values it once championed.

But India benefits from a game of free speech and free markets. The millions of Indians who emigrated to the US, UK, Canada, and Australia over the last 50 years did quite well in that game. With 400 million Indians newly online, in a newly remote world, India is poised to become even more formidable as a global exporter of software, finance, and media talent. Neutral crypto platforms will allow India to export these digital goods into every country, while simultaneously being provably fair to all parties. This is the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Unlike the US or China, India wouldn't just be playing to win, it'd be playing to win/win.

**10. India should buy Bitcoin, build a stockchain, attract crypto, and encourage decentralization**

To summarize, India is on the verge of banning a trillion dollar industry instead of using it to strengthen its national security, economy, currency, technology, and foreign policy.

But India's crypto ban has been reversed once before, and it's possible to envision a bold move here. Under Prime Minister Modi, the country shipped IndiaStack, ascended to #3 on the tech unicorn list, and leapfrogged the world in mobile data with Reliance Jio.

The next step is to demonstrate global leadership. As the world's third largest economy in PPP terms, India could lead a decentralized movement to develop provably fair crypto platforms, neutral international systems outside both American and Chinese control that all countries can embrace.

To get the ball rolling, Prime Minister Modi should:

* Create a digital rupee backed by digital gold. Shelve the proposed crypto ban and instead buy Bitcoin to back a digital rupee, making it the first national digital currency backed by digital gold. Even if the RBI doesn't want to peg the digital rupee to digital gold right away, it'll be useful to have BTC reserves as a backstop in a few years time.
* Add crypto to IndiaStack. Update IndiaStack to add on-chain accounting and a ""stockchain"", with the goal of putting the country's financial system – currency, payments, accounting, stocks, and more – entirely on-chain by 2030. With cryptographically provable financial statements, trust in Indian companies would rise and foreign investment would flow into the country.
* Attract crypto capital. Using the legislation passed in jurisdictions like Singapore, Switzerland, Wyoming, and Dubai as inspiration, create a crypto-favorable regulatory regime to attract tens of billions in capital to India.
* Encourage development of decentralized protocols. Encourage Indian entrepreneurs to build not just global companies, but global cryptoprotocols like Ethereum that can be trusted by any country expressly because they don't require trust.
* Help other nations with crypto. Recommend that India build its digital rupee and stockchain with an eye to exporting the designs to the rest of the world, either as services that others can use directly to work with the Indian economy or as blueprints they can fork to build their own versions.

India has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world's technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry.

The first step is simple: India should buy Bitcoin, not ban it.

It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” 
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. Binance Coin (BNB): coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another actual stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR):** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the company behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.

43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming."

DeFi Pulse, in partnership with the digital asset modeling platform Gauntlet, has announced a rating system. 

It takes into account:

* user behavior
* collateral volatility
* protocol parameters
* the riskiness of the smart contract

## Points for projects

\+90 - a very reliable project, the chances of losses for those who deposit funds are extremely small. At the same time, this also means that the effectiveness of such investments (APY, etc.) will not necessarily be maximum. Low-risk investments are usually less profitable.

80-90 - safe, the chances of loss are quite small.

65-80 - there is a small chance of losing the deposit in extreme market conditions.

50-65 - there is a high chance of deposit losses in extreme market conditions.

less than 50 - a significant chance of losing the deposit in normal market conditions.

Aave and Compound have already been reviewed, the results being 95 and 91 respectively. MakerDAO is next to be reviewed.

They also clarify that these estimates are formed precisely from historical liquidity and volatility.

Gauntlet is currently evaluating the lending protocols. In essence, the company is auditing the project. They do not invest in it directly but build a model based on the smart contract.

To take into account the behavior of the price of coins in this model, a model is built based on the order books of various exchanges. By simulating thousands of price trajectories, Gauntlet can assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting and as a consequence, the risk in the protocol.

They also analyze the most risky collateral which is historical liquidity and volatility data, so as to determine the type of collateral that could cause problems.

Now this is only an ALPHA version, which means that not all risks are covered. The danger of low liquidity within the protocol is omitted, as well as:

* network overload and gas (at the moment gas is taken into account only conditionally)
* loans with multiple assets
* portfolio stress testing (as in traditional finance)
* protocol reserves (management could use it for payments)

I highly appreciate you reading the article till the end!

As it's a PoW you need to think in Bitcoin terms rather than Cardano. I've been shouting about this since 50c, don't wait til it 5x's again.


* Ergo will bring all the advantages of Proof of Work to users of the Cardano ecosystem.
* Ergo is the first blockchain to adopt smart contract language similar to the UTxO model Cardano uses, bringing compatibility with Proof of Work to a whole new level.
* Long-term scalability of dApps with the ability of parallelization of dApps.
* More advanced cryptography with sigma protocols — highly flexible and composable cryptographic signatures.
* The Ergo headless dApps framework.
* Oracle pools — layered pools of pools of oracles with deviation checking consensus opening a whole new world of applications.
* Local Exchange Trading System on top of Ergo.

**ErgoSwap**


ETA: Q3 2021 ErgoDex support added in yoroi wallet

&gt;ErgoSwap is a Uniswap-like AMM-based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). DEXs are a type of cryptocurrency exchange which allows for direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions, reducing the need for centralised exchanges.
&gt;
&gt;In ErgoSwap anyone can discover the match for orders and then submit the swap transaction and get incentive including offchain services, it shows more or less approach of Ergo and concepts of earning without mining rig with Ergo dapps while promoting decentralization and privacy at the same time
&gt;
&gt;Atomic exchange for tokens on top of Ergo is implemented in the core, so yes, everything will be DEX and there will be lots of DEXes, matchers also possible

**ErgoAuction**

I look forward to when I can do the same thing on cardano. Would something like that need to be coded specifically, or can dapps like makerdao just use cardano’s ethereum importer/converter and hit the ground running?

I was curious if this is something we might see by the end of this month, or if it’s more realistic to not expect it for six months.

From the bottom link I was intrigued to see, if the revenue generated from Dai issuance was somewhat correlated to the MKR price since it is the source of the buy n' burn.  


According to the related pic, which is a screenshot from Makerburn. Then the two increases in Dai supply and MKR/USD seem to correlate. If that tells us that the marked believe that: 2b dai make MKR approx 2500USD worth and the two lines continue to correlate, then I believe we have a bright future ahead of us.

Note that it ""only"" took around 3 months to issue 1 billion additional Dai (from 1 til 2). And we have generated 7% of the next billion in just four days.

Please dear nord gods, if 4 billion dai is 5k MKR, then I am gonna be the happiest camper.

"EIP-1559 Expected Benefits, Possible Challenges, Misconceptions",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lnp44d/eip1559_expected_benefits_possible_challenges/,trent_vanepps,1,2021-02-20 04:04:17,41,/r/ethfinance/comments/lnp44d/eip1559_expected_benefits_possible_challenges/,Strategy,"Hey all. I wrote this summary of 1559 recently for a [Maker Signal Request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-does-makerdao-support-eip-1559/6646) but thought more people might get value out of it.   


“A transaction pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion” ([Source 1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md))  


**Expected Benefits**

* More predictable gas fees, reducing user overpayment
   * “Shopping on Amazon is a lot easier than buying a house in a competitive real estate market. On Amazon, there’s no need to be strategic or second-guess yourself; you’re either willing to pay the listed price for the listed product, or you’re not” ([Section 4.2](http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf))
   * This will lead to better UX for users and applications
* Preventative maintenance to avoid possible future chain reorgs
   * In conditions where fees significantly outweigh block rewards, there is an ever present incentive for block producers to carry out short term reorgs to capture as much value as possible. Burning the BASE\_FEE removes this latent incentive.
   * Read more here: [On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf)
* Cements the role of ETH within the Ethereum crypto-economic system
   * Burning the BASE\_FEE adds a real and consistent cost to economic abstraction (paying for transactions out-of-band, or “off-chain”, in non-ETH assets)
* Will allow in-protocol congestion oracle
   * Once EIP-1559 is live, it will enable a native congestion oracle via [EIP 3198 2](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3198.md) \- A useful tool for applications

**Possible Downsides**

* Technical complexity
   * Reforming the fee market for a live, value bearing chain like Ethereum is no small task. All client level issues aimed to de-risk it are [tracked here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Fee%20Market%20Meetings/mainnet-readiness.md).
* Miners are largely opposed to it, and are threatening to make the upgrade contentious
   * The BASE\_FEE burn, an integral part of the system, has led to miner opposition because it will reduce their income.

**Misconceptions**

* Lowering individual transaction fees
   * Transaction fees are a function of supply and demand, and this EIP does not attempt to increase average available blockspace or alternatively, reduce demand.
* BASE\_FEE burning is meant to punish miners
   * Burning the BASE\_FEE is the simplest mechanism to ensure the elastic blocksize is not gamed by miners. If not burnt, then miners could costlessly increase the blocksize while extracting maximum BASE\_FEEs from users, and recoup their sent losses.
* Increasing ETH price
   * While sometimes mentioned by proponents of this EIP, this is not a stated goal for any of the constituent mechanisms.  


Tim Beiko also [wrote a great explanation of the BASE\_FEE mechanism](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-does-makerdao-support-eip-1559/6646/29?u=tvanepps) and how it adjusts, so I will link it here.  


&gt;The increase of the base fee is linear across -12.5%/+12.5% the previous block’s base fee depending on the gas utilisation of the block (between 0% and 200%, the max allowed post-1559).  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If blocks are 0% full, the base fee goes down 12.5% compared to the previous block’s base fee;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If blocks are 100% full (i.e. gas used == target gas limit), the base fee stays the same;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If blocks are 200% full (the max allowed post-1559), the base fee rises 12.5% compared to the previous block’s base fee.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a 12.5% increase/decrease &amp; \~15 second block times, it takes roughly 5 minutes for the base fee to rise/lower 10x, 10 mins for 100x, etc."

Sentinel Network is a true p2p and decentralized VPN network.  What makes Sentinel different is that unlike other dVPNs, such as Orchid (OXT), Sentinel decentralizes both the back-end (by letting anyone host a node) and the front-end (by letting anyone build on top of the open sourced protocol). This allows existing centralized VPNs to switch to sentinel to reduce their costs for hardware hosting and liability to legal claims. It also allows any individual to build their own dVPN app on top of the network, one example being the Velocity App which is an App built on Sentinel with 50k downloads for Android. Currently the token has a diluted marketcap of 26M or $.013 per token.

Since Sentinel will be a income producing protocol we can use traditional market metrics, such as P/S ratio to determine a valuation for the SENT token. The SENT token can be staked to secure the network (similar to ATOM) which will receive block rewards as well as 20% of the income from dVPN nodes. Looking at other income producing dApps we can get a market average:

Sentinel recently announced the first traditional VPN company with over 5,000 paying users that will be transitioning to the Sentinel network. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lis7m4/pretty\_big\_ann\_today\_by\_pa\_that\_no\_one\_is\_talking/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lis7m4/pretty_big_ann_today_by_pa_that_no_one_is_talking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))

Sentinel's own dVPN app has over 100k downloads (android only) + Velocity has over 50k downloads as of December. Currently, both of these apps are free to use prior to Sentinel's mainnet. If we assume that 25% of these users convert to paying users then this would be another 37,500 users.

The average user spends $4.45/month on their VPN service. ([https://www.technipages.com/how-much-does-the-average-vpn-cost](https://www.technipages.com/how-much-does-the-average-vpn-cost))

Using this information we can estimate the Annual Revenue generated on the Sentinel Network based on current users and the announced company that is transitioning:

&amp;#x200B;

|App|Users|Monthly Revenue (Users \*$4.45)|Annual Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sentinel|25,000|$111,250|$1,335,000|
|Velocity|12,500|$55,625|$667,500|
|Transitioning VPN company|5,000|$22,250|$267,000|
|**Total**|**42,500**|**$189,125**|**$2,269,500​**|

&amp;#x200B;

Using the market average P/S of 188.61 this would value Sentinel at a marketcap of  $428,050,395.00 or $0.21 per token.

|Annual Revenue|Industry P/S|Marketcap|Price per token|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2,269,500|188.61|$428,050,395.00|$0.21​|

To get to $.30 per token there would need to be an additional 17,000 paying users on the Sentinel network:

|App|Users|Monthly Revenue (Users \*$4.45)|Annual Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sentinel|25,000|$111,250|$1,335,000|
|Velocity|12,500|$55,625|$667,500|

&amp;#x200B;

These are the catalysts that I think will generate user growth in the coming months:

1.) iOS app - The team has confirmed that the iOS app is days away from being launched. This alone I think could bring in the needed 17,000 users between the Sentinel iOS app and any 3rd party (velocity?) that could build their own iOS app on Sentinel. 

2.) Improved desktop application - The current desktop version is admittingly clunky and not user friendly. The new v3 client being built on Cosmos will have improved UI and functionality making which should increase user adoption and retention. Sentinel is the only dVPN with a windows and linux desktop application. 

3.) Marketing - the team has confirmed that marketing will begin with the launch of the iOS app. To date there has been no marketing spend and all users are from word of mouth and community efforts to promote Sentinel. [https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lma59i/were\_just\_getting\_started/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lma59i/were_just_getting_started/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

To summarize, using the current market P/S for revenue generating cyrpto protocols and based on the current/anticipated users we can forecast a token price of $0.30 per token on Sentinel mainnet launch. This would be a 30x from current levels."

No other crypto price source matches the one on MakerDAO.  This is especially troubling because that's the figure they are using the determine the liquidation threshold.

I don't know if it's the right place, but I have a small issues with the MakerDAO app: After been liquidated, I am trying to claim the remaining collateral. Unfortunately, after signing it successfully, the TX is never broadcast to the network, your app gives the error ""Claiming collateral failed"". I can click on a link to the etherscan TXID which doesn't exist, indicating that the tx is never properly broadcast or rejected every time.

My collateral is 3.849 AAVE if that helps

ETH Progress since Genesis.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lrg8wy/eth_progress_since_genesis/,Smithgift,284,2021-02-25 00:03:00,58,/r/ethfinance/comments/lrg8wy/eth_progress_since_genesis/,Strategy,"(crossposting from the daily.) 

Ethereum has come a long way in just a few years. I can tell you that--I ran an Ethereum node at Genesis.

All the way back in Frontier days...

* Transactions didn't exist, at least for the earliest few days. The chain was deliberately started with a gasLimit too low to actually do anything. Over time, there was a race to make the first transactions, then the first contracts...
* GUI Wallets did not exist. You had to use the JS console, and you had to be careful, because an early bug would send your ETH into nothingness if you left off the to field. After that, you still had to be careful because...
* ENS did not exist. But we thought it would be soon, so we didn't have address checksums, either. I don't think we even had the funky circle things.
* Block explorers barely existed. It's been a while, but I remember etherscan starting pretty early. But none of this verified contracts or token pages.
* Stablecoins did not exist. MakerDAO was just a twinkling in Rune's eye. There was a contract that hosted a list of the top ten movies, which could be altered by burning ETH. I suspect that list is now final. But of course stablecoins did not exist, because...
* ERC20 tokens did not exist. There was no standard on the chain, and everyone did what was right in his own eyes. If you're interested in history, you can check out the original issue and see a lengthy discussion on transferFrom vs. cheques. I was on Team Cheque, but in retrospect transferFrom was clearly right. In either case, it wasn't for years before there was a standard ERC20 template code.
* DeFi did not exist at all, unless you count the DAO.
* But maybe this was no surprise, because developing was a pain in the donkey. There were three languages available: Solidity, Serpent, and LLL. They all sucked in their own ways.
* Solidity was primitive--some time before Genesis I personally had discovered that the continue statement was bugged. There was no revert(), only throw (which did the same thing, but burned all gas). Constructors were named by naming a function the same way as the contract that held it. I'm not sure when SafeMath was a thing. Libraries were primitive; none of this using statements thing.
* Serpent was like Vyper, except really bad. I never used it, but Augur did. They commissioned an audit of the compiler, and the report was so bad they rewrote it all in solidity.
* No one used LLL.
* Toolchains did not exist. I remember manually linking contracts in JS.
* IDE support did not exist. There was mix, a buggy custom IDE which was notable because you could use it to simulate a blockchain. This was great, because...
* ganache did not exist. I remember starting a node on another computer to develop on, because...
* PoA chains didn't exist, either. That other node was PoW mining on its own chain.
* Neither ethers.js or web3.js 1.0 existed. Earlier versions of web3.js were callback based, or in certain horrifying cases synchronous. There were other issues.
* But let's say you got a functioning dapp. How did you get it to people? It was assumed that swarm would be functional at this point, but as it wasn't, you just had to somehow get the package to someone manually. (I'm not sure if this host-a-dapp-on-a-domain is the best solution here, but it is *a* solution.)
* Of course, neither metamask nor infura existed. You had to run your own node.
* At Genesis there was only geth, cpp-ethereum, and the python one, whose name escapes me. Parity/OpenEthereum came later. At one point there was a Java node. They were all pretty barebones--no fast sync, and definitely no warp sync. Don't even think about a light client.
* The EVM had issues. No CREATE2. DELEGATECALL didn't exist, but a broken version of it did that is now completely forgotten about. There were a lot more, although those are the biggest two.
* BONUS THING I REMEMBERED: Recovery phrases either did not exist, or were almost unused. You had a .json with your encrypted private key, and that was it.
* I will say one thing that existed back then and not now is innocence. Prior to the DAO hack, everything was perfect and amazing and nothing could go wrong. Now, millions stolen from a DeFi project going up in flames is not even noteworthy.
* And, of course, ETH was less than $1.

I think we can safely say the fundamentals have improved."

Now **I'm looking for guidance in regards to  US tax implications when using Defi to gain leverage or short a cryptocurrency**. 

I'm under the impression that, for example, if I'm bullish on ETH I can deposit ETH into a MakerDAO Vault  (or a similar defi smart-contract) and receive a loan in the form of a stablecoin, and there's no capital gains tax (CGT) applied to that transaction since it's a loan. I can then use that Dai to buy more ETH (CGT cost basis) and then once I sell that ETH it would register as a CGT event, at either a loss or gain. Please correct me if any of that is incorrect.

What I'm confused about is if you were to use defi to short a crypto. So, for example, I'd deposit a stablecoin into a MakerDAO Vault  (or a similar defi smart-contract) and receive ETH, which shouldn't be taxable since it's a loan. Then I sell that ETH for a stablecoin, hoping the price of ETH drops, so I can later buy back the same amount of ETH + interest to return to the smart-contract and have some stablecoin left over. **My question is what is the tax implication on those transactions?** I would imagine the IRS would think it's a taxable event when I sell the ETH I was loaned, but it's new ETH that I never bought so how does the cost basis of that sale get calculated? Then I buy back ETH at a later date, which I'd imagine the IRS would register as my cost basis for ETH, but then I return it to the smart-contract. It seems to me like the taxable event happens in reverse in this scenario (sell ETH I was loaned, then buy ETH to pay back the loan), so that's where my confusion comes from.

Pokazalo se da je **Fantom** veoma centralizovana mreža

Velika koncentracija glasačke moći u dva najveća validatora je izazvala probleme u radu ove stejking mreže.

Jedan  od ta dva validatora je juče zabagovao pa bio offline pa su se zbog  toga blokovi usporili oko 15h a oko 18h su totalno prestali da se  proizvode. Preko 5 sati nije bilo novih blokova.

Ova dva validatora imaju više od 1/3 glasačke moći cele mreže, jer su dosta popularni medju $FTM delegatorima.

Fantom fondacija je kontaktirala kritičnog validatora kako bi opet pokrenuli mreźu.

U  većini PoS sistema kao što je Fantom, entitet koji kontroliše preko 1/3  stejkovane sume ima moć da spreči mrežu da obradjuje transakcije. A za  reorganizaciju blokova treba 2/3.

Fantom fondacija je iznela predlog za izjednačeniju podelu stejka izmedju validatora.
