OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here‚Äôs how they do that

‚Ä¢ Making high value assets such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, thus lowering the entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

Here‚Äôs how it works:

‚Ä¢ $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 ‚Ä¢ 3 Token Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   ‚Ä¢ 10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) ‚Ä¢ Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They‚Äôve been building in super stealth mode until just recently, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

‚Ä¢ Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

‚Ä¢ Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

‚Ä¢  Recent coverage in The Capital - more press in the coming weeks

‚Ä¢  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

‚Ä¢  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium

‚Ä¢ Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA‚Äôs 3 tiered ecosystem explained:

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATSHow do they differ from their competitors?

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform. Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

The first round of pre sale is about to end!!! Price will go from $1.50 per token to $3.43 in the second round!

‚Ä¢ OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they‚Äôre so transparent!

OMNIA‚ÄôS potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. üóª Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional marketsüó≥ Their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us‚Ä¶ OMNIA does just that!

At times like this it's hard to keep track of the space so here's a run-down of what's happening in Defi.

Total value locked in Defi is currently sitting at an all-time-high of $169B, breaking the previous ATH of $154 set back in May 2021. Since June, Defi added $62M! But this only accounts for 7.5% of all of the money in crypto right now. Here are the major chains to look out for by alphabetic order:

1. **Arbitrum**, a built-in layer 2\* solution for Ethereum, just launched it's public mainnet on August 31, expecting *blue chip* defi dapps like AAVE, Curve, MakerDao, Sushiswap, and Uniswap to integrate soon. One of their partners Huobi, a centralized exchange, also has announced support for direct withdrawals to Arbitrum, which will allow users to circumvent Ethereum's gas fees when moving assets. 
2. **Avalanche** has an ongoing liquidity mining incentive pool worth $180M, seeking to attract users into their network. They recently announced a $15M allocation to Sushiswap and we're still awaiting news on the likes of AAVE and Curve's allocation.
3. **Celo**, a mobile-first defi platform that recently launched, also raised $100M for ""educational initiatives, grants, and incentives,"" with a $34M allocation split between the usual culprits: AAVE, Curve, and Sushiswap. 
4. **Cardano's** *Alonzo Purple* hard for is a public testnet due to launch of September 12, the culmination of more than three years of development. 
5. **Terra Luna's,** a Layer 1 chain known for it's influence on the Korean demographic, *Columbus-5* upgrade will take effect on September 9 and will introduce a similar upgrade to Ethereum's burn mechanism (EIP-1559). For Terra Luna, they will burn all *Seigniorage* or the cost to produce their native token, LUNA, effectively making it a deflationary token.
6. **Optimism,** another built-in Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, recently added a bridge for all ERC-20 tokens, which removes the added step of swapping for users who want to bridge from Ethereum to Optimism. Optimism is one of few chains that was able to pull Uniswap, which is still the king of DEXes, trading $1.5B a day; almost three-time more than it's closest competitor PancakeSwap.
7. **Solana**, one of the fastest Layer 1 chains, just launched *Igntion*, a hackathon with up to $5M in prizes, for developers to add to their budding ecosystem and build more defi, NFTs, and gaming applications. 
8. **Fantom,** a highly scalable Layer 1 launched in 2019, recently announced a $370M incentive program for developers to build on their network. Fantom's TVL is up 48% in the past week, the highest among the networks aged +3 months. 

That's a total of nine networks with major updates over the past month either through incentive programs, which will benefit developers and/or defi users, or mainnet launches. And that's only the *recent* news.

Other chains like Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon are still trodding on and building more and more partnerships along with sleeping giants like Harmony, Tezos, and xDai. And Polkadot isn't even here yet. We're also seeing Dapps integrating on different networks. Sushiswap, for example, is currently building on eight different chains! Ridiculous progress! I'm sure a the chart above will experience some major changes in next few months.

*Which chains do you think will come out on the top of the mountain? Which networks have you had your best experience one? And distributed do you think the defi sector will be?*"

Please help me find the flaws in my plan:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Deposit 10 ETH in [OAsis.app](https://OAsis.app)

2) Borrow at today's rate 10k DAI

3) Exchange 10k DAI for 10k USD

4) Do whatever I want with those USD.

From what I gather ([https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/](https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/)) I should not pay taxes at all since technically I have not made any gains.

I never intend to pay the loan. Three scenarios:

1) ETH goes up: I take out more DAI and repeat steps above. Still not taxable right?

2) ETH goes down: MakerDao liquidates part of my ETH to pay back my debt, I should pay taxes, but normally I won't since ETH's value is lower than when I bought it

3) My debt catches up with the minimum collateral %: MakerDAO liquidates. If ETH went down, no taxes. If ETH went up, I do have to pay taxes, but ETH had gone up so I can probably afford it without sweating it.

This seems to me like a win/win/win scenario. What am I missing?

Thanks!"

The Maker Foundation was tasked with bootstrapping protocol responsibilities to the community-run DAO and has done so extremely successfully. Following this success, the Maker Foundation will be dissolved over the course of a few months meaning the Maker protocol will be fully decentralized. [Source](https://blog.makerdao.com/makerdao-has-come-full-circle/)
* An [executive proposal](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-momc-proposal-august-core-unit-budgets-housekeeping-august-6-2021?network=mainnet#proposal-detail) was executed on Aug 24th that detailed budget allocations to the MakerDAO Core Units with a total of \~$2.9 million DAI being distributed. This proposal also implemented the [MOMC parameter changes](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmVG38FK?network=mainnet#poll-detail), Increases to the ‚Äú[UNIV2DAIUSDC-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRAuMND?network=mainnet#poll-detail)‚Äù max debt ceiling, and some general [protocol housekeeping](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/protocol-engineering-housekeeping-tasks-6th-august-2021/9712).
* There is an active [executive proposal](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-parameter-changes-september-core-unit-budgets-dssvest-streams-september-3-2021?network=mainnet#proposal-detail) that MKR holders can vote on. The proposal implements changes to the ‚Äú[Flash Mint Fee](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmPvcF8K?network=mainnet#poll-detail)‚Äù by decreasing the fee from 0.05% to 0%. The ‚Äú[PSM-PAX-A](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmdBrVKD?network=mainnet#poll-detail)‚Äù debt ceiling will be increased from $50 million DAI to $500 million DAI. Included in the proposal is [MIP-54](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmPfjETk?network=mainnet#poll-detail) which will introduce the ‚ÄúDssVest‚Äù module that automates token vesting. Other changes include the distribution of DAI to various operational wallets.

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

&gt;Check the previous newsletter if you want more clarity.

1. Mechanisms
2. Peg
3. Collateral Amount
4. Collateral Type

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO‚Äôs ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced. **TLDR:**MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future."

2. You deposit that asset into a vault.
3. Based on the amount of value in the vault you can mint some $DAI out and then can use it in some other system.

The only thing that you have to be careful about is the minimum collateralisation ratio. If I have $150 worth of $ETH and I put it in my vault then I can take out a maximum of 100 $DAI from this vault and spend it somewhere else. My $150 worth of $ETH sits in the vault. I cannot touch it until I repay the amount that I borrowed, which is 100 $DAI.

## What happens when your $ETH falls in value?

I put $150 worth of $ETH in the vault but if the value falls to $100 then my collateralisation ratio is 100% which is less than the ideal amount of 150%. Now I will have to either repay the loan (instead of borrowing 100 $DAI I must repay 33 $DAI) or I will have to add $50 worth of $ETH into the collateral so that the minimum collateralisation ratio or the *c-ratio* is balanced. **TLDR:**MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future."

# General Conclusion

MakerDAO is one of the core project on DeFi. The foundation of the project is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The two main components are $DAI (stablecoin) and $MKR (governance). The protocol creates $DAI that is backed by $ETH using a vault mechanism.This system is able to regulate and stabilise the price of $DAI stablecoin. This protocol is also the first successful onchain reserve stablecoin.

# Stablecoin Classification

The mechanisms of stablecoins have changed since 2017 and we're going to start classifying stablecoins into four different categories:

# MakerDAO

In MakerDAO‚Äôs ecosystem, $DAI is the stablecoin and uses a dual token and reserve mechanism. It is soft pegged to one dollar and uses over-collateralisation to get that one dollar. It uses different kinds of on-chain crypto assets like $ETH, stablecoins, and non-stablecoins.

## Dual Token Mechanism

In the dual token model, as the name suggests, there are two tokens in the system. The primary token is stablecoin $DAI which is soft pegged to the US dollar. The secondary token is $MKR. The main function of the secondary token is to absorb volatility in the system. Think of $DAI as your output which is stable and has low volatility, but because there will always be volatility within the system or outside of the system. The volatility needs to go somewhere, so it goes to the other token, $MKR.

## Functions of the MKR Token

This is a utility token and functions as a governance token for voting. It can be used to pay off interest accrued in the system, and during insolvency. During crashes or different kinds of liquidation $MKR can be minted and sold for $DAI in the ecosystem. $MKR is a crucial aspect of governing the entire system of $DAI. $DAI is the facilitator that allows people to exchange goods and services. A few months ago MakerDAO moved more of its funds towards the DAO which means that it is no longer mainly controlled by the founders and is now controlled by the community.

## Reserve Mechanism

This means that the stablecoin or the $DAI is backed by reserves and you can use the $DAI to redeem the underlying collateral. You can redeem $DAI for the underlying crypto assets that you deposited to get $DAI initially.

# Creating $DAI: How it Works

You can create $DAI in three simple steps:

1. You have to own the asset.
2. You deposit that asset into a vault.

Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, so it is very likely that the risks we have outlined could largely be mitigated in the future."

# Introduction

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1.¬†On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2.¬†Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase ‚Äî you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3.¬†Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis¬†here.

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin G√ºn Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great¬†research paper.

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the¬†**stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has¬†**one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin¬†**defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021.

 

**TLDR**:

Although, stablecoin is no stranger to many people, it is still developing and improving the existing advantages ‚Äî from creating the first stablecoins to having them automatically adjust to the market. These adaptations are something to be proud of, but is every market phase the same?  
As we can see, the Stablecoin market is a ""play ground"" for projects that fully answer the three questions above. In the future, we will see a variety of complex stablecoins, including many tools that aid in securing the anchor. This is a topic that will be discussed further in the future."

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin G√ºn Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great¬†research paper.

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the¬†**stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.The dual token model has¬†**one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin¬†**defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021. **TLDR**:Although, stablecoin is no stranger to many people, it is still developing and improving the existing advantages ‚Äî from creating the first stablecoins to having them automatically adjust to the market. These adaptations are something to be proud of, but is every market phase the same? As we can see, the Stablecoin market is a ""play ground"" for projects that fully answer the three questions above. In the future, we will see a variety of complex stablecoins, including many tools that aid in securing the anchor. This is a topic that will be discussed further in the future."

# Introduction

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1.¬†On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2.¬†Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase ‚Äî you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3.¬†Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis¬†here.

What is decentralized finance (DeFi)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Owl2102/comments/pliknd/what_is_decentralized_finance_defi/,No-Owl2102,1,2021-09-10 18:43:28,0,/r/u_No-Owl2102/comments/pliknd/what_is_decentralized_finance_defi/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5e5wbgpdnnm71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4787e92065fe60830a39bf34e702b7f5c8241b5

DeFi is a blockchain-based form of finance that uses smart contracts on blockchains, the most common of which is Ethereum, to offer traditional financial instruments rather than relying on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks. People can use DeFi platforms to lend or borrow money from others, trade cryptocurrencies, insure themselves against hazards, and earn income in savings accounts.

# Decentralized finance (DeFi) explained

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is an umbrella word for a multitude of public blockchain applications and projects aimed at challenging the existing finance world. DeFi refers to financial applications built on blockchain technologies, generally employing smart contracts, and is inspired by blockchain technology. Smart contracts are enforceable agreements that are automated and can be accessible by anyone with an internet connection. They do not require any middlemen to execute and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

# Why smart contracts?

Most smart contracts include Turing Complete programming languages, which allow numerous parties to interact without the need for a centralized middleman. The ability of blockchain to take use of smart contracts has made it an attractive platform for developing financial applications.

# How did DeFi get its start?

DeFi, according to some, began in 2009 with the debut of Bitcoin, the first peer-to-peer digital currency built on top of the blockchain network. The idea of introducing transformation into the traditional financial world via blockchains became a necessary next step in the decentralization of legacy financial institutions thanks to Bitcoin. All of this was made possible with the development of Ethereum and, more especially, smart contracts in 2015. The Ethereum network is a second-generation blockchain that was the first to fully use the technology‚Äôs potential in the financial sector. It incentivizes firms and enterprises to develop and deploy projects that make up the DeFi ecosystem.

DeFi provided a wealth of opportunities for creating a transparent and robust financial system that is not controlled by a single company. However, 2017 saw the beginning of a new era for financial applications, with initiatives allowing for more than just money transfers.

# Challenges within centralized finance

Bitcoin and other early cryptocurrencies were only decentralized in terms of issuance and storage, despite the fact that they were designed to allow individuals complete control over their assets. Until the advent of smart contracts, which enabled DeFi, providing access to a broader set of financial instruments remained a challenge.

# DeFi protocols and how they work

Here‚Äôs an overview of the most popular DeFi use cases and protocols available in the market today:

# DeFi lending and borrowing

By allowing lending and borrowing, DeFi gave finance a new path. Decentralized financing, often known as ‚ÄúOpen Finance,‚Äù provided crypto holders with chances to earn annual returns on their investments. Individuals might borrow money at a set interest rate thanks to decentralized borrowing. The goal of lending and borrowing is to meet the demands of the bitcoin community while also serving financial sector use cases.

# Decentralized exchanges

Decentralized Exchanges (DEx) are one of DeFi‚Äôs most important features, as they lock the most capital compared to other DeFi protocols. DExs enable users to trade tokens for other assets without the need for a centralized middleman or custodian. Traditional exchanges (centralized exchanges) provide similar services, but the investments available are subject to the will and costs of the exchange. Another disadvantage of CExs is the additional cost of each transaction, which is addressed with DExs.

## Top decentralized exchange: Uniswap

Founded in 2018 by Hayden Adams, UniSwap is the largest automated token exchange by trading volume deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was launched after receiving grants from multiple capital ventures, including the Ethereum Foundation. UniSwap automated transactions between cryptocurrencies through smart contract.

## How does it work?

UniSwap today offers three functionalities: Swapping tokens, adding liquidity, and removing liquidity.

**Swapping tokens**

1. Users are required to create an account on [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) to utilize this service.
2. Once a Metamask account is created, users can select tokens they own to swap for another type of cryptocurrency.

**Adding liquidity**

1. To provide liquidity, users deposit an equivalent value of tokens into the token‚Äôs associated exchange contract
2. Once you have tokens for liquidity, you can add them to a ‚Äúpool‚Äù on the UniSwap interface.
3. Users who provide liquidity on UniSwap earn exchange fees, calculated per the value of tokens offered for liquidity.

**Removing liquidity**

1. You can remove the liquidity on UniSwap by merely choosing the ‚ÄòRemove Liquidity‚Äô option from a drop-down menu.

# Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a feasible answer to the volatility issues that plague cryptocurrencies, and they are assisting DeFi in gaining popularity. Stablecoins‚Äô value is tied to a generally stable item, such as gold or the US dollar, in order to maintain its price consistent. Stablecoins were beneficial in the crypto ecosystem during risk-off periods, providing a safe refuge for investors and traders. They are a reliable collateral asset because of their stability. Stablecoins are also used in liquidity pools, which are a significant aspect of the DeFi ecosystem and DExs.

## MakerDAO

Founded in 2015 by Rune Christensen, [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/en/) is an organization building technology for savings, borrowing, lending, and a stable cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was one of the earliest DeFi protocols. Instead of conducting an ICO, the project privately sold $MKR tokens to fund the development over time. $DAI, Maker‚Äôs stablecoin, was launched in 2018 and has experienced significant traction.

**How does MakerDAO work?**

The protocol works like this:

* A user can send or deposit $ETH to a smart contract on Maker‚Äôs protocol and create a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). This will enables the ability to take $DAI at a specific collateralization rate.
* Suppose the price of $ETH drops in the future. In that case, the CDP of a user will automatically be closed to ensure the network has enough capital locked against the borrowed tokens. This can be prevented by putting in more $ETH or taking out less DAI in the first place.
* $ETH can be claimed back by paying back the amount, with the addition of a small fee.

# The future of DeFi

Through the advancement of distributed ledger technologies, we are witnessing a quantum jump in the new functionality of money. For the first time in history, the people of the world are shaping a global financial system. Everyone can participate in DeFi protocol governance and have a seat at the table where the world of decentralized finance is actively constructed.

Despite some of the challenges that come with working on the cutting edge of innovation, the world of decentralized banking is on the road to prosperity. When the power to construct financial services is democratized, it‚Äôs difficult to forecast how this field will evolve over time. However, when DeFI and fintech intersect and integrate, we‚Äôll reach a tipping point where fledgling financial technology becomes a component of a new financial system. One that embodies the ideals of speed, security, accessibility, and equality."
Summary of One Question A Day Event on SubDAO,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SubDAO/comments/plkqw9/summary_of_one_question_a_day_event_on_subdao/,SubDAO,1,2021-09-10 21:10:36,0,/r/u_SubDAO/comments/plkqw9/summary_of_one_question_a_day_event_on_subdao/,NaN,"&amp;#x200B;

[Summary of One Question A Day Event on¬†SubDAO](https://preview.redd.it/2mofyyiu3nm71.png?width=4001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d635e1d464a288d923de184d7a1a2bba565226a3)

&amp;#x200B;

We are glad to announce that the One Question A Day event has been completed. All participants show their enthusiasm and wisdom in the event which provides a chance that can help the community know more about SubDAO and its ecosystem.

In order to help more members understand SubDAO, we make a summary of all questions and answers from two rounds of events. Check and learn it now!

### Round 1

1. **How does SubDAO make a contribution to developers?**

The SubDAO will run as a parachain to provide specific services. The various DAO templates and SubDAO Airfone will alleviate the burden on developers to maintain DAOs and to create DApps linked with DAOs.

The initial governors of a DAO can easily create a cross-chain DAO with only a few clicks without any tech skills at all. Developers who are willing to build DApps can give the governance to communities by using SubDAO to create the very DAO connected to DApp through SubDAO Airfone.

And the OCW (O-chain Worker) provides the ability to access the o-chain world, which would empower SubDAO to access external data rather than only On-chain data, such as the price of stable coins, the contributions on Github, and so on.

**2. Which part is the fundament of the SubDAO network in the component of SubDAO?**

SubDAO Node is the customized chain node for the SubDAO network built by Substrate 2.0. It‚Äôs the fundament of the SubDAO network that contains the basic functionality as a normal chain node but also provides the ability to fetch external data needed for DAO governance with the OCW (O-chain Worker) from Substrate 2.0 Framework.

**3. How to build a new DAO from the perspective of the SubDAO network scenarios?**

As shown above, the steps to create a new DAO are marked. The DAO governor calls the smart contract of the SubDAO Guard to choose a proper DAO template from the DAO Template Library. After the governor fills in the basic information required by the template such as name, description, the rules of governance, initial members, and so on and deposits the initial fund to the Asset Vault, the SubDAO Guard contract will create the DAO according to the chosen template and filled information. All extra information, such as images, texts, and files, will be stored in a decentralized storage network like IPFS.

**4. In most features of SubDAO, Which feature can help SubDAO Network to interact with off-chain Workers?**

The on-chain worker is a new feature in the Substrate Framework that allows the SubDAO Network to interact with on-chain data.

**5. If a developer wants to interact with SubDAO DAO contracts, which components will be involved in this process?**

The first way to get involved with a specific DAO is using the Front End created by the SubDAO Labs to interact with all the DAOs on the SubDAO Network. The second way is using the SubDAO Airfone. The SubDAO Airfone will hide all the details of calling smart contracts for users and is used by DApps since the developers of DApps can customize their scenarios according to their needs.

**6. What‚Äôs the function of the PolkaSign?**

PolkaSign is a Web3.0 application for electronic protocols built on the Polkadot ecosystem. PolkaSign uses the Substrate Framework based on the SubDAO network to develop, can be replaced with any Substrate-based chain, and provides services for any type of organization with electronic agreements.

**7. How many members are there in the PDA? And who?**

There are 17 members on PDA until now, including Plasm, Phala, Stafi, Crust, Litentry, Bifrost, Patract, Darwina, Zenlink, and DeepDAO, members include zCloak Network, Clover, MathChain, Apron, and Stone, Manta Network.

**8. What are the basic functions of DAO on Substrate built by SubDAO?**

The basic functions include creating DAO, managing the assets vault and members, and conducting voting governance. So far, all modules and contracts of SubDAO have been integrated, becoming the first Polkadot project to implement DAO basic functions on Substrate, opening a new exploration of Polkadot ecological DAO governance.

**9. What do you know about the process of SubDAO blockchain and Smart Contract development?**

The detail includes:

* Upgraded the master node to Substrate3.0+, deploy a multi-node testnet
* Expanded flexibility on module design and adjusts to add new modules after creation.
* Adjusted the authority control voting module on the Vote process (Adds the function of setting the voting crowd, and adds the optional range when voting).
* Added voting and approval procedures for withdrawal applications on Vault (Anyone can initiate a withdrawal application, which is required to vote for it by a moderator so that the withdrawal can pass the verification).
* Adjusted the logic of personnel settings on Org, which can increase the way for personnel to join the organization (Org adds personnel to exit independently).
* Optimized the deposit process and increased withdrawal approval.

Other user experience and performance optimization¬†:

* Optimized the Moderator Permission management;
* Fix list DAO instance owner logic bug;
* Compiled DAO manager contract.

**10. Which investment institutions have invested in SubDAO until now?**

Hypersphere Ventures, Huobi Ventures, OKEx Blockdream Ventures, CMS Holdings, Signum, NGC Ventures, Digital Finance Group(DFG), Spark, SevenX, LD Capital, Digital Renaissance Foundation, Dealean, Kernel, Divergence Ventures, Bixin Ventures, Kenetic Capital, AU21 Capital, Illusionist Group to participate, and individuals including early team members and former chief growth officer of the DCG Group, Massari founders Ryan Selkis, Mask Network founders Suji participated in the investment.

### Round 2

**1. What kind of endeavor has the SubDAO team made to build the brand?**

Building of Polkadot DAO

AllianceOffline Promotion

**2. What content has been updated on the SubDAO official website?**

SubDAO‚Äôs official website has been upgraded and revised, which will bring the audience a brand new visual presentation. This revision not only gives the overall visual effect a whole new look but also shows some differences in the structure of the official website and the display unit on the homepage.

**3. How will the SubDAO Node work with the external data?**

&amp;#x200B;

[How SubDAO Node works](https://preview.redd.it/rdl5mjl54nm71.jpg?width=916&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d94b862e7e4b5a049d06366b7476c5c921a35f)

As shown above, the steps to create a new DAO are marked. The DAO governor calls the smart contract of the SubDAO Guard to choose a proper DAO template from the DAO Template Library. After the governor fills in the basic information required by template such as name, description, the rules of governance, initial members, and so on and deposits the initial fund to the Asset Vault, the SubDAO Guard contract will create the very DAO according to the chosen template and filled information. All extra information, such as images, texts, and files, will be stored in a decentralized storage network like IPFS.

**4. Do you know the SubDAO team members? List their name.**

Team Members are as follows.

**Wang Qiang:** Technical Contributor; Chief Solution Architect in Tencent; Former Team Lead in IBM; Core Developer of Smart Cloud / HSLT; Code Contributor of KVM; Community Contributor in RedHat

**Humphrey:** Community Contributor; Graduated from Peking University; Co-founder of PAKA Fund; Investor in many early projects of Polkadot

**Marvin Tong:** Technical Contributor; Founder and CEO of Phala Network; Former Product Manager in Tencent

**Owen:** Community Contributor; Stafifi Co-founder

**Da Jun:** Technical Contributor; Former Senior Software Engineer in Alibaba; Core Developer of Wetez and StaFi.io; Over 12 years of experience in Development

**Sang:** Community Contributor; Founder of Polka Warriors; Founder of Dotmarketcap

**5. What‚Äôs the motivation that SubDAO builds great work?**

DAO is the ideal governance model in the mind of the team. Creating and maintaining a DAO is not so easy, especially to make a DAO working across different chains. But with the help of Substrate 2.0 and Polkadot, the team thinks it is the time now. In the area of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, there are many mature DAOs maintained in different ways with different tools or platforms, such as MakerDAO and The LAO. Also, there are some

other tools to help governors building a DAO, such as Aragon. Aragon is a project providing tools to create and the governor a DAO, but only available on Ethereum.

**6. Which features make SubDAO unique and different from other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem?**

SubDAO is an enabler that aims to make DAO service easier-accessible. It is a cross-chain DAO creation and maintenance platform for DApps, powered by Substrate and Polkadot.

Despite several DAO service platforms, we are still far away from the real mass adoption of DAO and faced by many obstacles, including high technical barriers, unsatisfying user experience, simple and basic DAO functions that are unable to meet diverse user cases, most solutions are focused on Ethereum, etc.

However, SubDAO is created to tackle the problems that have been long ignored by other teams. So I would say that SubDAO has the following unique features:¬†

* Cross-chain platform;
* Access to off-line data;
* 0 technical background needed to create a DAO;
* Easy-to-navigate user interface. In the future, SubDAO will add more DAO templates and all types of organizations will be able to find a suitable DAO template for their own use.

**7. What are the use cases of SubDAO tokens?**

GOV, short for ‚ÄúGovernance‚Äù, is the native token of the SubDAO network. The total supply of GOV is 1 billion, with an annual inflation rate of 5%. The design of the SubDAO tokenomics model boils down to three goals: 1. Slot Auction; 2. Incentive the development of DAO; 3. Governance.

**8. What is the basic logic of governance farming design?**

Every organization with a DAO will have assets in the DAO. The amount of the initial shares (equity token) obtained by each DAO is decided by the asset size of the DAO;

DAO can realize share inflation and redistribution of DAO assets through voting and other governance activities, to achieve the goal of the organization;

We believe that the value of a DAO depends on many aspects including fund size, member count, and the frequency of governance activities. The bigger the fund, the more the member count, and the higher the frequency of governance activities, the more valuable and successful a DAO is.

**9. What do the Genesis Farming pools include?**

A total of 7% of the tokes will be distributed to 5 Genesis Farming pools. We will adopt a whitelist application mechanism. Then the DAOs that pass the application will receive farming rewards in GOV. The 5 types of DAO farming pools are:

* Foundation-based DAO
* Community-based DAO
* DeFi-based DAO
* Art (NFT)-based DAO
* Developer-based DAO

**20. Do you know the core roles of the SubDAO ecosystem? List them.**

In the SubDAO network, there are several core roles: para-chain contributors, farmers, and the SubDAO Council.

**About SubDAO**

SubDAO is a DAO infrastructure based on Polkadot, where any decentralized organization is allowed to conveniently create and manage a DAO. SubDAO does not only connect DAO with DApps to realize DAO‚Äôs cross-chain management but also bridges Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.

The founding team of SubDAO is composed of the former Technical Team leader of the IBM Group and many early well-known developers from Polkadot. All team members own rich experiences in Internet companies such as IBM, Tencent, and Alibaba. Jack Platts, former Director of External Cooperation of the Web3 Foundation and Partner of Hypersphere Ventures, serves as a strategic contributor to SubDAO. So far SubDAO has completed multi-million dollar financing including Hypersphere, Huobi Ventures, and other institutions.

New book about DeFi and a tiny failed experiment.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plz2ci/new_book_about_defi_and_a_tiny_failed_experiment/,GreenStretch,1,2021-09-11 10:39:39,25,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plz2ci/new_book_about_defi_and_a_tiny_failed_experiment/,FINANCE,"I tried posting about a new book about DeFi when I first picked it up and hadn't read any of it, but it got rejected for being too short.

[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/DeFi+and+the+Future+of+Finance-p-9781119836025](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/DeFi+and+the+Future+of+Finance-p-9781119836025)

It's very short, the body of the text not much more than 150 pages.  Vitalik wrote the preface.  

So the sections are an introduction about five problems of centralized finance, a general history of finance, the elements of DeFi infrastructure, the primitives or basic functions and elements of DeFi, a deep dive looking at several DeFi platforms and tokens, risks of the sector, and a conclusion.

I'm in the deep dive section now which looks at MakerDAO, both the governance token MKR and the DAI stablecoin, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Yield Protocol, dYdX, Synthetix, Set Protocol, and Wrapped Bitcoin.  While reading this last night, I kept looking at the websites for some of the major DeFi tokens and the rates paid on different assets.  

I've posted many times here about my skepticism of DeFi, even though I own a few of the major tokens.  But reading this made me excited and wanting to try this out on a small scale.  Just browsing on the sites, eventually there would be a point where they would ask to connect a wallet.  I didn't attempt that until now and felt a little scared because as far as I can tell, the public blockchain only shows isolated little subwallets when generating new addresses or creating separate subaccounts.  I didn't go as far as creating a brand new wallet with new seed words.  Connecting to the site, it was a bit shocking that it listed all the subaccounts, not just the tiny one I intended to use.  Logging out again, I went to a centralized exchange and purchased a very small amount of a DeFi token to deposit at a high interest rate.  By very small, it was only 33 dollars worth.  Going back to the site, I reconnected and selected the small subaccount with the token.  The box above the ""continue"" wallet had fine print that said the estimated ETH gas fees would be 71 dollars.  So far DeFi turned out to be as stupid as I feared and I didn't proceed with that transaction."

The (unpopular) vision of a Bitcoin-based ecosystem,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmzmm6/the_unpopular_vision_of_a_bitcoinbased_ecosystem/,M-A-L,1,2021-09-13 03:44:42,17,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmzmm6/the_unpopular_vision_of_a_bitcoinbased_ecosystem/,SPECULATION,"The Ethereum-killers like Cardano, Solana, and Elrond, are all performing really well atm. It seems to be a popular assumption that the future will either involve Ethereum, or one of these Ethereum substitutes (or both). 

There is an alternative vision however, namely of a Bitcoin-based ecosystem in which both Ethereum, the Ethereum-killers, and everything based on them, slowly move into the background. This isn‚Äôt a narrowminded Bitcoin maxi view and deserves to be more widely known. Here is the version of the Bitcoin-based view that I personally like: 

*Bitcoin* as store of value. Needs no introduction. 

*Lightning Network* to make Bitcoin functional as a currency and the transactions cheaper. I think many underestimate how well this is already working, how fast it is, how low the fees are and how quickly the network is growing. Lightning-powered Bitcoin might make things like Litecoin, BCH, Doge, Nano, Dash, etc. increasingly less attractive. 

*Defichain* for DeFi in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Deserves to be better known. This is a Bitcoin fork modified to enable DeFi functionality and nothing else. Like Bitcoin, it has no EVM (and is not Turing complete), which makes it very hard to exploit or hack. It‚Äôs not a general smart contract platform, so no one can blow it up with cryptokitties or other smart contracts gone viral. It anchors into Bitcoin‚Äôs ledger (so a 51% attack on it, requires a 51% attack on Bitcoin). By the end of the year, it aims to offer the full DeFi suite: a DEX, margin trading, overcollateralized loans, synthetic stocks (tokens tracking the price of Gold, Tesla, etc.), its own oracles, its own stablecoin, futures and options. One can swap trustlessly between BTC and dBTC on Defichain. If adoption skews to Bitcoin, Defichain becomes heavy competition for Uniswap, MakerDAO, Synthetix, Compound and so on. 

*Rootstock* to bring a general smart contract platform to Bitcoin. Also deserves to be better known. It‚Äôs a general smart contract platform on a Bitcoin layer 2, with gas paid in terms of rBTC. It also borrows its security from Bitcoin, through mining with Bitcoin, and here too one can swap trustlessly between BTC and rBTC on Rootstock. RSK supports all the programming languages used for the smart contracts of Ethereum. Any remaining functionality that is offered on Ethereum can be offered in principle within the Bitcoin ecosystem. One great example of this is RIF on rootstock, an infrastructure for all sharing economies, such as the sharing of identity, services and communications through a p2p marketplace. Any utility projects, like FileCoin, BAT, Civic, Syscoin, SelfKey, etc, could be moved over to Rootstock. 

As you can see, with these four, so much of the current cryptospace can be covered, and all revolve around Bitcoin. They are empowered by any heavy adoption of Bitcoin in the future. 

\*\*\*

If the adoption skews heavily in favor of Bitcoin as the most entrenched holder of value and the most heavily secured network, then one would expect a pressure to mobilize that value (as currency, in DeFi, and other smart contracts) and to tap into the security of that network. That is not a crazy thought, but it‚Äôs a world that might leave little room or need for most of the currently popular projects. 

No one knows the future, of course, but I think this is not at all an unrealistic scenario. It should at least be on your radar."
Decentralized Autonomous Organization DAO - Explained in Simple Terms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/png88j/decentralized_autonomous_organization_dao/,spritecut,1,2021-09-13 22:10:31,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/png88j/decentralized_autonomous_organization_dao/,EDUCATIONAL,"Wikipedia defines DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles[.](https://blockchainhub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DAOs_TaditionalOrganisations.png)

###Decentralized autonomous organizations aim to be:

- Open platforms where people interact with each other according to self-enforcing open-source protocols, making them extremely trust worthy.
- Keeping the network safe and performing other network tasks is rewarded with the native network tokens, encouraging active participation.
- All transactions of the organization are recorded and maintained on a blockchain making them very secure. 
- Interests of the members of the organization are ‚Äì if designed correctly ‚Äì aligned by the incentive rules tied to the native token. 

###Evolution and Examples 

**Bitcoin** network can be considered to be the first true DAO, coordinated by a consensus protocol which anybody is free to adopt. It provides an operating system for money without banks and bank managers, and has stayed attack resistant and fault-tolerant since the first block was created in 2009. However, Bitcoin lacks complex governance rules that are characteristic of DAOs.

**Ethereum** With the emergence of the Ethereum Network, the concept of DAOs moved up the technology stack from blockchain protocol to the smart contract. Smart contracts are necessary ingredients for DAOs to be possible. Nonetheless, Ethereum itself is not a DAO but a framework for developing DAO projects. 

**Uniswap** is the first DeFi protocol to have pioneered **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** which led it to become the most popular **decentralized exchange (DEX)**. The network has its own governance token UNI, which is used for voting on improvements and funding liquidity pools. As such, Uniswap is a full-blown DAO but one has to own 1% of UNI‚Äôs total supply in order to propose new governance rules or tweak existing ones, effectively barring over 90% of users from participating in directing the network‚Äôs development. 

**MakerDAO** is the most comprehensive example of DAO. As a DeFi protocol similar to Uniswap but for lending. MakerDAO has two token, stablecoin DAI and governance token MKR. The MakerDAO Foundation has been distributing MKR to incentivize contributors, spur voter participation, and decentralize the governance process. Effectively, the foundation‚Äôs goal is to abolish itself by giving away all the tokens to the network‚Äôs stakeholders.

**Aragon** is both a DAO and a platform for creating customized DAOs. This makes it extremely useful for users who don‚Äôt have advanced programming knowledge. Aragon takes care of the types of smart contracts and the interface, leaving it up to you to decide how to manage your organization. This makes Aragon a DAO ecosystem with a broad range of use cases.

###Criticisms

However, DAOs can be architecturally decentralized (independent actors run different nodes), and geographically decentralized (subject to different jurisdictions), but they are logically centralized (the protocol). As such, DAOs are on a spectrum of decentralization. 

The question of how to upgrade the code ‚Äì when and if necessary ‚Äì is very often delegated to a set of experts who understand the techno-legal intricacies of the code, and therefore represent a point of centralization.

Further, when we look at this from a legal perspective, it is clear that a DAO is neither a corporation, nor any other type of existing legal personality. It doesn‚Äôt have a registered office and has no physical place of business or registration. There are no shareholders or managers. As a result, it cannot perform many of the tasks commonly attributed to it, like owning property or engaging in legally binding contracts.

üì∑ Bluejay Finance üì∑  


Bluejay Protocol is a system for creating and managing stablecoins to track different currencies around the world. Our approach uses a collateralized debt position (CDPs), like MakerDAO, to create an elastic supply of stablecoins soft-pegged to sovereign currencies that are programmable, decentralized, and fully backed by collaterals.    


Bluejay aims to bring access to world-class financial services to the masses by mirroring their money on the blockchain. By leveraging on the existing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, the ecosystem can offer the under-banked population services like:  


\* Access to safe-haven assets like USD for short term saving through Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)  
\* Instant &amp; low-cost remittances to other currencies through DEX   
\* Mid to long term savings plan through different asset management &amp; lending/borrowing protocols  
\* ... and many more

The liquidity mining program will start 1 week after the auction launch, which is on September 17th. The liquidity mining will start at exactly block **19202000**. The countdown of the start block is available [here](https://polygonscan.com/block/countdown/19202000).

Bluejay Protocol is a system for creating and managing stablecoins to track different currencies around the world. Our approach uses a collateralized debt position (CDPs), like MakerDAO, to create an elastic supply of stablecoins soft-pegged to sovereign currencies that are programmable, decentralized, and fully backed by collaterals.

Bluejay aims to bring access to world-class financial services to the masses by mirroring their money on the blockchain. By leveraging on the existing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, the ecosystem can offer the under-banked population services like:

\* Access to safe-haven assets like USD for short term saving through Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)  
\* Instant &amp; low-cost remittances to other currencies through DEX  
\* Mid to long term savings plan through different asset management &amp; lending/borrowing protocols

Have you tried generating passive income with DeFi? What platforms do consider valuable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/po1b2g/have_you_tried_generating_passive_income_with/,OkImpress244,1,2021-09-14 19:57:35,2,/r/investing_discussion/comments/po1b2g/have_you_tried_generating_passive_income_with/,NaN,"Today, modern decentralized protocols and smart contract applications offer the DeFi user things like yield farming, staking, and lending, allowing them to accrue steady growth on their initial outlay. So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It‚Äôs a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use ‚Äústaking‚Äù as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

Decentralized Autonomous Organization DAO - Explained in Simple Terms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/po1rbe/decentralized_autonomous_organization_dao/,spritecut,1,2021-09-14 20:26:38,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/po1rbe/decentralized_autonomous_organization_dao/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"DAOs use **smart contracts** to organize, rendering transactions traceable, transparent and irreversible. This may change how financial institutions, legal firms, real estate industries, insurance companies and even governments function and operate[.](https://kajabi-storefronts-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/kajabi-storefronts-production/blogs/19054/images/DlowGjb0RoK3cm7eVsUk_mother.png)

Essentially the participants of the DAO own, operate and facilitate the running of the organization. 

###What are Smart contracts?

Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or any information of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.

- Autonomy ‚Äì There‚Äôs no need to rely on intermediaries
- Trust ‚Äì Your documents are encrypted on a shared ledger. ¬†
- Backup ‚Äì Your documents are duplicated many times over.
- Safety ‚Äì Cryptography keeps your documents safe.
- Speed ‚Äì Uses software to automate tasks.
- Savings ‚Äì No need for have to pay a notary as a witness
- Accuracy ‚Äì Avoid errors that come from manual reporting and filing. 

###Decentralized autonomous organizations aim to be:

- **Trustworthy** - Open platforms where people interact with each other according to rules running on open-source software.
- **Decentralized** - As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles
- **Democratic** - Keeping the network safe and other tasks are rewarded with the native network tokens, encouraging active participation.
- **Secure** - All transactions of the organization are recorded and maintained on a blockchain. 

###Easiest way to understand DAOs are with examples:

**Bitcoin** can be considered to be the first true DAO, It provides an operating system for money without banks and bank managers, which anybody is free to adopt, and has stayed attack resistant and fault-tolerant since the first block was created in 2009. However, Bitcoin lacks governance rules that are characteristic of DAOs.

**Ethereum** With the emergence of the Ethereum Network, the concept of DAOs moved up from blockchain protocol to the smart contract. Smart contracts are necessary ingredients for DAOs to be possible. Nonetheless, Ethereum itself is not a DAO but a framework for developing DAO projects. 

**Uniswap** is the first DeFi protocol to have pioneered **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** which led it to become the most popular **decentralized exchange (DEX)**. The network has its own governance token UNI, which is used for voting on improvements and funding liquidity pools. As such, Uniswap is a full-blown DAO but one has to own 1% of UNI‚Äôs total supply in order to propose new governance rules or tweak existing ones, effectively barring over 90% of users from participating in directing the network‚Äôs development. 

**MakerDAO** A DeFi protocol similar to Uniswap but for lending. MakerDAO has two tokens, stablecoin DAI and governance token MKR. The MakerDAO Foundation has been distributing MKR to incentivize contributors, spur voter participation, and decentralize the governance process. Effectively, the foundation‚Äôs goal is to abolish itself by giving away all the tokens to the network‚Äôs stakeholders.

###Beyond Financial markets

**Aragon** is both a DAO and a platform for creating customized DAOs. This makes it extremely useful for users who don‚Äôt have advanced programming knowledge. Aragon takes care of the types of smart contracts and the interface, leaving it up to you to decide how to manage your organization. This makes Aragon a DAO ecosystem with a broad range of use cases.

###Criticisms

DAOs are still **logically centralized** because they are reliant on software protocols, designed, written and operating effectively and as intended. The question of how to upgrade the code ‚Äì when and if necessary ‚Äì is very often delegated to a set of experts who understand the techno-legal intricacies of the code, and therefore represent another point of centralization.

Further, when we look at this from a legal perspective, it is clear that a DAO is neither a corporation, nor any other type of existing legal personality. It doesn‚Äôt have a registered office and has no physical place of business or registration. There are no shareholders or managers. As a result, it cannot perform many of the tasks commonly attributed to it, like owning property or engaging in legally binding contracts.

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It‚Äôs a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use ‚Äústaking‚Äù as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

If you, like me, are delighted with passive earnings with DeFi, please share your experience and thoughts. What platforms have you already used?"

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.

&gt;This could be an indication of where DeFi is headed.

 

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed."

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.

&gt;This could be an indication of where DeFi is headed.

 

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed."

I also want the opinions of the Ethereum Community.**

**I am going to discuss a fair bit about economics, finance, and how it pertains to technique. This thread is by no means intended to be taken as financial advice.**

To me it is clear that the current financial and economic system we have in place only deprives humanity of dignity and freedom. Can alternatives permanently solve the problem, or will the problem exist as long as technique exists? When I speak about technique, I am using Jacques Ellul's definition in his book ""Technological Society"" ""Technique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity"".

The Federal Reserve is looking to create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This gives the federal reserve a lot more influence on the consumption habits of Americans who hold USD IE Negative interest rates, inflation. Since your money loses its value over time, it is said that a small inflation rate is actually better for the economy since this encourages consumers to consume sooner rather than later. With the implementation of CBDC's, the Federal reserve will likely implement negative interest rates on those dollars, again further encouraging consumption as you are losing wealth if you do not. There are also major privacy risks involved with CBDC's. CBDC's are already becoming popular in China. I argue that this is an insult to human dignity and freedom.

Alternatives to our traditional banking system currently exist, like Ethereum, a censorship resistant, decentralized, trustless, smart contract blockchain. Ethereum has various applications such as lending pools (pools of assets where you can earn solid interest and borrow from) with decentralized stable coins (coins soft pegged to USD using Ether and other ERC-20 tokens as collateral, governed by MakerDAO holders). It is a very speculative technology, but I believe Ethereum has really matured. The asset Ether recently surpassed Paypal in terms of market cap as well as Ethereum settling more transactions in a quarter than Paypal did in a year. Lending pools like AAVE or Compound host a decentralized stable coin called DAI which offer far more competitive rates than a traditional savings account and especially more than a CBDC.

This technology I have been a passionate advocate for for over a year now regardless of my increasingly anti-technical views, however I often ponder on how this technology may only temporarily solve the issue of centralization in the financial sector, and it by no means solves the issue of technique. A lot of these projects utilize a governance token model, meaning that you vote using your tokens, and the more tokens you have, the more voting power you have. Depending on how these tokens are allocated, on how much early investors hold, or how much money you have, that voting power can be very centralized amongst few people. Popular Decentralized Exchange (Dex) aggregator 1Inch has 41% of all tokens held by one Ethereum wallet owned by popular crypto currency exchange Binance. This gives Binance the ability to swing any 1Inch proposal 41% in their favor instantly. Unfortunately there isn't a good way to remedy this at the moment. There are also issues with these exchange tokens potentially being labeled as securities and being subject to regulation by the SEC. Because of this and many other things it is becoming increasingly clear to me that Ethereum, despite being an improvement to the traditional banking system, is not enough.

Due to the efficiencies of blockchains, I also fear that this technology can be used as a means to coerce. Ethereum after upgrades and rollups is projected to be able to settle up to 100,000 to 150,000 transactions per second. Visa currently settles closer to 20,000-40,000. It should be no surprise that Visa has decided to utilize Ethereum to settle stable coin transactions. I fear that because they are so efficient, they can be utilized as a way to surveil or coerce. There was a blockchain in South Korea used to verify if people were vaccinated. It is not my intention to start a discussion about the covid vaccine, but merely a warning of how blockchain can be used to determine your status. Are you a dissenter? Did you pay your taxes? There is also nothing stopping governments or corporations from creating their own centralized blockchains, likely having more throughput than decentralized chains (with a few exceptions IE Solana) which may end up being the traditional, legal, settlement layer.

Since Ethereum is a public blockchain, anyone can view any transaction you make on the blockchain. This can be a corporation, a government, your neighbor. There are ways to increase your privacy, however I fear that people A. will not care about privacy (you would be surprised about how little people care) or B. that the ability to track on-chain data drastically improves. It is true that Ethereum is not the only blockchain. Monero is an example of a blockchain that allows for private transactions and the inability to search where a transaction is being sent. This asset is heavily regulated however. The only way you can obtain this asset without giving up information is if you buy it locally or if you mine it yourself. There is also limited functionality other than being a private decentralized blockchain.

It has become more apparent to me that these improvements over time degenerate to the very thing it sought to destroy. The United States has undergone numerous radical reforms to prevent corruption i.e. the Jackson Era and the Progressive reforms of 1920. These reforms only had temporary effects. As the movement relaxes, the corruption crept back in. I fear that blockchain is merely a temporary solution, and will resemble what it replaced, with only small practically insignificant differences. Does no solution exist as long as technique exists?

I have my doubts that a popular leftist philosophy taking hold of our society will end up improving the overall freedom and welfare of society. A prominent talking point I have heard from many left wing anarchist types is that AI can be used to decide the best way to allocate resources, including labor. This is an even more blunt manipulation of human behavior. Human beings will progressively let technology and AI make more and more of our decisions and play a bigger role in our lives, however turning it off would amount to suicide. Think of what would happen tomorrow if the internet or electricity was ripped from our society? This means that an industrial technological system would softly take power from all of humanity. One can argue that this already happened. Ellul mentioned in the Technological Society that the electronic brains running automatically has reduced seemingly powerful leaders into mere figureheads who only seem to direct procedures which are so complicated that no human brain could replicate them. Regardless of whatever system is in place, communism, capitalism, socialism, anarchism, etc, as long as there is technique, it will invade every faucet of your life and will continue to regulate your behavior until individual liberty ceases to exist.

I hope to set myself up in such a way where coercive forces have little to no influence in anything I do. I hope others do the same.

I have only briefly begun to mention my concerns regarding finance, economics, and technology. Please feel free to comment on anything that anyone wants to add."
EntroFi - Defi Protocol for Real World Financing and NFTs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EntroFi/comments/por0b3/entrofi_defi_protocol_for_real_world_financing/,EntroFi,1,2021-09-15 22:17:44,0,/r/u_EntroFi/comments/por0b3/entrofi_defi_protocol_for_real_world_financing/,NaN,"Today, EntroFi launches with a mission to bridge real-world assets to #DeFi. Bringing real-world assets on-chain will hugely scale DeFi as we know it, and DeFi-driven liquidity could unlock trillions of real-world financing. EntroFi is unique as it is similar to borrowing in trad-Fi, and is structured for smooth end-to-end execution for new trad-Fi users tapping into DeFi.

[https:\/\/entrofi.io\/](https://preview.redd.it/qgaveh6qdon71.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e43a2cd67563a0abf1347281f5f2f23107767540)

Our NFT-based DeFi lending platform will significantly improve the efficiency of existing financial infrastructure by connecting DeFi capitals directly to loan borrowers. Our protocol channels DeFi liquidity directly to SMEs and individuals, and brings real-world collateral assets, such as real estate and account receivables, as well as native NFTs, to DeFi by converting them into a new type of financial NFTs.

EntroFi utilizes the concept of NFT to accomplish two primary objectives:

1. Enables real world assets to access DeFi liquidity by connecting to DeFi protocol via NFT infrastructures.
2. Incorporates existing native NFTs with financial attributes via collateralization, improving their overall liquidity.

This is done through three separate layers in the EntroFi network:

1. Protocol layer, which is comprised of external DeFi, CeFi, or NFT protocols, such as MakerDAO, dForce, Yearn, Aave, Opensea
2. Liquidity layer, categorized into senior or junior capital based on risk/reward profiles
3. Asset layer of off-chain and on-chain assets, such as real-world assets backed NFTs (such as REITs, secured loans, tokenized bonds, Uniswap LP tokens, and OpenSea NFTs)

*Processing img 8dolr7ardon71...*

As users, you can participate in 1 of 4 ways: Liquidity contributor (provides capital to fund loan transactions across EntroFi), Originator (structures the transactions), Borrowers, and Risk Mitigators (ERF token stakers whose staked tokens will be used for risk mitigations in return for extra returns).

See the linked post for more detail, but typically these meetings are very educational in nature. Meetings with more friendly lawmakers has made it clear we have not done a good job educating outside the crypto bubble. 

Anyone who watched the Gensler testimony this week will know it needs to be very basic and non-technical in nature. So please keep it as succinct and non-technical as possible. They will not be technologists.

EntroFi - DeFi Protocol for Real World Financing and NFTs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntroFi/comments/ppsazf/entrofi_defi_protocol_for_real_world_financing/,EntroFi,1,2021-09-17 11:21:58,0,/r/EntroFi/comments/ppsazf/entrofi_defi_protocol_for_real_world_financing/,NaN,"Today, EntroFi launches with a mission to bridge real-world assets to #DeFi. Bringing real-world assets on-chain will hugely scale DeFi as we know it, and DeFi-driven liquidity could unlock trillions of real-world financing. EntroFi is unique as it is similar to borrowing in trad-Fi, and is structured for smooth end-to-end execution for new trad-Fi users tapping into DeFi.

[https:\/\/entrofi.io\/](https://preview.redd.it/3m58l6uvezn71.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a36e2ec20b00533ada6034696f32149cb56711b4)

Our NFT-based DeFi lending platform will significantly improve the efficiency of existing financial infrastructure by connecting DeFi capitals directly to loan borrowers. Our protocol channels DeFi liquidity directly to SMEs and individuals, and brings real-world collateral assets, such as real estate and account receivables, as well as native NFTs, to DeFi by converting them into a new type of financial NFTs.

 

EntroFi utilizes the concept of NFT to accomplish two primary objectives:

1) Enables real world assets to access DeFi liquidity by connecting to DeFi protocol via NFT infrastructures.

2) Incorporates existing native NFTs with financial attributes via collateralization, improving their overall liquidity.

This is done through three separate layers in the EntroFi network:

 1. Protocol layer, which is comprised of external DeFi, CeFi, or NFT protocols, such as MakerDAO, dForce, Yearn, Aave, Opensea

2. Liquidity layer, categorized into senior or junior capital based on risk/reward profiles

3. Asset layer of off-chain and on-chain assets, such as real-world assets backed NFTs (such as REITs, secured loans, tokenized bonds, Uniswap LP tokens, and OpenSea NFTs)

 As users, you can participate in 1 of 4 ways: Liquidity contributor (provides capital to fund loan transactions across EntroFi), Originator (structures the transactions), Borrowers, and Risk Mitigators (ERF token stakers whose staked tokens will be used for risk mitigations in return for extra returns).

It is also a critical component in decentralised finance (DeFi) because people often need a volatility-free means of transacting. 

As fully collateralised stablecoins gained interest, it soon became clear that as they grow in demand and adoption, collateralising them will be a difficult task. Not only is it difficult to amass and secure hundreds of billions of dollars, but it is also an inefficient use of capital, because the collateral is sitting idle instead of being put to more productive use elsewhere.¬†

. . . 

###Types of Stable Coins

###Centralised
- These are fully collateralised and backed 1:1 by fiat currencies, which are generally stored in bank accounts **They are centralized because they are launched and governed by a central organization, which could be either a company, a bank or even a government.** They generally maintain their peg through contraction or dilution (minting and burning) of the total supply, changing the relative price of each token until it reaches the desired peg.¬†Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Gemini USD (GUSD) 

###Decentralised
- Loans are created through Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) using smart contracts to collateralise a cryptocurrency in order to mint stablecoins. They are generally over-collateralised to compensate for volatility. **They are fully decentralised and both more transparent and more stable, because the protocols automatically stabilise the value of the coins** - MakerDAO (MKR), a pioneer of decentralised finance (DeFi), is a project where users deposit ETH, YFI, LINK, AAVE, UNI. BAT or even TUSDT, PAXUSD  at an over collateralised rate of 150%, and borrow against the value of these deposits to receive newly generated DAI. 

###Decentralised Algorithmic
- Utilising a two token system there is no collateral backing these. They consist of one stable asset and one speculative asset, which automatically expands or contracts the circulating supply with the minting and burning of the speculative asset. These mechanisms are called **‚Äòseigniorage models‚Äô** and use Algorithmic Market Operations controllers (AMOs) to maintain stability with the speculative asset not only absorbing the volatility of the system, but profiting from it as well. Clearly there is an issue if the protocols get hacked there is nothing backing up the coins. 

###Fractionalised Algorithmic stablecoins 
- The concept of algorithmic stablecoins inspired developers with the idea that a stablecoin could achieve mass adoption, yet require less than full collateralisation - **collaterally-backed and algorithmically modified to achieve stability**. The benefit of being under-collateralised is that if a stablecoin does not require 100% (or 150% in the case of DAI) of its supply to be collateralised then that capital, which would otherwise be required to sit idle, can instead be deployed elsewhere in a more efficient manner, such as in yield farms or used in lending.

. . .

###Centralised Stablecoins

###Tether (USDT)
Since its creation in 2014, Tether (USDT) is undoubtedly the predominant market leader and has been mired in controversy. According to the official website, ‚ÄúEvery tether is always 100% backed by the company‚Äôs reserves which include traditional currency and cash equivalents‚Äù Which has now been updated with the ‚Äúfrom time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‚Äúreserves‚Äù).‚Äù However, the ‚ÄúCash‚Äù portion of this is in fact only 2.9%

USDT is operated by Tether Limited, which is closely associated with iFinex, which is the parent company of the popular exchange Bitfinex.

It‚Äôs worth noting that there are several networks that USDT is being minted on including ; Omni, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, and Liquid.

###USD Coin (USDC)
USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin powered by Ethereum blockchain, as an ERC-20 token, launched by Coinbase, together with trading desk Circle. According to the official website of Coinbase, each USDC is backed by one US Dollar, which is held on bank accounts. Coinbase rewards its customers for holding the USDC on their exchange account. 

###Paxos Standard (PAX)
Paxos is also based on Ethereum‚Äôs ERC-20 blockchain. Paxos Trust Company, PAX issuer, is also the company that operates the Paxos exchange, along with custody services and safeguarding physical and digital assets as a regulated trust.

Paxos claims that the dollars, which back each PAX in regulation, are held in segregated accounts, which are FDIC-insured and domiciled in US banks. According to the official website, PAX is listed on over 100 exchanges.

###True USD (TUSD)
TUSD is another ERC-20 based stablecoin, and is supported by more than 70 exchanges around the world, including the major ones. TrueUSD‚Äôs issuer also issued other stablecoins pegged to other coins: those include TrueGBP, TrueAUD, TrueCAD, and TrueHKD.

###Gemini Dollar (GUSD)
The Gemini Dollar (GUSD) is touted as the first-ever regulated stablecoin. It‚Äôs issued by the Gemini Trust Company, owners of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, which operates as a qualified custodian under New York Banking Law and is also licensed by the State of New York.

According to the official website, the USD deposit balance is examined every month by a registered public accounting firm in order to guarantee the pegging. All the reports are published and available online.

###Binance USD (BUSD)
Binance USD (BUSD) is the stablecoin that resulted from a partnership between the leading crypto exchange and Paxos. It has received the approval of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and it was made available for trading since 
2019.

###Decentralised Stablecoins

###Dai (DAI)
DAI is not governed or issued by a central authority or, as in most of the cases here, by a centralized company. Instead, DAI is governed by a decentralized community of MKR token holders. These holders are in control of the Maker Protocol, which is the smart contract behind the DAI stablecoin.

This comes with a lot of benefits. For once, it takes away the worry that the company controls the supply of the stablecoin. It‚Äôs also immutable, censorship-resistant, and entirely transparent by design.

The main threat of decentralized stablecoins, such as DAI, is hacking to the smart contract. In such a scenario, there is no physical backup of the DAIs.


###Decentralised Algorithmic Stablecoins

###Terra (UST)
Terra is a Proof of Stake blockchain built using Tendermint, a core contributor to the Cosmos Network, that focuses on global payments and settlement. 

Consensus and security uses a seigniorage model, which is achieved through the LUNA token and absorbs the volatility of the stablecoins. When TerraUSD is priced at $1.01, the system expands to print more TerraUSD through burning LUNA. The idea is that LUNA holders can exchange their for $1 worth of TerraUSD, then sell it for $1.01, and profit from the difference. 

Part of the LUNA exchanged is burned while the rest of it compounds in a community pool. When TerraUSD is $0.99, the opposite happens, and TerraUSD is exchanged for $1 worth of LUNA.¬†

(In May 2021, LUNA faced its biggest test due to TerraUSD falling below its peg for several days due to a combination of the LUNA price crashing and a number of collateral liquidations. At one point, the stablecoin reached $0.92, but has since recovered.)

###Fractionalised Algorithmic Stablecoins

###Frax (FRAX)

At its core, it‚Äôs a seigniorage model yet in its infancy decided to be partially backed by USDC. Currently, FRAX is 85% backed by USDC with the remaining 15% being algorithmically stabilized by Frax Shares (FXS) which is continually minted and burned by arbitrageurs in order to maintain its $1 peg which to date has never shifted off of it.

FRAX is going with the multi-chain approach for adoption. Currently, FRAX is circulating on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, and plans to expand to Moonbeam. 

. . .

###TL;DR - Stablecoins offer a stable and secure means of holding funds during times of volatility. Different coins serve different markets at different times and have a wide range of goals and objectives over a given time horizon. The centralised coins are arguably the most popular and accessible. The decentralised DAOs are so far serving their ecosystems exceptionally well. And the Algorithmic coins are trying to push how far the concept of seigniorage can go.

What is Yield farming?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/pub9qq/what_is_yield_farming/,subwaybooligan,1,2021-09-24 11:20:00,1,/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/pub9qq/what_is_yield_farming/,NaN,"***TLDR at the bottom***

**What is yield farming in DeFi and how does it work?**

**What is yield farming?**  


At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards on their holdings. With yield farming, an investor deposits units of a cryptocurrency into a lending protocol to earn interest from trading fees. Some users are also rewarded with additional yields from the protocol‚Äôs governance token.¬†

Yield farming works in a similar way to bank loans. When the bank loans you money, you pay back the loan with interest. Yield farming does the same, but this time, the banks are crypto holders like yourself. Yield farming uses ‚Äúidle cryptos‚Äù that would have otherwise been wasting away in an exchange or hot wallet to provide liquidity in DeFi protocols like Uniswap in exchange for returns.

**Understanding liquidity pools, liquidity providers and automated market maker model**

Yield farming works with a liquidity provider and a liquidity pool (a smart contract filled with cash) that powers a DeFi market. A liquidity provider is an investor who deposits funds into a smart contract. The liquidity pool is a smart contract filled with cash. Yield farming functions based on the automated market maker (AMM) model.¬†

This model is popular on decentralized exchanges. AMM eliminates the conventional order book, which contains all ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and ‚Äúsell‚Äù orders on a cryptocurrency exchange. Instead of stating the price that an asset is set to trade at, an AMM creates liquidity pools using smart contracts. These pools execute trades based on predetermined algorithms.

The AMM model relies heavily on liquidity providers (LPs), who deposit funds into liquidity pools. These pools are the bedrock of most DeFi marketplaces where users borrow, lend and swap tokens. DeFi users pay trading fees to the marketplace; the marketplace shares the fees with LPs based on their share of the pool‚Äôs liquidity.¬†

Take Compound, for instance. The protocol provides liquidity to borrowers who want to borrow funds in cryptocurrencies. The Compound Finance system does this using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. LPs deposit funds into the liquidity pools. These contracts serve as the matching engine for market participants.¬†

Once an interest rate for the loan has been agreed upon, the borrower gets the funds.

In exchange for their funds, LPs get Compound Finance‚Äôs native COMP tokens. They also get a cut of the interest that the borrowers pay.

Some of the most common DeFi-related stablecoins include USDT, DAI, USDC and BUSD. Some protocols can also mint tokens, which represent your deposited coins in the system. For instance, if you deposit ETH into Compound Finance, you get cETH. If you deposit DAI, you get cDAI.

**Yield farming returns**

Estimated yield returns are calculated on an annualized model. This shows the possible earnings for locking up your cryptos for a year.

Some of the most common metrics include annual percentage yield (APY) and annual percentage rate (APR). The primary difference between them is that APR doesn‚Äôt consider compound interest, which involves plowing back your profits to increase your returns.

Still, most calculation models are simply estimates. It is difficult to accurately calculate returns on yield farming because it is a dynamic market. A yield farming strategy could deliver high returns for a while, but farmers could always adopt it *en masse*, leading to a drop in profitability. The market is quite volatile and risky for both borrowers and lenders.

**Should you try yield farming?**

**First, understand its risks**

Despite its obvious potential upside, yield farming has its risks. They include:¬†

* **Smart contract risks** 

Smart contracts are paperless digital codes that contain the agreement between parties on predefined rules that self executes. Smart contracts eliminate go-betweens, are cheaper and safer to conduct transactions. But, they are susceptible to attack vectors and bugs in the code. Users of popular DeFi protocols [Uniswap](https://decrypt.co/43927/ethereum-user-scammed-for-140000-in-uniswap-uni-tokens) and [Akropolis](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-steals-2-million-from-cryptocurrency-service-akropolis/) have all suffered losses to smart contract scams.¬†

* **Impermanent loss risk** 

Yield farming requires liquidity providers to supply funds into pools to earn yields and trading fees from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This offers LPs market-neutral returns, but it could be risky during sharp market moves.¬†

This risk is possible because AMMs don‚Äôt update token prices in line with movements in the market. For instance, if an asset‚Äôs price drops by 60% on a centralized exchange, the change won‚Äôt immediately reflect on a DEX.

As a result, a savvy arbitrage trader could use that narrow price gap to sell their token on a yield farming platform at a premium. LPs will eventually have to cover this difference, and incur losses when the price drops. Since their capital is locked in the pool, they can‚Äôt benefit when the price rises. One way of addressing this issue is to choose protocols that trade assets with low price slippages, such as the [WBTC and renBTC pairs on Curve.](https://taiyangzhang.medium.com/)

* **Liquidation risks** 

As with the traditional finance space, DeFi platforms use their customers‚Äô deposits to provide liquidity to their markets. However, a problem could arise when the value of the collateral drops below the loan‚Äôs price. For instance, if you take out a loan in ETH collateralized by BTC, a price increase in ETH would result in the loan being liquidated as the value of the collateral (BTC) would be less than the value of the ETH loan.

* **Capital intensive and complicated process**

Yield farming is a capital-intensive operation. Most of the cost concern surrounds the issue of gas fees on the Ethereum network. Josh Rager, the founder of cryptocurrency trading service Blockroots.com, took to Twitter to [complain](https://twitter.com/Josh_Rager/status/1293760986520969217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293760986520969217%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F38556%2Fethereum-fees-briefly-equal-a-us-stimulus-check) that he had to pay as much as US$1,200 in fees to purchase tokens on a DeFi project. This is more of an issue for smaller participants than for wealthier users, who have access to more capital. Smaller participants might find out that they can‚Äôt withdraw their earnings due to high gas fees.

Getting into yield farming is a risky endeavor if you have no experience in the cryptocurrency world. You could lose all your investment in one fell swoop. Invest at your own risk. The world of yield farming is fast-paced and volatile. If you decide to try your hands on yield farming, you should not invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose.

**What the future holds for yield farming**

Yield farming uses investors‚Äô funds to create liquidity in the market in exchange for returns. It has significant potential for growth, but it‚Äôs not without its faults.

Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, even promised not to dip his feet into yield farming until it ‚Äústabilizes.‚Äù Several other blockchains like Polkadot and Solana have tried wooing DeFi platforms with new features. Tezos completed an upgrade dubbed ‚ÄúDelphi‚Äù which it claims would reduce gas fees for developers by 75%. This proposition is expected to attract DeFi developers.

**The Seven Most Popular Yield Farming Protocols**

[**1. Compound**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/) is a money market for lending and borrowing assets, where algorithmically adjusted compound interest as well the governance token COMP can be earned.

[**2. MakerDAO**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/) is a decentralized credit pioneer that lets users lock crypto as collateral assets to borrow DAI, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Interest is paid in the form of a ‚Äústability fee.‚Äù¬†

[**3. Aave**](https://aave.com/) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol to create money markets, where users can borrow assets and earn compound interest for lending in the form of the [**AAVE**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) (previously LEND) token. Aave is also known for facilitating flash loans and credit delegation, where loans can be issued to borrowers without collateral.¬†

[**4. Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) is a hugely popular decentralized exchange (DEX) and [**automated market maker (AMM)**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) that enables users to swap almost any [**ERC20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pair without intermediaries. Liquidity providers must stake both sides of the liquidity pool in a 50/50 ratio, and in return earn a proportion of transaction fees as well as the UNI governance token.

[**5. Balancer**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/) is a liquidity protocol that distinguishes itself through flexible staking. It doesn‚Äôt require lenders to add liquidity equally to both pools. Instead, liquidity providers can create customized liquidity pools with varying token ratios.¬†

[**6. Synthetix**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/) is a derivatives liquidity protocol that allows users to create synthetic crypto assets through the use of [**oracles**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) for almost any traditional finance asset that can deliver reliable pricing data.

[**7. Yearn.finance**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance-protocol/) is an automated decentralized aggregation protocol that allows yield farmers to use various lending protocols like Aave and Compound for the highest yield. Yearn.finance algorithmically seeks the most profitable yield farming services and uses rebasing to maximize their profit. Yearn.finance made waves in 2020 when its governance token [**YFI** ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)climbed to over $40,000 in value at one stage.

Other notable yield farming protocols: [**Curve**](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/), [**Harvest**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/), [**Ren**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/) and [**SushiSwap**](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/16/bullish-activity-for-bitcoin-under-the-hood-of-the-sushiswap-saga-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/).

TLDR:***At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards on their holdings. With yield farming, an investor deposits units of a cryptocurrency into a lending protocol to earn interest from trading fees.***"

The Axie core team will build functionality for the game assets associated with the Axie brand in concurrence with the community. The Axie universe must be fun above all else; only by having an immersive gaming experience can the ecosystem attract enough participants to accrue value to the network. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Battling

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img iakoupn6cnp71...*

In October 2018, the Axie core team released the first battle system built on top of the Axie game assets. The battle system was structured as an ""idle battle"" system with inspiration from games like ""Final Fantasy Tactics"" and ""Idle Heroes"".

The Axie team started development on the real-time card battle system and application in March 2019 and released an Alpha in December 2019. As of October 2020, the Application has amassed over 15,000 downloads with over 7,000 weekly active users.

Much like Pokemon has gone through numerous iterations and types of battle systems, we also expect Axie to have many variations of battles over the years to come.

 **Tournaments and Esports**

Due to its skill-based, competitive nature, the Axie battle system is a good fit for competitive play and Esports. We believe this is a critical aspect for future growth and we have seen how engaged the players become when there is money on the line. 

Axie players have already earned thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency through numerous tournaments hosted by the core team or 3rd party sponsors.

&amp;#x200B;

# Breeding and $SLP 

Like real-world pets, Axies can be bred to create new offspring. To avoid hyperinflation of Axies there is a maximum amount of times an Axie can be bred before it is sterile.

Breeding an Axie costs AXS and some Smooth Love Potions depending on how many times the Axies have been bred. The AXS portion is variable and subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors.

* Axie Infinity does not sell $SLP to players directly
* Axie Infinity does not provide liquidity for $SLP

&amp;#x200B;

|Breed Count|Breed Number|Total SLP Cost|
|:-|:-|:-|
|(0/7)|1|600|
|(1/7)|2|900|
|(2/7)|3|1500|
|(3/7)|4|2400|
|(4/7)|5|3900|
|(5/7)|6|6300|
|(6/7)|7|10200|

 **Genetics** 

Each Axie has 6 body parts as well as a body shape. For each part, an Axie possesses 3 genes. A dominant (D), recessive (R1), and minor recessive gene (R2). 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/viam2obycnp71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7938d90db052616adc4fa214694f8f04dec8ae6e)

The dominant gene is what determines the body part that is physically present on the Axie. When breeding, each gene has a chance to be passed down to offspring:

**Dominant (D):** 37.5% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

**Recessive (R1):** 9.375% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

**Minor Recessive (R2):** 3.125% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

Then select an Axie to pair it with!

**How Long Does it take for an Axie to become an adult?**

Axies take 5 days to reach maturity.

After 5 days, you can morph your egg to an adult Axie and see the Axie's genes.

 

# Axie Population &amp; Long-term Sustainability

 

**Key Points**

* Axie is a new type of game that rewards players for the time and effort they spend both playing the game and growing the ecosystem.
* Axie has a 100% player-owned, real money economy. Rather than selling game items or copies, the developers of the game focus on growing the player to player economy and take small fees to monetize. Axies are created by players using in-game resources (SLP &amp; AXS) and sold to new/other players. You can think of Axie as a nation with a real economy. The holders of the AXS token are the government that receives tax revenues. The inventors/builders of the game, Sky Mavis, hold \~20% of all AXS tokens.
* Game resources and items are tokenized, meaning they can be sold to anyone, anywhere on open peer-to-peer markets.

Axie population growth is a major factor within the Axie ecosystem. At any given moment, there exists some ideal inflation rate that allows us to grow to our maximum potential. Too slow and Axie prices are too high for everyday people to join; especially competitive Axies. Too fast and you get unhealthy inflation. 

Long term Axie population management relies on:

* **Adding additional utility to Axies** through new experiences such as land, mini-games. This also adds utility to Axies beyond their effectiveness in fleeting metas. 
* **Adding vertical, rather than purely horizontal progression.** Right now in order to progress the main path that people take is by expanding the size of their collection. This dynamic is not optimal long term. In the long run there will be upgrades to both Axies AND Land that will require crafting ingredients. Axies themselves may be ‚Äúreleased‚Äù to obtain these crafting ingredients. This creates a long term supply sink to the Axie population. Axie progression is coming in the future; and it promises to create a much stronger bond between trainers and the Axies they choose to upgrade.
* **Soulbound Axies,** aka non-transferable Axies, that are competitive in the arena will allow anyone to compete and have fun.  Earning potential for these soul bound Axies should be zero or close to zero; meaning that of course demand will remain for strong ‚Äúreal‚Äù battle Axies. Also keep in mind that demand for Axies is ultimately what also drives demand for SLP (and AXS), so creating more reasons to own Axies and making it easier for us to grow are important in a a healthy economy.

**Transitioning from Growth-Dependency Using Network Strength**

In the beginning, the Axie economy will be dependent on growth and new entrants. New players require Axies to get started, Axies price and breeding profitability will be determined by the demand from these prospective Axie players.This is much like any startup, growth is necessary in the early days.

However, as the size and strength of the Axie network grows there will increasingly be new sources of external capital into the ecosystem such as:

* **Advertising fees and sponsorships**. Many projects are already eager to distribute rewards and tokens to the Axie economy. So far MakerDAO, AAVE, and Kyber Network have done experimental token drops to Axie players. Axie is already the largest community of people who understand how to use Blockchain technology in the world; there is immense value in advertising to a community like this.
* **Nonprofit organizations** will be a major source of Axie demand and to pour capital from donors into Lunacia with no expectation of return; only the will to do good.
* **Government donations and grants.** Axie is well poised to become a laboratory for Universal basic income experiments. 

It's also important to note that many Axie players see Axie as a fun game and a social community to meet friends. More than 50% of Axie players prefer the gameplay and community to the economic aspect. These players value the fun and relationships that they make through Axie much higher than any potential earnings; these players make the economy stronger in the long run. 

There are other types of value that Axie players gain through their journey such as:

* Joy of owning a pet.
* Fun, rest, and relaxation.
* Making friends and finding business partners/mentors.
* Learning how to use an important new technology. There's no need for paid ""blockchain classes"".

 

# Land

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wx0x1qcldnp71.png?width=1502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=721b528494820b05a03201f90ef77e0ff7b1f9c3)

Lunacia,  the Axie homeland,  is divided into tokenized plots of land which act as homes and bases of operation for their Axies. Plots can be upgraded over time using a variety of resources and crafting ingredients that can be found when playing the game. 

In addition, land-owners might find AXS tokens on their land plots, or use the Axies that occupy the land plot to explore resource nodes on the map. When interacting with resources nodes Axies can find AXS and potentially other resources. 

**Resource Gathering and Crafting**

* Resources will spawn in nodes across Lunacia and be used to upgrade both land and Axies.
* Landholders will have first rights to any resources that spawn on their land.
* &amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gxz8vgundnp71...*

**Real-Time PvE Battles**

Monsters called Chimera are terrorizing Lunacia. Players will be able to take on Chimera in real-time battles either alone or in groups. Chimera will drop an assortment of resources, items, and blueprints used to upgrade land and individual Axies.

Additional details about land will be released in time.

&amp;#x200B;

[ A plot owned and designed by cloudwhite ](https://preview.redd.it/7341y42qdnp71.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1721e833adbee419ae8992e645fe4518bb7430a)

 

**The World**

Lunacia consists of 90,601 plots of Land. These Land plots are represented as Non-Fungible Tokens and can be freely traded by players.

&amp;#x200B;

|Land Type|Player-owned|Total supply|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Savannah|5327|22042|
|Forest|5359|22025|
|Arctic|4171|16537|
|Mystic|2309|8264|
|Genesis|75|220|
|Lunas Landing(Center)|0\*|3501|
|Map(water,roads,resource nodes)|0|18012|
|**Total Land**|**17241**|**90601**|

 Land gameplay is still being actively developed and will be released in phases.

Phase one is the gameplay mentioned above, and phase two will focus on turning Lunacia into a virtual world with a focus on user-generated content. Players will be able to create games using the Lunacia SDK and place these games on land that they own. 

**Lunacia SDK**

&amp;#x200B;

The Lunacia SDK will initially be a map editor where players can use Axie Infinity art assets to create games and other experiences. Once a game has been created it is saved as a Non-Fungible Token and can be traded. These NFTs can be placed on land and players will be able to click on them to enter the game inside."

If that is the case, how are they able to update the smart contract when from what I've heard smart contracts in the ethereum are immutable and cannot be modified if changed? Or am I missing something?"

Can someone shed light on CDPs/MakerDAO?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/px6wm9/can_someone_shed_light_on_cdpsmakerdao/,tillyboy,1,2021-09-28 21:54:50,11,/r/defi/comments/px6wm9/can_someone_shed_light_on_cdpsmakerdao/,NaN,"I was wondering how the liquidation in MakerDAO actually works, and let me explain this by a little example:

1. I place 1500 USD worth of ETH into the smart contract as collateral, and then mint 1000 DAI
2. The ETH place plummets, such that now I only have 1450 USD as collateral. This triggers liquidation.
3. Assuming I get liquidated incrementally, 50 USD worth of my ETH is sold. Now I have 1400 USD worth of ETH left. This transaction however brings my collateral down from 145% to 140%. The liquidation however should bring my collateral back up to 150%.

Obviously, I must have misunderstood something. Can someone tell me what it is and how it actually works?"
