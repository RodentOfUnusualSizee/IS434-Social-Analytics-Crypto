rpvvmx,roxymo83,Tiied= AAVE for tired,I'm tired of trying to explain the particulars of racism to non POC's. Tired of trying to prove systematic racism exists. Tired of explaining my own experiences. If I respond to a question in the CRT sub.... that's the end of my answer. I'm done debating with ppl that will never be able to walk in my shoes &amp; lack the empathy to even try &amp; see where I'm coming from. It's really nothing to prove. It's facts. Shit that really happened/ still happens.  It's ok to not know about things u never went thru. But I'm done tryna validate it.

rp9us5,Jtrades26,Proton LOAN fee structure vs. Aave,"Taken from the Aave site faq -

What is the cost of interacting with Aave protocol?
Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for Ethereum Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity.

Aave has billions of $ in stable coins / crypto running through it, so safe to say Defi is very popular. I think it's fair to say it will become far more popular over time.

However reading through their subreddit the past few months reveals a glaring problem with fees due to Ethereum network congestion. Poly has provided some relief by the looks of it, but fees are still a general problem.

What will the fee structure look like on Proton LOAN? I assume it'll be negligible, and far lower then Aave considering it's built on the Proton blockchain?

Thinking out loud here but if banks or even just First Blockchain Bank üè¶ &amp;Trust are going to implement Defi / lending they will still need to benefit financially somewhere on par with their existing traditional lending so anyone know how banks might fit into defi?",2021-12-27 08:22:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonChain/comments/rp9us5/proton_loan_fee_structure_vs_aave/

rmy9nh,bobtobno,What to borrow on AAVE?,"I'm looking to take a collateralized loan on AAVE on Polygon.

But I'm not sure which stable coin I should use or what the APRs mean that I'm looking at

So the larger percent is the amount I'm paying to take the loan I think.

Is the smaller percentage below what I am paid in matic to take the loan? 

So if I borrowed USDT I would pay 3.72%, but be rewarded 7.77% in matic?

Does it make sense to just choose the stable coin with the best rate? Or is there a reason I should choose a particular one?",2021-12-23 23:38:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rmy9nh/what_to_borrow_on_aave/

In this Gujarati bhajan Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) ji is spreading the truth, and is teaching us the way's and means to keep our internal mind pure and calm. So that the shine of the Divine can be easily bestowed upon us.  


Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) ji explains  
Clouds of dirt are coming in between.  
When the deepest of dirt shall be washed away.  
Then the brightness of the doer, shall spread away.  
Whether a small or big stain in it shall always arise obstacles.  
When pure to purity shall blend easily.  
Then the internal shall become pure.  
Bubbles of lust shall arise and it shall show new new forms everyday.  
The bottom appears in pure and calm water.  
In the similar way in a pure and calm mind our internal brightness appears .  
Kakaji concludes  
As the obstacles of distance moves away.  
Then brightness shall spread there, do not be anxious do not loose patience then.

In this truthful Gujarati Bhajan he is guiding us and making us aware of the most important fact of life ""Death""  
Kakaji is guiding us  
You come late in the world and so you shall go late from the world there is no such rule.  
Who shall go early and who shall go late from the world is not to be known.  
During the day it seems it shall go away at night.  
Though you stay counting the hours for it to go, but it shall survive.  
No bribery shall work here, once own deeds (Karma's) are recommended.  
Whether poor or rich all receive death in the similar way.  
It (Death)won't turn away even if you shall be hidden in a fort.  
Even if you are at the bottom of the sea, death shall even reach there.  
It never sees day or night, It shall meet you at any time.  
When you have to go, go peacefully without God's grace you won't get peace.  
In this bhajan Kakaji is taking us very near to the closest fact of life Death, and making us prepared by knowing that you can meet death at any time, &amp; any where in life. You cannot hide your self from death. So doing good deeds is the only way you can lead your life peacefully and get blessings of the Divine for a peaceful death.

riae8f,klevioza,Sapnani Laxmi Jagta Toh Kaam Nahi Aave," 

In this Gujarati Bhajan,  
He is saying‚Ä¶  
Wealth in the dream is of no use upon waking up.  
The water of mirage is not going to quench the thirst.  
Without efforts, destiny cannot be glossed.  
With sliding sand, a palace cannot be built.  
To receive love from the world, your heart cannot be filled with animosity.  
The lost item at one place cannot be found at another place.  
Upon getting the light of the sun, brightness of stars will not be missed.  
Without any reason, insulting someone is going to be felt.  
For man who is confused, each moment feels costly.  
In happy state of mind, passing moment will not be understood.  
Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) is explaining that one should remain focus in the truth of life, in practicality of life. Have realistic goals and expectations in life and make efforts towards achieving realistic expectations. One should not try to make a palace from the sand or try to quench the thirst from mirage or try to become wealthy in the dreams.  
The reality is that love cannot be received if there is animosity in the heart. The reality is that the glitter of the stars is forgotten when the light of the sun is dawned. Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) is urging us to always remain focused and grounded. Make efforts in right direction. Remain anchored in the inner self to experience the true reality.

In this Gujarati bhajan,  
He is saying...  
Each and everyone comes to your door, O Divine Mother, asking for something or the other.  
Who to consider happy and who to count as happy.  
Everyone is suffering because of some or the other reason.  
They come to you only to talk about their grief, O Divine Mother.  
Holding hopes in their hearts, they all come to you.  
And, you fulfil their hopes, only when you feel in your heart.  
Not leaving greed from the heart and mind, they come to you.  
When they get tired running behind their own greed, then they look in your direction.  
When they are happy, then they do not come to you.  
When their illusion is broken, then the realization dawns upon.  
Holding fancies and ego in their hearts, they come to you.  
Knowing everything, you sit in silence then.  
Those who come to you with feelings of devotion,  
You not wait, you embrace then right away.  
Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) is explaining and shedding light on the fact that all of us, devotees of Divine, pray to Divine asking for only desires and demands to be fulfilled by the Almighty. Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) is urging us to pray and worship with intense emotions of devotion and love. When we reach out to God, it should be only to feel the Divine connection, and not for fulfilling our wishes and fancies created by us only, in our hearts and mind.

I don't even use the banks anymore to get my loans but the gas fees have been crazy.

I understand that L2 -&gt; Polygon (Matic) is already implemented however, as an Ethereum OG, I understand the lack of security side chains like Polygon can't overcome easily.

Anyone have any idea of Ethereum native L2s like Arbitrum, ZkSync, or Optimisim being implemented on major Defi Apps such as Aave or Compound? Also for centralized exchanges such as Coinbase adding direct support for Ethereum L2s?

rbo3ws,klevioza,"Maut Toh Aave Vahelo Modu, Na De Koi Aene Re Tedu"," 

In this Gujarati bhajan, he is shedding light on the ultimate truth of life,  
He is saying...  
Death definitely comes either early or late, though no one actually calls for it.  
It is the call of a creator, it comes either early or late.  
It is a big part of this universe, it doesn‚Äôt leave anyone.  
It doesn‚Äôt differentiate between right and wrong, it embraces each and everyone.  
It falls upon each and everyone, and few courageous ones actually welcome it.  
Even though, many boast about it, but get scared while embracing it.  
Whoever has taken birth in this world, they are embraced by it as well.  
It hasn‚Äôt differentiate anyone, it is the weapon of the creator of this universe.  
For those who are tired and defeated, it becomes a golden opportunity.  
No one is saved from it, death comes either early or late.  
Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) is explaining about the fundamental phenomenon of life, that is death. The birth and the death are the two points in the line of infinite. It‚Äôs The Divinity that has given expression to this physical dimension, and it knows when this physical dimension will end. Everybody knows in their heart that they will die one day. Yet, as we are ill prepared, and there is fear and confusion. Kaka (Satguru Devendra Ghia) is urging us to see how life occurs in a flow and enjoy each and every moment of it. And, infuse liberating wisdom about death in our inner self.

rbdsfj,bitcoinbuzzing,Koinly and Aave,"Hi guys!

I am working through my taxes right now and I have played with DeFi protocols last year (Aave/Compound/Balancer etc.,), however I am a little stuck about how to actually add correctly taxable entries into Koinly in respect to lending.

&amp;#x200B;

**An example:**

* Added 1,000 USDC to Aave's lending pool and receive 1,000 aUSDC back.
* After 1 year at 5% APY, I have generated 50 USDC (aUSDC before claiming)
* I claim my interest by removing my liquidity from the pool and receive 1,050 USDC back

How do I approach adding this into Koinly? I have watched a bunch of their guides but haven't seen a concrete example on how to actually add something like this in.",2021-12-08 08:27:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/koinly/comments/rbdsfj/koinly_and_aave/

r8nmvj,vaccine_question69,Why did USDT deposit APY shot to 70% on Polygon AAVE?,"APY rising means that the amount of USDT in the pool is decreasing. Why is this happening?

The reason I'm confused is that I'd expect the opposite to happen. Given that USDT can't be used as collateral on AAVE, you can either:
1. Deposit it.
2. Deposit e.g. WBTC and borrow USDT.

r7c8um,Aerocryptic,Aave + Curve,"Hi Horde

I thought it would be interesting to share my experience on some reliable defi investments. Nothing fancy with some crazy APYs, just some reliable investment from some of the safest defi places around here : Aave and Curve.

I began to use these defi in march when i took some profit in stablecoins. I began on Polygon that had some really nice rewards at that time. Nowadays i mostly use Avalanche, same defi plays, just different networks and rewards.

On Avalanche i have deposited half of my Avax on Aave :

[Aave rewards on Avalanche](https://preview.redd.it/4my3uvfit5381.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68dff91e077e686986ea665937a81e6ae2f74c74)

As you can see avax is rewarded 12% on deposits which is slightly better than the staking rewards (but also a bit riskier). But what is interesting is that i can use this deposit as a collateral to borrow some stablecoins. Most of the stablecoins will cost you around 2% at the moment if you want to borrow some (1st line is the cost of borrowing, 2nd line is the reward for using the service).

I only borrow around 40% of my limit to avoid any liquidation and the pain to monitor constantly my holdings. 

These stablecoins are then deposited on Curve on 2 pools : the Aave pool (100% stablecoins) and Atricrypto (stablecoins + eth + btc). I obviously bridged some eth and btc to use the atricrypto pool.

[Curve pools](https://preview.redd.it/4sl1qogku5381.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09bf5d6d691227260fcd734922a5ed0af1b6e30c)

The atricrypto pool is 1/3 stablecoins, 1/3 eth, 1/3 btc in $ value. You could suffer from impermanent loss on this pool but less than a LP pair with a 50/50 spread.

These investments reward me in avax (mostly) that i deposit in Aave, upgrading everytime my borrowing limits.",2021-12-03 01:16:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoHorde/comments/r7c8um/aave_curve/

r6v4gl,fragmynt,"Synthetic Markets built on Polygon. Trade on any asset class without leaving the blockchain, or earn staking rewards that are always better than AAVE. Tier-1 VC funded!","**Who are we?**  
Through [Fragmynt](https://fragmynt.com), individuals from around the world will be able to trade on any asset class, from traditional assets such as stocks, commodities and real estate, to novel assets such as event contracts, human capital and artwork, all from the same platform and without ever leaving the blockchain.

We bring the goals of many DeFi projects such as Synthetix, Uma, Mirror, Polymarket, Augur etc. under one roof with one architecture.

**How does it work?**  
Through the use of liquidity pools we allow anyone to create what we call ""Synthetic Markets"". These markets can be created on any stock, commodity, person, event, asset, object, or anything else you can imagine, whether it has a spot market or not. The markets allow two types of participants, collateral providers (CPs) and traders.

CPs can create a synthetic market on anything by deciding on an entity (e.g. Christiano Ronaldo, Tesla, Sweden's Happiness Index) and providing collateral (stablecoin) to one side of a liquidity pool while tokens representing the entity are automatically generated by the protocol on the other side. CPs earn 0.3% of every trade on the pool for providing a market to traders.

Traders can go long by depositing stablecoin into one half of the pool and receiving token from the pool in exchange. Shorters lock a margin which mints a new token they can sell into the pool and receive stablecoin.

**What does this mean?**  
Perhaps the most significant difference is that these markets are oracleless. They are entirely self contained within the liquidity pool. This makes them more secure as they don't need to rely on an external mechanism for pricing. It also means that the markets can trade 24/7/365. The final advantage is that this system allows markets to be created on any asset, whether it has a spot market or not. Rather than trying to replicate existing markets on the blockchain, we are creating direct competitors.

Natural incentives encourage CPs to provide collateral to the most popular pools with traders, which in turn attracts traders due to more favorable market conditions (e.g. lower sensitivity to individual trades, more accurate pricing)

Additionally, rather than leaving the collateral idle in the pools, it is instead staked in AAVE, earning the collateral providers an additional return. This means that providing collateral to active markets on Fragmynt is **always** better than just yield farming.

**Why do we exist?**  
The world's current financial system is disjointed due to regulatory collision between states, nuisance bureaucracy and wealth inequality. Even the DeFi landscape is disjointed, many projects exist but they only tackle part of the problem and all are built on different chains using different protocols adding to the problem. Crypto has created entirely self contained monetary systems that are accessible to everyone and unassailable from the outside. We are doing the same for financial markets.

r6flmw,GapFresh6000,AAVE borrowing + DeFi Wallet Staking question," So, I could do this??

# Right now:

1. Buy 4.25 ETH,  (20K USD), minus fees
2. Connect wallet to AAVE, and use the 4.25 ETH as collateral to borrow 2.125 ETH (10K USD) at 3.43 APY (Stable Borrow), on a 3 year term
3. Send borrowed ETH to Defi wallet, minus fees
4. Swap borrwed ETH to CRO, minus fees
5. Stake CRO at 12.5% P.A.
6. Every 3 months for the next 3 years, re-invest Staked rewards to Compound Interest Quarterly

# In 3 years:

1. Staked CRO becomes $14,466.64 (Could be more or less depending on the value of CRO)
2. Swap CRO back to ETH, minus fees
3. Pay Principle + Interest on loan, totaling $10,529.19

# Estimated Results:

* $3,937.45 in profit was made from Staked CRO on Defi, minus all the fees along the way
* 4.25 ETH that was used as collateral is returned to you, and is likely worth more than initial 20k USD after 3 years

r52wih,heinaga1989,Is AAVE essentially PAYING you to take out a loan?? (polygon),"Today I learned that in AAVE, your collateral STILL earns interest even after you take out a loan. So what if I did this?:

1. Deposit $1,000 USDC and earn 3.28% + 1.61% MATIC reward. (Is that 4.89% interest total?)
2. Borrow $800 NEW USDC AGAINST the original USDC and pay the APR of 4.07% BUT get rewarded 2.68% MATIC on the 800 loan. So wouldn't that bring the rate down to 1.39% on the 800 loan?
3. Redeposit the $800 USDC and earn 3.28%+1.61% MATIC reward.

He is saying...  
Divine Mother comes with welcoming hands, let us walk two steps with her, by becoming her child in true sense and not by staying sad.  
Happy child is liked by everyone, specially liked by Divine Mother herself.  
In sorrow and sadness, everyone runs away, only Divine Mother comes closer.  
Devils and humans, all of them come to her. Divine Mother calls everyone to her.  
She welcomes everyone with open arms, not looking at any caste or creed.  
She doesn‚Äôt leave anyone alone, she always walks with them.  
Take support of Divine Mother, you will never be disappointed.  
She will never disappoint you, she will always remain close to you.  
Leave looking for her anywhere else, just look for her inside you.  
Kaka is narrating that Divine Mother is just waiting to be acknowledged. Kaka is expressing her pur love for every single child of hers irrespective of caste or creed. Divine Mother showers same grace upon everyone, we are the ones not able to receive it because of our ignorance. Kaka is urging us to connect with divinity which is existing within us.

on sushi it's saying that you can earn around 31% so I for sure would like to set up a nice passive income machine to cover my living expenses.

I don't expect it to be 31% forever but what's the lowest I can expect this to drop?

What were your thoughts on this situation?

(Disclaimer: below is all just my opinion, I‚Äôm aware this doesn‚Äôt apply to just Kpop, I‚Äôm aware idols lie/ have to lie about many things and have to pretend to have certain personalities or whatever. I know Kpop is very manufactured and that this is just another thing under that.)

What I want to mainly highlight is the wanting to be a Kpop idol part:

‚ÄúTwo, Keeho had posted various vague insinuations that he'd been attempting auditions on twitter (""y'all jus need to know if i deactivate and y'all see me on tv all of a sudden don't question me that's a whole other person"") and on curiouscat (Q: ""are you actually planning on to be a kpop idol"" A: ""yes im auditioning to sm next month"").‚Äù

I am thinking of many different idols here but a lot of idols who are revealed to be from very wealthy backgrounds‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt always that talented and I find it hard to believe that they simply passed an audition without use of a company connection. (I know, nothing new)

I mean hey if I were to have those connections to whatever career I wanted I‚Äôd probably use them too. It‚Äôs just sometimes hard to believe that some rich kid that doesn‚Äôt bring much to the table (in terms of idol talent at least), just so happened to get in through an audition alone when it‚Äôs said to be very difficult (especially the international auditions).

r1yedk,Set1Less,Next wave of crypto: Connecting crypto with real world assets =&gt; AAVE + Centrifuge,"Right now, crypto is a completely self sufficient economy and apart from few places like El Salvador where its totally legal and treated as currency, rest of the world just doesnt treat crypto as cash/currency and to deploy your crypto, you need to jump through hoops like take out a loan or trade crypto for cash, withdraw it from an exchange etc. 

However crypto has continued to grow, and reached a 2 trillion mcap asset. There is a lot of capital in this market, but due to terrible and unfriendly regulations promoted by bureaucrats and dinosaur politicians,  this market is stifled to an extent. A lot of that $1 trillion is stranded with no other place to go. 

But what if you can start using crypto to fund real world companies? What if a company that operates in a real world market raises funds from crypto users? This bridges real world assets and the crypto economy. 

Lets say a legit company that operates in a market (for example a bank or a fintech startup or a logistic company) raises funds via crypto deposits, and pays interest back to crypto holders? Traditionally, these companies would require funding which is provided by VCs and seed investors. This involves multiple loops and is always closed for general public. But crypto enables average users to participate in this economy. 

Aave + Centrifuge has built the technology/compliance stack that allows crypto users to start bridging the gap between crypto and real world assets.

Most of this cycle's events are zero or negative sum games - NFTs, farming, liquidity mining etc. There is some money to be made there, but it's hard to see any of this integrate with the real world economy. 

The next crypto wave is going to be all about how the trillion dollars trapped in this secluded crypto economy find their way into various companies across the world that have cash flows and revenue from their operations, thus giving crypto a bridge to the real world economy.",2021-11-25 23:00:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r1yedk/next_wave_of_crypto_connecting_crypto_with_real/

Back in May/Jun, I was playing around with some yield farming on the the Matic Network. But I ran into a bit of a problem. I have just over 180Matic deposited in Aave rn, but I don't have enough funds in my Metamask to withdraw. 

If I'm understanding correctly, I would have to buy on Ethereal Mainnet and bridge it to Polygon in order to get the necessary 0.0017 Matic required to withdraw, correct? That's nearly my whole worth just in gas fees if I'm calculating the current costs correctly.

In this Gujarati bhajan on self realisation,  
He is saying...  
You will accumulate a lot in this world for the physical body (gross existence), but nothing will come with you.  
Selfless deeds will only remain in your hands in the end.  
You come alone, and with closed fists, when you come in this world.  
You are not even aware of what will happen to you the next moment.  
There is no end of yours, only you will remain in the end.  
Going and coming of yours will never stop (rebirths) till you do not become aware from within.  
You have received unstable physical body to become aware from within.  
Utilise your body for true purpose, don‚Äôt engage your mind in your body.  
Forget about this world, forget about this body, just concentrate your mind with your inner being.  
When you will realise about true self, you will find the whole world inside you.  
Kaka is explaining that our physical body, mind and intellect are outer layers enveloping the inner self, the true self. Our identification with impermanent outer components of our being is leading us to the never ending cycle of births. Kaka is urging us to use our physical body, mind and intellect as medium to reach our true inner self, and to use them as tools to attain the final goal of self realization.

In this Gujarati devotional bhajan, he is guiding to us in the direction of actual Power if the Divine.  
He is saying...  
Cannot understand, and cannot comprehend, such things happen sometimes,  
Then, O Divine Mother, power of yours is understood.  
When a huge tree develops from a tiny seed,  
When enormous stars are seen floating in the sky without any support,  
Then, O Divine Mother, Power of yours is understood.  
When the whole world receives the sun light at a time,  
When in this inexhaustible ocean, the high and low tide alternates,  
Then, Power of yours, O Divine Mother, is understood.  
When the most powerful becomes helpless,  
When the killer and saviour unite together,  
Then, O Divine Mother, Power of yours is understood.  
When in salty surface, pure water ponds are found,  
When a person of no competence, becomes absolutely competent,  
Then, O Divine Mother, Power of yours is understood.  
You make even a speechless person to talk, ,  
You make visually challenged person to start seeing with you grace,  
You even make impaired person to climb the mountain,  
Then, O Divine Mother, Power of yours is understood.  
Kaka is explaining that the Divine Mother is the Powerhouse of energy, strength and stability.  
Many times in our lives, things beyond logic, incomprehensible things happen, that hold us in complete astonishment. Such things happen only because of the grace of Divine. Human mind is subject to limits and stunted vision, on the other hand Divine power is limitless, it is beyond logic, beyond human wisdom and beyond any boundaries. Kaka is urging us to acknowledge the presence of Divine Power in our lives, which actually transforms our life in order.

qzjb3g,klevioza,"Thai Hoye Bhale Mulakat Ek Din, Yaad Aave Jivanma Ae Toh Kadi","In this Gujarati bhajan, he is directing us to look beyond the obvious and reflect on it.  
He is saying...  
Even if you meet someone only once, you remember that someone sometime in life.  
Remembering you, O Divine Mother, so, I must have met you too sometime.  
I have never doubted my existence in life,  
Why should I doubt your existence, O Divine Mother.  
In this world of visuals, you do not doubt anything,  
But, sometimes you get experience of unseen in this world.  
In life, emotions are not seen, but they are surely experienced.  
To remove the doubt, sometimes even unseen has become visible.  
Everything that is not understood, cannot become unacceptable,  
As you experience it, then it becomes acceptable immediately.  
Kaka is explaining that we all have tendency to believe in what we see to be the truth. But, many times, the truth is not just seen, it is experienced and felt by us. Our emotions are not seen, but the truth is that we experience emotions all the time. Similarly, we have not been able to see Almighty, but we have experienced the presence of God through our surroundings. Kaka is urging all spiritual seekers to see beyond the visuals and open the heart to the level of comprehending something which is beyond our understanding at the moment. Explore the unseen, experience the unseen and reflect on the experience of the unseen in mind and heart.

the 'racist man' mentioned is Fundy. People seem to be mad that she reduced the 'racism' they were talking about to just some twitter drama.  


there was also this tweet about Billzo that was pinned in the space at the end :  https://twitter.com/bratthebeloved/status/1459302879269957633?s=20   


I'm going to be honest, I'm not American, and I have never heard of AAVE till I joined this fandom, and am honestly still very unclear of what it is exactly.

qvbnwe,india-inc,New caseload has goals targeting AAVE?,"I recently started at a school district in the south (serving K-12) with a high population of black students. I noticed that I have a lot of students with artic goals even in high school, which is weird. The last time I worked with high schoolers (in the northwest), I didn't have many artic cases because their speech no longer had academic impact/they didn't want to work on it/it got remediated by that age/etc. I decided to brush up on my knowledge of AAVE, and found that I have students whose goals seem to be targeting aspects of their AAVE (in particular, vocalic r, th, consonant cluster reduction). I also have some students with syntax goals that might be targeting grammatical aspects of AAVE as well. Because they seem to have a language difference, not a disorder, it's not appropriate for me to be working on goals to change their dialect. 

Now my next step is doing something about it. (Easier said than done)

With over 60 students, I can't go write an amendment for each one right now, so I'll wait until their annual IEP to change their goals. The problem is the kids who should be discharged because they only have goals targeting their AAVE. The way my district handles evaluations is weird and not easy. Only specific assessment SLPs can do the testing, I don't even have access to the tests. Also, they don't usually assess on the triennial year?? Which seems like something that shouldn't be allowed but apparently is? Basically they ask the parents if they want to waive their right to an eval and all the parents say yes. At my previous districts, we always did a full battery and report every 3 years like clockwork. But now I have kids whose last eval was like 6 years ago or more. I'm also a contractor with no real supervisor and I feel like nobody tells my anything half the time, I don't even know how or who to contact to get the ball rolling.

Essentially what I'm saying is there are lots of roadblocks to me actually getting an eval in order to discharge the students who don't actually need speech. Very frustrating, and makes me want to throw up my hands/cry/quit.

Also: feeling conflicted about what to do for the kids with AAVE-targeted syntax goals. On one hand, what the tests perceive as grammatical ""errors"" are a normal part of their dialect, so I should just leave them alone, right? On the other hand, should I be teaching them the ""standard"" way so that they can learn how to code switch and use the ""correct"" grammar on their academic papers? Don't know which is the best and most culturally competent way to approach this.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense, typed it frantically in between sessions. Any insight is welcome!",2021-11-17 00:29:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/qvbnwe/new_caseload_has_goals_targeting_aave/

Oct, 2021,vincy@footprint.network

Data SourceÔºö[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/9819c526-4bc6-4b58-9f30-70ee2401994a/aave-vs-compound-dashboard)

Despite its platform being launched in just 2020, Aave (AAVE) outgrew its established competitor Compound (COMP) and multiplied its market cap eightfold within half a year. In an industry with plenty of fast ascents and precipitous falls, many wondered whether the platform had the staying power to remain a central institution in DeFi lending . 

Nearly 2 years later, Aave is still going span, especially in relation to its one-time close rival. 

This article will take a closer look at the two platform‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses and explain why Aave was able to overtake Compound.

**Aave and Compound TVL Compared**

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint AnalyticsÔºö TVL \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/f8h8p1ijfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e386bfc1aaac1af81fdf4debd7d4ebeab12c9eb)

As of Oct. 20, the DeFi market has surpassed $200 billion in total locked-in value (TVL) at $241.575 billion, with Aave‚Äôs TVL gaining the largest share at $18.89 billion. This is followed by lending protocols Curve ($18.01 billion), MakerDAO ($16.4 billion) and Compound ($12 billion).

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint AnalyticsÔºöLatest changes to the ranking of the top 10 TVL platforms](https://preview.redd.it/21c2ormkfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e549794d93469f3b1ecde9ecfe7db9213f8181d0)

In the lending space, Aave's TVL has been way ahead of Compound in the last six months. This can be attributed to its model, which is similar to traditional finance, and ability to operate in Financial Conduct Authority-encrypted assets.

**Comparison of Market Cap**

As of Oct. 20, Aave continues to dwarf Compound in the DeFi lending and borrowing industry with a market cap of over US$4 billion versus the latter‚Äôs $1.97 billion. 

There are two other metrics that indicate Aave‚Äôs span position in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint AnalyticsÔºöAave VS Compound Market Cap \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qw2ryvrlfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9b83cd712b4ec7e0fa662fedb20e3bcd508f6a)

First, its circulating supply of 82% is higher than Compound‚Äôs 61%, indicating less inflationary pressure. 

Second, Aave has not had any major security incidents, indicating better security mechanisms likely favoured by depositors. 

**Aave‚Äôs deposit volumes dominate**

Aave's deposit volume of approximately $21 billion has remained higher than Compound's estimated $18 billion. Compound previously went live with subsidised lending and mining (disguisedly raised deposit returns and lowered lending rates to compete with Aave). Today, Aave has turned to lending and mining, coupled with Polygon's deposit and lending subsidies. Compound's rate advantage has largely disappeared as a side-effect of Aave's ecosystem bargaining power.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint AnalyticsÔºöAave VS Compound Deposited Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/cvm50yumfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3905bf49ce749fca4785daefd1400a1a01dad643)

The Aave team continues to focus on innovation while being highly risk-aware, and adjusts the direction of the product in a timely manner when issues arise, making the platform more secure.

**Can Aave users lend out more assets than Compound?**

Data for the previous month shows that Aave's borrowing balance has levelled off above $8.2 billion per day, which is still higher than Compound‚Äôs borrowing balance of $5-7 billion, with little overall volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint AnalyticsÔºöAave vs Compound Borrowed Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/galyhuynfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b3d7e77bdc38d4b1511927b2aef32bd4c705db)

Aave supports a wider variety of tokens, allowing users to lend out more assets and have more liquidity available. Some of Aave's rate agreements are also considered more innovative and have some advantages over Compound, such as unsecured flash loans, rate swaps and line of credit mandates. But on the downside, it comes with relatively high lending rates and loan fees.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Footprint AnalyticsÔºöAave's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/7zmxrlxofpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f2ac0af00f9ad43ef9485bf6b65715a40967d1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint AnalyticsÔºöCompound's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/jek2itypfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e505296989245dd7a1eb2a9e34e5da801f12932a)

Aave and Compound support a variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as DAI, USDC and USDT, and non-stablecoins such as WBTC and UNI. With Aave, users mainly pledge ETH to lend USDC, DAI and USDT.  With Compound, users pledge ETH to lend DAI and USDC. While the supply of DAI and USDC is about the same, the former has more demand than the latter.

It is also worth noting that  Aave is one of the few licensed projects and is freely convertible in the United Kingdom.

**Differences in liquidation**

There are currently two traditional liquidation methods: the auction format of MakerDao and the liquidation method of Aave and Compound, which operate on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Compound sets a liquidation line of 75% as well as a borrowing rate that triggers liquidation when 100% is reached. However, only 50% of its assets will be liquidated. 

Aave, on the other hand, has a 5% safety cushion, mitigates risk, especially for new users.

Note: While the two liquidation methods have some efficiency issues, Liquity is a more innovative liquidation mechanism that differs from the traditional methods of MakerDao, Aave and Compound, as discussed in the article [Footprint: Can Liquity's mechanism really catch up from behind?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyTQi_HplDLXmXx7E9s-EEsqu32HrJxdCbCK66COCKM/edit#heading=h.lgi4s1f3dx3m) 

**Conclusion**

In summary, Aave continues its dominance over Compound, mainly due to  the following points:

* Aave has been more aggressive in innovation and business expansion, having more types of tokens released on its platform and gaining relative traction on unsecured flash lending, automated market makers, line of credit mandates, and with the traditional finance industry.
* On 19 October 2021, Aave TVL hit an all-time high that was made possible by the team behind the company whose focus is on safety, risk management and product strategy.
* Aave has progressed much  faster in terms of compliance to mitigate risk.

qt7rjd,rapdogmon,Half of the Internet Slang You Use Is AAVE,"Title is exaggerated before people ask for sources.  My point being that a lot of y‚Äôall use AAVE thinking it was just ‚Äúfunny‚Äù internet slang.  As someone who‚Äôs been on the internet for a long time I also thought this.

Now this is likely because AAVE is becoming a popular dialect (much to black peoples chagrin).  A direction like derived from the popularity of black music (rap and R&amp;B).  As well as an idolization of certain aspects of black culture.  Words like: ‚Äúbae‚Äù,  ‚Äúpop off‚Äù, ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, ‚Äúperiod‚Äù (specifically certain inflections given to this one), and ‚Äútea‚Äù all have their roots in black culture.  There‚Äôs other words that I can‚Äôt recall of the top of my head either because they even become so engrained into how many or speak we may not even notice it.

That‚Äôs how popular dialects tend to work.  It‚Äôs why they often prevail over prestige dialects.  

Now the debate on whether it‚Äôs racist or not is pretty complex and I‚Äôm not black so I won‚Äôt get into it.  My point is that some of y‚Äôall here really aren‚Äôt aware of how prevalent it is in your own vocabulary much less the vocab of our favorite streamers.

In my opinion, disregarding the debate mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs not something to be penalized to the fullest extent.  If only because most black people are not looking to penalize you.  The issue usually arises when someone adopts a ‚Äúblack personality‚Äù (offend founded on stereotypes of a black person).  I like to use the ‚Äúhabitual be‚Äù in my personal conversations and often give much praise to it as a grammatical function.  As a linguist I find it both remarkable and also enjoyable to use.  ‚ÄúIt be like that‚Äù.  It‚Äôs function is to mark habitual situations.  If you are a teacher someone may say, ‚Äúhe be teaching‚Äù.

Sorry that was an excuse to talk about my one of my favorite subjects.  Point is: AAVE is for more prevalent in internet culture than some of you realize.",2021-11-14 03:01:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamWasTaken2/comments/qt7rjd/half_of_the_internet_slang_you_use_is_aave/

qrz244,soulsoar11,Why is it called AAVE and not BAVE or BVE?,"(for those who aren't aware) AAVE, or African-American Vernacular English is a dialect/sociolect/whatever you wanna call it pattern of speech with features that unite black English speakers across North America, and is responsible for a lot of 21st century slang, internet vernacular, and has a lot of stigma around it, sometimes even just being called 'broken English.' I don't want to push back against any of the harsh realities about that stigma, the ugly history of race in my country. 

My question is this: it is my general and pretty ignorant understanding that most people of color in America don't prefer to identify as African Americans, and the more simple term Black seems to be more popular nowadays.

qrn2wh,heinaga1989,Collateral on Aave still earns interest?,"Hi all,

On many platforms like Celsius, if you want to borrow against your collateral, your collateral won't earn interest anymore.

But   I heard the other day that your collateral does earn interest on Aave.    Is it true?  I read the docs and nowhere did it say that the  collateral  does NOT earn interest, so maybe it does earn interest?

If  it does, why would Aave allow this?  They need my collateral in case  whatever I borrowed goes down in value.  So if they pay me on my  collateral, they would need to somehow make money off of my collateral  as well, which means they would be rehypothecating?  I would imagine  Aave doesn't rehypothecate...

Any help appreciated,

qq206m,pongvin,Hitelpiacok a blockchainen (Credit markets - Aave/Compound etc),"Egy [el≈ëz≈ë posztban](https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qowhf9/liquidity_pools_automated_constant_product_market/) a liquidity pool -okr√≥l √≠rtam, amikkel tetsz≈ëleges tokent lehet cser√©lni m√°sik fajt√°ra. Ebben a posztban egy m√°sik p√©nz√ºgyi 'primit√≠vr≈ël' lesz sz√≥: a hitelpiac protokollokr√≥l. Az√©rt h√≠vom ≈ëket primit√≠vnek, mert ezeknek az eszk√∂z√∂knek a haszn√°lat√°val komplexebb p√©nz√ºgyi konstrukci√≥kat lehet l√©trehozni - p√©ld√°ul sz√°rmaztatott vagy szintetikus '√©rt√©kpap√≠rokat' (derivatives/synthetics), t≈ëke√°tt√©tet (leverage), short/long poz√≠ci√≥kat √©s ilyesmiket. Ezekr≈ël m√©g lesz sz√≥ k√©s≈ëbbi posztokban is.

**A hitelpiacok √°ltal√°noss√°gban**

A hitelpiac egy gy≈±jt≈ëfogalom, √≠gy nevezz√ºk a kereskedelmi bankok √°ltal felaj√°nlott hitelopci√≥kat √©s a p√©nzpiaci szerepl≈ëk √∂sszess√©g√©t. Legyen az lak√°shitel, szem√©lyi k√∂lcs√∂n, aut√≥l√≠zing vagy egy√©b, mindnek van egy k√∂z√∂s tulajdons√°ga: a hitelez≈ë banknak sz√ºks√©ge van biztos√≠t√©kra, hogy a hitelezett vissza fogja fizetni az ad√≥ss√°got kamatostul. Ezt a biztos√≠t√©kot fedezetnek (collateral -nak) h√≠vj√°k, √©s tradicion√°lisan nagyon sokf√©le lehet. Hogyha a hitelez≈ë nem tudja visszafizetni a hitelt, akkor a bank jogosult behajtani a hi√°nyt, p√©ld√°ul a fedezet elad√°s√°val. Lak√°shitel eset√©n tipikusan a lak√°s maga a fedezet j√≥ r√©sze. Ha fizet√©sk√©ptelen lesz az ad√≥s, akkor a bank eladja a lak√°st, hogy abb√≥l p√≥tolja a hi√°ny√°t. Nem felt√©tlen kell mindig likvidnek (eladhat√≥nak) lennie a fedezetnek: szem√©lyi k√∂lcs√∂n eset√©n p√©ld√°ul a 'fedezet' az ad√≥s munkaszerz≈ëd√©se (fizet√©se) is lehet. Itt magasabb kock√°zatot v√°llal a hitelez≈ë bank, mert a fedezet illikvid √©s megsz≈±nhet.

Mivel valamekkora kock√°zat mindig terheli a hitelez≈ët (hogy az ad√≥s fizet√©sk√©ptelenn√© v√°lik), a hitelez≈ë kamatot sz√°mol a hitelre, hogy kompenz√°lja a rizik√≥t. K√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë t√≠pus√∫ hitelekn√©l k√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë kamatot sz√°mol a bank a rizik√≥ alapj√°n, valamint a k√∂zponti jegybank alapkamata is ad egy minimum kamatot, amit musz√°j belesz√°m√≠taniuk (hogy profit√°bilisak maradjanak). Ez az alapkamat √°tt√©telesen az √°ltal√°nos *hitelig√©nyt≈ël* f√ºgg: ha nagyon sokan akarnak hitelt (t√∫l k√∂nny≈± hitelhez jutni), akkor az infl√°ci√≥ ellens√∫lyoz√°s√°ra a jegybank alapkamatot emel. Ha be akarja p√∂rgetni a gazdas√°got, akkor alapkamatot cs√∂kkent.

Nagyon leegyszer≈±s√≠tve a modern fiat p√©nznek ez a k√∂rforg√°sa: a jegybank l√©trehozza a p√©nzt, kihitelezi a kereskedelmi bankoknak az alapkamat√©rt, akik tov√°bbhitelezik a c√©geknek nagyobb kamat√©rt, akik kifizetik a dolgoz√≥knak, akik a fizet√©st felhaszn√°lva tov√°bbi hitelhez juthatnak a kereskedelmi bankokt√≥l (mondjuk c√©get alap√≠tani vagy lak√°st venni), vagy fel√©lik √©s vesznek m√°s dolgoz√≥t√≥l/c√©gt≈ël kaj√°t. A visszafizet√©s hasonl√≥ √∫ton t√∂rt√©nik (csak visszafel√©). A rendszer az√©rt m≈±k√∂dik, mert a hitelb≈ël *t√∂bb* val√≥s √©rt√©ket tudnak teremteni a c√©gek √©s a dolgoz√≥ik, mint ami a hitel √©s a kamata. Kamat n√©lk√ºl viszont az eg√©sz rendszer borul, mert hitelez√©sn√©l mindig van kock√°zat, amit kompenz√°lni kell. Valamekkora %-a a hitelezetteknek mindig fizet√©sk√©ptelen lesz.

Ebb≈ël a k√∂rforg√°sb√≥l viszont l√°tjuk, a kereskedelmi bankok szerepe nem egy elm√©leti k√∂vetelm√©ny, hanem praktikus. Ak√°r lehetne, hogy a c√©gek √©s mag√°nszem√©lyek k√∂zvetlen a jegybankt√≥l k√©rjenek hitelt, kiv√°gva ezzel a k√∂zvet√≠t≈ë bankokat. Viszont a jegybanknak nincs kapacit√°sa arra hogy J√≥skapista d√≠szt√∂k c√©ge kock√°zatfaktor√°t elemezze √©s meg√°llap√≠tsa a kamatot, ez√©rt ezt kiszervezi a k√∂zvet√≠t≈ë kereskedelmi bankoknak. A bankok dolgoz√≥it √©s infrastruktur√°j√°t pedig meg kell fizetni √∫gy, hogy alapkamatn√°l nagyobb kamatot kell fizetn√ºnk hitelfelv√©telkor. Sokkal jobb akkor sem felt√©tlen lenne a helyzet, hogyha a jegybank beolvasztan√° mag√°ba az √∂sszes kereskedelmi bankot, mert akkor n√°luk lenne t√∂bb dolgoz√≥ meg infrastrukt√∫ra, amit ugyan √∫gy meg kellene fizetni. L√©nyegesen olcs√≥bb√° √∫gy lehet tenni a p√©nzpiacot, hogyha hat√©konyabb az infrastrukt√∫ra, √©s/vagy kevesebb a dolgoz√≥. A blockchainen m≈±k√∂d≈ë DeFi protokollok ezt a hat√©konys√°gemel√©st akarj√°k el√©rni. √âs nagyon √∫gy t≈±nik, hogy sikeresen.

**Blockchaines hitelpiacok**

A p√©nz k√∂rforg√°s√°nak most egy bizonyos alk√∂r√©re fogok f√≥kusz√°lni: a kereskedelmi bankok √©s a hitelezettek kapcsolat√°ra, √©s hogy ez hogy van a blockchainen reprezent√°lva. A p√©nz sz√ºlet√©se m√°sik t√©ma, ezzel kapcsolatban √≠rtam r√©gebben a [Maker](https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qhpnjv/makermakerdao_protokoll_%C3%B6sszefoglal%C3%B3_defi/) \-r≈ël, mint egy 'jegybank' p√©lda. De ide tartozik a blockchain nat√≠v tokenj√©nek a kibocs√°t√°sa is, amit a b√°ny√°szok/stakerek kapnak a blockchain √ºzemeltet√©s√©√©rt cser√©be.

L√©teznek blockchainen fut√≥ hitelez≈ë (lending) platformok mint az Aave √©s a Compound. Ezek emberi beavatkoz√°s n√©lk√ºl (*is*) m≈±k√∂d≈ë platformok, amikt≈ël k√∂lcs√∂n lehet venni bizonyos tokeneket, fedezet√©rt cser√©be.

Elt√©r≈ëen a tradicion√°lis p√©nzint√©zetekt≈ël, ezek a lending platformok sokkal kevesebb t√≠pus√∫ fedezetet fogadnak el. Ez az√©rt van, mert bizonyos fedezett√≠pusok √©rt√©ke nehezen √©rtelmezhet≈ë, nincs reprezent√°lva a blockchainen, vagy t√∫l instabil. P√©ld√°ul ameddig az ingatlan tulajdoni lapok nincsenek valahogy reprezent√°lva tokeniz√°lt form√°ban, addig a lending platformok nem tudj√°k az ingatlan tulajdonl√°st √©rtelmezni, √©s emiatt nem is haszn√°lhat√≥k fedezetk√©nt. √âpp ez√©rt kiz√°r√≥lag olyan fedezetet fogadnak el jelenleg, amiknek val√≥s id≈ëben automatikusan meg lehet √°llap√≠tani az √©rt√©k√©t: ERC-20 √©s ekvivalens tokenekek (USDC, Dai, USDT etc), valamint blockchain nat√≠v tokenek (ETH, BNB). 'Art' NFT-ket √©s random shitcoinokat is lehetne haszn√°lni elm√©letileg, de t√∫l instabil az √°ruk.

**Az Aave platform**

M≈±k√∂d√©s√©t tekintve nagyon egyszer≈±. Van egy token lista, amikb≈ël le lehet k√∂tni a protokollba ak√°rmennyit, hogy kamatozzon. A token list√°t az Aave governance token tulajdonosai (az Aave korm√°nyzata) hat√°rozz√°k meg, mindenf√©le rizik√≥szempontok alapj√°n. A r√©szletekbe nem megyek bele, most el√©g annyi hogy szavaz√°s alapj√°n b≈ëv√≠thet≈ë vagy sz≈±k√≠thet≈ë a lista ([itt olvashat√≥](https://docs.aave.com/faq/governance) r√≥la t√∂bb info).

Aki lek√∂t (deposit) a protokollba tokent, ≈ë lesz a hitelez≈ë (lender). M√°sok k√∂lcs√∂n vehetik ezeket a tokeneket, akkor, hogyha ≈ëk maguk is lek√∂t√∂ttek a protokollba valamilyen tokent, ami fedezetk√©nt (is) funkcion√°l. Am√≠g van akt√≠v k√∂lcs√∂n, addig a fedezetet nem lehet kivenni a protokollb√≥l. Ha a k√∂lcs√∂n kamatostul visszafizet√©sre ker√ºl, akkor √∫jra ki lehet venni a teljes depositot. A tokenek gyorsan v√°ltoz√≥ √°rfolyama miatt az √∂sszes lending platform jelenleg jelent≈ës *t√∫lfedezetet* k√∂vetel, ami azt jelenti, hogy a fedezet √∂ssze√©rt√©k√©nek mindig t√∂bbnek kell lennie, mint a k√∂lcs√∂n√∂k √∂ssz√©rt√©k√©nek. L√°ssunk egy p√©ld√°t:

Mai √°rfolyamon 1 ETH 100 USD (val√≥s fiat USD). Ha lek√∂t√∂m ezt az 1 ETH-et, akkor max 80 USD-nyi m√°s tokent vehetek fel, mondjuk 80 USDC-t. Ez a 80 USDC amit felvettem, valaki m√°snak a deposit-j√°b√≥l sz√°rmazik. Az Aave automatikusan, val√≥s id≈ëben √°ll√≠tja a deposit kamatoz√°s√°t √©s a k√∂lcs√∂n kamat√°t az alapj√°n, hogy az adott token lek√∂t√©sei vs k√∂lcs√∂nv√©telei hogy ar√°nyulnak egym√°shoz √∂sszes√≠tve. Mindk√©t kamatt√≠pust √©vi lebont√°sban mutatja az Aave website frontend (e.g. h√°ny %-al lesz t√∂bb tokened egy √©v m√∫lva, ha nem v√°ltozik azid≈ëben a kamat  - APY: Annual Percentage Yield), viszont a kamat maga m√°sodpercenk√©nt √≠r√≥dik j√≥v√°. Hogyha kev√©s a szabad USDC deposit a protokollban, akkor magas lesz a kamata, ha sok, akkor kicsi. P√©ld√°ul hogyha √∂sszesen 90 USDC van lek√∂tve az Aave-ba, √©n pedig 80-at veszek fel, akkor nagyon magas hitelkamatot kell fizessek √©rte. Cser√©be aki lek√∂t USDC-t, az is magas deposit kamatot fog kapni r√°. A hitelezett fizeti meg a hitelez≈ë deposit kamat√°t, a borrow kamattal.

Egy √©rdekess√©ge ezeknek a platformoknak, hogy a deposit *mindig* kamatozik, akkor is, ha van r√°terhelve k√∂lcs√∂n. Hogyha m√°s tokent k√∂t le az ember, mint amit felvesz ellene, akkor elm√©letileg el≈ëfordulhat olyan, hogy a deposit kamat magasabb mint a borrow kamat. Ritka de megesik, √©s ez m√©g jobb mint az ingyenhitel!

**Fizet√©sk√©ptelens√©g, felsz√°mol√°si elj√°r√°s, protokoll deficit**

Ez a r√©sze a protokollnak nagyon hasonl√≥, mint a Maker-√©. [Ebben a posztban](https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qhpnjv/makermakerdao_protokoll_%C3%B6sszefoglal%C3%B3_defi/) √≠rtam r√≥la a ' Vault liquidation (Vault felsz√°mol√°si elj√°r√°s)' szekci√≥ban. A l√©nyeg, hogyha a fedezet √∂ssz√©rt√©ke lecs√∂kken a k√∂lcs√∂n \~70%-80% -a al√° (val√≥s fiat USD-ben m√©rve, a % pedig a deposit tokent≈ël f√ºgg), akkor az Aave el√°rverezi a fedezetet, az √°rver√©s nyertese visszafizeti a k√∂lcs√∂nt a fizet√©sk√©ptelen hitelezett hely√©ben, √©s megtart bel≈ële profitot. Ha ez nem fedezn√© a teljes k√∂lcs√∂nt, akkor a protokoll deficites. Ilyenkor a deficitet p√≥tolja az Aave automatikusan az √∫gynevezett Ecosystem Reserve-j√©b≈ël. Ezt√≥bbiba pedig √∫gy ker√ºl √©rt√©k, hogy a borrow kamat az ugyan ahhoz a tokenhez tartoz√≥ deposit kamatn√°l mindig nagyobb - a k√ºl√∂nbs√©g egy r√©sze a Reserve-be megy. K√∂zvetve az Aave governance token birtokosai fedezik a deficitet ilyen esetben, hasonl√≥an mint a Makern√©l. [T√∂bb info itt](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module).

Fontos megjegyezni, hogy ezeknek a hiteleknek **nincs futamideje**, mert nem sz√ºks√©ges hogy legyen. Egyed√ºl az sz√°m√≠t, hogy a deposit √∂ssz√©rt√©ke mindig nagyobb maradjon, mint a k√∂lcs√∂n √∂ssz√©rt√©ke. Ha k√∂lcs√∂n vesz valaki valamit √©s elfelejti, akkor a borrow kamat miatt egy id≈ë ut√°n felsz√°mol√°si elj√°r√°s al√° ker√ºl. Ezt √©rdemes elker√ºlni, mert bukik rajta az ember 5%-10% -ot, ha el√°rverez≈ëdik a deposit. Oda kell viszont figyelni, mert mivel a kamatok is val√≥s id≈ëben v√°ltoznak, el≈ëfordulhat olyan eset, hogy hirtelen az egekbe sz√∂knek: p√©ld√°ul a depositorok elkezdik kivinni a protokollb√≥l a tokeneket, de a hitelezettek k√©s≈ën kapcsolnak hogy vissza k√©ne fizetni. [T√∂rt√©nt ilyen nemr√©g](https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qigg69/aave_stablecoin_likvidit%C3%A1si_hi%C3%A1ny/).

**Ad√≥optimaliz√°l√°s**: Ha valaki haszn√°lni akarja a tokenjei √©rt√©k√©t, egyik opci√≥ hogy eladja ≈ëket igazi p√©nz√©rt, de ez ad√≥k√∂teles lehet. Ehelyett √©rdemes lehet lek√∂tni √©s stablecoint (pl USDC) felvenni az √©rt√©k√©√©rt cser√©be, √©s azt √°tv√°ltani igazi p√©nzre. Egy√©bk√©nt a csilli√°rdosok mint Bezos √≠gy ker√ºlik el az ad√≥fizet√©st, csak nem cryptoval, hanem r√©szv√©nyekkel mint collateral √©s azokra terhelt k√∂lcs√∂n√∂kkel.

**T≈ëke√°tt√©tes short**: tegy√ºk fel, hogy arra sz√°m√≠tok, hogy a bitcoin √°ra stablecoinban cs√∂kkenni fog √©s profit√°lni akarok ebb≈ël. Azt kell tegyem ehhez, hogy:

\- lek√∂t√∂k valamit

\- felveszek Wrapped Bitcoin-t cser√©be

\- [eladom](https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qowhf9/liquidity_pools_automated_constant_product_market/) a Wrapped Bitcoin-t stablecoin√©rt

\- lek√∂t√∂m a kapott stablecoint is

\- m√©g felveszek az √∫j stablecoin deposit √©rt√©k√©√©rt WBTC-t, amit megint √°tv√°ltok stablecoinra, √©s √≠gy tov√°bb, ameddig el nem √©rem a k√≠v√°nt rizik√≥faktort (praktikusan max 2-3x lehet ezt a ciklust megcsin√°lni, ut√°na m√°r mikroszkopikus WBTC √°r emelked√©sre is felsz√°molhat√≥ leszek).

Amikor megfelel≈ë az √°rfolyam, apr√°nk√©nt kiveszegetem a stablecoin depositot, visszav√°s√°rolgatom a WBTC-t stablecoin√©rt, √©s visszafizetem az Aave-nak a WBTC-t. Ha cs√∂kkent a WBTC √°ra stablecoinban, akkor kevesebb stablecoint kell felhaszn√°ljak arra, hogy visszav√°s√°roljam a WBTC-t, teh√°t a profitom extra stablecoin. Ha viszont emelkedett az √°ra, akkor t√∂bb stablecoint kell felhaszn√°ljak hogy visszav√°s√°roljam a WBTC-t, teh√°t a vesztes√©gem valamennyi stablecoin.

**T≈ëke√°tt√©tes long**: megszorozhatom 2-3x az √°rfolyamv√°ltoz√°sb√≥l ad√≥d√≥ profitot (vagy a vesztes√©get) ezzel a m√≥dszerrel. P√©ld√°ul ha arra sz√°m√≠tok, hogy az ETH √°ra emelkedni fog stablecoinban, akkor ezt tehetem:

\- lek√∂t√∂k valamit

\- felveszek stablecoint

\- eladom a stablecoint ETH-√©rt

\- lek√∂t√∂m az √∫j ETH -et

\- m√©g felveszek az √∫j ETH deposit √©rt√©k√©√©rt stablecoint, amit megint eladok ETH-√©rt, amit megint lek√∂t√∂k √©s √≠gy tov√°bb. Hasonl√≥an ez el≈ëz≈ëh√∂z, nem lehet v√©gtelenszer megcsin√°lni ezt, mert egy id≈ë ut√°n m√°r nagyon pici ETH √°r cs√∂kken√©s is felsz√°molhat√≥v√° tesz.

Ha emelkedik az ETH √°ra stablecoinban, akkor kevesebb ETH-et kell felhaszn√°ljak arra, hogy visszav√°s√°roljam a felvett stablecoint, teh√°t a profitom extra ETH.

**V√©gsz√≥**

A fent eml√≠tett tranzakci√≥kat a layer 2-es Polygonon *t√∂red√©k centek√©rt* v√©gre lehet hajtani, a legnagyobb fee az eg√©szben a 0.3% swap fee, amikor tokent cser√©l√ºnk. A kamatok is *sokkal* jobbak, mint b√°rmelyik centraliz√°lt foly√≥sz√°ml√°n. Ennyit sz√°m√≠t a hat√©konys√°g √©s az automatiz√°ci√≥.

A DeFi-ben az a sz√©p, hogy az egyes decentraliz√°lt appok ugyan azon az adathalmazon √ºlnek (a blockchainen), √©s maxim√°lisan kompatibilisek egym√°ssal. Emiatt a k√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë p√©nz√ºgyi primit√≠vek haszn√°lat√°val p√©ld√°tlanul magas hat√©konys√°got √©s hozamokat lehet el√©rni, √©s innov√°ci√≥b√≥l is akad b≈ëven. A k√∂vetkez≈ë posztban egy √∫j √©s teljesen bizzar DeFi tal√°lm√°nyr√≥l lesz sz√≥, a **Flash Loan** \-r√≥l √©s a haszn√°lat√°r√≥l.",2021-11-09 19:50:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qq206m/hitelpiacok_a_blockchainen_credit_markets/

qpuymm,AmbientTextures,Financial Giant ING is working on a DeFi lending project - There's a good chance they are working with existing DeFi powerhouse AAVE.,"News has broken earlier today that financial heavyhitter ING has already developed a DeFi lending product and is going to be testing it soon. Super strange that a huge bank will be providing a service that will supposedly allows new businesses to participate in financial services disconnected from the current banking system. Either something is fishy, or ING realise that they can't compete and figure if they can't beat em (which they DeFinitely can't), better join them.

Earlier in the year when the whitepaper for this DeFi product was released, it explicitly mentioned AAVE, in which they praised the protocol.

I don't know about you, but I get the sense that regardless of how well this project will do, AAVE is criminally underpriced currently at $330 and is due for some serious action.

What are you thinking? Bullish on AAVE?",2021-11-09 11:42:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qpuymm/financial_giant_ing_is_working_on_a_defi_lending/

 Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Crypto lending has become one of DeFi's most promising use applications, ushering in an influx of dozens of platforms, tools, apps and participants all claiming to revolutionize how tokens are loaned and borrowed. 

According to Footprint, the number of platforms in the DeFi lending category grew by 263% to 69 since December 2020, setting a record TVL of $48.44 billion, accounting for 21.04% of all DeFi platforms and networks' entire TVL. 

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL of Different CategoriesData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/98d8thpk2qx71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e39b83f4fe0c7ca743b23e727f9bad2095a323b)

The most important lending platforms to have emerged are Aave, MakerDAO and Compound‚Äîthey dominate the category in terms of TVL. However, while **Compound** used to be the span favorite, the 519 Crypto Market Crash reshuffled the leaderboard and Aave took the lead.

As indicated in the chart below, MakerDAO and Compound have performed poorly in recent months. 

Therefore, many people are wondering whether Aave is on top because it‚Äôs a particularly span platform or because its competitors temporarily fell behind. The answer determines your assessment of Aave locking in your tokens in the long term, and also who to watch for insights about the future of crypto lending. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we look at the data, it becomes clear that Aave has several span advantages that indicate it will continue to be a market leader in DeFi lending. Namely, it is highly secure, innovative, and has recently launched Aave Pro, which gives it an enormous head start as traditional finance starts to buy into crypto. 

**Project Background**

Aave, formerly known as ETHLend, was launched on Ethereum in November 2017. The platform's initial mode of operation was similar to that of P2P~~‚Äî~~with the online platform matching borrowers and lenders through smart contracts in a peer-to-peer fashion. But the development model was soon adjusted after market reaction was subdued.

In 2019, the project completed a brand upgrade and was renamed to Aave (or ‚Äúghost‚Äù in Finnish), and went live in January 2020. This version provides liquidity by establishing a pool of funds and focuses on solving the problem of inefficient aggregation of lending needs. Users deposit collateral assets and then borrow assets within the collateral rate without a need for matching. 

In the succeeding months, the platform achieved the following milestones:

* July 2020: received $4.5 million from ParaFi and $3 million in strategic funding with participation from Framework Ventures and Three Arrows Capital. It also released its economic proposal, Aavenomics, which included the conversion of the original token Lend to AAVE and the issuance of an additional 3 million tokens, a security module, lending incentive, among others.
* October 2020: secured $25 million in funding led by Blockchain Capital and Standard Crypto, in addition to receiving approval from the U.S. SEC to register as an Ether Trust.
* February 2021: completed its V2 upgrade then launched the AMM marketplace the following month, allowing liquidity providers to pledge LP tokens from Uniswap and Balancer for loans
* April 2021: offered token incentives to borrowers and lenders through its liquidity mining programme
* May 2021: deployed and launched the Polygon chain
* July 2021: launched a new product for institutional clients Aave Pro
* October 2021: deployed and launched Avalanche.

**Economic model**

&amp;#x200B;

[Aave Economic Overview Data source: Aave Docs](https://preview.redd.it/op142pep2qx71.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323aae55486571260a7f9ce3a5805c31bfa9c83a)

Aave's economic model, which went live in July 2020, has three main uses for the token AAVE, namely community governance, safety module building and ecosystem rewards.

* Community Governance: Users holding the platform token AAVE can participate in community governance, such as participating in voting on the protection of the platform ecosystem, updates to the safety module mechanism, new feature iterations, etc. One AAVE token is equivlanet to one vote.
* Safety Module Construction: Users can pledge their token AAVE holdings into a security pool, which is used to protect against risk events such as contract breach risk, liquidity risk (liquidation risk arising from insufficient collateral coverage), and prophecy machine risk (caused by network congestion or market crash and where the prophecy machine cannot update the price or the price is provided incorrectly).
* Ecosystem Rewards: Token rewards given to borrowers and lenders, equivalent to liquidity mining.

Aave has put a lot of effort and innovation into security, not only by incorporating a safety module as part of the ecology and thus providing a safety cushion for risky events, but also by rewarding those who find security vulnerabilities. These proactive initiatives continue to support Aave's breakthrough development.

**Flash Loan**

&amp;#x200B;

[Flash Loan Borrowed Amount Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/tej99lvq2qx71.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cba31688ccddc70894aa7f68f273fb987fc461)

Aave also has a first-of-its-kind advantage over other lending platforms through Flash Loan. The product has a certain threshold for users and is suitable for developers with some programming skills. It is characterised by the ease with which users can obtain loans without the need to pledge any assets. They would have to simply return the borrowed funds within the same block (about 15 seconds). If they are unable to repay the loan in the same block, the transaction is revoked without any impact on the user. But, if the loan is successful, they are charged a 0.09% fee.

As of this writing, Flash Loan has surpassed $9.8 billion in cumulative lending volume and is expected to surpass $10 billion by the end of October. Although the entire crypto industry is in a recovery phase after the 519 Crypto Market Crash and Flash Loan's transaction volume has declined, there is no denying the explosive growth of the product, building a span momentum to support Aave to overtake Compound and MakerDAO.

**Asset classes and interest rates**

&amp;#x200B;

[Aave‚Äôs Deposit APY and Borrow APY Data source: Aave  website](https://preview.redd.it/hzp2c94s2qx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6fef32120110661620031bfc4ace40c7e40e40)

The V1 and V2 versions support 31 types of assets in single token pledges, mainstream cryptocurrencies and emerging cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,the AMM version supports LP token pledges for Uniswap and Balancer, with 16 types of assets. This differentiated strategy satisfies the lending needs of multiple groups, attracts more users to participate and retain, and also accelerates the expansion and influence of the platform, laying the foundation for achieving a bend in the road.

The strength of the asset range has allowed Aave to expand its pool of funds and has given it more scope to create unique interest rate advantages. First, the overall borrow APY is lower than other platforms (capital utilisation in the same dimension), with liquidity subsidy for depositors and borrowers (although this is not an Aave initiative). Second, it is a pioneering interest rate swap that allows users to choose between a variable borrow APY or stable strategy borrow APY. If they choose a higher rate, they can switch to a lower rate strategy, giving them access to lower cost funding in a more volatile and decentralised market.

**Aave Pro**

The success of Aave's V2 trial of the credit delegation model where loans can be obtained without collateral paved the launch of the Aave Pro project, which integrates DeFi with traditional finance and provides a new gateway to DeFi for offline investment institutions. 

It caters to individual investors who have very limited funds compared to institutional investors. In addition to this, DeFi has experienced explosive growth for over a year, but has not lasted as long as before.

The OTC funds are more often pooled in the hands of institutional investors. As an electronic money institution licensed by the FCA in the UK, Aave can ensure the safety of funds in a more compliant and secure dimension to allow institutional investors to participate and promote the good development of the whole ecosystem.

Aave Pro is different from the original V1, V2 and even AMM. For one, Aave Pro is only developed for OTC institutional investors, with only four assets launched - USDC, BTC, ETH and AAVE. Second, Aave Pro is a private pool, which is completely separate from the Aave protocol pool, so that the risks are completed independently. 

Third, participating investment institutions need to pass the KYC verification of Fireblocks, assess the credit rating through KYC information, and adopt different collateral rates according to different credit ratings, which greatly reduces the security of funds.

**Summary**

Aave took the lead in lending because of its team instead of coincidence. Not only processing a tightened control over security and compliance, Aave team also continually sought out breakthroughs and innovation in DeFi lending.  With the launch of Aave Pro in particular, Aave has gradually opened a gap with the top lending platforms, and is set to usher in a new round of development for DeFi in a new direction.

qk80o8,lingi6,AMPL lending on Aave.,"Soft shilling here

Talking about stablecoin, there is a algorithmic rebasing token which changes supply according to market demand.

The protocol which controls the supply is soft pegged to 2019 $ value and will stay the same , which means if inflation eats the USD over time..it will still be of the same value ten years later down the road.

But there is one big problem, which is understanding how  the token works. People just jump in and whine later, since it's the first of its kind in the entire cryptoverse adoption is slow due to lack of understanding how it works.

According to Aave's website these are the networks those tokens are available in:

* aBUSD - Eth
* aDAI - Avalance, Polygon, Eth
* aGUSD - Eth
* aUSDC - Avalance, Polygon, Eth
* aUSDT - Avalance, Polygon, Eth

The first time I added funds, the app purchased aUSDT. I read somewhere that Nash uses Avalanche, so it matches up.

However, today the USDT rate on Aave is much lower than what's on Nash website (5.30% vs 14.52%) so I was curious to see what asset Nash was using today.

When I tried to add more funds the app now says it would buy aGUSD, but that token is only available on Eth mainnet.

Anyone knows how Nash Earn works? What network(s) it is using? How does the algorythm work?",2021-10-31 02:56:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nash/comments/qj80gd/earn_what_aave_version_is_being_used/

qhcu0m,nutfeed,Any low risk way of lending ETH at 10%+ APY? Any way to protect from liquidation on AAVE?,"So I just started dabbing in DEFI, I‚Äôve only been lending on Celsius and Nexo, but recently I converted my USDC to UST and have it on Anchor Protocol at 19.5% APY.

I figured I could lend my ETH for more UST on AAVE at 50% LTV and it should be safe unless ETH drops to ~$2000 - this is the only thing stopping me.

Doing this would put me at close to 10% APY on my ETH and it feels like a reasonable risk.

Is there anything I can do to protect my ETH on AAVE from liquidation in case of a flash crash? 

Or even better, any other low risk high yield strategies for lending ETH at something higher than 10% APY?

Tips are much appreciated",2021-10-28 10:29:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qhcu0m/any_low_risk_way_of_lending_eth_at_10_apy_any_way/

qgvw3s,adamsot34157678,"Analyst Predicts Monster Uptrends for Ethereum and Aave, Says Red-Hot Solana Could Run Hard."," A popular crypto strategist and trader is predicting strong uptrends for Ethereum (ETH) while saying that explosive altcoin Solana (SOL) could continue its impressive performance.

The pseudonymous trader Smart Contracter tells his 176,000 Twitter followers that he‚Äôs keeping a close watch on Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) because he believes the trading pair remains bullish after it broke out from a large inverse head and shoulders pattern (IHS).

 An inverse head and shoulders pattern is a bullish technical pattern that marks the beginning of a new uptrend. According to Smart Contracter‚Äôs chart, ETH/BTC is currently consolidating within a bullish continuation pattern and can climb as high as 0.12 BTC, worth $7,287 at time of writing.

Next looking at the leading smart contract platform against the US dollar, the crypto strategist says ETH is now en route to $5,000 after it took out a diagonal resistance.

 Next is lending and borrowing protocol Aave (AAVE), which the trader believes is ready to ignite an epic rally after printing a bullish higher low setup.

 The trader uses the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that predicts future price action by following the psychology of market participants that tends to manifest in waves. According to Smart Contracter‚Äôs chart, AAVE can soar close to $900 before completing its five-wave cycle. 

 In the short term, the crypto strategist predicts that Solana can revisit its all-time high of $218. In the long term, Smart Contracter says he sees Solana igniting a massive rally to $900 as he believes SOL is following in the footsteps of Binance Coin‚Äôs (BNB) epic surge earlier this year.",2021-10-27 20:46:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/qgvw3s/analyst_predicts_monster_uptrends_for_ethereum/

Ive seen the whole thing where compound had a glitch that sent millions to different people and then the CEO was trying to intimidate people to give it back. Of course all of that bothered a lot of people. 

I have also seen a growing popularity around AAVE. 

Having looked through recent posts most are just talking about the compound glitch and not necessarily the long term of the project.

So what do you degenerates think about compound in the long term? Is AAVE just the better move with its variable and stable interest rates?",2021-10-25 17:39:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfd1za/do_people_still_believe_in_compound_comp_or_has/

qdv3u1,ludovic-delion,"Ludovic Delion : L AAVE, analys√© comme le catalyseur de la finance d√©centralis√©e, une devise revolutionnaire","Aave (AAVE)cryptomonnaie et le protocole de pr√™t de cryptomonnaies non-custodial  
Ainsi D√©couvrir Aave (AAVE),c est comprendre le protocole open source et non-custodial permettant la cr√©ation de march√©s de la finance d√©centralis√©e (DeFi). Il permet √† ses utilisateurs de percevoir des int√©r√™ts sur le d√©p√¥t de leurs cryptomonnaies et d'emprunter des actifs, le tout de mani√®re d√©centralis√©e.  
Cr√©√©e en 2017 et bas√©e √† Londres, la soci√©t√© Aave est √† l'origine du protocole du m√™me nom. Elle d√©veloppe un protocole d√©centralis√© du march√© financier non privatif de libert√© auquel les utilisateurs peuvent participer en tant que pr√™teurs ou emprunteurs.  
Les pr√™teurs fournissent des liquidit√©s au march√© afin de g√©n√©rer un revenu passif, tandis que les emprunteurs peuvent souscrire des emprunts avec des crypto-actifs mis en garantieLe protocole Aave prend en charge plus de 15 crypto-actifs diff√©rents, avec une large s√©lection de stablecoins. Lors d'un d√©p√¥t dans le protocole Aave, des Aave Tokens (aTokens) sont forg√©s.Ces tokens particuliers suivent la valeur de l'actif sous-jacent et sont br√ªl√©s lors du remboursement du pr√™t. Pendant que l'actif sous-jacent est pr√™t√© aux emprunteurs, les aTokens produisent des int√©r√™ts en temps r√©el. De plus, ils peuvent √™tre librement stock√©s, transf√©r√©s et √©chang√©s.Aave propose √©galement des solutions sous-collat√©ralis√©es. Le protocole rend ainsi possibles les emprunts de mani√®re instantan√©e sans qu'une garantie soit n√©cessaire.Par le pass√©, Aave √©tait connue sous le nom d'ETHLend, que la soci√©t√© a rapidement abandonn√© pour marquer son passage d'une strat√©gie de pr√™t P2P d√©centralis√©e √† une strat√©gie bas√©e sur les pools de liquidit√©.  
Auparavant, le token natif du protocole √©tait le LEND, qui a r√©cemment √©t√© remplac√© par le AAVE suite √† une migration accept√©e par la communaut√©. Le ratio de migration √©tait de 100 LEND pour 1 AAVE.  
¬´ Aave ¬ª est un mot finnois qui se traduit par ¬´ fant√¥me ¬ª en fran√ßais. Pour Aave, cela repr√©sente son objectif de cr√©er une infrastructure transparente et ouverte pour une finance hautement d√©centralis√©e.  
Complexe dans son fonctionnement, penchons-nous sur les nombreuses composantes du protocole Aave. Comment celui-ci fonctionne-t-il et que vous permet-il de faire ?  
La tok√©nisation par les Aave Tokens  
Le protocole Aave impl√©mente une strat√©gie de tokenisation pour les fournisseurs de liquidit√©. Lors d'un d√©p√¥t, l'utilisateur re√ßoit une quantit√© correspondante de tokens de produits d√©riv√©s, baptis√©s Aave Tokens (ou aTokens).  
**Ceux-ci correspondent avec un ratio 1:**1 aux actifs sous-jacents d√©pos√©s et suivent le standard ERC 20 d'Ethereum. Le solde des aTokens de chaque d√©posant augmente au fil du temps, en raison de l'accumulation permanente des int√©r√™ts g√©n√©r√©s par les d√©p√¥ts.  
Les aTokens impl√©mentent nativement le concept de r√©orientation des taux d'int√©r√™t. Ce concept permet de distinguer la valeur accumul√©e au fil du temps par les int√©r√™ts pay√©s par les emprunteurs du solde initial.  
D√®s qu'un portefeuille li√© √† Aave comporte de aTokens, la valeur accumul√©e par ces derniers peut √™tre redirig√©e vers n'importe quelle adresse, ce qui permet de fractionner le solde et les int√©r√™ts g√©n√©r√©s.  
Malgr√© les avantages que ce mod√®le de tokenisation pr√©sente, il s'accompagne d'un inconv√©nient non n√©gligeable. Il est impossible de transf√©rer la totalit√© du solde en une seule transaction.  
En effet, le montant exact d'un transfert ne peut pas √™tre renseign√©, puisque les int√©r√™ts continuent √† fonctionner m√™me pendant la confirmation de l'op√©ration de transfert. Cela signifie qu'un tr√®s petit solde (dust balance) sera toujours laiss√© sur le portefeuille √† l'origine d'un transfert.  
D√©poser des cryptomonnaies et g√©n√©rer des revenus avec Aave  
Aave requiert au pr√©alable une connexion √† un portefeuille externe supportant Ethereum. En raison de son efficacit√© et de sa r√©putation dans l'industrie, je vous conseille vivement d'utiliser MetaMask.  
Ce navigateur Web est relativement simple √† utiliser et √† initialiser.  
**Si vous d√©tenez d√©j√† votre propre portefeuille MetaMask et √™tes un habitu√© de son utilisation, passez ce tutoriel. Dans le cas contraire, d√©couvrez les 3 √©tapes pr√©alables avant de pouvoir utiliser Aave avec MetaMask :**  
L'utilisation de cette fonctionnalit√© est tr√®s simple. Il vous suffit de s√©lectionner l'actif que vous souhaitez d√©poser parmi les cryptomonnaies support√©es par la plateforme, puis de renseigner le montant de votre d√©p√¥t. Une fois votre d√©p√¥t enregistr√©, vous commencez √† percevoir des int√©r√™ts.  
Chaque actif a son propre march√© de l'offre et de la demande avec son propre taux d'int√©r√™t annuel qui √©volue avec le temps. Ainsi, si l'√©cart entre les liquidit√©s disponibles et les fonds emprunt√©s se resserre, le taux d'int√©r√™t annuel en d√©p√¥t augmente (ceci est √©galement fonction d'autres facteurs).  
Comment sont calcul√©s les int√©r√™ts per√ßus ?  
Les d√©positaires de tokens sur Aave re√ßoivent des revenus continus qui √©voluent en fonction des conditions du march√© et se divisent en deux parties.  
Le paiement du taux d'int√©r√™t sur les pr√™ts  
Tous ceux apportant de la liquidit√© √† un actif se partagent les int√©r√™ts pay√©s par les emprunteurs correspondant au taux d'emprunt moyen multipli√© par le taux d'utilisation.  
Plus le taux d'utilisation d'une r√©serve est √©lev√©, plus le rendement pour les d√©posants est √©lev√©. Une feuille de calcul mise √† jour en temps r√©el permet de voir ce mod√®le de taux d'int√©r√™t en action.  
Le paiement du taux d'int√©r√™t sur les flash loans  
Les d√©posants re√ßoivent 0,063 % du volume de tout flash loan (pr√™t √©clair) ex√©cut√© sur Aave.  
Emprunter des cryptomonnaies avec Aave  
Pourquoi emprunter des cryptomonnaies ?  
Seconde possibilit√© avec Aave, l'emprunt de cryptomonnaies. Cela peut vous para√Ætre assez curieux, mais emprunter des cryptos peut s'av√©rer relativement int√©ressant.  
Supposons que vous avez une position ouverte sur un actif, prenons l'exemple de l'ETH, et qu'une opportunit√© d'investissement s'offre √† vous. Il vous sera impossible de r√©cup√©rer vos ETH, sauf si vous cl√¥turez votre position.  
En empruntant des cryptomonnaies avec Aave, vous pouvez donc obtenir des liquidit√©s sans pour autant vendre vos actifs. Cela vous permet ainsi de profiter de nouvelles possibilit√©s d'investissement, ou m√™me de faire face √† des d√©penses impr√©vues.  
Comment emprunter des crypto-monnaies avec Aave ?  
Avant tout chose, vous devez d√©poser sur Aave des fonds qui serviront de garantie, aussi appel√©e ¬´ collat√©ral ¬ª. R√©f√©rez-vous √† la partie pr√©c√©dente pour en savoir plus sur ce point.  
Une fois devant la liste des actifs disponibles, s√©lectionnez celui dont vous avez besoin, plus cliquez sur le bouton ¬´ Emprunter ¬ª en bas √† droite.  
Renseignez ensuite le montant souhait√© en fonction de votre collat√©ral. S√©lectionnez ensuite un taux stable ou variable puis confirmez votre transaction. Aave vous permet de modifier le type de taux s√©lectionn√© √† tout moment par la suite.  
Quelle est la diff√©rence entre taux stable et taux variable ?  
Le taux stable  
Les taux stables agissent comme un taux fixe √† court terme, mais peuvent √™tre r√©√©quilibr√©s √† long terme en fonction de l'√©volution des conditions du march√©. Opter pour un taux stable permet donc de planifier √† l'avance le montant des int√©r√™ts √† payer.  
Un r√©√©quilibrage des taux stables est peu probable, mais se produit si le taux d'emprunt moyen est inf√©rieur √† 25% et que le taux d'utilisation est sup√©rieur √† 95%.  
Le Le taux variable est le taux bas√© sur l'offre et la demande dans Aave. Le taux variable changera au fil du temps et est plus avantageux taux variable  
en fonction de la situation.  
V√©ritable moteur de l'√©cosyst√®me Aave, le AAVE joue le r√¥le d'utility token. Il peut notamment √™tre utilis√© pour r√©duire les frais des diff√©rents services d'Aave et donne √©galement des droits sur la gouvernance du protocole.  
AAVE est utilis√© pour voter et d√©cider du r√©sultat des propositions d'am√©lioration d'Aave (AIP). En outre, le AAVE est √©ligible au staking dans le cadre du module de s√©curit√© du protocole. Cela fournit une s√©curit√© aux d√©posants et permet de g√©n√©rer un revenu passif.  
Les tokens AAVE utilis√©s pour payer les frais d'Aave sont automatiquement br√ªl√©s. Ainsi, cela permet de naturellement r√©duire le nombre de tokens en circulation, ce qui de surcro√Æt augmente sa raret√©.  
Le projet Aave a r√©colt√© un total de 24 millions de dollars au cours de 2 cycles de financement, lorsque le token LEND √©tait encore d'actualit√©.  
En novembre 2017, Aave a fait l'objet d'une ICO publique, laquelle lui a permis de r√©colter 16,5 millions de dollars. Notez que lors de cette lev√©e de fonds, le token LEND √©tait propos√© au prix de seulement 0,017270 dollar (ce qui repr√©sente un token AAVE √† 1,7270 dollars).  
Dans un second temps, en juillet 2020, Aave a re√ßu le soutien de plusieurs fonds d'investissement, lui permettant de collecter 7,5 millions de dollars suppl√©mentaires. Le projet a notamment re√ßu le soutien de DTC Capital, Parafi Capital Three Arrow Capital et Framework Ventures.  
√âquipe et partenaires  
L'√©quipe  
**Selon la liste officielle des membres de l'√©quipe d'Aave,celle-ci se compose de 18 personnes. Penchons-nous sur le parcours et les missions de ses principaux membres :**  
Fondateur et PDG d'Aave, Stani Kulechov est un chef d'entreprise chevronn√© qui poss√®de une vaste exp√©rience dans le d√©veloppement de solutions dans le secteur de la blockchain. Dipl√¥m√© d'un Master de droit √† l'universit√© d‚ÄôHelsinki, Stani Kulechov conseille notamment de nombreux projets blockchains et prend souvent la parole lors de conf√©rences au sujet de la FinTech et des smart contracts d'Ethereum.  
√Ä l'avenir, Aave voit grand, et compte bien conqu√©rir toute l'Europe. En effet, depuis ao√ªt 2020, la Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), le gendarme financier du Royaume-Uni, a accord√© √† Aave une licence d'√©tablissement de monnaie √©lectronique. Cette licence autorise la startup √† fournir des services de paiement au m√™me titre que ceux de Coinbase et Revolut.  
AAVE est la 28e crypto-monnaie du classement  
AAVE (AAVE) est un march√© mon√©taire d√©centralis√© qui fonctionne sur la blockchain Ethereum. AAVE permet aux utilisateurs de pr√™ter et d'emprunter une gamme de crypto-actifs. Le site Web d'AAVE le d√©crit comme un ""protocole de liquidit√© non d√©positaire pour gagner des int√©r√™ts sur les d√©p√¥ts et emprunter des actifs.""  
Au 22 juin, la capitalisation boursi√®re d'AAVE se situait au niveau de 2,674 milliards de dollars, la crypto se n√©gociant autour de 214 dollars par jeton.

Au 22 juin, la capitalisation boursi√®re d'AAVE se situait au niveau de 2,674 milliards de dollars, la crypto se n√©gociant autour de 214 dollars par jeton.  
Comme le souligne le graphique, AAVE a atteint un bas d'environ 26,20 $ en novembre 2020 et un haut de 643,07 $ √† la mi-mai 2021, lorsque l'Ethereum a atteint son sommet. La crypto a progress√© plus de vingt-quatre fois et demie entre fin 2020 et le sommet de mai 2021. Au niveau de 214 $ le 22 juin, AAVE √©tait un tiers du prix des sommets, car la crypto a sous-perform√© le Bitcoin et l'Ethereum pendant la correction des prix.  
Amp est num√©ro 29, avec une capitalisation boursi√®re l√©g√®rement sup√©rieure √† celle d'AAVE  
Amp (AMP) est une plateforme permettant de garantir les transferts d'actifs. Le site Web d'Amp indique qu'elle fournit aux actifs en crypto-monnaies ""une assurance instantan√©e et v√©rifiable pour toute application dans le monde r√©el"". AMP dispose de fonctionnalit√©s de contrats intelligents pour les garanties.  
Au 22 juin, AMP √©tait la 29e crypto-monnaie en importance juste derri√®re AAVE, avec une capitalisation boursi√®re de 2,633 milliards de dollars √† 0,06343 $ par jeton. Amp et AAVE ont chang√© de place dans le classement au cours des derniers jours  
Element centrale et Poids lourd de la finance d√©centralis√©e, Aave est un protocole de pr√™t open source de crypto-monnaies g√©r√© √† 100% par ses utilisateurs. Les pr√™teurs per√ßoivent un int√©r√™t sur leur d√©p√¥t, tandis que les emprunteurs ont la possibilit√© d‚Äôacc√©der √† des liquidit√©s en mettant en gage leur crypto-monnaies.  
Cet √©cosyst√®me est sous-tendu par le jeton du m√™me nom, l‚ÄôAAVE. D√©tenir de l‚ÄôAAVE donne la possibilit√© de participer √† la gouvernance du protocole et permet √©galement de r√©duire les frais induits par ce dernier.  
Aave a une offre encore plus limit√©e que le Bitcoin . Aave a migr√© vers Polygon √† partir de la blockchain Ethereum car Polygon r√©sout mieux les probl√®mes de confirmations de lenteur et de frais de gaz √©lev√©s.  
Aave a connu une croissance consid√©rable de son activit√© d‚Äôutilisateurs cette ann√©e et est devenu un √©l√©ment important du mouvement de la finance d√©centralis√©e (DeFi).  
Aave, Sushi, Curve et PoolTogether ont r√©cemment annonc√© une initiative d‚Äôadoption de DeFi de 100 millions de dollars avec une plate-forme mobile pour les applications financi√®res du nom de Celo.  
Ce partenariat vise √† rendre les services DeFi accessibles √† 6 milliards de personnes sur la plan√®te qui poss√®dent un smartphone avec une connexion Internet. Une autre nouvelle positive est que SEBA Bank, une banque suisse agr√©√©e par la FINMA, a annonc√© le mois dernier qu‚Äôelle √©tendait son offre de produits √† DeFi avec un support suppl√©mentaire pour Aave (AAVE) et Chainlink (LINK).  
L‚Äôint√©r√™t des investisseurs pour les actifs num√©riques augmente rapidement et beaucoup veulent aller au-del√† du bitcoin. SEBA Bank offre aux investisseurs un acc√®s personnalis√© aux moteurs de rendement et aux avantages de diversification de cette nouvelle classe d‚Äôactifs ¬ª, a d√©clar√© Alistair Heggie, COO de SEBA Bank.  
Cela ressemble √† premi√®re vue √† l‚Äôannonce d‚Äôune √©ni√®me plateforme d√©centralis√©e concurrente au g√©ant Twitter. Une sorte de fantasme r√©current dans l‚Äôunivers des cryptomonnaies face √† la mise en place de r√©seaux sociaux pr√©sent√©s comme natifs √† ce secteur. Et dont l‚Äôinnovation consiste le plus souvent √† reprendre le contr√¥le de ses donn√©es. Mais √©galement √† les mon√©tiser, parfois selon des principes plus malsains que novateurs. Cependant, √† y regarder de plus pr√®s, cette annonce du protocole Aave cache peut-√™tre une motivation plus‚Ä¶ revancharde.  
Il est difficile de d√©nombrer la quantit√© de projets de l‚Äôunivers des cryptomonnaies qui n‚Äôont pas tent√© leur chance dans la cr√©ation de r√©seaux sociaux. Le tout selon un mod√®le th√©orique associ√© au web3 et √† la d√©centralisation sur une blockchain. Mais √©galement avec une volont√© de reprendre le contr√¥le de ce contenu que les g√©ants actuels du secteur mon√©tisent √† leur avantage. Un mod√®le √©conomique qui a du mal √† s‚Äôimposer et dont les r√©sultats sont aussi d√©cevants que l‚Äôabsence d‚Äôadoption qu‚Äôils provoquent au sein de la communaut√©.  
**Cela en premier lieu car il est toujours difficile de concurrencer les primitives d‚Äôun secteur. Et tout comme le Bitcoin ne sera jamais remplac√© par le Dogecoin, Twitter trouvera difficilement un concurrent √† sa taille. Mais dans une logique d‚Äô√©volution de l‚ÄôInternet actuel vers sa version web3 d√©centralis√©e et communautaire, cette perspective reste n√©anmoins d‚Äôactualit√©. Et les projets qui tentent de surfer sur cette tendance se succ√®dent avec un mod√®le cependant (presque) toujours identique :** mon√©tiser ses donn√©es personnelles pour son propre compte.  
Aave veut d√©velopper un Twitter sur Ethereum  
Et dans cette longue liste de projets concurrents √† Twitter, c‚Äôest aujourd‚Äôhui le fondateur du protocole Aave qui entre dans la course. Cela suite √† une r√©cente d√©claration qui expose sa volont√© de d√©velopper une plateforme de ce type avant la fin de cette ann√©e. Une bien √©trange d√©cision pour un protocole dont l‚Äôactivit√© est principalement centr√©e sur l‚Äôoffre de pr√™ts dans l‚Äôunivers de la DeFi. Et qui fait de ce dernier le plus important de ce secteur avec une valorisation actuelle toute proche des 11 milliards de dollars sur le site DefiPulse. Ce qui le place en t√™te de cet √©cosyst√®me avec une dominance de 17% de parts de ce march√©.  
¬´ Nous pensons que les cr√©ateurs de contenu devraient poss√©der leur public sans autorisation. Un espace o√π tout le monde peut cr√©er de nouvelles exp√©riences utilisateur en utilisant le m√™me graphique social et les m√™mes donn√©es en cha√Æne. ¬ª ‚Äì Stani Kulechov  
Mais ce n‚Äôest pas la premi√®re fois que le projet Aave s‚Äô√©carte quelque peu de son domaine d‚Äôactivit√© principal. Ce qui avait donn√© naissance aux √©tranges NFTs du nom d‚ÄôAavegotchi √† la fin de l‚Äôann√©e derni√®re. Le tout reposant sur un jeton GHST au succ√®s plut√¥t mitig√©  
le protocole DeFi AAVE prend en charge AVAX, Aave est un syst√®me de pools de pr√™ts d√©centralis√©s qui collecte les fonds des utilisateurs et prend en charge les pr√™ts/emprunts via des contrats intelligents.  
Aave Protocol a int√©gr√© Avalanche comme troisi√®me blockchain publique apr√®s Ethereum et Polygon. Cela permet aux traders d arbitrer plus facilement leurs actifs vers Aave pour le pr√™t ou le jalonnement.  
le protocole Aave s'impose comme le catalyseur de la finance d√©centralis√©e . Ce secteur √©mergent est une sous-cat√©gorie de l'industrie crypto et d√©signe des services gr√¢ce auxquels quiconque peut jouer le r√¥le d'une banque. 21 Millions revient sur l'histoire d'Aave, d√©taille simplement ce qu'il propose, son mod√®le √©conomique, sa s√©curit√© et vous explique pourquoi il est il est √† l'avant-garde du futur de la finance

qcoj82,klevioza,Jivanma Toh Aave Sadaye Tadko Ne Vali Chaya," In this Gujarati bhajan, he is shedding light on true character of life, and beyond life.  
He is saying...  
In life, one experiences the sun (hardship) and the shade (comfort) too.  
The thread of life is raw (transitory), and the body is also raw (transitory),  
Please don‚Äôt get connected to it, don‚Äôt get attach to this illusion.  
You will not be able to take anything with you, and you have not brought anything with you either.  
Upon dawn, sun rises, this sequence never changes.  
How many came and how many went, there is no count to that.  
Only right and wrong karmas (actions) performed are written down.  
Sometimes early, sometimes late, one will have to bear the consequences of them.  
Due to these karmas (actions), the body and circumstances are defined.  
By giving key in the hands of humans, the doer has washed away the responsibility.  
Kaka is explaining the essence of life in this bhajan. He is explaining two fundamentals, firstly, that life is transient. There is nothing permanent about this life. We must acknowledge and imbibe this fact in our daily conduct in our life. And secondly, that we are the playwright of our own drama of our life. Kaka is directing us to the transition stage where we disconnect with the material world and tune into universal mind. Comprehend what is not so permanent and what is eternal. Find the actual purpose of life.

I understand that this means after one year, if the rate does not change, I will have 8.28% of 200USDT in USDT (16USDT) and 10.43% of 200 USDT (20.86 USDT) in AVAX.

After 2 days, I should have already collected (200 x 0.1043) / 182.5 = 0.114 AVAX.

But when I check the transaction overview, I can only claim 0.00167 WAVX

qcaa1g,Mars_chego,"De-Fi Insurance Protocol Solace, Backed by Polygon, NEAR, and Aave is Now Live","Insurance-alternative protocol allows DeFi liquidity providers to hedge their risk in the event of smart contract exploits. [https://btcmanager.com/de-fi-insurance-protocol-solace-backed-by-polygon-near-and-aave-is-now-live/](https://btcmanager.com/de-fi-insurance-protocol-solace-backed-by-polygon-near-and-aave-is-now-live/)

Solace, a risk management insurance protocol for decentralized finance, has launched after eight months in development and four months on the Ethereum Rinkeby and Kovan testnets.

Entirely community-run, Solace offers coverage policies for DeFi protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap. Claims are instantly and automatically validated and claimed within the network, and payouts are made in a single transaction. Capital providers contribute to a single underwriting pool that is coming to multiple blockchains.

Solace aims to revolutionize the DeFi industry by providing investors with safety and security while contributing to the ecosystem. The protocol manages risk via intelligent assessment based on quantitative measures and analytics instead of voting, staking or other forms of ‚Äúcrowd wisdom‚Äù.

Supported by financial grants from the Polygon network, the NEAR Protocol, and Aave, Solace coverage policies are now available for the following DeFi protocols:

‚Äì Aave

‚Äì Compound

‚Äì Liquidity

‚Äì Yearn

‚Äì Curve Finance

‚Äì Uniswap V2 and V3

‚Äì Sushiswap

Eventually, Solace will have its own $SOLACE token to further decentralize the protocol‚Äôs governance, but the token will not be available at launch.

Standing out from traditional finance solutions, users can experience Solace while remaining entirely anonymous. The protocol doesn‚Äôt feature a KYC method and is entirely censorship-resistant. Solace is releasing with a launch version of its DAO, which includes members like the founders of Axie Infinity, Zerion, and Alchemy.

&gt;‚ÄúThere are a few points I really wanted to focus on. First is simplicity and usability. With Solace, you don‚Äôt have to understand how the protocol works ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù to use it, not even read the docs, just visit solace.fi and buy coverage, everything should be self explanatory without a knowledge barrier. Second is confidence in the claims assessment process. Claims processed by Solace are validated immediately and payouts happen in a single transaction, all thanks to our parametric automated system. Third is risk assessment. As a user I don‚Äôt trust the current mechanisms like voting, staking or market forces, in other words ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù, to accurately evaluate risk exposures and predict losses. Solace is driven by an analytical approach and incentivizes intelligent risk assessment through an architecture where people can offer their risk assessment models and earn fees for managing risk,‚Äù said Solace Founder Nikita Buzov.

**About Solace**

Solace is a decentralized coverage protocol, insurance-alternative, that allows DeFi liquidity providers and market makers to hedge their risk in the event of smart contract exploits. Solace advances risk management of decentralized financial products by efficiently making coverage policies available to liquidity providers and other protocols.

qbvtux,hearthstonetroll,+25% APY BTC/ETH Polygon only using Aave+Curve,"For those who have not played around with Aave &amp; Curve il show you how to get 25% apy on your bitcoin and ethereum in a safe way on the 2 biggest blue chip crypto projects without ever having to sell btc/eth to cover your position. only risk you take on is aave &amp; curve.  


This strategy is the way to go risk/reward specially now that it is btc season and eth will catch up on btc in a couple of months/weeks. you can also decide to put in more BTC or ETH in your deposit as collateral but that disorts the safety (not by a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7e8r8wsw9ku71.png?width=967&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edd0578b5bdc1676785b2e2a9b52d656b91ede61

Everything is explained in the picture above but il also break it down here:  


 

50% portfolio (half BTC/half ETH) deposit on DeFi-bank -&gt; use this as collateral and borrow half stablecoins to the value of your deposit.  
the other 50% of your portfolio and the stablecoins now form a 33%ETH/33%BTC/33%STABLEcoin and you deposit this in for example the Atricrypto pool on curve.

atricrypto yields are around 30 up to 40% depending on the rewards and traded volume in the pool Taking this into calculation you are now earning something around 25% yield ON YOUR WHOLE portfolio that only exist out of BTC/ETH  


if you would put your 100% portfolio in Atricrypto on curve you would have higher yield but you would be converting 33% of your portfolio into stablecoins and thus being less long on BTC/ETH wich is not worth it atm.  


you should start with a health factor around 1.59 and when this drops, you simply take out a share of your curve position into 3 partys 33%ETH/BTC/STABLE, use the eth/btc to increase collateral and the stable to repay your loan. this way you never have to sell btc or eth to cover your position on aave.  


Hope this was educational for a few out there, good luck !",2021-10-20 16:04:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/qbvtux/25_apy_btceth_polygon_only_using_aavecurve/

qai9ww,klevioza,"Ave Koi Hath Phelavi, Jagma Aave Tare Dware"," In this bhajan, Kaka is guiding us on charity and service and its principles.  
He is saying...  
Someone comes your door in this world, spreading their hands,  
Then you should be happy by giving to them, you should be happy.  
You must understand that Divine Mother has come to you in disguise of that someone.  
To give you an opportunity, she has truly come to your door.  
Everything is given to you in this world by Divine Mother, and today she is asking back from you.  
Many of you would have done wrong actions before. By giving today, you get a chance to wash away your sins.  
When you give back to the world, your heart and mind should be free of ownership and ego.  
Even after searching, you will not find such opportunity, please don‚Äôt waste this opportunity.  
You have been running to Divine Mother to receive from her, then why should you run away from giving to others.  
With love, Divine Mother has come to you, you should also welcome her with love.  
You have come in this world as a guest, and you have not brought anything with you.  
Kaka is explaining the fundamentals of charity and service in this bhajan. True value of giving is that one must understand, one is giving only what one has received from Divine Mother because of her grace. There is nothing that is ours to give. Again, it is an opportunity given by Divine Mother to us. Indirectly, It is an opportunity for us to wipe off our wrong doings. Divine Mother is blessing us once again. Kaka is urging us to give graciously without any pride or ego. Helping anyone is not a choice, it is a chance given to us by Divine. One must remain eternally grateful to Divine. Those who have serviced him has attained his glory. If God is everything, service is prayer, service is worship.

On the Matic explorer I can't seem to find any transaction touching that smart contract in nearly a month and my deposits are not accounting for the $600 gain. It seems like a big jump for a stablecoin pool. Does anyone have any insight into anything that happened with Curve/Aave/Autofarm that may have caused this? I think I have heard Curve releases extra bonuses on preset dates (vs. linearly). There also seems to be something with Autofarm becoming fully minted, maybe there was a bonus for that?

Bondeds Index and platform will allow HUNDREDS of small market cap coin projects to get their tokens listed on the lending index. Token holders of the various projects can then deposit their tokens and take out stable coin loans against their bags, unlocking their assests.

They have built a complex algorithmic ecosystem around the primary lending index including features such as USB stable coin, ca. 10% APY for USDC lenders, bundling of alts in various tiers for loans, and much more.

**No one else is doing this!**

\- Non-anon team

\- Huge connection to chainlink and will use new tiered LINK oracles when bundling alts into tiers for loans. LINK tweet in may pumped it to 8 cent!

\- Single stake $BOND on the platform earns interest and liquidation fees.

\- SC Audit by Cyber Unit (Same firm that audited FTX, Elrond &amp; Ukraine National Bank)

\- 13m market cap

\- Profit feedback loop with fee distribution back to holders

\- All unlocks from pre-sale done (no vesting unlocks to worry about)

\- Strong liquidity compared to market cap

\- A big catalyst in November which is perfect timing for the bull run and bullish Q4

\- Chart looks like it wants to explode

\- Rebrand in the works

\- Partnered with PROS, TOMO, GLCH, UNN, MATIC, ROUTE, GTON, DFYN, LINK, STAK &amp; More

\- 400m/1000m Coins in Circ - **Current Price: 0.035$**

\- Target: 500m - 750m Market cap and $BOND to 2$

q2gxsu,Arelthedeer,Is the D slur AAVE,"I want to get a response from Black Lesbians specifically. I know this question has likely been asked before, but I wanted to bring another question into the conversation. If absolutely *anything* I say is offensive to any group whatsoever, I apologize and will educate myself on that. This post is me attempting to educate myself on the topic in the first place.

Just a preface, I am a white lesbian. None of my research has given me a reason as to the *why*. I don't intend on using the term regardless of whether it actually is AAVE or not, as there are people who have expressed that it does hurt them. If something is used against a group of people/hurts them, that is enough for me to stop/not do a certain behavior. If something I do is perceived as one thing, regardless of my belief that it is another, I'm going to treat it from the perspective that I hurt someone. I hurt someone, and I need to stop that behavior so as to not hurt another person. In this case, it is a whole group.

I'll start with the definitions of Slur, and AAVE as I understand them.

Slur: A derogatory term used against a minority group that can be reclaimed by the group it is used against.

AAVE: African-American Vernacular English, a language, or at the very least a dialect, curated and used by Black people. As I understand, the reason that it is a problem for white people to use it, is it takes away the culture and blurs the lines of where it originated from. People don't *know* that a lot of words are AAVE, and they use them incorrectly which is demeaning to those who are Black.

A slur is a word that was used against a particular group of people, whereas AAVE is a word that is being protected by a group of people. Saying that a Slur for a word that was not solely used on Black people is AAVE, in my mind, at least, implies that it was Black people using it against lesbians. That's just not true, I like to believe that one minority group wouldn't collectively all agree to go against another. Yes, there are Racist Lesbians, and there are Lesbophobic Black people, but those people don't reflect the entire communities ideas. I don't think entire Black population had a slur used against lesbians in their language unless they were actively going against them. This is why, from my understanding, I find it unlikely that the D slur is in fact AAVE.

This is why, I would like this to be explained to me, and if I have anything wrong(I understand this is very likely) to be corrected and educated on it.

I apologize if anything I said felt demeaning or offensive in anyway shape or form. I'm attempting to look at this from a logical perspective, but if I am not coming off that way, I understand that and am apologetic.",2021-10-06 17:31:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLGBT/comments/q2gxsu/is_the_d_slur_aave/

q2bmpp,Arelthedeer,Is the D slur AAVE?,"I want to get a response from Black Lesbians specifically. I know this question has likely been asked before, but I wanted to bring another question into the conversation. If absolutely *anything* I say is offensive to any group whatsoever, I apologize and will educate myself on that. This post is me attempting to educate myself on the topic in the first place.

Just a preface, I am a white lesbian. None of my research has given me a reason as to the *why*. I don't intend on using the term regardless of whether it actually is AAVE or not, as there are people who have expressed that it does hurt them. If something is used against a group of people/hurts them, that is enough for me to stop/not do a certain behavior. 

I'll start with the definitions of Slur, and AAVE as I understand them.

Slur: A derogatory term used against a minority group that can be reclaimed by the group it is used against.

AAVE: African-American Vernacular English, a language, or at the very least a dialect, curated and used by Black people. As I understand, the reason that it is a problem for white people to use it, is it takes away the culture and blurs the lines of where it originated from. People don't *know* that a lot of words are AAVE, and they use them incorrectly which is demeaning to those who are Black.

A slur is a word that was used against a particular group of people, whereas AAVE is a word that is being protected by a group of people. Saying that a Slur for a word that was not solely used on Black people is AAVE, in my mind, at least, implies that it was Black people using it against lesbians. That's just not true, I like to believe that one minority group wouldn't collectively all agree to go against another. Yes, there are Racist Lesbians, and there are Lesbophobic Black people, but the entire Black population didn't have a slur used against lesbians in their language unless they were actively going against them. This is why, from my understanding, I find it unlikely that the D slur is in fact, AAVE.

I apologize if anything I said felt demeaning or offensive in anyway shape or form. I'm attempting to look at this from a logical perspective, but if I am not coming off that way, I understand that and am apologetic.",2021-10-06 10:54:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/q2bmpp/is_the_d_slur_aave/

q07im3,briittanyy,Commented on a Tiktok video poking fun at a white guy for using AAVE - should I not have made the joke because I am white?,"The title is a little confusing I think. Basically a Black creator I follow on Tiktok stitched a white guy's video. In his video, he uses AAVE but is misusing it and it doesn't make sense. 

I commented making fun of the guy by saying ""purr sis chile finna cap chile queen"" or something like that, which I thought was clearly commented in jest/agreeing with the creator. 

However, a commenter said that it isn't my joke to make because I am not Black and AAVE is not for me. I agree that AAVE is not for me which is why I don't use it, but in this context I thought it would be clear that I was not intending to poke fun at AAVE, but that it was being used facetiously in a nonsensical manner to imitate the original poster's use of it.

Did I misjudge it being okay to make that joke?",2021-10-03 09:04:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/askblackpeople/comments/q07im3/commented_on_a_tiktok_video_poking_fun_at_a_white/

From a twitter feed by Luigi DeMeo and retweeted by kevin sekniqi: 

 1/ Update on our work with the first class teams at Aave and Curve as we all prepare for their launch on Avalanche and ensure that they are successful. The hope is that this will happen as soon as possible next week, and all parties are working toward that.  

 2/ Last week, an Aave governance proposal was proposed to set up ‚ÄúAave Guardian,‚Äù a temporary solution to ensure community control until all features of Aave Governance are finalized on Avalanche. The vote selected 10 members to be holders of the multisig.

3/ Voting closed on September 28 and selected the new members of the multisig, including prominent members of the community such as [@0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki)

 4/ Since the vote passed, the community has been setting up the multisig and performing tests. As this process is truly decentralized and prioritizes security, coordination can be challenging. 

 5/ The good news is that we are closer to having support from Gnosis Safe, contracts deployed here, and UI support hopefully following soon after! 

 6/ While all parties had planned and focused on Aave deployment this week, there were a few minor items caught while the community was testing the Aave Guardian setup that will push deployment to early next week.   
7/ I‚Äôm just as eager as you all for the big push of Avalanche Rush. I appreciate your patience (and memes). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm bummed and getting impatient as well but what's a few more days. Security is more important than speed.",2021-10-02 12:05:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/pzo0r4/aave_and_curve_delayed_until_early_next_week/

px5gr7,tradersofcrypto,"Three Cryptocurrencies To Watch This Week ‚Äì ETH, SOL, AAVE","As we enter into the final week of September, the cryptocurrency market seems to be picking some pace. It is no doubt that this month has been awful for the investors of crypto, as the entire industry took a dip, not once but twice. With no major fundamental reason causing the markets to plummet, crypto holders were quite concerned about the price recovering back.

Of course, the markets did recover decently after the pushes to the south, but the momentum of the sellers still outweighing the buyers kept the fear alive among the masses.

Having that said, looking at the price action on a technical aspect, it is surprising to understand that the markets are holding at/well above the higher timeframe support levels. The bears‚Äô inability to breach through any major demand zones indicates that they lack strength despite their fierce speed.

There did come good accumulation in the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin in mid-Sept, but the recent update from China claiming it illegal washed the gains away in no time. However, it was certainly not a cause of concern for the technical analysts, as it was ascertained that the sellers failed to break through any significant areas of buyer‚Äôs interest. As a result, the prices accelerated to the north after a mini consolidation at the lows. And at the point of writing, several crypto assets have recovered almost completely from the dip.

As the cryptocurrencies are back on the move, perhaps the buyers are in the driver‚Äôs seat; the following are three top cryptocurrencies traders and investors much keep an eye on for this week.

Won't need insurance because people who take out loans are always undercollaterized and therefore not risky for the lenders. And the APY for stablecoins has consistently been above the national average of a savings account ever since it's inception. Seems like a no-brainer for me but wanted to ask for some bad advice on reddit.

ptmyfv,lamehillbilly,AAVE Polygon question,"So, let me get this right.

I have done some research, and I am looking at what to do with my MATIC for some safe passive income. I started with researching AAVE and currently am trying something. I have deposited  MATIC for 4-5% APY which already is pretty nice and feels secure since the TVL is astronomical.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I am looking at the loans with the original MATIC as collateral. I change my risk factor to 2, and took out another 80 MATIC to then add back to my original DEPOSIT. See there is a 2% interest rate but right now it looks like MATIC is PAYING 2.65% back in MATIC to borrow. SO I am getting paid for the loan, paid for the staked collateral and also adding more matic to the original deposit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surely I am crazy and this is gonna bite me in the ass lol, or is this really the power of DEFI?

Yes I know if MATIC plummets I am at risk of liquidation.",2021-09-23 11:51:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/ptmyfv/aave_polygon_question/

ptbeue,Shimbo_io,AAVE has been added to our service!,"Hi, guys!

Shimbo is developing a new service that allows our partners to add an instant crypto exchange 

feature. And recently we've added the support of $new\_coin on our platform! 

Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto.

Lenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity.

Aave has several unique selling points when compared with competitors in an increasingly crowded market. During the DeFi craze in the summer of 2020, it was one of the biggest projects in terms of the total value of crypto locked in its protocol.

The project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice. One of Aave‚Äôs flagship products are ‚Äúflash loans,‚Äù which have been billed as the first uncollateralized loan option in the DeFi space. There‚Äôs a catch: they must be paid back within the same transaction.

Another big selling point is how those who borrow through Aave can alternate between fixed and variable interest rates. While fixed rates can provide some certainty about costs during times of volatility in the crypto markets, variable rates can come in handy if the borrower thinks that prices will fall in the near future.

More coins will be added soon!

I invested in it recently, so far what I have read convinced me to invest in it. But I am still not entirely sure if its a wise investment. (But well, I am never sure about that)

Its a decentralized finance protocol which gives one the possibilty to either lend or to borrow cryptos. 

Another thing are the flashloans that you can use on lend, without any initial deposit. 

AAVE is currently sitting at the 45th on Coingecko.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sadly not the one who can help with more information because of this I would like to initiate a discussion by asking the following questions:

\-Where do you see AAVE in the future? What are the mayor risks for you? 

\-Are the flashloans usable?  I wasn't able to find a lot of information about it. People got scammed on other lending platforms with it, did not happen with AAVE (I guess).

\-What are, in your opinion, the biggest competitors for AAVE? Could they leave AAVE kinda redundant somehow?

\-Do you see for AAVE a bigger growth potential than for Ethereum?

This is going to be a great collaboration and definitely improve Harmony One presence among the masses creating more opportunities, more adoption! Lately, Harmony One has been doing very well and have increased their marketing and interaction with the public. I think this is the beginning of something great for all Harmonauts!

Harmony's latest proposal to deploy Curve on the Harmony blockchain is now live for anyone holding CRV tokens prior to the snapshot. This comes just days after a successful vote to bring Aave to the Harmony blockchain. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" \[If successful...\] the Harmony and Curve team will deploy the Curve contracts and gauge  on Harmony. Harmony supports EVM and Ethereum tooling, leading to a  seamless integration, much like other EVM chains and L2s. During  Harmony‚Äôs DeFi Hackathon in Sep 2020, a community team already  successfully ported Curve on testnet: [GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-contracts 3](https://github.com/harmony-one/dapp-curve-contracts) and [GitHub - harmony-one/dapp-curve-ui: Frontend for curve.fi on harmony.one 6](https://github.com/harmony-one/dapp-curve-ui)).  
&gt;  
&gt;After the market is functional, we will work with the Curve core devs  for cross-chain governance implementation on Curve on Harmony.""

Hey fellow crypto enthusiast

I've been looking at different liquidity platforms (not even sure of the name ahah) such as Aave, Venus, Port Finance and Qubit to do some leverage with some of my (not so) hard earned (stable)coin, but the APY keeps swinging between low and high, making it almost impossible to predict which might be the best comp.

I'm well aware that it depends on a lot of factors, but do any of you have a way of tracking the average APY (lending and borrowing) of the various platforms? Or at least, in your opinion, which one seems to have the most stable?

(If I give examples, it'll be from the book so yeah)

1. I've heard that some words have ties to gangs slang and stuff - words like ""homies"" ""repping___""  ""ride or die"". What are other words to look out for that ""sound cool"" but aren't? 

2. If I understand correctly, AAVE is perceived in America like *Kiezdeutsch* (German spoken by immigrants a.k.a. me lol) is perceived in Germany. How did it become so ""cool"" around the world? 

3. Which words are often perceived to be AAVE but aren't (Such as ""y'all"" or ""ain't""), and the other way around - which words sound ""normal"" but are AAVE? 

4. I have also gathered that a lot of AAVE words have been taken into ""twitter lingo"". What are some primary examples?",2021-09-18 01:56:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/pq572v/questions_about_aave_words_use_meaning/

AAVE is  approaching it‚Äôs first resistance level against Bitcoin on the 13h,  which shouldn‚Äôt pose much of a barrier given the rate of growth, but it  is under the Pivot level against the US Dollar. Suggestion of upward  momentum against Bitcoin suggests that we should see AAVE reach its  pivot level against the dollar.

SUSHI  measured against BTC. With the last close on the 13h between the pivot and first resistance level with an exceptionally high growth rate and a Stochastic RSI pointing at a lot more upward cycle ahead.",2021-09-15 02:09:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__civilizedRatty/comments/po86q7/prediction_aave_and_sushi_breakout/

I managed to deposit it into AAVE and borrowed some DAI with a health factor ~5.2. It took me about an hour to figure out. I think I had trouble because my funds are in the Coinbase Wallet instead of MetaMask.

My question is . . . what now? I don't want to do anything high risk right now while I'm learning, but I'm at a loss as to what to do with the DAI. I almost swapped it to WBTC, but decided to come here and get ideas first. 

It seems like just borrowing the DAI is losing me money.

Anyway, I have been lending DAI on the lending platform Aave which gives me aDAI which I earn interest on. Lately I have been reading articles about Tether (USDT) being seized by federal entities and I already knew this was possible because of the nature of Tether which is why I own DAI.

My worry is that my aDAI might be seizable by federal entities, I am not great with this side of politics and don't know if my assets in their aDAI token form would be seizable or able to be frozen by federal organizations. So that is my question, it's quite simple just a yes or no.

A further question would be since Tether is seizable would aUSDT the tokenized version of USDT be seizable too or no?

# What Is Leveraged Yield Farming and How Can It Bring Higher Returns?

* [By Brian Huang](https://thedefiant.io/author/brian-huang/)
* [September 2, 2021](https://thedefiant.io/2021/09/02/)
* [DeFI 101](https://thedefiant.io/category/defi-101/)

In DeFi, while it‚Äôs not necessarily true that bigger is always better, the beauty of a high APY never fails to turn heads. And regardless of how much higher DeFi yields are compared to traditional finance, there‚Äôs no shortage of DeFi users eager to maximize their profits, chasing higher yields from platform to platform and network to network. Therefore, it‚Äôs no surprise that leveraged yield farming, with its superior capital efficiency to alternative DeFi products, has become a popular choice for experienced DeFi participants to maximize their yields.

The concept behind leveraged yield farming isn‚Äôt as complicated as it might seem at first mention; If yield farming with X yields you Y returns, then **yield farming with 5X yields you 5Y returns**. In other words, borrowing funds to ramp up your position X, aka using leverage, multiplies your yields. Of course, it‚Äôs not for free; Like any lending platform, you have to pay borrowing interest for the privilege to use borrowed funds. Yet, where leveraged yield farming shines is in its capital efficiency‚Äìthe ability to borrow more than you put up as collateral.

For anyone who‚Äôs used one of the major DeFi lending platforms, you‚Äôll know that one endemic issue within DeFi lending is the lack of capital efficiency; If you put up $1 as collateral, you might only be able to borrow 50 cents. So if you then use that 50 cents to yield farm, won‚Äôt you just be earning less than if you used that $1 from the start? This limit is prohibitive for many lending use-cases. However, this is not the case for leveraged yield farming.

Unlike most traditional lending platforms, leveraged yield farming allows for undercollateralized loans. This higher capital efficiency means not only higher APYs for farmers but also lenders, as a result of this undercollateralized model creating higher utilization rates, which are a major factor in lending APYs within most lending platforms. The benefits are clear at a glance, higher APYs, and that‚Äôs also why leveraged yield farming platforms such as [Alpaca Finance](https://www.alpacafinance.org/) and [Alpha Homora](https://homora-bsc.alphafinance.io/) have gathered billions of dollars in TVL, becoming two of the most used DeFi platforms.

Yet, levering up your farming position to earn multiplied yields is only the simplest way to use a leveraged yield farming platform. There are advanced features and practices that allow users to create customized positions for their ideal risk profiles, target returns, and market biases. From taking long and short positions, to using market-neutral hedged strategies, it‚Äôs all possible through the customization of leveraged yield farming, and the best part is that no matter what you do, with leveraged yield farming‚Äìyou‚Äôll always be earning yields!

#### Leveraged Yield Farming Explained

Leveraged yield farming has two key participants: (1) lenders that deposit their single tokens within lending pools to earn yields, and (2) farmers that borrow tokens from these lending pools to yield farm with leverage.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6vkyicmhkzl71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4ec93b077980e70ad1c5a3f5e09ef9379b48b44)

**Lenders**. Lenders in a leveraged yield farming protocol can find among the highest yields in DeFi for single assets (Above figure). As stated before, such high APYs can be sustainably achieved due to higher utilization on the lending pools in general. What does utilization mean?  


Well, if a lending pool has 1,000 ETH, and there are borrowers that want to borrow 100 ETH, the utilization of that pool will be 10% (100/1000). Where undercollateralized loans and leveraged yield farming have an edge is that each respective borrower can borrow much more, thus achieving said higher utilization.

Using the previous example, if a traditional lending platform has 10 borrowers that are limited to borrowing a max of 10 ETH each due to collateralization limits, they will borrow a total of 100 ETH. Within an undercollateralized leveraged yield farming platform, these same 10 borrowers could perhaps borrow 50 ETH each, creating a utilization of 50% (500/1000). Higher utilization is important for lenders because most lending platforms have an interest rate model that slopes upwards at higher utilization, using the concept of supply and demand where higher demand for loans leads to higher rates for borrowing. This means at 50% utilization, the borrowing interest paid to lenders will be much higher than at 10%.

Through an undercollateralized model, utilization rates can and sometimes do hit as high as 90%+. Meanwhile, on overcollateralized lending platforms, the overall platform utilization can‚Äôt be higher than the weighted-averaged collateralize ratio of all the assets. It‚Äôs mathematically impossible. So for example, if a protocol has 2 asset pools, each with a 50% LTV limit *(Deposit $1 of collateral to borrow max .50)*, then that platform‚Äôs overall utilization can never be higher than 50%. Leveraged yield farming has no such limitation, leading to much higher APYs for users!

Yet, although the loans are undercollateralized, this model as utilized by modern yield farming platforms has proven very safe for lenders, because unlike other lending platforms, borrowers cannot withdraw the borrowed funds from the protocols. As such, the usage and subsequent return of the funds are tightly controlled by the protocols and their liquidation mechanisms, ensuring lenders receive their funds back. This is in contrast to traditional lending platforms that allow borrowers to take and use their funds anywhere.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qpvl9ybjkzl71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403a5953040f6e40d42f769764c944639932bf1e)

**Farmers**. Leveraged yield farming is similar to the standard farming of LP tokens but with additional features. In standard farming, a user ‚Äúprovides liquidity‚Äù to an AMM by depositing a pair of tokens in 50:50 proportion (e.g., $100 worth of ETH and $100 worth of USDT). This is necessary to create LP tokens. Users then receive LP tokens, which increase in value over time as trading fees are accrued into these LP tokens. Users can also stake some LP tokens in farming pools on DEXes that offer them to earn additional token rewards.

In leveraged yield farming, users can borrow tokens to increase their farming positions and therefore, capture additional farming yields. The process is simple: in a leveraged yield farming protocol, users first deposit any proportion of the two tokens. So in the aforementioned prior example of ETH and USDT, users could deposit only one of the two, or a combination of both, and the underlying protocol will do optimal swaps in the background to convert the tokens into a 50:50 split for the LP tokens (*a process known as Zapping*).

Then, to get leverage, farmers can borrow one of the tokens up to a maximum leverage(1.75x-6x depending on the pair). 1x leverage means without leverage, such as with standard yield farming. 2x leverage means borrowing as much as you deposited as collateral; Your total position value would be 2x your equity value.¬†

Once you‚Äôve selected your leverage and opened a position, the protocol would then use an integrated DEX to convert all deposited and borrowed tokens into a 50:50 proportion, adding them as liquidity into the DEX‚Äôs pool, and staking the received LP tokens in the subsequent farm. Yet, all of that happens in the background. For you, it‚Äôs one simple click when opening a leveraged yield farming position.

Farmers earn yield farming rewards from the integrated DEX (e.g, CAKE), trading fees and additional ALPACA rewards, and pay borrowing interest to earn a net APY that can be quite substantial.

Although using leverage can bring greater profits, it also carries greater risk. Specifically, one of the top concerns of users when using leverage is the risk of liquidation.

#### Leveraged Yield Farming Protocols

Leveraged yield farming protocols have taken hold of users in all the largest DeFi ecosystems.¬†

#### Sustainability in a Bear Market

There is another dimension in which leveraged yield farming shines, and that involves how it gives users the capability to create advanced strategies through shorting and hedging. In other words, through clever use of leverage and position customization, users can generate high yields while holding short or even market neutral positions. The implication of this is significant, which is that **leveraged yield farming allows you to profitably yield farm in bear markets.**¬†

Besides for capital efficiency, this ability offered by leveraged yield farming addresses another major issue within yield farming which is sustainability; more specifically, yield farming‚Äôs lack of sustainability in various market conditions.

In all other yield farming platforms, you typically have to hold long-only positions on tokens in order to provide liquidity and yield farm. That also means that in bear markets when prices are dropping, the yields may not offset the equity losses you‚Äôd take from holding the tokens. Leveraged yield farming platforms are a solution to this problem and may become included in a handful of DeFi havens where it‚Äôs still profitable to yield farm during a bear market.

For more information on advanced strategies with leveraged yield farming, please see our article on the subject.¬†

#### Leveraged Yield Farming in DeFi and Its Future

From our above run-down, it is clear leveraged yield farming provides unique opportunities to earn among the highest yields on your crypto assets in DeFi. Furthermore, the strategies can range from conservative (farming stablecoins or hedging pseudo delta-neutral) to high-yield high-risk speculative (levering long and shorting), thus appealing to a wide spectrum of users.¬†

At its foundation, because much of the yield in leveraged yield farming is generated not from platform token rewards but from higher capital efficiency, it is safe to say leveraged yield farming is one of the most sustainable segments within DeFi.

Leveraged yield farming is also one of the few platform types that allows under collateralized loans. It can achieve this safely by limiting the usage of the loaned funds within the protocol for yield farming on integrated exchanges. While this use-case might seem narrow at first glance, in practice, it accounts for the majority of the DeFi activities today. The applications for the loans may also be expanded in the future. There is no technical limitation, so once new yield sources arise, LYF protocols will be ready to capture those opportunities by offering on-chain leverage to users.¬†

Currently, the user base in leveraged yield farming platforms is diverse and not limited to risk-seekers. When deploying capital with the right strategies, users can generate substantial profits in all market conditions with mitigated risks! There are various methods that can appeal to anyone regardless of their risk profile, target yields, or knowledge level.

In summary, leveraged yield farming not only addresses major DeFi problems of capital efficiency and sustainability, but also currently offers mature products with high earning potential. Thus, we believe leveraged yield farming protocols are well positioned to continue growing as a fundamental building block and DeFi LEGO.",2021-09-07 09:45:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/pjdbxb/alpaca_finance_alpacafinance/

pfzz8p,MisterMyriad,Worried I may have disappeared some tokens trying to use Polygon Network on Aave,"I was trying to use Polygon network on Aave. I used the Polygon Bridge to successfully move some tokens from ETH network to MATIC network. Problem is, they weren't MATIC tokens, which is what MATIC network runs on, so I can't do anything with the tokens I've moved there since any further action is denominated in MATIC. So, I figured I should get some MATIC over there. I picked some up on an exchange and sent it to my Metamask. New problem, Metamask doesn't seem to support MATIC on the ETH network, so my MATIC tokens aren't showing up in the wallet. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are as follows: 

1. Can I retrieve the MATIC tokens I've sent to Metamask, or are they PolyGONE?

2. How can I get MATIC tokens onto the MATIC network so my other tokens aren't stuck in limbo?

pfxs34,silverwolf365,AITA for not realizing I was using AAVE?,"So I'm a white guy and obviously I know I shouldn't be using AAVE because it's not my culture. However I do have a lot of black co-workers and friends and we're all pretty close. Whenever we talk or hangout to me it feels like I'm just having a normal conversation with them and I think I'm talking normally but my boyfriend had pointed out to me that after I talk to my black friends or co-workers for awhile I start using AAVE and take on a ""blackcent"". I never noticed I did this and none of my black friends pointed out i do this and apparently it only happens when I'm around my black friends and co-workers. It honestly took me for a loop cause consciously I know better and I like to think of myself as an ally. I know that people in general take on speech patterns of the company they have around but from what I understand it's still not okay for me to do this. I've tried to curb the habit with being more conscious about what I'm saying but occasionally I still catch myself doing it whenever I get relaxed around my black coworkers and friends. My boyfriend and non-black friends have started to get on my case about it and it resulted in a pretty heated argument about how I need to do better and how there's no excuse for what I'm doing. I really am trying to stop but I don't know what else to do and it still seems like it's not enough. Am I the asshole for not trying harder to curb this habit?",2021-09-02 00:44:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pfxs34/aita_for_not_realizing_i_was_using_aave/

pft24i,pitbullgio,How does borrowing on Aave works on the polygon network? Clear some doubts...,"Hi Guys, 

Sorry for my noob questions but I still have some questions about the process of borrowing in general and also on the polygon network. 

  
So for example I use USDC as a collaterize on aave via polygon. 

Question 1 already is this usdc then usdc on the polygon network?  
So I can buy Matic tokens on binance and swap on the aave app for USDC polygon. (or is the ETHEREUM Network)

Then I can use this as a collatorise for lending an amount of tokens like wbtc,weth, usdt, matic.

  
Lets say I have 100 usdc worth that I put in WBTC, I get there is a borrow rate for like 1%   
If I borrow I get then 100 dollar worth of WBTC (not looking at tlv)   
Question 2 is this WBTC on the Polygon network then or on the Ethereum network I presume we remain in Polygon.

Then if I want to repay the loan after a year for example without getting liquidated I have to pay back my WBTC + 1% of WBTC or is it paying back in dollar value?

  
So these are the questions I struggle with.

Thx for your advice",2021-09-01 20:40:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/pft24i/how_does_borrowing_on_aave_works_on_the_polygon/

pe5cbq,Sakugen23,Why do people focus way too much on white people using certain AAVE instead of actual issues,"I don't know if I'm looking too much into this, but I've seen people with takes like ""don't use AAVE if you're not black"". I have a pretty nuanced take, and it's that using some AAVE is fine and good ( I use bruh, yo, and sometimes deadass), but some people do use it to mock black people and that isn't ok. I know Vaush made a video on this a while ago, and he had a pretty good take on it  


The thing is that I'm just really confused. Most of the people I know who use those words got it from the internet, memes, and other things. Most of this has been part of Gen Z slang for a while now. I get that we should call out people who appropriate AAVE and that black people are demonized for such, but using it casually while being nonblack doesn't seem like an issue to me, nor is banning non-black people from using AAVE a good solution.  


This [carrd](https://aavenb.carrd.co/) is what inspired me because I understand some words like ""woke"" and ""lit"" can be considered AAVE, but words like simp and sus are mostly just internet slang? The latter I heard from Among Us lmao   


I don't know if I'm just looking into this too much, but I'd like to get a black persons' perspective on this, and I'm still struggling to understand because both sides of the AAVE discourse have good points",2021-08-30 06:32:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/pe5cbq/why_do_people_focus_way_too_much_on_white_people/

Polycat says APY = **11.66%.**

Aave says APR = 3.05% (base) + 1.32% (MATIC) = 4.37%.  If we account for compound interest this is APY = **4.47%.**

So, is Polycat misreporting the APY, or am I missing something?   I've checked these rates over the past week and there is always a large mismatch.

N√§chste Unterst√ºtzung bei 315 -  Der Krypto-Token Aave rangiert an der Spitze der DeFi-Bestenliste, mit Total Value Locked (TVL) auf dem Protokoll ohne Verwahrung bei 14,98 Milliarden US-Dollar.

This seems outrageously high but then again, I have heard some pretty harsh stories about Coinbase fees - hence their IPO

Are my AAVE tokens stuck there for eternity (unless I pay the ransom) or can I move these tokens to another wallet/platform to avoid the pain?

When non-Black people use AAVE/Ebonics, people tend to call them out for a lot of reasons. Other than the obvious, it almost always ends up making the person look unflattering.

I've read more about it and have come to understand that AAVE is culturally important to the people who speak it, and clearly it's viewed in a serious light.

p9hoi1,Ghostiie18,What is AAVE and how do black people actually feel about it?,"Before I go under fire I would just like to say yes im white and no I'm not trying to be racist I just genuinely don't understand and would like someone to explain it to me.

I don't go on Twitter but I still see things from there occasionally and I've run into 2 situations where people came under fire for using aave and I don't quite understand why?

The first one is about Kurtis Conner and a now deleted tweet. He was making a stupid joke like ""what would I say if I was on a bus? This is bussin"" or something like that, and then a bunch of people came at him for using the word bussin because its AAVE? But I see white people use that word all the time

And the other example is with Olivia Rodrigo. I've seen a video about her using AAVE and they talk about lots of words she uses but the one that had me really confused was ""yall."" They were trying to say that yall was AAVE and that only black people should say it I guess? But I grew up in the south in an area that was predominantly white up until a few years ago and we ALL say yall. I've been saying yall way before AAVE was a concept and it genuinely confuses me

So can someone explain this to me? I'm trying to understand it and find out if it's a really issue but I don't trust Twitter",2021-08-23 02:15:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/p9hoi1/what_is_aave_and_how_do_black_people_actually/
p9fp0s,c0wluvr,‚ÄúAAVE‚Äù and most of the black community are taking things too far.,"I‚Äôm so tired of seeing people get ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù for using what is called, ‚ÄúAAVE‚Äù. The Olivia Rodrigo (not a fan, never heard her music) scandal is hilarioussssss. People are really getting mad at her for saying ‚Äúhome girl‚Äù??? I‚Äôm LAUGHING. I‚Äôm not black, but I will STILL call my friends home girls bc that‚Äôs the culture I grew up in. I‚Äôm not going to tip toe around the word. And ‚Äúmiss gurl‚Äù? That‚Äôs only RECENTLY been a thing. I‚Äôm going to use it bc it‚Äôs hilarious to use. I do agree her over exaggerated ‚Äúblaccent‚Äù was cringe. And she forced a lot of what she was saying. 

But I literally watched a video where the narrator said that ‚ÄúAAVE‚Äù is a language that the black community OWNS. Owns???? OWNS??? That‚Äôs just crazy. Nobody owns a language. It‚Äôs not even a language, it‚Äôs a dialect. As long as nobody is saying the n-word, or mocking other people‚Äôs accents - I think we‚Äôre good. Since last year, most of the black community has been taking advantage of the incident with George Floyd by telling people what to do and what not to do. I‚Äôm sorry, but if I grew up in a culture that uses ‚ÄúAAVE‚Äù, I‚Äôm gonna use it. Especially being from Texas. I‚Äôm not going to say ANYTHING offensive. I don‚Äôt make fun of other people‚Äôs color, I don‚Äôt mock accents, I dont think anybody is less than, IM JUST ME. I say y‚Äôall, bc I‚Äôm from Texas. I‚Äôm not gonna get rid of harmless habits.

I think everybody as a society has bigger things to worry ab when it comes to black people rights than someone saying home girl.

p8kk0s,ethereum88,How to make 9.38% APR on pure ETH (Aave Polygon guide),"I try to make this as simple to understand as possible. It's more for intermediate DeFi users since there are some risks (can be mitigated if you are careful.)

The reward is almost double the staking rewards of 5%, on pure ETH portfolio, i.e. there won't be any impermanent loss.

You may ask any questions in the comments, I'll try my best to answer! üò∏

# Step 1: Head over to AAVE (Polygon) and deposit your 1 ETH there (works for any amount of ETH, we write 1 ETH for easy calculations).

Site: [https://app.aave.com/markets](https://app.aave.com/markets)

You can google AAVE, most people will agree it is a safe DeFi platform (it's the largest with most total value locked).

On the surface, it looks like pure ETH only gives 1+% APR there, but that's just the beginning!

&amp;#x200B;

# 2) Borrow DAI &amp; Redeposit DAI (in batches of around $2k)

Keep doing this until you have borrowed around $6k of DAI, i.e. around 1.8X worth of your 1 ETH.

So now your collateral is:

* 1 ETH
* $6k DAI

And you have borrowed $6k DAI.

# 3) Your APR is now &gt;9.3%.

* For your 1 ETH, you are earning 1.58% APR
* For your $6k DAI deposited, you are earning 6.41% APR (effectively 1.8X 6.41% = 11.5% of your original ETH collateral)
* For your $6k DAI borrowed, it costs 5.96-3.90 = 2.06% APR (effectively 1.8X 2.06% = 3.7% of your original ETH collateral

**Overall APR = 1.58% + 11.5% -3.7% = 9.38% APR**

# 4) Main Risk: Your Health Factor should be around 1.2-1.3 now. You need to watch this carefully and prevent it from dipping below 1.

Note: It is actually not as dangerous as it looks, because you have a ton of stablecoins (DAI) to cushion any price drops of ETH.

I've done calculations that such a Health Factor (using this method) is safe as long as ETH does not drop &gt;50% **overnight**.

Rebalance accordingly (withdraw DAI to pay off loans) whenever ETH price dips.",2021-08-21 11:56:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p8kk0s/how_to_make_938_apr_on_pure_eth_aave_polygon_guide/

p71le3,bananaunana,Aave and Curve will be launched at Avalanche [AVAX],"Avalanche, a famous Ethereum-Killer has announced a huge DeFi initiative. Soon, Aave and Curve DeFi will be launched at Avalanche. To be attractive, a total amount of 180 Millions USD of Avalanche Coins are allocated to be distributed when Aave and Curve will launch on Avalanche. 

Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave said: 

&gt;‚ÄúAvalanche consensus is well suited for building DeFi applications due to its scalability features, particularly its high throughput and near-instant finality. The deployment of the Aave Protocol on Avalanche will allow users to leverage low transaction costs without compromising the security of the network.‚Äù. 

Michael Egorov, CEO of Curve said: 

&gt;‚ÄúAs DeFi becomes more and more popular, it becomes clear that Ethereum blockchain is currently struggling to fit all the activity. Thus, it is important to expand to other chains and L2s. We find Avalanche offering an excellent opportunity with its unique decentralized consensus mechanism, high throughput and low transaction fees.‚Äù

p6k4fr,HUMPDAY77,"Why I am insanely bullish on AAVE, and DeFi in General.","Basically, banks want to act as a middleman here because they see the easy potential new profit streams. 

Because DeFi inherently offers 6-10% USDC Apy returns, they know people will continue to be attracted to it as they learn about it.

However, most people aren‚Äôt fluid with crypto and don‚Äôt trust themselves to do swaps on uniswap and move coins between wallets and what not. 

So banks will be an intermediary in the future. You put ur money in a *non FDIC Insured* high yield savings account, and on the back end the banks are lending ur money via DeFi platforms like uniswap, quickswap, Pancakeswap, sushi, etc.

AAVE is my favorite. 16 million coins. Need coins to vote on governance of the platform. So the more the platform gets used, the more ppl will want AAVE to vote in governance. 

But the main thing w AAVE is that you need to hold it to get the best rates on the platform. 

So banks as they move their USDC into AAVE protocol to earn 6-10% APY, will also buy loads of AAVE (which has a supply smaller than BTC) so that they can influence decisions on the network, as well as securing the best rates 

It‚Äôs absolutely crazy how obvious of a trade DeFi is going to be in the next decade I seriously think a new financial system arises once we get regulations and banks know what they can and can‚Äôt do from top down. They need to play 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage or face big fines, we can play at the line of scrimmage.

TLDR: Regulations actually Bullish. DeFi/eth are going to be very lucrative trades for the next decade, in my view.",2021-08-18 12:32:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p6k4fr/why_i_am_insanely_bullish_on_aave_and_defi_in/

p5qxvo,thebubrub,Aave on Polygon Question- atokens and/or matokens?,"Hello friends,

I am relatively new to using both Aave and the matic network.  In doing quite a bit of reading on both, I see a lot of mention about receiving ""atokens"" when depositing in Aave - they are interest bearing tokens.  My understanding is that if using Aave on polygon, you would instead receive ""matokens"" - these are just the interest bearing tokens for polygon.  Further, I could possibly then take these tokens over to curve finance and stake them there.

1. Is the above correct?
2. If yes, how do I see my ""matokens' in my metamask wallet?  I see none, after depositing. I have added the ""maDai"" token to the metamask wallet, as I have deposited Dai tokens in Aave, but it shows a zero balance.  I can't see any indication in metamask that I have ever received any interest bearing tokens by using Aave on polygon.  However, I can confirm with certainty that I have indeed deposited (and some borrowing) on Aave and am gaining interest payments.

What am i missing here?",2021-08-17 06:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/p5qxvo/aave_on_polygon_question_atokens_andor_matokens/

p5qxvo,thebubrub,Aave on Polygon Question- atokens and/or matokens?,"Hello friends,

I am relatively new to using both Aave and the matic network.  In doing quite a bit of reading on both, I see a lot of mention about receiving ""atokens"" when depositing in Aave - they are interest bearing tokens.  My understanding is that if using Aave on polygon, you would instead receive ""matokens"" - these are just the interest bearing tokens for polygon.  Further, I could possibly then take these tokens over to curve finance and stake them there.

1. Is the above correct?
2. If yes, how do I see my ""matokens' in my metamask wallet?  I see none, after depositing. I have added the ""maDai"" token to the metamask wallet, as I have deposited Dai tokens in Aave, but it shows a zero balance.  I can't see any indication in metamask that I have ever received any interest bearing tokens by using Aave on polygon.  However, I can confirm with certainty that I have indeed deposited (and some borrowing) on Aave and am gaining interest payments.

What am i missing here?",2021-08-17 06:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/p5qxvo/aave_on_polygon_question_atokens_andor_matokens/

p1u3qb,No_Aioli_4344,Please go and show Aave some Love,"TL;DR Go here https://governance.aave.com/ and show Aave how you would like it, if they would come to Harmony.


Alright, so i usually would never tell anyone to shill stuff in different communities, because it is a shitty thing to do, but this is different. If you havent seen it allready, let me bring you up to speed.

The Harmony-Team made a proposal to bring Aave to the Harmony Mainnet and the Aave community is now looking at the Harmony projekt and there will be snapshot vote later this month. And you may don't think that this is a big deal, but it is actually very important. Aave makes Defi more comfortable.
And it will most likely cause a lot more TVL on Harmony. And that will cause more projekts to come to Harmony and so on and so on.

The reason why i am telling you this, is because you can help to make that happen. All you got to do is go to governance.aave.com, sign up and go to the Harmony proposal. Then just comment why you would think it is a good idea for Aave to come to Harmony. Talk about your experience with Harmony. Like comments that you agree with and just be as nice as you guys are on this sub. You don't need to say stuff like ""I would buy Aave if it would come to harmony"" or something like that. You don't need to lie about harmonys numbers or overexaggerate either. Harmony speaks for itself. Just show some love, that is all we can do right now.

I know there is a lot of fucked up shit going on in the USA right now, but Harmony still has its best days ahead of itself imo.",2021-08-11 01:34:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/harmony_one/comments/p1u3qb/please_go_and_show_aave_some_love/

* Apricot Finance is the first DeFi project on Solana to do the lending-and-borrowing service.üí∞
* It will minimize the liquidation penalties unlike other traditional lending-and-borrowing projects such as AAVE, Curve.
* Any new features?ü§î
* üôãOrderbook-based fixed rate loans (unsure about the tech behind, still seeking for answer from their Discord)
* ‚úäClose to zero collateral loans (Keeping an eye on this! It will save a lot if it actually works!)
* A humongous and supportive community with over 25k members on their discord channel (Disclaimer: I am one of them)
* What makes Apricot so special? üåª
* It has a very experienced team with over 20+ developers and managers in the team. They have spent over a year on this project by surviving through various market conditions and overcoming many obstacles. They are working actively on new features to push the project one step ahead of other borrowing-and-lending projects.

I think I have to send the AAVE from [FTX.US](https://FTX.US) to an eth wallet first?  Something like Metamask?  And then I can go to the AAVE website and send the AAVE from Metamask to AAVE??

What are the fees to send the AAVE to the wallet (like Metamask) and from the wallet to AAVE?  Do you have to pay high ETH gas fees (something like 0.05 ETH??).  I only have a few hundred dollars of AAVE and if it's 0.05 ETH to transfer, it's not going to be worth it.

oztpw0,spartybasketball,How do I bring my AAVE from FTX.US to stake?,"Hello.  I'm a newbie.  I only know the Solana world and I have staked solana in the past.  I'm trying to learn how to bring my AAVE from [FTX.US](https://FTX.US) to AAVE for staking.  Can someone tell me a simple way to do this?

I think I have to send the AAVE from [FTX.US](https://FTX.US) to an eth wallet first?  Something like Metamask?  And then I can go to the AAVE website and send the AAVE from Metamask to AAVE??

What are the fees to send the AAVE to the wallet (like Metamask) and from the wallet to AAVE?  Do you have to pay high ETH gas fees (something like 0.05 ETH??).  I only have a few hundred dollars of AAVE and if it's 0.05 ETH to transfer, it's not going to be worth it.

I'm exploring DeFi and the benefits of DeFi not being connected to the legacy banking system and KYC etc really resonates with me.

I hold BTC right now and eventually want $30,000 but in ¬£GBP in the UK.

I want to make monthly deposits to pay off the loan.

Could someone help me model out what borrowing USD $30,000 might look like in terms of what I've shared and the following...

\- Monthly interest payments

\- Risk of interest movements

\- Yield farming benefits

\- The amount of collateral I'd need to deposit. I ideally want 50% LTV.

\- I'd ideally put extra BTC on the network and loan it out to earn interest but also to have it there ready for a margin call.

\- Margin Calls / Reverse Margin

\- The most efficient process / route of moving BTC onto the AAVE network

\- Process of getting $30,000 and then ¬£GBP back into the UK

oxndrs,cryptic_addict,u/gmitools made a Web App to help Aave users avoid Liquidation,"Hello all,

As a borrower/lender on Aave, we've always had a tough time figuring out one simple number: **at what BTC/ETH price am I going to be liquidated?** Health factor is not a very intuitive statistic, and it's a tricky question if you have both stable/non-stable assets as collateral and borrows.

So, [u/gmitools](https://np.reddit.com/u/gmitools/) made a web app to figure this out...

[http://gmi.tools/aave/](http://gmi.tools/aave/)

Here's a good sample address to test (with plenty of activity on both Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon): *0x4125caF9dD93EC6AD7A4C668EC55102F8F18203a*

The app:

* Reads Aave deposits/borrows from your wallet (supports Aave on both Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon), or allows you to add them manually
* Assumes that non-stable assets move at the same rate, giving you the market dip or increase % that leads to your liquidation
* Shows BTC/ETH prices at your liquidation, along with the other assets you own
* Provides an interactive simulator to show your health factor in various market conditions

Feedback much appreciated! What other features would you like to see?

I‚Äôve 0.8 AAVE ($250) in Trust Wallet and I want to either convert it to ETH or transfer it Binance and trade it there. 

My problem is the network fee keeps changing and is currently &gt;$55 which seems high right?

At first I tried trading it in trust wallet from AAVE to ETH. It said I‚Äôd receive 0.0987 ETH which seemed about right and that the network fee would be $5.67 worth of ETH. I executed that and it carried out something called a ‚Äúsmart contract call‚Äù which completed but I still have my AAVE and $5.67 less ETH. If I follow the same process to try again I now get a different screen with 1% slippage and a network fee of &gt;$60. 

Earlier the network fee to transfer out was $16 but as I don‚Äôt hold any ETH in the wallet, by the time I‚Äôd transferred $20 over it was a fee of $36 and has kept going up. 

Am I missing something or do I just wait for gas fees to drop?",2021-08-03 22:28:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ox4mor/cheapest_way_to_get_aave_out_of_trust_wallet/

ow4d78,gknix,Aave lending how would it help increasing yield ? (Newbie),"Hi all,

Disclaimer as I‚Äôm still learning Defi and came across a straightforward question that I can‚Äôt seem to think through.  

Currently using matic network info Aave. Most lending rates are about 4%-6% with the extra matic rewards and I seem to be missing something :

Scenario 1: Lending to Aave worth $100 coins at 4% APY. Borrow 50% ($50) to yield farm or stake etc at 50% APY. Borrowing 50% LTV to give yourself leeway so your collateral is sufficient and not taken away in case of volatility 
This will earn : $4 + $25 is total rewards after one year. 

Scenario 2: use the $100 coins and directly yield farm or stake at 50% APY. 
This will earn : $50 total rewards after one year. 

Why would anyone lend in Aave (or any other lend/borrow) platform ?",2021-08-02 09:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/ow4d78/aave_lending_how_would_it_help_increasing_yield/

ü•á Private Presales and Private Sales raised 40+ BNB. 150 Presale filled in seconds. Even though some came for FUD, there was nothing unhealthy. Devs are really unbelievably trusted and known people.

They are clear glass transparent on their management, ultra-safe money management, and attentive on what they are doing. They totally feel responsible about the money they manage. Other than Marketing(3%) and Community Fund Wallets (2%), They won't have the tokens from the start which is ultra-safe for any kind of dump at the start as security.

ü•á The most intriguing thing is the RAAVEngine Wallet that is controlling Buying back and Burning to the dead wallet. Why it is important? Because every single dev team out there is using this wallet to control the supply on their own. And the automatic contracts positioning stupidly and projects are going bad with a weak point. But these guys found a solution that makes it ultra-smart and safe at the same time.

ü•á The innovative RAAVEngine Wallet has a unique blockage function inside that blocks leakage from that wallet infinitely. The smart contract is defined as blocking any transfers from RAAVEngine wallet to anywhere except buying and burning. No exception. It means It will have only options of buy and burn. The BNB that are being collected inside, will be there forever. Haha. This is the nicest Guarantee for people who wants to join for a safe contract.
Their approach on Whitelisting participant choosing was awesome. They picked attentively the wallets that have money but no nonce (which means manipulative, bad wallets) and removed them from the whitelist to create a much better and healthy structure for securing everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

ü•á First of all, The Dev team is fully experienced in many projects and community creations like AAVE, Compound, Ethereum kind of big guys. All have management experience and they are legit and they even sent all the communications they made with the solidity experts under the hood in terms of safety and trust. Their purpose is to spread De-Fi awareness on the most basic level in BSC. Especially before the big bull run.

&amp;#x200B;

ü•á They are clear glass transparent on their management, ultra-safe money management, and attentive on what they are doing. They totally feel responsible about the money they manage. Other than Marketing(3%) and Community Fund Wallets (2%), They won't have the tokens from the start which is ultra-safe for any kind of dump at the start as security.

&amp;#x200B;

ü•á The most intriguing thing is the RAAVEngine Wallet that is controlling Buying back and Burning to the dead wallet. Why it is important? Because every single dev team out there is using this wallet to control the supply on their own. And the automatic contracts positioning stupidly and projects are going bad with a weak point. But these guys found a solution that makes it ultra-smart and safe at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

ü•á The innovative RAAVEngine Wallet has a unique blockage function inside that blocks leakage from that wallet infinitely. The smart contract is defined as blocking any transfers from RAAVEngine wallet to anywhere except buying and burning. No exception. It means It will have only options of buy and burn. The BNB that are being collected inside, will be there forever. Haha. This is the nicest Guarantee for people who wants to join for a safe contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Their approach on Whitelisting participant choosing was awesome. They picked attentively the wallets that have money but no nonce (which means manipulative, bad wallets) and removed them from the whitelist to create a much better and healthy structure for securing everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

And the fee structure is awesome for the Community Admins/Mods and participants for the community works, the structure is shaped by everyone. There will be airdrops but the better thing is that they will have fees for the ones who work for the community shills/management and campaigns for spreading the word.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear RAAVERS,

ü•á Private Presales and Private Sales raised 40+ BNB. Now is the time for Dxsale Presale with 150 BNB Hardcap. Get in, in case they can open the public presale. There were

ü•á First of all, The Dev team is fully experienced in many projects and community creations like AAVE, Compound, Ethereum kind of big guys. All have management experience and they are legit and they even sent all the communications they made with the solidity experts under the hood in terms of safety and trust. Their purpose is to spread De-Fi awareness on the most basic level in BSC. Especially before the big bull run.

ü•á They are clear glass transparent on their management, ultra-safe money management, and attentive on what they are doing. They totally feel responsible about the money they manage. Other than Marketing(3%) and Community Fund Wallets (2%), They won't have the tokens from the start which is ultra-safe for any kind of dump at the start as security.

ü•á The most intriguing thing is the RAAVEngine Wallet that is controlling Buying back and Burning to the dead wallet. Why it is important? Because every single dev team out there is using this wallet to control the supply on their own. And the automatic contracts positioning stupidly and projects are going bad with a weak point. But these guys found a solution that makes it ultra-smart and safe at the same time.

ü•á The innovative RAAVEngine Wallet has a unique blockage function inside that blocks leakage from that wallet infinitely. The smart contract is defined as blocking any transfers from RAAVEngine wallet to anywhere except buying and burning. No exception. It means It will have only options of buy and burn. The BNB that are being collected inside, will be there forever. Haha. This is the nicest Guarantee for people who wants to join for a safe contract.

Their approach on Whitelisting participant choosing was awesome. They picked attentively the wallets that have money but no nonce (which means manipulative, bad wallets) and removed them from the whitelist to create a much better and healthy structure for securing everyone.

And the fee structure is awesome for the Community Admins/Mods and participants for the community works, the structure is shaped by everyone. There will be airdrops but the better thing is that they will have fees for the ones who work for the community shills/management and campaigns for spreading the word.

Their approach on Whitelisting participant choosing was awesome. They picked attentively the wallets that have money but no nonce (which means manipulative, bad wallets) and removed them from the whitelist to create a much better and healthy structure for securing everyone.

And the fee structure is awesome for the Community Admins/Mods and participants for the community works, the structure is shaped by everyone. There will be airdrops but the better thing is that they will have fees for the ones who work for the community shills/management and campaigns for spreading the word.

The BNB that are being collected inside, will be there forever. Haha. This is the nicest Guarantee for people who wants to join for a safe contract.

Their approach on Whitelisting participant choosing was awesome. They picked attentively the wallets that have money but no nonce (which means manipulative, bad wallets) and removed them from the whitelist to create a much better and healthy structure for securing everyone.

And the fee structure is awesome for the Community Admins/Mods and participants for the community works, the structure is shaped by everyone. There will be airdrops but the better thing is that they will have fees for the ones who work for the community shills/management and campaigns for spreading the word.

I‚Äôm trying to test out DeFi so I bridged some ETH to Polygon and deposited some WETH into Aave. Now I‚Äôm trying to borrow a bit of USDC against this but I‚Äôm told to pay pretty high gas fees every time. I thought the whole point of using the Polygon network was the low fees.

Am I doing something wrong or am I missing a step somewhere? Some guidance would be appreciated!",2021-07-30 06:20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ou7r8x/looking_for_some_guidance_on_aave/

ou5mfv,New-Principle6184,Many phrases people get backlash for using are not really Aave,"I hope this doesn't come across disrespectful, of course there a lot of phrases that are Aave and should not be used by people that aren't black, as is the general opinion of the black community, especially on twitter. But certain phrases that a lot of people are ""cancelled"" for using aren't really Aave. For example saying ""period"" was a thing before it became slang, like another way of saying end of story.. Anyway this will sound dumb to people that aren't aware of this type of thing but if you use twitter a lot you know this happens a lot on there. Olivia Rodrigo getting criticism for talking like that is what brought this to mind, here's the video link if any of you want to see: [Olivia Rodrigo compilation using Aave](https://twitter.com/beytilldawn/status/1420466512343838720?s=21)(obviously a lot of it is Aave and very cringeworthy to see her use it but, is ""af"" really Aave, isn't it just an abbreviation..)

ü•á Private Sales are over just yesterday. Now guess what? It is time for the Whitelisted and public presale Launch! Let me tell you the details.

ü•á First of all, The Dev team is fully experienced in many projects and community creations like AAVE, Compound, Ethereum kind of big guys in De-Fi Space. All have management experience and they are legit and they even sent all the communications they made with the solidity experts under the hood in terms of safety and trust. Their purpose is to spread De-Fi awareness on the most basic level in BSC. Especially before the big bull run.

ü•á They have a unique approach to the management of wallets. There will be 5 different wallets defined in the system for team management, they won't have the tokens from the start which is ultra-safe for any kind of dump at the start.

ü•á The most intriguing thing is the RAAVEngine Wallet that is controlling Buying back and Burning to the dead wallet. Why it is important? Because every single dev team out there is using this wallet to control the supply on their own. And the automatic contracts positioning stupidly and projects are going bad with a weak point. But these guys found a solution that makes it ultra-smart and safe at the same time.

ü•á The innovative RAAVEngine Wallet has a unique blockage function inside that blocks leakage from that wallet infinitely. The smart contract is defined as blocking any transfers from RAAVEngine wallet to anywhere except buying and burning. No exception. It means It will have only options of buy and burn. The BNB that are being collected inside, will be there forever. Haha. This is the nicest Guarantee for people who wants to join for a safe contract.

And the fee structure is awesome for the Community Admins/Mods and participants for the community works. There will be some airdrops but the better thing is that they will have fees for the ones who work for the community shills/management and campaigns for spreading the word.

BabyAave Features :

‚úÖ FAIR LAUNCH

‚úÖ NO PRE-LAUNCH AIRDROP

‚úÖ ANTI-BOT SNIPING AND HIDDEN CONTRACT

‚úÖ ANTI-DUMP LOGIC

‚úÖ DIVIDEND TRACKING TOKEN

‚úÖ 10% REDISTRIBUTION IN TOKENS

‚úÖ 3% AUTO LP

‚úÖ 1% Baby WALLET

Our team chose a stealth launch for many reasons. We think this is much better than a pre-sale launch. And you can see for yourself if you study other projects and their launches. Fewer bots, no token sales during listing on PancakeSwap, everyone has the same purchase conditions, proof that the team has money and serious intentions for development, since liquidity will be added by the team and locked for 12 months, more organic launch and trading volume.

-----------------------------

SAFETY FEATURES!

‚úÖ Locked Liquidity

Initial liquidity will be locked for a minimum of 12 months to provide holders with peace of mind that the token can always be exchanged. A trusted 3rd party, MUDRA, will operate as the middle man to ensure that all raised liquidity is locked in a secure locker for the full timeframe.

‚úÖ Contract Audit

In an effort to increase transparency and ensure security, the team has purchased a top-tier audit with CERTIK.

The audit will be published on AUGUST 2 (4 days after launch). Due to the fact that this company has long queues from other projects. We made a prepayment and spent a lot of money, and we hope you will appreciate it.

üìù Verified and Latest Version

The contract code will be verified on BscScan and fully open. You can study it before buying our token. Also, our code will be written on the latest version f the compiler, which excludes the possibility of ""honeypot"" or other fraudulent manipulations.

Anti-Dump Logic

Price protection features such as max tx on sells are included. Any transaction selling more than 0.1% of total supply will be rejected. This prevents massive one time sells that drastically alter the token price.

After a long wait on Aave, finally I was excited to deposit some Amples and earn some percentage on my deposit.

oq3bdl,GeeAkpan,EPNS gets into collaboration with Aave to get Push notifications to Aave users,"A major part of the Web3 ecosystem is Decentralized finance (DeFi) 

&amp;#x200B;

This structure has already gained prominence

While more users and institutions are getting into DeFi, they need tools to match the user experience of Web2  smartphone apps and tools. EPNS collaboration with Aave gives an opportunity for their protocol to be made better this creating a great standard for decentralized notifications.

EPNS collaboration and pilot program with Aave is two faceted:

The first goal is the development of a notification standard that meets the demanding requirements of liquidity protocol users of DeFi.

Aave users will gain access to subscribe to alerts as decline in health factor of their loan, new assets becoming available for borrowing, the risk of being liquidated, borrow or deposit rate exceeding preset thresholds, governance proposals being approved, and so on.

Also, Aave‚Äôs team of experts will provide great input to improve the security, scalability, usability, and adoption of EPNS.

Aave has made waves on the DeCi ecosystem and given it Stability. EPNS is excited to come in collaboration with this great project to advance DeFi.

For more updates on our journey as we transform DeFi and push notifications, stay tuned.

opzc3j,Infinite-Ad-6747,DPI (DeFi Pulse Index) is gonna be added as collateral to the AAVE V2 market.,"Why did this news surprise me so much?

Smart idea. not investment advice!

What is [DPI](https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi)? - It‚Äôs a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market

**1. Leverage.**

By placing DPI as collateral, you can take either the same DPI or an asset that will be less volatile (ETH) as a loan and buy DPI using a loan. Thus, you make **x1.5** on the asset. The logical step is to make a flexible leverage index as it is implemented in Indexcoop: [ETH2x-FLI](https://www.indexcoop.com/ethfli) and [BTC2x-FLI](https://www.indexcoop.com/btcfli). In the future, this can give x3.5 values to your deposit, where you risk only % of the loan that you take on AAVE if you borrow DPI

**2. One place.**

This is a cool opportunity to have only 1 asset (DPI index) instead of **14** defi tokens. You can do it yourself, but you will fuck up to manage and rebalance, and then throw it as collateral and take a loan for it ‚Äî the high gas fee is an enemy for farmers. 

**3. Farming.**

The loan that you take back in DPI, for which you pay %, you can throw into farming on SUSHI: **DPI/WETH** (12% in the SUSHI token) or **sUSD**(synthetix‚Äôs stablecoin**)/DPI** (31% in the SUSHI token), you pay off the loan and still earn on top of the token. Here I really want to see the relationship of DPI and **ETH2x-FLI** as a pair on sushi, so that it would be a leverage position on **1.5 DPI assets** (DEFI tokens) and **ETH (x2).**

&amp;#x200B;

**Example: There is $10k**

DPI: $7500 (75%)

ETH: $2500 (25%)

\- you buy DPI, put it as collateral in AAVE, you get the opportunity to take a loan for 50% of the collateral (Loan To Value), here you can see the definition of the [metrics](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters) 

\- you take a loan in DPI

\- you exchange your ETH in WETH, through uniswap or sushiswap

\- you go to the [sushi](https://app.sushi.com/farm), adding [liquidity](https://app.sushi.com/add/ETH)

\- stake like LP DPI/WETH on sushi

&amp;#x200B;

**As a result:**

\- on aave $7500 in DPI

\- $5000 in staking as DPI/WETH

\- $12000 is working, + interest coverage on the loan and earnings on the SUSHI token 

&amp;#x200B;

It should work if you are able to take a loan in DPI from AAVE, if not, take a loan in ETH, then be careful of the metric (Liquidation Threshold), so that you are not lekvidirovat if DPI falls in price and you do not have time to deposit collateral. Profit to all!

onpby5,Adremy,Aave Founder Announces Plans to Create Twitter on Ethereum this Year,"Stank Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave, stated that the DeFi platform plans to establish a Twitter alternative on Ethereum this year. Through this platform, users can monetize their content and manage network rules.

Kulechov said: ‚ÄúWe believe that content creators should own their audiences in a permissionless fashion, where anyone can build new user experiences by using the same on-chain social graph and data.‚Äù

On Saturday, Kulechov hinted at this development in a tweet:

‚ÄúSince Jack is going to build Aave on Bitcoin, Aave should build Twitter on Ethereum‚Äù.

Kulechov refers to Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who plans to decentralize Twitter and create a Bitcoin-based DeFi. Last week, he announced on Twitter that the latter would become a division of his mobile payment company Square.

onir1f,bestchange_pr,AAVE is developing an analogue of Twitter based on the Ethereum blockchain,"The developers of the DeFi protocol Aave are working on a Twitter analogue. It is planned that the social network will operate based on the Ethereum blockchain. The project may face green light even this year.

According to AAVE CEO Stani Kulechov, users would have options to monetize their content. There is also a statement from the developer's team that the new project would solve some pressing issues of social networks. For example, AAVE wants to exclude any censoring issues.

On the other hand, the Block analyst Larry Chermak believes that a social network based on ETH is a dead born project. The analyst insists that the ETH blockchain would be just overloaded without any chance.

Besides, Chermak points every social network needs to be censored. Otherwise, it might become a place for posting forbidden and illegal content.",2021-07-20 01:25:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestchange/comments/onir1f/aave_is_developing_an_analogue_of_twitter_based/

&amp;#x200B;

Blockchain ile devletin ve h√ºk√ºmetin kontrol√º dƒ±≈üƒ±nda olan finans kavramƒ± geldi. Kripto para birimleri son birka√ß yƒ±lda √∂fke oldu. Ancak ≈üimdi daha cesur ve daha taze bir fikir ortaya √ßƒ±kƒ±yor ve buna merkezi olmayan finans (DeFi) deniyor. DeFi, insanlarƒ±n g√ºce sahip olduƒüu ve aramalarƒ± yapmak i√ßin geleneksel finans sistemlerine g√ºvenmek zorunda olmadƒ±klarƒ± fikridir. Aave, kullanƒ±cƒ±larƒ±n teminat yatƒ±rmadan kripto √∂d√ºn√ß almalarƒ±nƒ± saƒülayan bir DeFi projesidir. Bor√ß verenler ayrƒ±ca para yatƒ±rabilir ve parmaƒüƒ±nƒ± bile kƒ±pƒ±rdatmadan hemen faiz kazanmaya ba≈ülayabilir. Kendisini ‚Äúpara piyasalarƒ±nƒ±n yaratƒ±lmasƒ±nƒ± saƒülayan a√ßƒ±k kaynaklƒ± ve g√∂zetimsiz bir protokol‚Äù olarak tanƒ±mlayan Aave, teminatsƒ±z krediler fikrini ortaya atarak DeFi'de etkili bir konum elde etti. Bununla, proje hakkƒ±nda daha fazlasƒ±nƒ± √∂ƒürenelim! Aave (LEND) Coin Nedir? Nasƒ±l alƒ±nƒ±r? Geleceƒüi.

&amp;#x200B;

Aave Nedir?

&amp;#x200B;

2018'de piyasaya s√ºr√ºlen Londra merkezli Aave, merkezi olmayan ve e≈üler arasƒ± bir ≈üekilde √ßok √ße≈üitli kripto para birimlerini √∂d√ºn√ß vermenizi ve √∂d√ºn√ß almanƒ±zƒ± saƒülayan Ethereum blok zinciri √ºzerinde √ßalƒ±≈üan bir DeFi platformudur. Aave, adƒ±nƒ± Fince ""hayalet"" kelimesinden alƒ±r. Ekip, kullanƒ±cƒ±larƒ±n ilgisini √ßeken s√ºrekli geli≈üimi ve yaratƒ±cƒ± teknolojiyi yansƒ±tmak i√ßin bu adƒ± se√ßti.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Proje, teminatsƒ±z krediler ve ‚Äúoran deƒüi≈ütirme‚Äù gibi DeFi alanƒ±na se√ßkin √∂zellikler getiriyor. Aave, kullanƒ±cƒ±larƒ±n bir yatƒ±rƒ±m portf√∂y√º olu≈üturabilecekleri √ße≈üitli kripto pazarlarƒ± olu≈üturmak i√ßin Aave Protokol√ºn√º kullanƒ±r.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Aave Nasƒ±l √áalƒ±≈üƒ±r?

&amp;#x200B;

Aave ile dijital varlƒ±klarƒ±nƒ±z √ºzerinde pasif faiz kazanabilirsiniz. Bir DeFi protokol√º ile kripto para √∂d√ºn√ß verebilir ve √∂d√ºn√ß alabilirsiniz.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bor√ß verenler, jetonlarƒ± likidite havuzlarƒ±na yatƒ±rabilir ve Aave faiz getiren jetonlarƒ± veya aTokenlarƒ± alabilir. √ñrneƒüin, USDC yatƒ±rabilir ve aUSDC alabilir veya DAI yatƒ±rabilir ve aDAI alabilirsiniz. a Jetonlar yatƒ±rƒ±ldƒ±ƒüƒ±nda basƒ±lƒ±r ve kullanƒ±ldƒ±ƒüƒ±nda yakƒ±lƒ±r. aTokens'ta kazanƒ±lan faiz, talep ve arz gibi piyasa ko≈üullarƒ±na g√∂re deƒüi≈üir. Mevduat k√ºresel bir likidite piyasasƒ±nda bulunduƒüundan, talep y√ºksek olduƒüunda faiz oranlarƒ± y√ºkselir.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mevduat sahipleri varlƒ±klarƒ±nƒ± istedikleri zaman √ßekebilirler. T√ºm s√ºre√ß, pozisyonunuzu aktif olarak y√∂netmek veya izlemek zorunda kalmadan otomatik olarak ger√ßekle≈üir. Aave ayrƒ±ca flash kredileri de kolayla≈ütƒ±rƒ±r . Desteklenen varlƒ±klarƒ± √∂d√ºn√ß almak i√ßin teminat yatƒ±rarak kredi alabilirsiniz. Ek olarak, orijinal depozitonuzun kilidini a√ßmak i√ßin krediyi, olu≈üan bor√ßlarla birlikte geri √∂deyebilirsiniz.

**Trade AAVE Now:** Available at July 14th 7PM PT

Aave is an open source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets. The decentralized finance application allows users to deposit certain tokens and earn real-time interest from their deposits as other users borrow those tokens at a higher interest rate. In addition to this bank-like operation, Aave also offers flash loans, which enable users to pay a small fee to borrow very large amounts of token value so long as they pay back the loans within the same transaction.

**To learn more about AAVE, check out our blog:** [https://blog.okcoin.com/2021/07/14/cardano-and-aave-are-now-on-okcoin/](https://blog.okcoin.com/2021/07/14/cardano-and-aave-are-now-on-okcoin/)

oehzoe,dontbearichardD,Noob here: Best/cheapest moving partial LP from DEX to AAVE?,"I am kind of paranoid with my AAVE health factor so I'll often pull some out of a LP when I go to bed if it's getting lowish.  Is there a particular platform that makes this any cheaper or easier than Quickswap?

It's a bit of a process of having to remove LP tokens, then pull out %, then swap back to USDC (pay swap fee), put in aave, then have to redeposit the LP token on QS.

This isn't that bad but I'm losing on the swap back obviously.  I'm just wondering if there is somewhere that I can do this cheaper/easier so that I can put part of my capital into that platform for when I need quick/cheap AAVE deposit.

Is there a better way to do this to cheaply get liquidity onto aave?  Or do all DEXes that allow LP pretty much have the same swap fees/withdrawl process?",2021-07-06 06:33:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/maticnetwork/comments/oehzoe/noob_here_bestcheapest_moving_partial_lp_from_dex/
oeg4dp,Curi0usJ0e,Thoughts on Lending protocols like Aave?,"I am pretty new to Crypto, and was wondering what are your thoughts on Lending protocols like Aave for example? Judging by the current crypto market, seems like the token is doing pretty well against others, but my question is about the utility of the Protocol itself.

Since one would have to put some collateral  to borrow, and assuming it's in any other crypto, wouldn't it be much easier to borrow from a traditional bank instead, since you could potentially put any other assets (such as your house) as collateral?

Also the concept of Flash loans that do not require a collateral is confusing/concerning. The whitepaper mentions, if the amount returned is less than what was borrowed, the transaction is reverted. What if the borrowed amount was traded with other tokens/crypto or spent? Would the protocol be able to revert those changes as well? What if it was spent to get tangible goods for example? There are many things described in the paper that I didn't understand, but this sounds like a risky concept with potential of exploitation, and I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.

Would be great if someone with more understanding can explain this further. 

And also as a lending protocol with real world utility, what do you guys think about the future of these protocols?",2021-07-06 04:54:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oeg4dp/thoughts_on_lending_protocols_like_aave/

oe3s0t,TobiramaTheSecond,Aave Prepares to Launch Its Permissional Version For Institutional Investors in July,"Aave, one of the leading decentralized Ethereum-based crypto markets, has plans to launch a permissioned version of its platform for institutional investors in July.  

The news came to light after a webinar that featured Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov and  Fireblocks CEO and co-founder Michael Shaulov. According to [an email recap of the discussion](https://twitter.com/TraderNoah/status/1411719489947906048), Aave Pro will be launched in July as a response to ‚Äúextensive demand from various institutions.‚Äù  

The permissioned platform will be launched in partnership with a digital asset custody provider, Fireblocks. The latter will provide verification of customers, allowed to use Aave Pro, as well as implement anti-money laundering and anti-fraud controls for the new platform.   

At the start, the platform will only support four crypto assets: BTC, ETH, AAVE and USDC. Aave Pro‚Äôs pools will be separated from its main platform. The leaked email also notes plans to decentralize governance for Aave Pro in the future.

oe09ej,Galaxyartcat,"AITA for telling my friend, who is white, not to use AAVE, even though I'm also white?","Ok so if you aren't pre-educated on AAVE I don't suggest continuing and I also mostly want opinions from people who are black here as it is more of a black issue. 

Ok so my friend (15M)  was using AAVE in messages about animatronics, specifically he misused the term ""bussin"" but went around and claimed it was because he thought the animatronics were yummy, now I (13M) am a very non-confrontational person. If I am put into a conflict I will avoid eye contact, cry and fidget, thankfully this was over text. I sat there, anxious trying to bring it up in a way that wasn't overbearing but also not beating around the bush. So I said ""Was the AAVE necessary?"" at first, he apologized, but then went on about how I was lecturing him and as a thirteen year old white boy I shouldn't be doing that, especially about what is and isn't offensive, I thought I was being reasonable by bringing up possible misuse. 

I at this point was getting slightly ticked off, so I came back with ""I've seen opinions, and I'm not going to be also lectured by a fellow teenage white boy on how you think it's fine""  he said he'd be genuinely apologetic about it if called on it. But then proceeded to call me a child (We are a year apart I'm turning 14 in literally 25 days) and say its not my place to tell him off. He eventually actually looked into it and said I was probably right but still shouldn't lecture him as another white person. 

Here's the thing: I barely lectured much on the AAVE, I mostly was defending myself and giving reasons I felt that way, not the use itself. 

 He also said ""AAVE people"" which tells me that he likely didn't do much research about it before hand, as there is no such thing as an ""AAVE person"" only black people. 

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, AITA?

odbscf,lance_pt,Aave - average down or wait for ath?,"So, Aave was my rookie mistake in this last bull run. I‚Äôve come into crypto last December and I‚Äôm quite a conservative investor. 

However, right before the big correction I forgot all the basic principals and, almost as an impulse, I bough almost 2 Aave at 597. That‚Äôs pretty much an ath and a couple of weeks after, the price crashed.

Second mistake, didn‚Äôt set up any stop loss.

Now, I‚Äôve less than half my investment and I can‚Äôt see Aave reaching aths in the near future.

Would you guys buy more Aave to average down the cost or simply assume the mistake and hold the bag hoping that one day the price goes up to ath?

It‚Äôs difficult for me to allocate more funds to aave when I think that i should be buying eth instead.",2021-07-04 10:50:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/odbscf/aave_average_down_or_wait_for_ath/

I came across AAVE and from the looks of it, the project seems sustainable in the long term. Marketcap isn't too big (compared to BTC and ETH), max supply is only 16 million, TVL is about $10 billion, and it's currently down 60% from its ATH (seems like a bargain  buy...). Project has been audited about 13 times too. 

That said, is there potential for more growth for this project in the next several years? What are some potential risks/pitfalls that AAVE may have? Would the risks be regulatory based, have anything to do with flash loans, etc?

oaryeo,sponge_hitler,Why would invest in tokens like AAVE or UNI instead of ETH directly?,"hello,

you have read the title. I am wondering why one would choose to invest in a DApp on a smart contract platform instead of the smart contract platform directly. See, I like both Aave and Uniswap, but they depend on Ethereum.

If Ethereum gets replaced with one of thoose ""Ethereum Killers"" then Aave and Uniswap are done too, but both Aave and Uniswap can also be replaced on Ethereum itself. If Ethereum goes up then so will the DApps on it, but ETH has more room to grow because its more useful than just one single asset on Ethereum. So basically it seems like investing in AAVE would be more risky yet also less rewarding than investing in ETH.

What are your thoughts on that?",2021-06-30 15:13:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oaryeo/why_would_invest_in_tokens_like_aave_or_uni/

oaq8re,PM_ME_YOUR_SALSA,Why would someone realistically buy Aave?,"I have been eyeing Aave for a long time (1 year+) because of its blue-chip status. I understand how the protocol works and the token's role in the model, however I can't understand why anyone would wish to use the Aave protocol, when deposit APYs are abysmally low (similar to bank account interest rates for wrapped BTC and ETH). Even on stablecoins, deposit APYs are comparable to holding USD in traditional savings account of some online banks. I've kept an eye on deposit APYs for months, and every time I thought they were just too low for anyone to actually use Aave for lending especially when most CeFi platforms offer 3-4x the returns.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I missing here?  How is Aave so successful with the constantly low deposit APYs and high borrow APYs? I want to believe in the project and invest in it for the long haul (years), but I can't bring myself to invest in a platform whose economics I don't see profitability in.

o9rfo2,Zorubark,Some stuff about writing dialogue for black north american characters in AAVE,"So, I'm writing a story and it's set in the equivalent of england, not really england but has england stuff, and I tried to learn british expressions to not make it weird, I'm not from the USA and people don't really protect british expressions from being used unless they're being used wrong, but AAVE is more protected, and with a good reason of course, a lot of people misuse it while when used by african-americans is seem as not as cool and other bad things

But the problem for my situation is that one day a wise man said ""\[...\]the best way to learn something is to be immersed in it and to make it part of you. While treats are good for making dogs do backflips, true comprehension comes from integrating new things into your daily life.\[...\]"" -*Sam O'Nella*

And I know this works, I started using british slang like dodgy and gobsmacked and started paying more attention to when british youtubers use slang to understand how it's used since only knwoing the meaning isn't enough.

But when it comes to AAVE many people say to not use it if you're not black, and I know just saying ""well some black people on reddit said it's fine I can do it!"" doesn't make much sense since not every black person uses reddit or will see this post, and only relying on articles feels surface level too since there's no real person to tell me what to do in this situation like ""hey you stupid doodoo head just do \[thing they would tell me to do\]""*(I use comedy to hide my awkwardness)*

TL,DR: I wanna make my black american characters use AAVE for accuracy and representation but I only know how to learn to use it properly by ingrading it into my vocabulary my I want to ask actual people to know what I can do since I'm stuck

And don't worry I go to the internet for literally everything I don't know and can't do, so I hope this doesn't seem like asking too much of you since I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do many times :|",2021-06-29 03:25:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/askblackpeople/comments/o9rfo2/some_stuff_about_writing_dialogue_for_black_north/

o8mfh5,doomboyu,AAVE Flash Loans for Arbitrages and Collaterals,"Greetings, hope you all are doing well.

Today, I came across AAVE Flash Loans and one of its use cases i.e. Arbitrages between two or more DEXs. I found it interesting and researched further by going through official guide, Youtube tutorials and few web articles. I was wondering if it's still profitable in terms of finding arbitrage opportunities and making trades. I was seeking guidance and help in terms of tools that can be used for this purpose and insight in your experiences.

Today, I came across AAVE Flash Loans and one of its use cases i.e. Arbitrages between two or more DEXs. I found it interesting and researched further by going through official guide, Youtube tutorials and few web articles. I was wondering if it's still profitable in terms of finding arbitrage opportunities and making trades.

I have 2 screenshots, one from 20/Jun and the other from 24/Jun.

A: Approximate Balance: I assume this went down because it's a combination of DAI + MATIC and that the MATIC value went down. Is this the case?

B: Current Balance: I assume this went up because it is DAI only and I gained a small amount of APY.

C: I assume this is the same value as A and that's why the value went down.

Do I have this correct?

I want to do some staking in REN and AAVE on [polygon.curve.fi](https://polygon.curve.fi) . I understand these are very good projects with good team behind them. But I am trying to understand, how rewards and proposed returns would work in a longer run. If somebody can help me to understand this, would really appreciate.

Suppose if I invest $1050 in REN and $1050 in AAVE staking. REN shows total APY of 11.95% and AAVE shows total APY of 7.72%. With current APY, it tells me $15/month of monthly profits. Is that all I am looking as profit? It doesn't look big that I invest $2000 and after one year I get around $180. Is this how it works or I am missing something?

If I am missing something and it can grow well, I can invest more in it. Please see attached pic and guide.

You might be wondering why anyone would do this... Im looking into it for tax avoidance.  I have some LT gains in ETH, and I dont want to engage in certain types of transactions that could be considered sales with my LT ETH.


EDIT: I know that the total borrow would (eventually) cross over the liquidation threshold via the compounding interest, but I could manage that risk with occasional debt paydowns or further colalleral deposits.",2021-06-18 03:22:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/o25ene/aave_polygon_borrowing_question/

**What is Curve Finance?**

CRV  Finance is one of the most paradoxical and innovative new DeFi  protocols on the crypto market today. It launched in January 2020 with  subsequent launch of a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/DAO)) in August 2002. CRV is the in-house token of the DAO. The DAO uses the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)\-based creation tool, Aragon, to connect multiple [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) used for users‚Äô deposited liquidity.

CRV  is the token of Curve Finance. It is a stable coin-only (DAI, USDT, and  USDC) decentralized exchange (DEX) which (like Uniswap) uses an  automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) to manage [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity).

Curve  Finance has experience exponential growth since the second half of 2020  with month over month user growth. On  June 12th, 2020, Coinmarketcap  noted that Curve&gt;Fi was the largest DEX in terms of TLV, exceeding  both AAVE and Compound with 8.3B in locked value.  Of note, LTV of the  two two platforms is noted to fluctuate and rankings may change from day  to day until one of these two platforms furthers it's net growth enough  to pull away as the leader.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is CRV undervalued in regards to Market Cap to TVL ?**

First,  we have to understand some fundamentals regarding defi metrics. The  total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked  into a DeFi platform. On a platform that does borrowing and lending, the  TVL would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto  the platform, which other users can then borrow. TVL is also being used  as a metric to measure growth. If the TVL of a platform increases it  generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it  is growing.

Like market caps, the TVL can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire DeFi space. On [www.defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/), you can view the TVL for the total DeFi space as well as individual platforms.

The  market cap to TVL ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the  amount of funds locked on the platform. It can be easily found on [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/).  Since the TVL can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can  be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly.  To calculate the market cap to TVL ratio simply divide the market cap by  the TVL. Any value less than 1 means that a platform‚Äôs TVL is higher  than their market cap. CRV has a ratio of less than 1. Specifically,  their Market Cap to LVL Ratio demonstrates an ultra low ratio of .07572  as of 6/12/21.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notable Events in CRV History:**

\-Launch in Jan 2020

\-Launch of DAO with CRV token in Aug 2020

\-Partnership with Fantom on Feburary 25th, 2021

\-Coinbase listing in March 23rd of 2021.

\-Partnership with Polygon to provide an L2 solution for deep stable coin liquidity on April 20

\-Curve V2 went live in Paraswap on June 10th, 2021

**Understanding DeFi Risks and Impermanent Losses:**

Defi  is at the cutting edge of blockchain technology. As with all new  technology, risks are inherent and cannot be completely eliminated.  Curve Finance has attempted to mitigate risk with code and platform  audits to promote transparency. Audit partners noted on their website  include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Mix Bytes.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bug Bounties and Frequent Audits support Protocol Security](https://preview.redd.it/2r59if8j73571.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c3897e05b63c65f7661f87b0d7c43639bede0fc)

&amp;#x200B;

If  you have ever provided liquidity to a liquidity pool just to realise  that some of your coins have gone missing, then you have experienced  impermanent loss. In essence, impermanent loss is a temporary loss of  funds occurring when providing liquidity. It‚Äôs very often explained as a  difference between holding an asset versus providing liquidity in that  asset. Impermanent loss is usually observed in standard liquidity pools  where the liquidity provider (LP) has to provide both assets in a  correct ratio, and one of the assets is volatile in relation to the  other. Although impermanent loss is lessened significantly in a stable  coin pool, it is still present and should be accounted for when  providing liquidty because Curve Finance (like Uniswap) uses a constant  product market maker to maintain a correct ratio of tokens in the pool.

You can estimate potential losses and returns by using the Baller App, [https://baller.netlify.app/](https://baller.netlify.app/), a nifty program which is designed to estimate impermeant losses when providing pool liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Network Usage &amp; Sentiment:**

Curiously,  most retail users are not talking about the Curve.Fi DEX despite the  fact that CRV contains more stablecoins than any other exchange except  Binance AND it has had month over month user growth with an exponential  increase in total locked volume (TLV).

[Credit: https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheShual\/status\/1401482416523550722?s=20](https://preview.redd.it/z9ipc6vl73571.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e952411c8b58d3991762d8129cf0347f4889503d)

&amp;#x200B;

I  suspect the reason for CRV flying under the radar to date is that it‚Äôs  user interface has the appearance of a 1990s era Windows 3.1 platform.  The UI does not engender confidence in the system or provider for a  user-friendly experience.

Fortunately,  this is expected to soon change with unofficial discord confirmation  that an alternative UI is in the works; ETA not specified at this point.

**Curve Finance V2**

The V1 version of [Curve carved a niche](https://www.coindesk.com/pancakeswap-uniswap-sushiswap-crypto-defi-exchange)  for itself as a place to trade stablecoins by creating a new automated  trading model with extremely low slippage, even on very large trades.

On  June 10th, 2021, Curve Finance launched v2 on ETH Polygon; it reflects a  model in which greater liquidity could be achieved on a pool of  volatile assets by [using a dynamic peg](https://curve.fi/files/crypto-pools-paper.pdf).

The V2 version of Curve.Fi is built on [Ethereum layer 2 Polygon](https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-bitcoin-ether-crypto-market-rebounds). The Ethereum version contains [$USDT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click), and the Polygon version contains am3Crv, [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click).

Curve  V2 is analogous to a more automated version of Uni v3.  To wit: under  Uniswap v3, liquidity providers were able to define the prices at which  they were willing to trade. This was powerful because it allowed the AMM  to have much more funds available within the prices people were likely  to want to trade. Previously, a large trade could move an AMM so far out  of line with the market that traders might trade less than they wanted.

This  Uniswap v3 approach requires very active management on the part of LPs.  Curve v2 proposes automating roughly the same system. Basically, it  identifies an internal price peg based on trading on Curve and  concentrates the liquidity around that peg. The peg can move, but it  will only do so if moving doesn‚Äôt cause liquidity providers to incur too  much loss. Stable coin trading pools will remain the same from V1 to  v2.

Defi Dividends noted an  example of how Curve performs against Uni V3 in stable coin trading  pairs of varying amounts. Notably, CRV performed better in ALL ranges  for every stablecoin tested.

&amp;#x200B;

**Locked Value and Defi Metrics:**

Curve has $7.2 billion in total value locked on it now versus $6.4 billion on Uniswap, according to [DeFi Pulse](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-pulse-decentralized-finance-data-site-tvl). It should be noted that Curve has an active [liquidity mining](https://www.coindesk.com/video/what-is-yield-farming-defis-hot-trend-explained) program to incentivize participation and Uniswap does not.

Curve has had [$124 million in trade volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/)  over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Uniswap  has seen $1.5 billion in trade volume over the same period between [version 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and [version 3](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/).

In  terms of DEX, Curve Finance is the #1 provider of liquidity and locked  value with remarkable staying power on the Defi Pulse Index.

As of June 9th, Curve Finance reported that DefiPulse Volume was underreporting. [https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1401832224161423363?s=20](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1401832224161423363?s=20)

They  noted that they had 10 billion in total pool deposits plus daily volume  with another 900million on Polygon. The platform sees an average daily  trading volume of +$166,000,000. Compare this to Uniswap V2 on the same  day with total liquidity of 4.8 billion and 599 million

**Tokenomics:**

There are a total of 3.03b CRV to be entered into circulation. The distribution is as such:

¬∑ 62% to community liquidity providers

¬∑ 30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting

¬∑ 3% to employees with 2 years vesting

¬∑ 5% to the community reserve

**The initial supply of around 1.3b (\~43%) is distributed as such:**

¬∑ 5% to pre-CRV liquidity providers with 1 year vesting

¬∑ 30% to shareholders (team and investors) with 2-4 years vesting

¬∑ 3% to employees with 2 years vesting

¬∑ 5% to the community reserve

TDLR [Curve.Fi](https://cure.fi/) Summary:

\-Curve.Fi  is a highly profitable and growing stablecoin DEX with low slippage and automated market makers

\-Curve.Fi has more stablecoins than Coinbase, or another other DEX/centralized exchange, except Binance

\-CRV  has 10B in locked value (more than sushi AND uni combined). This makes  CRV the second most valuable ETH token by total locked value after AAVE

\-High yields can be generated using the CRV token for staking and liquidity/yield farming

\- Market Cap to TVL ratio is an incredible .07 at present!

\-  Curve.Fi.v2 launched 2 days ago and permits pooled use of  non-stablecoin crypto with more automation than uni v3 with better  value, especially on large (&gt;10M) volume

\-  Late '90s JAVA style UI may have limited retail awareness to date. It  is being replaced in the near future with an alternative UI

\- Polygon, 1inch, Fantom support. May be ported on equilibrium when PolkaDot launches after Kusama's first 5 parachain auctions

\-  Unprecedented month over month exponential growth despite the recent  slump in crypto. The current price of CRV does not reflect its recent   5x TVL since Jan 2021 and 2x growth in TVL since the May 19th liquidity  collapse (unlike most other currently stagnant DEXs).

CRV Finance is one of the most paradoxical and innovative new DeFi protocols on the crypto market today. It launched in January 2020 with subsequent launch of a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/DAO)) in August 2002. CRV is the in-house token of the DAO. The DAO uses the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)\-based creation tool, Aragon, to connect multiple [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) used for users‚Äô deposited liquidity.

**Why is CRV undervalued in regards to Market Cap to TVL ?**

First, we have to understand some fundamentals regarding defi metrics. The total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked into a DeFi platform. On a platform that does borrowing and lending, the TVL would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto the platform, which other users can then borrow. TVL is also being used as a metric to measure growth. If the TVL of a platform increases it generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it is growing.

Like market caps, the TVL can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire DeFi space. On [www.defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/), you can view the TVL for the total DeFi space as well as individual platforms.

The market cap to TVL ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the amount of funds locked on the platform. It can be easily found on [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/). Since the TVL can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly. To calculate the market cap to TVL ratio simply divide the market cap by the TVL. Any value less than 1 means that a platform‚Äôs TVL is higher than their market cap. CRV has a ratio of less than 1. Specifically, their Market Cap to LVL Ratio demonstrates an ultra low ratio of .07572 as of 6/12/21.

**Notable Events in CRV History:**

\-Launch in Jan 2020

\-Launch of DAO with CRV token in Aug 2020

\-Partnership with Fantom on Feburary 25th, 2021

\-Coinbase listing in March 23rd of 2021. 

\-Partnership with Polygon to provide an L2 solution for deep stable coin liquidity on April 20

\-Curve V2 went live in Paraswap on June 10th, 2021

**Understanding DeFi Risks and Impermanent Losses:**

Defi is at the cutting edge of blockchain technology. As with all new technology, risks are inherent and cannot be completely eliminated. Curve Finance has attempted to mitigate risk with code and platform audits to promote transparency. Audit partners noted on their website include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Mix Bytes. 

[Bug Bounties and Frequent Audits support Protocol Security](https://preview.redd.it/firkmjcp60571.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dc9493a25df39dc5b564adad129036cf35e5874)

If you have ever provided liquidity to a liquidity pool just to realise that some of your coins have gone missing, then you have experience impermanent loss. In essence, impermanent loss is a temporary loss of funds occurring when providing liquidity. It‚Äôs very often explained as a difference between holding an asset versus providing liquidity in that asset. Impermanent loss is usually observed in standard liquidity pools where the liquidity provider (LP) has to provide both assets in a correct ratio, and one of the assets is volatile in relation to the other. Although impermanent loss is lessened significantly in a stable coin pool, it is still present and should be accounted for when providing liquidty because Curve Finance (like Uniswap) uses a constant product market maker to maintain a correct ratio of tokens in the pool. 

You can estimate potential losses and returns by using the Baller App, [https://baller.netlify.app/](https://baller.netlify.app/), a nifty program which is designed to estimate impermeant losses when providing pool liquidity. 

**Network Usage &amp; Sentiment:**

Curiously, most retail users are not talking about the Curve.Fi DEX despite the fact that CRV contains more stablecoins than any other exchange except Binance AND it has had month over month user growth with an exponential increase in total locked volume (TLV). 

[Credit: https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheShual\/status\/1401482416523550722?s=20](https://preview.redd.it/ucqebugx60571.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff48bad265b235d99740e829f7991d0275d86fa0)

I suspect the reason for CRV flying under the radar to date is that it‚Äôs user interface has the appearance of a 1990s era Windows 3.1 platform. The UI does not engender confidence in the system or provider for a user-friendly experience. 

Fortunately, this is expected to soon change with unofficial discord confirmation that an alternative UI is in the works; ETA not specified at this point. 

**Curve Finance V2** 

The V1 version of [Curve carved a niche](https://www.coindesk.com/pancakeswap-uniswap-sushiswap-crypto-defi-exchange) for itself as a place to trade stablecoins by creating a new automated trading model with extremely low slippage, even on very large trades.

On June 10th, 2021, Curve Finance launched v2 on ETH Polygon; it reflects a model in which greater liquidity could be achieved on a pool of volatile assets by [using a dynamic peg](https://curve.fi/files/crypto-pools-paper.pdf). 

The V2 version of Curve.Fi is built on [Ethereum layer 2 Polygon](https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-bitcoin-ether-crypto-market-rebounds). The Ethereum version contains [$USDT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click), and the Polygon version contains am3Crv, [$WBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$WETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WETH&amp;src=cashtag_click). 

Curve V2 is analogous to a more automated version of Uni v3.  To wit: under Uniswap v3, liquidity providers were able to define the prices at which they were willing to trade. This was powerful because it allowed the AMM to have much more funds available within the prices people were likely to want to trade. Previously, a large trade could move an AMM so far out of line with the market that traders might trade less than they wanted. 

This Uniswap v3 approach requires very active management on the part of LPs. Curve v2 proposes automating roughly the same system. Basically, it identifies an internal price peg based on trading on Curve and concentrates the liquidity around that peg. The peg can move, but it will only do so if moving doesn‚Äôt cause liquidity providers to incur too much loss. Stable coin trading pools will remain the same from V1 to v2. 

Defi Dividends noted an example of how Curve performs against Uni V3 in stable coin trading pairs of varying amounts. Notably, CRV performed better in ALL ranges for every stablecoin tested.

&amp;#x200B;

**Locked Value and Defi Metrics:**

Curve has $7.2 billion in total value locked on it now versus $6.4 billion on Uniswap, according to [DeFi Pulse](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-pulse-decentralized-finance-data-site-tvl). It should be noted that Curve has an active [liquidity mining](https://www.coindesk.com/video/what-is-yield-farming-defis-hot-trend-explained) program to incentivize participation and Uniswap does not.

Curve has had [$124 million in trade volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/) over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Uniswap has seen $1.5 billion in trade volume over the same period between [version 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and [version 3](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/).

In terms of DEX, Curve Finance is the #1 provider of liquidity and locked value with remarkable staying power on the Defi Pulse Index.

As of June 9th, Curve Finance reported that DefiPulse Volume was underreporting. https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1401832224161423363?s=20

They noted that they had 10 billion in total pool deposits plus daily volume with another 900million on Polygon. The platform sees an average daily trading volume of +$166,000,000. Compare this to Uniswap V2 on the same day with total liquidity of 4.8 billion and 599 million

TDLR [Curve.Fi](https://Cure.Fi) Summary:

\-Curve.Fi  is a highly profitable and growing stablecoin DEX with low slippage and automated market makers

\-Curve.Fi has more stablecoins than Coinbase, or another other DEX/centralized exchange, except Binance

\-CRV has 10B in locked value (more than sushi AND uni combined). This makes CRV the second most valuable ETH token by total locked value after AAVE

\-High yields can be generated using the CRV token for staking and liquidity/yield farming

\- Market Cap to TVL ratio is an incredible .07 at present! 

\- Curve.Fi.v2 launched 2 days ago and permits pooled use of non-stablecoin crypto with more automation than uni v3 with better value, especially on large (&gt;10M) volume

\- Late '90s JAVA style UI may have limited retail awareness to date. It is being replaced in the near future with an alternative UI

\- Polygon, 1inch, Fanton support. May be ported on equilibrium when PolkaDot launches after Kusama's first 5 parachain auctions

\- Unprecedented month over month exponential growth despite the recent slump in crypto. The current price of CRV does not reflect its recent  5x TVL since Jan 2021 and 2x growth in TVL since the May 19th liquidity collapse (unlike most other currently stagnant DEXs).

ny493l,ethereum88,AAVE Strategy with ETH as collateral (Surprisingly quite resistant against price fluctuations),"**Warning: This could be potentially risky. Do comment below if you spot any flaw with this strategy!**

I recently did some calculations on using Aave with ETH as collateral to borrow stablecoins. There is some risk, but it is surprisingly quite resistant even against major crashes.

Basically the strategy is to start with some collateral (ETH, or even stablecoins). Then, borrow Tether, swap to USDC/DAI, deposit on Aave as collateral; to borrow more Tether, and repeat until you reach a health factor that you are comfortable with. (Tether gives high APY even when borrowing, but it is not valid as a collateral.)

Since the collateral would eventually be comprised of a lot of stablecoins, it is actually surprisingly resistant to price crashes. Even a 60% price drop of your original collateral wouldn't liquidate an overleveraged position.

# Sample calculation

Start with 1 ETH @$2500 as collateral.

Borrow Tether, convert to USDC/DAI and deposit as collateral. This allows you to borrow even more Tether. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually, it is possible to borrow up to $3500 worth of Tether (1.4 ETH worth of Tether).

The health factor looks like this:

**Total Collateral = 1 ETH + 1.4 ETH (in USDC) = 2.4 ETH**

**Liquidation Threshold = 80% (it's actually slightly higher but for convenience we put this.)**

**Total borrows in ETH = 1.4 ETH (in Tether)**

**Health Factor = (2.4 x 0.8)/1.4 = 1.37**

# Let's say ETH crashes massively to $1000

The magical thing is that the USDC collateral will now be worth more in ETH.

Total Collateral = 1 ETH + 3.5 ETH (in USDC) = 4.5 ETH

Total borrows in ETH = 3.5 ETH (in Tether)

Health Factor = (4.5 x 0.8)/3.5 = 1.02 (still above 1, avoids liquidation.)

&amp;#x200B;

So even a 60% crash (ETH $2500 to $1000) can't liquidate this position, despite being over-leveraged (Borrowed $3500 using just $2500 worth of ETH).

&amp;#x200B;

nxqpwo,TheBulbafanatic,My thoughts on AAVE appropriation,"This started as a reply to a comment, but I wanted to offer my stance as a white American who grew up in the southeast, in a predominantly black community.

Language is a reflection of one‚Äôs experiences/history as much as their cultural background. I‚Äôve lived in the southeastern US my whole life. Even as a white person, my use of AAVE is a recitation of words I hear from black peers, colleagues, from grade school and college, in the store, at the park, whatever. I use it because the people I associate with say it and therefore I‚Äôve associated a positive connotation with it: this is what I grew up around, this is the norm for me. When you surround yourself with people that talk a certain way, you also start talking that way. The internet has become a platform to spread language to people who normally wouldn‚Äôt hear it, as well.

Some other instances of me appropriating language from others:
‚ÄúWe stan,‚Äù ‚Äúbased,‚Äù ‚Äúoof‚Äù (internet/meme culture); ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù (southern vernacular); stuff like ‚Äúhuman person‚Äù or ‚Äúmale mode‚Äù (from films or shows I like, the first is from Home because I think it‚Äôs funny and the second from Beastars, I use it as a genderfluid person to describe what I do when expressing as male). I also sometimes respond to people‚Äôs requests with ‚ÄúHai!‚Äù (Japanese for yes) because I‚Äôve been taking Japanese lessons for years. I‚Äôll add giongo/gitaigo to comics I draw (Japanese onomatopoeia, I write it with katakana because it looks neat), again as a Japanese student. I sincerely hope nobody takes me saying any of these things as me ‚Äú‚Äùowning‚Äù‚Äù the words.

I sympathize with those frustrated with the commoditizing of AAVE, like white people printing it on a shirt? Or using it in a mocking way, or to push a caricature. But... what, I‚Äôm not allowed to use words I‚Äôve been immersed in my entire life - that aren‚Äôt innately offensive - because I‚Äôm white? I find this attitude regressive. I feel it stunts cultural exchange and growth. Frankly I feel this conservative attitude towards language ultimately makes people unwilling to discuss issues of racial prejudice because they‚Äôre worried they‚Äôll piss somebody off.

Like. Regarding Dream. ‚ÄúAyo turn that shit up Charles!‚Äù ‚ÄúAyo‚Äù is the AAVE people took offense to, right? But both of his songs have started with, ‚ÄúAyo, Perish, this is hot, boy!‚Äù Am I stretching if I theorize this particular word was used to draw a parallel between the ‚Äúüéµdrugsüéµ‚Äù shit and his own music, rather than to promote a caricature? Maybe consciously, maybe not. I dunno. Why is the automatic assumption that Dream has a subliminal bias against POC?

(Tl;dr Language can be a product of your experiences/upbringing in addition to culture and policing who uses it is, in my eyes, regressive)",2021-06-12 05:27:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamWasTaken2/comments/nxqpwo/my_thoughts_on_aave_appropriation/

Every time I try and deposit it onto Aave I get this Transaction window pop up (Image Below).  
No matter what GWEI I enter, according to the [EthGas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) at a 21000 Gas limit, the transaction fails.

Error: \[ethjs-query\] while formatting outputs from RPC '{""value"":{""code"":-32603,""data"":{""code"":-32000,""message"":""intrinsic gas too low""}}}'

I'm on the Polygon Network in my Metamask walelt, and I have 0.001 MATIC which I got from the Matic Faucet. Is that what is being used instead? surely it would be enough. Do I need to have ETH somewhere to act as this gas, does wETH work?

nxhn8k,Gillynator,"Depositing in polygon.curve Aave USD pool, what would be best deal ?","Hi guys, 

so i borrowed some USDT on Aave, it's currently with the best reward rates in WMATIC among the stablecoins available to borrow there. 

I now want to deposit this USDT in Curve. But from what i see, it would be ideal to deposit DAI in that pool, since it's got the lowest share of the pool curve will pay a bonus for depositing DAI. 

So my question is, is it best to swap this USDT for DAI beforehand, and take benefit of the bonus? Or is it best to deposit USDT directly?

i hope i have made this clear :)

nx8kgh,smells_gay_to_me,"Could someone explain to me why using aave is problematic if you're not black, I'm kinda dumb when it comes to social issues","I wanted to ask here because a lot of the people here are not only diverse in a person to person sense, but also in an opinion sense and I want to get as many different points of view on this as possible because I am so confused. I don't know how on topic this is, but I don't want to touch twitter with this because twitter is a hell hole, so I understand if this gets taken down

Some of the words that are considered aave are stuff I say to help me speak clearly, stuff that has been so ingrained into my everyday speech over several years of use that I don't think it's really possible for me to just, stop saying them. In my mind they have never had a connection to black people, so even if the usage itself is wrong the intent has never been to mock

One of these being ""hella"" which has been something I have used for as long as I can remember as I have a mild speech impediment and saying ""hell of a"" is difficult for me. It's also much more time consuming to type out and say in general

It's a similar thing with ""sus"", something I've been using since my time playing Town of Salem years ago back when I was a relatively young child and was only reinforced by Among Us. Suspicious is also a very hard word to say on a bad day and I'll do anything to avoid stuttering, to the point I will say the first letter of a word and hope everyone knows what I'm on about. 

Lastly, and most topical right now, would be ""ayo"". This, in combination with ""eyo"", has been something I have used to show general acknowledgment for years now. It has never been influenced by the culture of people around me and was something I believed I had created to help with my communication skills. I also shorten them to just saying ""e"" or ""a"" when it comes to typing

Is what I'm doing inherently problematic even though, in my mind, these are words I came up with myself?",2021-06-11 13:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamWasTaken2/comments/nx8kgh/could_someone_explain_to_me_why_using_aave_is/

What's there not to like? [Polycat.finance](https://polycat.finance/?ref=0k78ooqRQq45P31s0NR0071SS0r0O6742P2r45O39o) is one of the most tried and tested farms on Polygon, and pretty early on it started developing way beyond any simple goosecopy. Features:

**Vaults**

The Vaults are used to lock LP tokens in an auto-compounding contract that compounds once PER MINUTE and the profits are used to both buy and burn FISH tokens, as well as to acquire more LP tokens to increase your deposit. Currently earning over 3000% APY.

**Farm**

The Farm is currently FISH-MATIC only and does not auto-compound but instead generates FISH tokens as a reward at over 30,000% APY currently.

**Pool**

The Pool is a single asset vault where you stake FISH to earn more FISH. Currently earning over 6000% APY.

**FISH Tokenomics**

Max Supply: 3 Million

Emission: 0.8 FISH/Block

FISH is bought and burned by the fees from Polycat Finance. The supply is capped at 3M and it's estimated all have been minted in August. $FISH will take on a governance function and is also used for the new Initial Farm Offerings (IFO) function just announced.

The latest news update has been nothing but good news. QuickSwap has directly integrated a FISH-QUICK pool which is huge for FISH and allows the Vaults to compound FISH into more FISH LP tokens.

Audits and tokenomics can be read at their github.  
**BSC -&gt; Matic Guide**

1. Get USDC on BSC from PancakeSwap
2. Go to [https://evodefi.com/bridge?token=USDC](https://evodefi.com/bridge?token=USDC) to Send your USDC to Matic
3. Go to [https://matic.supply/](https://matic.supply/) if you need some Matic
4. Go to [https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) and swap your USDC for the desired Tokens (FISH, Matic)

nvhu7t,Accomplished-Big3997,MATIC Network: AAVE + Sushi 40% + APR using stable coins lending/borrowing!? (+ MATIC long term Gains upon HODL),"Please correct me on this strategy if you see any immediate problems or pitfalls to what I have in mind.

Polygon (Matic) trading for low gas fees:

AAVE is giving out ‚Äúfree‚Äù loans on stable coins. If you borrow a stable coin with the matic network on AAVE you have to pay an APR, but as an incentive for using the AAVE/MATIC network they will give you a higher amount of matic in return therefore negating the APR via MATIC tokens for borrowing. 

Here‚Äôs the rundown:

1. You must be on the matic network to use this strategy. If you aren‚Äôt connected to the MATIC Mainer wallet you must do so first. Search for guides such as ‚Äúhow to connect Metamask to Matic Mainnet Wallet‚Äù

Once you have funds in the matic mainnet wallet which is connected to Metamask use Sushiswap to purchase som DAI.

2. Deposit DAI on AAVE for 2.80% APR + 3.18%APR in MATIC 

3. Use the Deposited DIA as collateral to borrow USDT. You will now get 75% of the money deposited in DAI in USDT. 
(ex: deposite $1000 in DAI you can now borrow $750 in USDT)

With the current promotion it cost 3.89% but you will receive 8.37% APR paid in matic. 

4. Now that we borrowed the USDT we can use this to lend to Sushi. Sushi offers 15.59% apr when lending your USDT. 

5. Now that we have USDT collateral on SUSHI we can borrow 75% of this collateral. You now buy DAI for 1% APR (this is just deducted from the 15.59% APR via your USDT collateral making it 14.59% True APR for staking the  USDT collateral 

6. Now that we borrowed DAI on sushi we can deposit this DAI on AAVE and repeat each of these steps.

Every time you borrow you will only be able to borrow 75% of the collateral put forth so eventually you will continue this process until you are lending a borrowing in the single digits. 

In my case I stopped borrowing and lending at the $5 mark 

This is a long shot but I have yet to see any downside and by my calculations you will net around a 40%-43% return on your investment by compounding the yield.

In my case this % is a little less as I make sure to have a little more money in my account to make my health factor better on AAVE and SUSHI and proctect from impermanent loss if apr from borrowing gets triggered and I have not yet sold my MATIC APR gains to make more return on the MATIC long hodl train....

This is powerful stuff.... it seems. Please correct me if my logic is flawed or there is something wrong with this duel platform yield farm strategy.",2021-06-09 07:35:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nvhu7t/matic_network_aave_sushi_40_apr_using_stable/

nvfxnc,fatfirewoman,Just buy and hold ETH vs. using Aave vs. Uniswap vs. Alchemix,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the appeal of all of these financial crypto stuff? 

I really don't understand why anyone wouldn't just keep investing in ETH and hold, vs. transferring ETH and converting them to tokens on Alchemix or Uniswap or Aave and start doing staking/pooling to earn a relatively tiny amount of interest rate in exchange face a lot more risks of losing their ETH. 

In the case of Uniswap - if you are pooling you are trading 50% of ETH toward another coin that in the long-run is not going to be as valuable as ETH, so you are losing money due to price divergence in exchange for getting fees, but those fees are gonna be small in the long run compared to just holding 100% of ETH and see it appreciate. 

In the case of Aave, you are giving up ETH in exchange for Aave's aToken, while theoretically this aToken gives you interest rate, the value of aToken could grow slower than ETH in the long-run or have something else happen to it (point is, it is NOT ETH), which still means you are losing out when compared to just straight up holding ETH. Plus, interest rate is pretty low nowadays for depositing ETH on aave anyways, trying any other crypto is too risky, and there are still unknown risks and costs of just moving money around on Aave. 

In the case of Alchemix - again, it's great that you get some upfront money, but then you have to pay it back over time plus pay interests. And you are asked to pay more than you get in the beginning so in the long run, you still lose money. Alchemix is basically a loan shark. People love getting money upfront, but at what cost?  

I'm not looking to make $100. I am looking to 10x my investment. And I think the best way to do this is to just buy ETH and HOLD. All of these fancy financial instruments are full of traps, and act more like a bank for the poor or a casino or lottery machine for those who are addicted to gambling. In the end, the house always wins. 

I think maybe if you work at a $B hedge fund trading crypto, you can build an algorithm to take advantage of loop holes, but ordinary people should just stick with buy and hold.",2021-06-09 06:05:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nvfxnc/just_buy_and_hold_eth_vs_using_aave_vs_uniswap_vs/

nvfxnc,fatfirewoman,Just buy and hold ETH vs. using Aave vs. Uniswap vs. Alchemix,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the appeal of all of these financial crypto stuff? 

I really don't understand why anyone wouldn't just keep investing in ETH and hold, vs. transferring ETH and converting them to tokens on Alchemix or Uniswap or Aave and start doing staking/pooling to earn a relatively tiny amount of interest rate in exchange face a lot more risks of losing their ETH. 

In the case of Uniswap - if you are pooling you are trading 50% of ETH toward another coin that in the long-run is not going to be as valuable as ETH, so you are losing money due to price divergence in exchange for getting fees, but those fees are gonna be small in the long run compared to just holding 100% of ETH and see it appreciate. 

In the case of Aave, you are giving up ETH in exchange for Aave's aToken, while theoretically this aToken gives you interest rate, the value of aToken could grow slower than ETH in the long-run or have something else happen to it (point is, it is NOT ETH), which still means you are losing out when compared to just straight up holding ETH. Plus, interest rate is pretty low nowadays for depositing ETH on aave anyways, trying any other crypto is too risky, and there are still unknown risks and costs of just moving money around on Aave. 

In the case of Alchemix - again, it's great that you get some upfront money, but then you have to pay it back over time plus pay interests. And you are asked to pay more than you get in the beginning so in the long run, you still lose money. Alchemix is basically a loan shark. People love getting money upfront, but at what cost?  

I'm not looking to make $100. I am looking to 10x my investment. And I think the best way to do this is to just buy ETH and HOLD. All of these fancy financial instruments are full of traps, and act more like a bank for the poor or a casino or lottery machine for those who are addicted to gambling. In the end, the house always wins. 

I think maybe if you work at a $B hedge fund trading crypto, you can build an algorithm to take advantage of loop holes, but ordinary people should just stick with buy and hold.",2021-06-09 06:05:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nvfxnc/just_buy_and_hold_eth_vs_using_aave_vs_uniswap_vs/

All my Matic is on the Matic mainnet now because I had to do so to use aave. So is there a secure platform that will give great interest? Or should I be moving all my Matic back through the bridge to ethereum mainnet to stake my Matic? 

I‚Äôm just curious what others are doing as this is coming up pretty soon. 

The rewards on aave per week go from 427,350 to 89,445. 

So it will be a big reduction soon. I was hoping Matic would come out and say they‚Äôre extending it or doing something bigger and new. But haven‚Äôt heard anything yet. 

It is still interest and still would do ok. But Celsius does 10% but I don‚Äôt want to go to cefi. I‚Äôd rather stake on Matic. 

Moving all the Matic back to ethereum seems like defeating the purpose of polygon. Shouldn‚Äôt we be encouraged to stay on Matic mainnet? I wish we could stake from the Matic mainnet. 

Let me know what you guys are thinking of doing.",2021-06-07 21:07:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/maticnetwork/comments/nuc45w/aave_matic_rewards/

I'm based in the UK (worth mentioning this because rules are different in every country).

I've only recently started to research the areas of NFTs and DeFi and I wanted to create (and invest in) a diversified portfolio made up of these altcoins.
However, before making a move in this space there's still a lot that I need to learn, and I want to be cautious.

As a matter of fact, for me the first element of caution is that I won't invest in any coins/tokens that I cannot store safely. I would prefer to store tokens in a cold hardware wallet (not a hot wallet like MetaMask or TrustWallet), but from what I understand, hardware wallets like the Trezor, currently don't support all NFTs and DeFi tokens (I will write below a list of the ones that I'm interested in which are not supported at the moment).

If any of you invest in NFTs/DeFi tokens that cannot be kept in a cold wallet, what is your backup/storing/security routine or process? Where do you keep them? How often do you withdraw them from the exchanges and where do you send them?

Someone from Binance advised me to buy them spot against BTC for example, and then withdraw BTC from Binance to my hardware wallet. However, wouldn't this create a tax liability? Since I would be exchanging altcoin X for another currency (BTC) before withdrawing, if the altcoin was at a profit when I did that, wouldn't that create a tax liability for capital gains?

Can anyone advise on the topics above?

The coins that I'm interested in:

-NFT tokens: AXS, CHR, CHZ, TVK, DEGO, ALICE, THETA
-DeFi tokens: AAVE, KAVA

What's there not to like?    
[Polycat.finance](https://polycat.finance/?ref=0k78ooqRQq45P31s0NR0071SS0r0O6742P2r45O39o) is one of the most tried and tested farms on Polygon, and pretty early on it started developing way beyond any simple goosecopy. Features:  
**Vaults**

The Vaults are used to lock LP tokens in an auto-compounding contract that compounds once PER MINUTE and the profits are used to both buy and burn FISH tokens, as well as to acquire more LP tokens to increase your deposit. Currently earning over 3000% APY.

**Farm**

The Farm is currently FISH-MATIC only and does not auto-compound but instead generates FISH tokens as a reward at over 30,000% APY currently.

**Pool**

The Pool is a single asset vault where you stake FISH to earn more FISH. Currently earning over 6000% APY.

**FISH Tokenomics**

Max Supply: 3 Million

Emission: 0.8 FISH/Block

FISH is bought and burned by the fees from Polycat Finance. The supply is capped at 3M and it's estimated all have been minted in August. $FISH will take on a governance function and is also used for the new Initial Farm Offerings (IFO) function just announced.

The latest news update has been nothing but good news. QuickSwap has directly integrated a FISH-QUICK pool which is huge for FISH and allows the Vaults to compound FISH into more FISH LP tokens.

Audits and tokenomics can be read at their github.

nsrcej,JeffGDoubleE69,Aave + yield farming as sushi alternative,"What are your thoughts on depositing your cryptos in aave as collateral to get stablecoin loans, which would then be used in stablecoin yield farming? You can get 65% APR on a DAI/USDC pool atm, even when using 50% LTV that‚Äôs still a much higher yield than providing liquidity in the cryptos pair. Plus, there‚Äôs no risk of impermanent loss. 

The only risks I can think of are the added liquidation risk, but a very conservative LTV will greatly mitigate this. Even with a lower LTV yields still outperform LP pairs, especially with aave polygon rewards. Additionally, there is additional smart contract risk since there‚Äôs an extra protocol being used than just sushi swap. And if the yield farms for the stablecoin pairs aren‚Äôt audited there is risk of rug pull/protocol exploits there also. 

This could be a promising way to eliminate IL risk while also getting higher yields.",2021-06-05 16:45:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/SushiSwap/comments/nsrcej/aave_yield_farming_as_sushi_alternative/

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to sustain any price level during the current pullback, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels. Does this mean that the bull trend is over and the institutional investors are abandoning the crypto markets?
No! It is the other way around. Glassnode‚Äôs weekly newsletter¬†pointed out¬†that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium is rising, suggesting that institutional investors are accumulating at lower levels.
GBTC is not alone, another popular vehicle for institutional investors, the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has also witnessed strong capital inflows. According to analysts at Glassnode, this shows ‚Äúearly signs of renewed institutional interest.""
ÔøºCrypto market data daily view. Source:¬†Coin360
Another metric that may be¬†signaling¬†a possible bottom in Bitcoin is its dominance chart, which looks similar to the early part of 2017. If Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance follows a similar trajectory to 2017, it will indicate that Bitcoin is still some distance away from its peak and altcoin season still has room to run.
Now that the monthly options and futures expiry has passed, investors are likely wondering if Bitcoin could start a sharp recovery next week and which altcoins will rally if that happens.¬†

I understand Polygon is essentially paying people in Matic to deposit and borrow on Aave. 

But the yields seem very small compared to what you'd get if you stake your Matic in an LP like Quickswap or Polycat.

Can anyone shed more light on the pros and cons of both approaches?

Someone from Binance advised me to buy them spot against BTC for example, and then withdraw BTC from Binance to my hardware wallet. However, **wouldn't this create a tax liability?** Since I would be exchanging altcoin X for another currency (BTC) before withdrawing, if the altcoin was at a profit when I did that, wouldn't that create a tax liability for capital gains?

\-NFT tokens: AXS, CHR, CHZ, TVK, DEGO, ALICE, THETA  
\-DeFi tokens: AAVE, KAVA

&amp;#x200B;

N.B. I'm not looking for investment advice (whether I should invest in the tokens above or not). I'm just looking for advice on how to safely store them and withdraw them without incurring in tax liability.

npmic4,BairakaDV,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Extend Gains, AAVE and THETA Rally","Bitcoin price remained well bid above the USD 36,000 level. BTC extended its rise towards the USD 38,000 resistance zone. It is currently (04:40 UTC) trading below USD 37,000, but dips might remain attractive near USD 36,000.

Besides, most major altcoins are showing positive signs.¬†ETH¬†broke the USD 2,650 resistance and it could rise further towards the USD 2,800 level. XRP/USD settled above USD 1.00, but it might face hurdles near the USD 1.10 level.

Bitcoin price

After a close above USD 35,500,¬†bitcoin price¬†started a steady increase. BTC broke the USD 36,500 resistance level and climbed above USD 37,000. However, the bulls failed to gain strength for a break above USD 38,000. The price is now correcting gains and trading below USD 37,000. An immediate support is near USD 36,200 and USD 36,000.
On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 37,500 level. The first major breakout resistance is now forming near the USD 38,000 level, above which it could test the USD 40,000 zone.

Ethereum price

Ethereum price¬†is up 15% and it broke the USD 2,650 resistance zone. ETH tested the USD 2,750 level before correcting lower. The price is now consolidating near USD 2,650. The first key support is near USD 2,600, below which the price might test USD 2,550.
If there is a fresh increase, the bulls need to clear the USD 2,720 level for more gains. The next key resistance is near the USD 2,850 level, above which the price could test USD 3,000.

BNB, LTC, DOGE, and XRP price

Binance Coin (BNB)¬†tested the USD 365 resistance level. BNB is now trading below USD 350, with an immediate support at USD 335. The next major support is near the USD 325 level. On the upside, the bulls might face hurdles near USD 365, followed by USD 380.
Litecoin (LTC)¬†spiked above the USD 190 level, but there was no break above the USD 195 resistance. The main hurdle for a larger increase is near the USD 200 level. On the downside, the bulls might remain active near the USD 165 level in the near term.
Dogecoin (DOGE)¬†is up over 10% and it is trading above the USD 0.320 level. If the bulls remain in action, there could be a move towards the USD 0.350 level. On the downside, the price might find strong support near USD 0.305 and USD 0.300.
XRP price¬†settled above the USD 1.0 resistance zone. However, it is still trading below the USD 1.10 resistance. If there is a fresh increase, the bulls might aim for a break above USD 1.10. If not, the price might correct to test USD 0.950.

Other altcoins market today

Many altcoins gained over 10%, including AAVE, KSM, THETA, RUNE, LINK, VET, CAKE, SHIB, SUSHI, SOL, TFUEL, UNI, DOT, FTM, and ATOM. Out of these, AAVE rallied almost 25% and it broke the USD 380 level.
Overall, bitcoin price is showing signs of more gains above the USD 37,000 level. If there is a downside correction, BTC might remain stable near USD 36,000 and USD 35,500.",2021-06-01 13:21:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALT_Heads/comments/npmic4/bitcoin_and_ethereum_extend_gains_aave_and_theta/
npjbbo,Order_Responsible,AAVE Ethereum Questions,"In the AAVE app, on the page of a specific token to lend, I connected my wallet, clicked on the ""Deposit"" button, and then it asked how much I wanted to deposit, I entered the info, and it displayed in small print the estimated cost underneath, which was around 20 USD, which seemed very high. 

* 1. I did not proceed b/c I did not want to get charged, but is that the only fee I would have to pay to deposit, or are there more fees later on?
* 2. are the ethereum fee amounts independent of the deposit amount?
* 3. is there a similar cost to withdraw?

Someone else already posted about a similar question, but since there is no long-term data available for interest rates, which makes it impossible to compare products, for someone who is planning on holding &gt; 1 year, for the ethereum network, does anyone have an idea of whether it would make more sense to deposit directly into AAVE or to use something like yearn.finance or Vesper or one of the other solutions, considering that they are going to take out their own fees?",2021-06-01 10:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/npjbbo/aave_ethereum_questions/

The reception to my first substack post was really warm and exciting! Thank you all so much for your engagement on Reddit too.

I'm returning with a 2nd post on Aave.

[Here's the link to the post](https://tokeneconomics.substack.com/p/understanding-token-2-aave).

Would love feedback and will definitely try to answer any questions here.

The tl;dr: The Aave Protocol is the #1 borrowing &amp; lending protocol today. However, the Tokenomics of the AAVE token are less rosy. There is a 2-tier reward system, with different rewards &amp; risks if you stake your AAVE or not. Furthermore, there is large downside tail risk in a black swan sell-off event. I advise potential AAVE token buyers to have a clear thesis as to their preferred risk &amp; return profile and their projections for Aave protocol volume after incentives end.",2021-06-01 06:26:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/npf24g/understanding_the_economic_value_of_the_aave/

npbemq,ConvexPreferences,"Are liquidity mining incentives artificially propping up Compound, Aave, Curve, Polygon, etc?","Short version:

My question is, how sustainable are these liquidity mining incentives, and  is the TVL and usage of platforms like Compound, Aave, Curve, Polygon  being artificially propped up during the time that these  incentives are  running - and when they go away, will usage and TVL  tank? Impact on  prices?

Longer version:

On Compound, Aave, and Curve (i'm sure other platforms as well), in addition to the borrow rate or lending rate, there is a distribution of native tokens to borrowers and lenders. On Compound, the payout of Compound tokens is a higher yield than the borrow rate, so you're getting paid to borrow. On Aave (Polygon version), you're getting paid in Polygon to borrow because the Matic payout is higher than the borrow rate on any given crypto. You can recursively lend and borrow with  this.  Polygon is going to distribute $40 million under this program.

I see that Uniswap is looking to add liquidity mining incentives back to its protocol as well, distributing native tokens to users - in order to drive more usage.

Will the demand still be there when these incentives go away and yields come down? Does the business model work without these incentives? And if TVL drops, is  there a downstream impact on price at all or is price not  tied to usage /  TVL?",2021-06-01 03:34:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/npbemq/are_liquidity_mining_incentives_artificially/

nm62ot,Credefi,What Do Aave And Credefi Have In Common?,"Economy-wise, the closest siblings to CREDI are AAVE and SUSHI, as they follow a two-token system with incentives for users who contribute to the platforms‚Äô development and stability. By the way, Aave has traditionally been considered one of the top DeFi projects according to DeFi Pulse.

So, what is there in common between these projects? Aave and SushiSwap are also using extensive pooling approaches, but it is essential to point out some of the Credefi platform‚Äôs advantages in this regard:

Credefi mitigates the regulatory risk of large pools by offering a full spectrum of financial services, including peer-to-peer loans, passive lending and trade finance.

A wide choice of collateral options with high-level risk assessment, backed by a EU-licensed financial institution.

The platform‚Äôs multiple value creation mechanism offers continued incentives for providing liquidity for CREDI and xCREDI, which adds deeper liquidity to both tokens.

This way Credefi is not just a project similar to the popular AAVE and SUSHI, it goes way beyond their capabilities!

First Celer Improvement Proposal (CIP-1) is posted by our community member. From a high-level, the developers propose to deploy a new strategy to app.layer2.finance. The strategy first claims the stkAAVE from Aave‚Äôs incentive controller contract, it then activates the cooldown period for unstaking, which is currently set to 10 days by Aave. After the cooldown expires, the strategy unstakes the stkAAVE and converts them back to AAVE. It also claims the accrued AAVE interest from staking during the cooldown period. It then sells the AAVE obtained from the into the stablecoins on Uniswap back into the stablecoins and re-invests them into Aave, compounding the gains.

I'm a matic newbie and i would like to know what are your thoughts/best options related to passive income on stable coins.

I'm currently earning and compouding intrest in PancakeSwap at the cake autocompounding pool, which i like and i intend to use for long term. Now i would like to start earning some passive intrest on my stablecoins using the matic network as well. I'm looking for pools where there is no impermanent loss.

Which one of those do you like the most?  (Or if there is a better one that i don't know about?)

  
\-  Quickswap: DAI-USDC LP pool  (104.85% APY)

\- Curve:  Aave (aDai+aUSDC+aUSDT) (35.85% Matic APY) &lt;-- still don't understand how it works, btw  
Or

\- AAVE: USDT (12,88% APR payed in matic)

\- can these two factors change if MATIC follows the trend?  

\- would it be smart to Repay the loan ahead of time to avoid liquidation?  

\- can one be liquidated if all they did was deposit into AAVE? 

I essentially want to avoid losing my funds. I guess that's what liquidation is, so I am willing to pull out if that's the case. I am just unaware how volatility can affect that chance of happening.

ney679,chop_hop_tEh_barrel,Hyper compounding matic with stable - when to pay the loan back? (AAVE),"I understand the strategy of depositing the matic as collateral, then borrowing stable coins against it.  You get to borrow the money, buy an appreciating asset with it plus you gain interest on your target asset (matic) for borrowing and lending.

Its great n all but the piece im missing is, when do u pay the borrowed  stable coins back?  Is there a strategy people use like some sort of staggered approach (borrow stable n  quick swap it for matic when it dips, pay back the loan as it peaks)?  That idea would make sense to me but would alsk require you to write a bot or be actively watching all day.",2021-05-18 09:56:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/maticnetwork/comments/ney679/hyper_compounding_matic_with_stable_when_to_pay/

newsc1,jeam3131,Question about AAVE to Curve APY Loss,"I'm trying to figure out an issue. I borrowed some DAI from AAVE polygon which currently has a borrow APY of 3.99%.

I let it sit for a day and then unstaked from curve, received my DAI back, and then used it all to pay back the AAVE loan. However, there was not enough DAI to pay back all the loan.

ndjggw,Nessaki,Deposit matic for using Aave x Polygon market,"Hi Community,

I tried to use the Aave x Polygon market and deposit my DAI there. I swapped my DAI to the polygon network. Now, when i want to deposit DAI into the Aave contract, it says i do not have enough matic in my wallet. That makes sense because i never purchased it before. So i went to Binance and purchased 18 tokens. 

Question:

Can someone help my to send these tokens to my wallet from binance to matic without having to spend $80+ fees on ethereum just to do that? There must be a cheaper way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot in advance.

nczz3o,DiscardedPizza,Recursive borrowing of MATIC on AAVE? Does it work?,"Let's say i deposit Matic on AAVE on the Polygon chain. I then borrow the maximum amount of MATIC against it, and re-deposit it in AAVE. That gives me more borrowing power, so I borrow more Matic and deposit it, and keep repeating. 

The borrowing APY is of course higher than the lending APY. However, participating in the loan gives you bonus MATIC that is larger than the lending APY.

Normally, recursive borrowing is dangerous - especially when it is translated into fiat currency. But here, I don't see that I can be liquidated. I didn't borrow $10,000 worth of Matic. Instead, I borrowed the Matic itself. If Matic crashes, then my proportional borrowing/lending rate doesn't change.

This only works as long as there are additional Matic rewards. 

But am I wrong? Am I misunderstanding how this works?  Is there a liquidation danger?",2021-05-15 22:22:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/nczz3o/recursive_borrowing_of_matic_on_aave_does_it_work/

nb0mps,LunchMeat99,Celsius Vs. Aave Staking,"I've looked all over and I still do not fully understand Aave-Polygon Staking, if someone could explain it to me, that would be much appreciated. I am currently on Celsius and receiving 13.99% APY, my account is also on HODL, with a 2-factor authentication so I feel pretty safe on there.

I have heard that staking on Aave has better rewards, and is beneficial for the Polygon network. At this moment, Aave offers a 5.94% APR on deposit and an additional 14.81% APR on borrowed. I have heard that you can also safely borrow a percentage depending on the amount of Matic you deposit. 

If someone could please better explain to me how borrowing works if it is fully safe, and if it is worth it considering the gas fees on ethereum at the moment.

You could even argue this with English, that our underlying grammar has remained Germanic, while we took on lots of Romance loanwords.

nakwc4,pupuupup,"Are DeFi rates sustainable? During the bear market cycle, how much do you think APY for lending would be? (Like for instance, lending USDT on Aave)","During the bear market, less people would borrow stable coin. More people would lend out stable coin. Would this make interest rate drop significantly? How much do you think will the interest rate be?

Lending / marginal trading protocols only. Yield farming not included.

Thanks.
