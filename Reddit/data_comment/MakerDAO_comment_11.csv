Revanchist1,"Are you worried about being liquidated? If you're not worried about that, why not use any of the other DeFi services. Borrow Dai using MakerDao CDP, Borrow MIM using Abracadabra, borrow LUSD being Liquity, etc.",2021-11-01 01:39:42
Revanchist1,"Abracadabra has taken a more progressive approach compared to MakerDao. 

Their approach to be on every chain and take on different collateral types is the primary reason for their growth. 

I'm also surprised MakerDAO hasn't voted to accept stable LP tokens as collateral yet.",2021-11-01 03:56:11
bronyraur,I feel like it would describing MakerDAO as mostly backed by USDC would be more accurate,2021-11-01 05:31:15
MrQot,"&gt;How does that impact token supply? 

It usually works on a mint/burn system on the non-canonical chain, i.e. 1000 coins exist on Chain A, you will lock them up by sending 10 to Chain A's bridge contract and receive 10 on Chain B. The 10 on chain B are minted on the spot and when you send it to Chain B's bridge, they're burned and unlocked on Chain A. The total supply is whatever Chain A's contract says it is, so it'll always be 1000. If the bridge has a bug/exploit, then an attacker could steal funds and mint a whole bunch on Chain B and mess with AMM's and pools and such, but he couldnt withdraw more on Chain A than there are actually locked in the bridge.

&gt;Is the contract address the same?

No, because the contract address depends on a bunch of things (contract code + transaction nonce + probably more) which *can* be the same since it's a deterministic process, but [it's a lot of effort](https://cryptobriefing.com/makerdao-team-recovers-63-eth-for-rightful-owner/)

For arbitrum specifically there's a whole setup to implement custom gateways or register a token on the generic gateway, pretty interesting stuff: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets",2021-11-01 09:49:56

Again, we are just getting started in this field. I'm glad we didn't immediately discount Ford's Model T car because it had shitty suspension and was a bumpy ride, aren't you? Imagine if we gave up on the car because of that.

flygoing,"The entire point of MakerDAO is to create stability from volatility. That's the point. Creating stability from stability would be pointless, just hold the first stable thing.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral.

Nexo and MakerDAO both have stipulations in their terms of service that allow them to change the interest rate at any time and for any reason. They also claim no responsibility if your crypto is loaned out and not paid back. They are basically just a middle man.

Here is a link to a site people put together to try and get their coins back from Nexo. It’s based in the Cayman Islands so they are most likely never going to see their money returned.

MrMoustacheMan,"#DAI Con Argument

*Disclaimer: my stablecoin holdings are spread across DAI, UST and USDC. As I take more profit this year DAI will become a bigger holding, but for now it's less than 1% of my portfolio.*

- DAI is notable as a decentralized stablecoin. It basically [functions as a loan taken against ETH or other collateral](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-makerdao-and-dai).
- In a [market full of centralized stablecoins](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins) the appeal is clear: no need to trust a central authority (see [USDT Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1sms/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_tether/)) or worry about [getting blacklisted](https://cryptobriefing.com/100000-usdc-blacklisted-highlighting-importance-decentralized-stablecoins/).

- That being said, nothing is risk free and there are some potential aspects of DAI to consider:

##Backing

- As the name implies, 'multi-collateral' DAI is [backed by loans taken against multiple assets](https://share.streamlit.io/tadzz/maker_dai_collateralization_2/main/dai_collateral_app.py), not just ETH. I think a [multi-collateral model](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#in-mcd-we-trust) helps to diversify risk instead of being backed by just one asset.
- But looking at the data you'll notice that a not insignificant amount of [DAI is generated from USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) and other centralized stablecoins. 

    - [USDC was added to help stabilize DAI's peg back in March 2020](https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-devs-debate-usdc-dai-liquidity-issues/). I think this decision exposed DAI to some risk, given the non-zero possibility of issues with USDC/Circle, such as concerns about regulation, rehypothecation etc. (see [USDC Con arguments] (https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2nfy/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_usd_coin/)). Would DAI's peg/liquidity be impacted if the SEC came down on Circle tomorrow?

- Does this mean that DAI loses some decentralization street cred? No, [according to MakerDAO](
https://blog.makerdao.com/busting-makerdao-myths-seven-misconceptions-about-dai/). 

    - However, some community members saw it differently. One forum member explained:

        &gt;""[there are new economical risk that can sneak in with such a solution and mixing it with an otherwise decentralized system ... I am in this project for it’s pure decentralized nature and would not want to see it becoming inter-mixed with USDC. If it were, I would rather just want to stick with USDC altogether.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-usdc-as-collateral-to-mitigate-liquidity-risk/1570/16)""

- Anyway we know [decentralization is a spectrum](https://nopara73.medium.com/few-words-on-decentralization-and-anonymous-payments-160782d30b9e), not a binary distinction. And it's the political axis of decentralization which I find more concerning, which takes us to...

##Monetary policy

- The rules that govern how DAI gets minted/collateralized and how it retains its $1 peg are sort of complicated for a lay user.
    - That's not a strong con in and of itself - most people interacting with smart contracts don't know how they work, you don't need to have a deep understanding of [how AMMs function](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/) to use a [DEX](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex).

- Still, I think a [seignorage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seigniorage.asp) system like [how Terra mints its decentralized stablecoin UST](https://research.thetie.io/the-terra-triforce-rise-of-the-lunatics/) is easier for folks to use and grasp - no need to [maintain a CDP](https://media.consensys.net/how-to-open-a-makerdao-cdp-and-earn-interest-on-compound-a-walkthrough-guide-b9e9f9584000), just burn LUNA to get UST. 

- DAI fluctuates given the volatility of ETH and in the past the MakerDAO team have [debated different strategies to retain the $1 peg, including an 'emergency shutdown'] (https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/12/defi-leader-makerdao-weighs-emergency-shutdown-following-eth-price-drop/).

- The stability and collateralization of DAI is thus a function of MKR governance, which in my opinion has a lot of room for improvement:

    - There's a [lack of transparency](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1197153771564019718) and a lack of participation, leading to [whales dictating monetary policy] (https://twitter.com/0xMako/status/1188824097918029825?s=21). To take a more recent example, a [proposal to remove USDT collateral passed with only 10 unique voters, one of which had 73% of the voting power](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRNwrTy?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown).

- To me this is not the ideal of decentralized governance, but more akin to the Federal Reserve setting monetary policy.",2021-11-06 03:09:24

Papazio,"The story of the guy who tried to port his Maker CDP over to Arbitrum using Oasis.app where no such instance of Maker exists. Initially lost something like 60 ETH.

Guy posts on Reddit and peeps help him out with contact to the Maker team. The geniuses at Maker devise a way to potentially get the funds back, but say it is risky and will cost a lot of gas and might not work anyway.

The team goes for it and not only gets all his ETH back but covers the cost of the gas for him too. It just shows how close users, devs, and project leads are and how if you have an issue you should be able to easily get in touch and get help. Decentralisation does not mean 0 help.

noduhcache,"To explain a bit further, shiba is a non-native token instaminted on another chain, while doge is both a native token and a network, where the tokens have been issued to those who secure the network gradually over time.  

The difference does indeed matter.  I would encourage people to think about the ease of creating one vs. the other, and if something is easy to create, it can be end up being just as easy to discard.  When many people globally distributed must cooperate on the other hand not only to secure a network, but also to create infrastructure to make it accessible and then build adoption to use that infrastructure and liquidity to maintain it, that's a much more durable public good.  

There are examples of non-native tokens that have a different kind of investment of time and infrastructure to them, for example makerdao and dai.  But the principle still stands.  Look at how easy something is to make and maintain, if it was really easy, then it's gonna be just as easy to fade to nothing.

But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. This is the best network for smart contracts because fees are super low (per transaction), secure, very fast, and uses almost no energy. It’s great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a Songbird/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything BEP 20, ERC 20, XRPL, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral.

Dan6erbond,"I can try my best to explain the concept of tokens, assets and NFTs, so hope this helps!

The concept of a token is a asset on the blockchain, that contains metadata and in itself isn't really worth much. Just imagine it as an entry in an Excel sheet, but depending on how you treat that token, you can start to give it value.

A token like SHIBA gets its value from the hype and attention that it gets from the community. Tokens like BAT have value because you do something to earn it, and DAI gets its value from being used to govern the MakerDAO autonomous organization.

Now those are just tokens as a general concept. But there are three different kinds of tokens, not all of which are supported by all blockchains:

- Fungible Tokens (FTs)
- Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Security Tokens

A fungible token should be interchangeable with all its other representations. This is the case for all the tokens I mentioned above, since 1 SHIBA is the same as every other SHIBA. There's nothing unique about your SHIBA (in most cases, though, there can be exceptions here).

But NFTs are different. They're meant to be unique, and only one with that metadata and precise representation should exist. So think of artwork. Sure, I can create a copy of the Mona Lisa and hang it up at home. But the real thing only exists once. NFTs make it possible to tokenize unique assets on the blockchain, and assert their authenticity using cryptography. Lots of technical details that are luckily abstracted by blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.

Then there's security tokens. They go a bit against the idea of crypto, but Algorand and Cardano support them to be compatible with certain regulations. Security tokens can be unique like NFTs, or fungible. But in both cases, they can have managers, clawback addresses, etc. which are essentially users, or wallets, that can mutate the token. This can include changing the metadata, freezing it, taking it back, or destroying it. 

What I just described are the technical underlyings of how NFTs and tokens in general on a blockchain work. But what we conventionally refer to as NFTs these days are those graphics that are tokenized as NFTs. They're basically just images stored in the token metadata of the NFT you're buying, and as I mentioned, can help ensure that a unique artwork is actually authentic.

Blockchain really offers a lot of possibilities in this space. These images can be minted by a computer, i.e. generated based on various parameters, such as the person who's minting the NFT, which would visually change the actual image. It adds an aspect of uniqueness and rarity, which gives them their value.",2021-11-10 17:17:39

Lazy_Physicist,"SPELL is an interesting project to me because they seem to be hyper aggressive about taking different types of collateral in order to mint their MIM stablecoin. They collect minimal fees compared to MakerDAO and redistribute those fees in a very clear way (buyback SPELL with MIM fees and increase the ratio of staked SPELL (sSPELL) to SPELL). They use Kashi lending to isolate their lending markets to prevent contagion I believe so theoretically their hyper aggressive strategy of using yield bearing assets as collateral shouldn't be problematic if they onboard a lemon asset. Daniel (the creator) also seems to be incredibly aligned with the Ethereum ethos of freedom and self determination and has made more money than he probably knows what to do with from his bitcoin investments so I don't believe he will ever intentionally rug any of his projects. From the interviews that I've seen/heard he's also constantly thinking about cutting edge tokenomics to provide proper incentives for his protocols' users to keep his protocols healthy. Personally I think it's a good idea to hold at least some SPELL and stake it on mainnet to be exposed to it, but the danger is this hyper aggressive strategy could cause problems down the road if they move too fast. If you believe that maker DAO is too slow and cautious then SPELL is the protocol for you. It's incredibly risky right now but the rewards could be huge if the protocol manages to overtake Maker in market share.",2021-11-12 10:11:03

MrQot,"Kinda hard to tell from the lack of context and weird misuse of terminology, is he pro or anti L2 lol? I'll do my best either way:

&gt;It will have no effect on trading Eth and ERC20 tokens. 

The idea is these tokens will be bridged to layer 2, and the new projects will deploy on layer 2 exclusively and skip layer 1 altogether. So that includes tokens. There's a lot of innovation going on for example with MakerDao to have Dai be a fully cross-chain and cross-layer stablecoin or Aave to be a single deposit-once access-anywhere DeFi platform with their portal thing in the upcoming V3.

If he means no effect as in ""you still have to pay lots of fees to bridge to L2"" (common criticism) the answer is exchanges will adapt to offer direct withdrawals to rollups (as many are already doing today) so that's a moot point in the long term but definitely a concern if your funds are currently on L1 and you need to move them. But it's a one time fee essentially.

It will absolutely have an effect, but obviously if the team behind the token doesn't do anything to port to L2 it will be stuck on Layer 1 DEXes where gas is expensive. (There are some talks of bridging arbitrary tokens to Arbitrum and others, but afaik the science isn't fully in yet and idk what effect that has on L2 liquidity)

&gt;However ETH 2.0 is a hard fork, and should have a direct effect. 

What's known as ""ETH 2.0"" will eventually offer sharding which will help rollups scale even more by offering them more data. Layer 1 gas will stay expensive, as those shards will be data-only, not execution.

&gt;BUT the only caveat would be someone building a DEX that uses an L2 solution in the background to reduce those fees on traders

Not sure what he means by ""in the background"". If you're operating on a rollup, you'll be as aware of which rollup you're on as you're currently aware of which chain you're on (ethereum, polygon, bsc, avax, etc.) In fact the user experience as far as MetaMask goes will be the same.

&gt;You will however in those situations still have to know those solutions, and how to change the DEX's exchange setting in your transaction to take advantage of it

Again that's a weird terminology, not sure what he means by DEX's echange settings? If he means the MetaMask RPC endpoint, that's basically the same thing as switch from mainnet to polygon. It's not like you're on mainnet and have to tell the DEX to ""use layer 2 in the background"", that's not how it works.

A rollup is basically a distinct blockchain that commits data to ethereum's mainnet. So it can focus on scaling instead of having to bootstrap its own nodes and security solutions. That's the ""execution layer"" in the modular blockchain model.",2021-11-13 05:59:04

FaceDeer,"It really bothers me how much focus people in the cryptosphere put on the ""inflationary"" or ""deflationary"" nature of various cryptocurrencies.

For one, it's using the term wrong. In economics ""inflation"" doesn't refer to the *supply* of a currency, it refers to the buying power of a currency. If one day you can buy a loaf of bread for $1 and the next day it costs $2, then dollars are undergoing inflation. It doesn't matter how many dollars there are in circulation.

For another, a lot of cryptocurrencies *aren't* trying to replace fiat. Many cryptocurrencies have intended functions other than that. The purpose of MKR, for example, is to provide decentralized governance for MakerDAO and serve as collateral of last resort for the protocol. I could sell a loaf of bread in exchange for MKR but  that's kind of a weird thing to do.

Ether itself is not actually intended as a general-purpose buy-a-loaf-of-bread currency, even if you can potentially use it for that if you want. Its purpose is to *keep Ethereum running.* It's there to be used as a mechanism for incentivizing validators/miners and for spam control by serving as a payment medium for transactions. It doesn't necessarily need to have an incentive to spend it on anything other than that.

If you want something to replace the dollar with you should design a cryptocurrency with the characteristics specifically intended for doing that. DAI is a great example, it's quite explicitly meant to fulfill the role that dollars fulfill.",2021-11-13 07:54:42

siflbabyshifero,"I found this but it’s a just a media outlet. Not an official source. None of Shytoshi’s Mediums discuss scrapping SHI. What may have happened is that they thought they would get enough liquidity from Leash price to be able to make and sustain a stable coin but, that hasn’t happened yet. Not saying they’re sticking with SHI but, if they did, they do have a lot of Bone to ensure price stays at $0.01. In the past other governance tokens have been what’s maintained a stable coin. MakerDao is a governance token and it’s liquidity allows DAI to stay pegged to $1.00. All that being said, here’s what the article had to say.

“It is important to note that neither SHIB nor LEASH, which are currently high performers on ShibaSwap, will be the blockchain’s primary token. Ryoshi shared that the blockchain’s primary token will be BONE. The reasoning behind this was that the BONE token would have a fresh, fair, and ‘0’ start.”",2021-11-14 07:58:38
aregus,"lmao if you’re in TIME, Klima, Ohm and whatever new fork of that algo coin then you’re pretty much in the highest risk/reward ratio possible on DeFi

It’s like buying n staking Hex in early 2020. 

But if you’re looking for an stable, mid risk and high reward then stick to ETH leverage w Makerdao just a clean x2.4 of your allocation. If ETH goes to 1.5T by Q1 that’s a sweet X4-X5 on your $$ portfolio. 

Low risk would be stable coin farms w 30-40% APY but I would do it w borrowed money. So 100% allocated on ETH then borrow 40% and farm that sweet APY then redistribute your rewards in moonbags. 

That should give you a x10 at the end of the cycle if you’re right.",2021-11-14 09:17:25

For something big like MakerDAO or whatever, a Google search is likely about as good as doing it yourself.",2021-11-15 08:56:48
aregus,"There’s many wrong assumptions here and I would suggest you to start slowly into defi instead of trying this. 

First there’s not aave wallets or coinbase wallets, only custodian and non-custodian wallets. 

Non-custodian wallets are the ones you generate with a web3 client like metamask or ledger live. The first one generates an standard hot wallet where transaction signatures are done directly from the client, and the second one is a hardware cold wallet, where you have to sign your transaction from your hardware device in order to confirm them. 

A wallet becomes a hot wallet in the moment you type the seed phrase in a machine connected to the internet, so hardware wallets displays the seedphrase on their own screen so ur seedphrase never touches an online machine (cold wallet). 

If you’re experimenting with DeFi or NFTs I suggest you to get a hardware wallet first before doing anything else, and please keep it as a cold wallet.

Custodian wallets are the ones generated by exchanges or services that holds your coins for you, like coinbase, binance, Celsius, etc. 

Now about the strategies, there’s 3 strategies explained in my comment above it’s not a single one:

- The first one is just buying n staking ohm forks it can be Klima, Time, etc or Ohm itself. The logic behind these ponzus it’s an algorithmic reserve token that aims to mitigate volatility on crypto by using their treasury funds to back the current price of the asset or at least as close as possible meanwhile is issuing new bonds to capture more value from new investors. Bonds are created by depositing certain assets into the treasury and usually offers a discount vs the open market.

Some forks twist the purpose of the treasury a little bit, like klima which is looking to inflate the price of carbon credits w this funds in order to ""save the planet"". 

The payment is good but the risks are high, specially when some of this tokens are priced multiple X’s vs their treasury funds so all of them are in a rush to get more people aboard before the next big crash (If that ever happens).


- The second one involves leverage and I would not recommend it for new people like you, but if you’re planning to invest in the ohm forks then your risk tolerance is pretty high. It’s actually very easy to do, just buy ETH from any exchange and move your funds to a non-custodian wallet so you can use the makerdao contracts. 

Just the standard oasis app &gt; ETH-A &gt; Multiply 

But any big pullbacks could liquidate you so careful w the leverage. 

- The third one requires a bit more experience on defi even if it has the lowest risk, because it requires to do some research on certain iconic projects like curve, yearn, etc and you may have to bridge funds in multiple chains in order to make the most of it. There’s many ways to pull this one but a basic setup is bridging your ETH to polygon, or just buy matic and buy ETH on polygon then deposit your ETH on aave and borrow against your ETH up to 40% of its value into stable coins. I usually borrow Dai cuz the APY doesn’t pump that hard but be aware that dai price can pump considerably when volatility is high. 

At 40% it means the price has to crash more than 50% in order to liquidate you, which is not going to happen overnight so you have time to payback some of the borrowed money to keep it at 40% TVL

Use your borrowed stables to provide liquidity to any project that it pays good, you can even bridge them from polygon to another chain. I’m currently in the nusd Pool of synapse on polygon and  G3crv of curve on fantom, both are making above 40% APY. 


Remember that ETH is the native token of ethereum, WETH is the erc-20 token of a synthetic ethereum and is backed 1:1 w ETH, also it’s the one you’re going to use in the above strategy. 

Read more about WETH in their website. 


Finally the risks are mainly contract risks (if the protocol is hacked then say bye bye to your funds), so try to get insurance before making any deposits into these pools it’s better to pay a small price for insurance than a very expensive lesson. Also you’re earning a high APY in most of this projects so it’s worth it.",2021-11-15 09:00:19

lawhoo_,"I think a split approach is probably the best solution to address both sets of stakeholders, if only because it has the benefit of smoothing out the shocks of a ""start""/""stop"" approach to burning/raising the surplus buffer.  Much easier to model out if you don't have to account for the fact the surplus buffer could just jump based on a vote (obviously it still good, but a constantly growing surplus would hopefully cause less need for it). Ultimately folks like certainty and if they can model out the surplus growth and the burn rate, I think that's better than an all-or-nothing approach.

I would have to think more on the right percentage split, but agree with you that it needs to outpace MKR vesting.  As I mentioned, I've only recently become interested in actual ins-and-outs of how MakerDAO actually works so I'm still learning on the sources/uses.",2021-11-15 22:13:11
svantetobias,"My two DAI cents as a long term MKR holder, but not active in the MakerDAO forums:

1. Every DAI in the Surplus Buffer should have a concrete safety reason for being there, based on historical needs or credible forecasts. Building up a bank instead of deploying capital is inefficient unless it serves a purpose greater than the opportunity cost it represents.
2. Any DAI income left over after that should be split three ways, depending on the efficiency in furthering the MakerDAO system:
   1. Invest in Core Units
   2. Lower the Dai interest rate (stability fee)
   3. Pay out to MKR holders via buy-and-burn

As long as this is the optimization framework we agree on, MKR buy-and-burn could be 0% or 95% of stability fee income.

Balancing the above budgets is extremely difficult and requires deep knowledge, large amounts of data and long term strategy. It's what a full-time CEO gets paid top salary to do in traditional organizations. And to not get burried in bureaucracy, the CEO makes these decisions without having to reach consensus with shareholders first. The CEO is measured on performance after the fact - the only way to make the process efficient.

Now, maybe MakerDAO can afford to delegate this function to a group of elected representatives who needs to come to agreement, but as you allude to yourself, coming to full MKR agreement every week on the Surplus Buffer size is an extreme strain on bandwidth.",2021-11-15 23:30:49

Connortbh,"It might help since you're asking about DeFi broadly but Liquity's Liquidation mechanism is that you pay a 10% liquidation penalty and your ETH is sold at that discount to those with LUSD in the stability pool backstopping liquidations on a pro rata basis. You get returned the difference in ETH. Stability pool depositors are incentivized by earning LQTY.

Last time I used MakerDAO it involved some type of auction, but in periods of extremely high liquidations you might have a lot of slippage, in addition to your liquidation penalty. Meaning in some cases you'll be penalized further.

This will then benefit gZIL holders. So its good to to help them bootstrap liquidity. It also took a bit of time for MakerDAO to get this done but you can see where they are at now.

mrcleansocks,"Yeah. So the “vehicle” right now on chain is just a transaction. What that transaction is on the blockchain is actually just a little bit of data added to the ledger stating a change 

Example 
Bob sent sally 45 LRC 

This updates the current state for everyone in ethereum so everyone knows it happened. Sending individual transaction was fine for years, but there is a finite amount of space per block. Each block adds a few hundred transactions every 30-50 seconds and equates to about 10-15 tps (numbers may be off here but they’re relative.)

What a roll up does is essential use the extremely small amount of space that each transaction uses and instead of saying 

bob sent sally 45 LRC 

The transaction might say something like 

“Batch 45683920” 

Inside this batch is all of the requests for state changes on the system. Bobs payment to sally, my payment to my girlfriend, minting tokens via MakerDAO, any and all sorts of stuff that could happen via the blockchain.  

Since some things cost more to do on ethereum, you pay a proportional amount of gas depending on what you’re doing. 

So technically if you and I were sharing “Batch 4568392” and we were the only riders. We might split the cost of gas 50/50 or 40/60 depending of the complexity of the transaction. Add another person into the batch and it gets cheaper. Add another person and it gets even cheaper. 

The overall gas fee for the batch is always going to be high, but the more people riding inside the batch, the cheaper seats become by the nature of us splitting the cost for the batch. 

Let me know if you need a better explanation.",2021-11-18 23:46:00

But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential.

nikola_j,"MakerDAO is a decentralized finance protocol on the Ethereum blokchain which allows you to create collateralized debt positions where you deposit or lock in assets as collateral and mint or borrow Dai against your deposit.

The deposit you're making is not being sent to any kind of account or wallet. It's being locked into the Maker protocol's smart contracts which later on keep track of your current balances, including the amount of assets you deposited and the amount of Dai you borrowed.

The set of smart contracts that run the Maker protocol do have some variables that are being maintained by MakerDAO governance. However, there is no way for the governance or anybody else to have access to your deposited funds. Not unless a major security exploit is found, which is very unlikely at this point, but it's fair to assume that there always exists a chance.

In short, when you create a MakerDAO Vault, you're creating it within Maker protocol's smart contracts - the protocol gives your Vault a unique ID number and keeps track of your deposits and borrowings, without any person having any kind of direct influence on the process.

If you would like to learn more, I would suggest for example checking out the Maker Community portal which has some nice explanations (https://makerdao.world/en/learn/). Or if you want to dive deeper into how it all works, you may enjoy going through Maker docs at https://docs.makerdao.com/.

If you are interested in analysing on-chain transactions, you can select any random vault from https://defiexplore.com/ and take a look at the transactions where users create vaults, deposit collateral and generate Dai.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a way to try out creating one MakerDAO Vault for yourself, I can suggest going to https://app.defisaver.com/ (which is one of the management apps for Maker Vaults) and selecting the ""Simulation mode"" which then creates a sandboxed testing environment for you, with a 100 ETH balance, where you can try creating a Maker Vault, among other things.

I can absolutely understand your skepticism, but I implore you to keep researching and digging deeper, because the world of decentralized finance is an incredible growing ecosystem, with Maker being one of its core components.",2021-11-21 09:17:00

AstridPeth_,"Eu não conheço todos os projetos, mas digamos algo como Compound.

Você é rewarded por dar colateral para o projeto. Os projetos, por sua vez, exigem algum colateral de quem está emprestando (ex: eu deposito 60k USD de ETH e pego 40k USD de DAI/USDT, etc). O risco que você corre é o preço do que o cara botou de colateral cair muito e você ficar xupando o dedo.

Para ser justo, projetos como o MakerDAO já enfrentaram quedas de ETH de mais de 90% quem quebrar.

Mas com certeza existem riscos que se corre. 8% em dólar com stablecoin é algo bem maneiro. Vale alguma alocação para quem entende e tem o perfil de risco (ex: é novo e conseguiria trabalhar novamente e recuperar o dinheiro em caso de default)

DAIJustinCase,"I'll try to give you some answers.  


1. As the value of the collateral decrease the ratio will decrease, as an example from 200%-&gt;180%. Nothing happens immediately following a decrease but at some point you will hit the liquidation threshold. Once you do, the collateral is automatically auctioned off and the debt paid. This is called a liquidation. 
2. Keepers doesn't step in as such. When a vault falls below a certain threshold it gets liquidated. This means the collateral is sold off and the debt is repaid. This is done at a given percentage and varies according to vault, but is always higher than 100%.  The sale is triggered and done by an automated auction system. Keepers are buyers of collateral in such auctions. 
3. MakerDAO is an automated protocol. A vault will be liquidated and closed before it ever becomes undercollateralized. If someone opens a vault and never comes back to it, eventually interests are going cause a liquidation assuming the value of the collateral doesn't keep growing enough to compensate. If the fall is very steep it is possible that some vaults may end up undercollateralized before getting liquidated, but the protocol is taking steps to minimize the risk of this happening.",2021-11-22 20:44:36

chinjila,"&gt;With Proof of Work I can see CPU being volunteered to keep the chain   
alive in exchange for tokens, but in Proof of Stake I don't see how   
Staking benefits the blockchain or incentivizes people to contribute   
hardware resources to help keep the chain active. Can someone explain?

Proof of Work is in a way converting the energy used in mining into $$ value to ensure block creator has a ""Stake"" in the fairness of all participants. In another word, by investing in the hardware and computing resources as ""Stake"" in the network, miners are rewarded for keeping the ""Consensus""of the network fair. 

In light of the energy waste and climate impact, we can eliminate the layer of ""Energy to $$"" and simply have the participants put up money (Stake) to validate the correctness of block via attestations. Validators are penalized via slashing and miss attestation penalty if they are not keeping up their end of the deal. Thus greatly reduces the energy consumption while maintaining the security of the chain.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; How exactly do all the validators know if the transaction took place/is   
valid? What's the mechanism by which we all detect falsehoods and reject  
 a new block?

Validators receive scheduled attestation on each block and attest for the transactions in Mempool.  The chosen proposer of the block must get 66%(I think) of scheduled validators to attest for the block to earn the block proposal reward.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I see smart contracts as problematic in more complicated scenarios. Say   
instead of using eBay, I use a smart contract to buy a widget. Sellers   
ships it, I receive it, but the widget is broken. Or what if the buyer   
pretends they never received the widget. Wouldn't we need a third party   
to resolve the issue? Smart Contracts seem too rigid and permanent for   
this use case.

Smart contracts deal with tokens, tokenization of real world assets are underway by MakerDAO and other folks. IIRC there is a fractionalized ownership of real estate properties that one can buy on Uniswap. The Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO) are commonly the consensus to handle human dispute. For example, Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance where claims are approved or denied based on DAO consensus. Smart Contracts will not replace all human transactions, it is not meant to. Buy/Sell physical goods will largely remain off-chain transaction and perhaps immutable recordings being on blockchain.

Sorry, I can't answer all the questions, but these are what I know that may help you out in some way.",2021-11-23 00:01:04

MinimalGravitas,"As a fairly vocal crypto advocate (check my comment history) and long term investor, yea this probably isn't a terrible idea to be honest.

In the grand scheme of things crypto mining isn't a huge chunk of our GHG emissions, but it probably is one of the few areas that can realistically be stopped without massive resistance from society. ICE road vehicles, international travel, beef and dairy all probably need to be cut massively if we are going to have a hope of maintaining anything like the levels of agriculture we need to support the global population in the mid future... but it appears that pretty much no government is willing to push for the end of any of that as quickly as is needed (i.e.  yesterday). At least killing crypto mining would be a relatively easy (if minor) win.

That said, I do still think crypto as a coordination tool might be the exact thing we need to help us avoid the massive web of 'Tragedy of the Commons' scenarios we're all caught up in that seem to prevent us taking the action needed to dodge the oncoming Great Filter. This concept was played out in one way in Kim Stanley Robinson's excellent novel 'Ministry for the Future', and is often discussed in one way or another in the crypto community.

If you're interested and open minded enough to actually look at some writing from advocates a good overview to start understanding how crypto people look at coordination problems like climate change would be: https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ethereum-slayer-of-moloch- I'd recommended skipping down to the subtitle ""I'm a child of the last bull phase"" and reading from there as the stuff before that is irrelevant.

Another good example, more recent and more specific is MakerDao (one of the biggest DeFi platforms) pivoting towards climate focused public goods: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684 to put this in context Maker has about $18 billion in on-chain locked value, which means they could feasibily represent a measurable percentage of sustainability funding in the areas they decide to focus on.

In short, maybe crypto mining does need to die, but at the same time I'm pretty sure crypto coordination tools and vast sums of young money can also probably help us fight climate change.",2021-11-24 07:03:37
nikola_j,"They're not really. The lender and borrower are following standard protocol rules - the lender has deposited their assets into the protocol's pool and receives interest, while the borrower took funds from there and pays interest.

The token incentives given besides that are what makes the borrowing virtually free, but note again that you are still paying interest on the borrowed asset (in that asset), while receiving these incentives is a separate thing, basically rewards for using the protocol given out by the team/project/DAO.

And that's not something that's done everywhere. MakerDAO, Reflexer, Liquity, for example, none of them have token rewards for borrowing.",2021-11-24 09:04:53

Regardless, in no reality is eth less centralized than bitcoin. Just meaningless words from the peanut gallery. Using something that happened in 2013 is irrelevant (even if it happened) because the network is 1000x the size today. Governance in bitcoin has been constructed and its decentralized. 

Ethereum has leadership and a headquarters. Their nodes are centralized on infura cloud servers. It’s a a centralized mess in more ways than one.

Also, [eth hard forked](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) to restore funds. It’s a bad precedent and critical vulnerability of having “leadership” who are prone to these types of political decisions. The same thing couldn’t happen on bitcoin.",2021-11-24 11:47:22

Neophyte-,"i havent kept up to date with hte latest turing complete blockchgains ie eth killers

i saw what solana was doing and was not impressed. u need specialised hw to run a node, the devs shut down the blockchain to fix xyz lol. this flies in the face of what decentralisation is about, same with bsc

but if u wanna figure out if algorand is trash i.e improves scalability at the expense of decentralisation or security lookl at how the consensus algorithm is centralised, dpos being obne of the most infamous examples (exchange wallets forked STEEM blockchain to collude with justin sun who took over the blockchain)

reading about agora

&gt; Algorand does this by selecting validators randomly from all token holders. The network relies on an algorithm that automatically picks the next group of nodes that become eligible to add blocks. This approach maintains decentralization since everyone can be selected by the system. The fact that no one knows who the next validators will be ensures security, which is another important element in the trilemma. 

i dont buy  that randomly selecting a validaitor solves the trilemma. you still need consensus via a gossip protocol to nodes what the chain tip is, 

to get more scalability ideally you need sharding. random node selection helps as block validation for a turning complete blockchain with lots of operations is expensive esp if there is network bound operations eg calling some oracle to get data e.g. current price of eth in makerdao

even sharding has limits, u can so easily seperate execution pn diff shards where one operation is not ready on another. usually its split into stuff kuije data storage and opcode execution

imo blockchain can never come close to a cenbtralised counterpart; its simply defies laws of physics. ina decentraliosed system. u need to propagate blocks over tcp/udp. amongst validators. those operatioons are slow, million times or more then just doing it all iin one api/ sservice in a traditonal software solution",2021-11-24 15:20:23
MinimalGravitas,"I'm in a couple of DAOs, Bankless has a few hundred active members and it's difficult to keep up with everything that's going on, how do you think it would be if it included everyone who burnt gas on Ethereum... there have been about 180 million unique addresses using the network so far [https://etherscan.io/chart/address] so can you imagine getting monthly charity proposals and votes organized?

That's why I think it would be so difficult!

I don't disagree with you that it there are lots of good things that could theoretically be done with this amount of ether, my vote would be to spend it all on renewable energy and climate change mitigation measures for LEDCs (similar to what Rune has proposed for the MakerDao treasury) but there just hasn't been a practicable way suggested to make that happen.

If you can think of a way to make it work then you can always make a proposal, Ethereum development is open and welcoming so you could probably get help creating an EIP if you could come up with a concrete idea that hasn't been thought of and discussed already.",2021-11-24 22:27:23

These stablecoins are being kept stable by

And when Tether liquidity pops and 80% of liquidity is left the arbitrage that is active in the system that keeps these stablecoins stable will start to fail.

Every single stablecoin will be affected by a combination of arbitrage breaking down and loss of faith.

Some stablecoins will survive, their pegs will come beg to one.

Some will not.

Now anyone could clone it with lower fees - except they can't, because making the Maker system less profitable would also make it less sustainable, lower it's dev velocity, and therefore making it less stable and more prone to being overtaken by competitors in terms of services.

There's a huge amount of continuous off-chain work done by the DAO which can't be cloned, that's their added value that the fee pays for. Collecting a fee that CAN be forked away just simply isn't a good business model on open chains.

1) Hard to prove stuff which is about economic agents. It is not directly about the behavior of smart contract, it is about the market and the assumptions you impose on it. Impose wrong assumptions - and prove security where you actually don't have it.

2) Your example about secure hashing algorithm is a bit misleading - these things are largely conjectures in cryptography, and are far from not only a formal proof, but any proof. Secure hashing, for one, implies P!=NP.

I would also like to point out that formal verification systems are very much possible and used for normal languages like Python or even Solidity. Makerdao DAI smart contracts, for example, ARE formally verified.",2021-11-26 13:24:48

nikola_j,"Thanks for bringing this topic up, it really is important to improve UX associated with this process.

Besides the forum and this subreddit, I think twitter and discord announcements coordinated with any integrators could certainly help reach more people, too.

Imho, it would be great if these kinds of events could be announced via the main, official @MakerDAO twitter account, as I believe the broader community still maybe doesn't recognize accounts such as @MakerGrowth *as* official (and it certainly doesn't have as large of a reach).

I know that the @MakerDaiBot also posts these protocol changes, but those are very quickly burried by other bot posts.

For the most recently offboarded AAVE, BAL and COMP we at DeFi Saver tried notifying (to be) affected users with in-app notifications, as well as discord mentions, but it wasn't the best of efforts and we can certainly improve on this, too.

One comment I've heard from affected users is that they feel that the whole process happened way too quickly for something so important (with some adding that they even try to keep up with Maker Governance in general). The most relevant time period in this case is the one from the point the executive passes and until liquidations start happening, I believe, so maybe that's something worth considering, too.",2021-11-27 02:53:51

Kar27051,"d) tax implications
- Services like Lido/RocketPool give you tokens to represent your staked ETH. The US IRS counts this as exchanging your eth for that token, incurring capital gains based on the cost basis of your ETH.

c) lock up period
- till 2.0 if it's any of the staking options
- lending options like BlockFi/Celsius/etc. don't have lock up periods, but you also have to trust them and their lending practices
- crypto.com has lockup periods


b) not your keys not your crypto, but doing everything yourself can also be difficult depending on how tech savvy you are
- Coinbase/Kraken: large exchanges, one of the most convenient ways to stake, can lock your account with TOTP/hardware security keys (fido), they make money by staking crypto for you and taking a cut.

- Celsius/BlockFi: they lend your crypto out to make the money they pay you in interest. They claim most are fully collateralized (like MakerDAO CDPs), but they do make some un/under-colaterlized to ""institutuional investors"". The higher the interest rates go the more profit they have to squeeze out of their riskier lending.

- Staking services lido/rocketpool: they stake your ETH for you and you get a token that represents your holding. That token can be secured safely in any hardware wallet. 

- Staking services like Blox/Allnodes (32ETH): You have to secure your withdraw &amp;/ validator keys and any account info (Blox requires an AWS account). 

- Self hosting (32ETH): secure your withdraw &amp; validator keys, keep your node up to date, will require hardware or some cloud service. Harder to set up but there are guides out there.

a) constantly changing, just find the services you like most and compare current rates",2021-11-27 23:36:21

&gt; #DAI Con Argument
&gt; 
&gt; *Disclaimer: my stablecoin holdings are spread across DAI, UST and USDC. As I take more profit this year DAI will become a bigger holding, but for now it's less than 1% of my portfolio.*
&gt; 
&gt; - DAI is notable as a decentralized stablecoin. It basically [functions as a loan taken against ETH or other collateral](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-makerdao-and-dai).
&gt; - In a [market full of centralized stablecoins](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins) the appeal is clear: no need to trust a central authority (see [USDT Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1sms/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_tether/)) or worry about [getting blacklisted](https://cryptobriefing.com/100000-usdc-blacklisted-highlighting-importance-decentralized-stablecoins/).
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, nothing is risk free and there are some potential aspects of DAI to consider:
&gt; 
&gt; ##Backing
&gt; 
&gt; - As the name implies, 'multi-collateral' DAI is [backed by loans taken against multiple assets](https://share.streamlit.io/tadzz/maker_dai_collateralization_2/main/dai_collateral_app.py), not just ETH. I think a [multi-collateral model](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#in-mcd-we-trust) helps to diversify risk instead of being backed by just one asset.
&gt; - But looking at the data you'll notice that a not insignificant amount of [DAI is generated from USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) and other centralized stablecoins. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [USDC was added to help stabilize DAI's peg back in March 2020](https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-devs-debate-usdc-dai-liquidity-issues/). I think this decision exposed DAI to some risk, given the non-zero possibility of issues with USDC/Circle, such as concerns about regulation, rehypothecation etc. (see [USDC Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2nfy/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_usd_coin/)). Would DAI's peg/liquidity be impacted if the SEC came down on Circle tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; - Does this mean that DAI loses some decentralization street cred? No, [according to MakerDAO](
&gt; https://blog.makerdao.com/busting-makerdao-myths-seven-misconceptions-about-dai/). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, some community members saw it differently. One forum member voiced concerns at the time:
&gt; 
&gt;         &gt;""[there are new economical risk that can sneak in with such a solution and mixing it with an otherwise decentralized system ... I am in this project for it’s pure decentralized nature and would not want to see it becoming inter-mixed with USDC. If it were, I would rather just want to stick with USDC altogether.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-usdc-as-collateral-to-mitigate-liquidity-risk/1570/16)""
&gt; 
&gt;     - So if you're a purist, you may not like DAI's 'contamination'.

&gt; #DAI Con Argument
&gt; 
&gt; *Disclaimer: my stablecoin holdings are spread across DAI, UST and USDC. As I take more profit this year DAI will become a bigger holding, but for now it's less than 1% of my portfolio.*
&gt; 
&gt; - DAI is notable as a decentralized stablecoin. It basically [functions as a loan taken against ETH or other collateral](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-makerdao-and-dai).
&gt; - In a [market full of centralized stablecoins](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins) the appeal is clear: no need to trust a central authority (see [USDT Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1sms/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_tether/)) or worry about [getting blacklisted](https://cryptobriefing.com/100000-usdc-blacklisted-highlighting-importance-decentralized-stablecoins/).
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, nothing is risk free and there are some potential aspects of DAI to consider:
&gt; 
&gt; ##Backing
&gt; 
&gt; - As the name implies, 'multi-collateral' DAI is [backed by loans taken against multiple assets](https://share.streamlit.io/tadzz/maker_dai_collateralization_2/main/dai_collateral_app.py), not just ETH. I think a [multi-collateral model](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#in-mcd-we-trust) helps to diversify risk instead of being backed by just one asset.
&gt; - But looking at the data you'll notice that a not insignificant amount of [DAI is generated from USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) and other centralized stablecoins. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [USDC was added to help stabilize DAI's peg back in March 2020](https://news.bitcoin.com/makerdao-devs-debate-usdc-dai-liquidity-issues/). I think this decision exposed DAI to some risk, given the non-zero possibility of issues with USDC/Circle, such as concerns about regulation, rehypothecation etc. (see [USDC Con arguments](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og2nfy/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_usd_coin/)). Would DAI's peg/liquidity be impacted if the SEC came down on Circle tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; - Does this mean that DAI loses some decentralization street cred? No, [according to MakerDAO](
&gt; https://blog.makerdao.com/busting-makerdao-myths-seven-misconceptions-about-dai/). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, some community members saw it differently. One forum member voiced concerns at the time:

&gt;         &gt;""[there are new economical risk that can sneak in with such a solution and mixing it with an otherwise decentralized system ...

TrymWS,"Maker. It’s the governance token for MakerDAO, where you can generate DAI, the biggest decentralized stablecoin.

You generate DAI as a loan, and lock up your crypto as collateral.

The Maker token is being generated and burned to offset any losses or gains from liquidating insolvent vaults, from those who have generated a DAI loan.",2021-11-28 20:38:29

Letsmakeitawsome,"Maker (MKR) is the governance token of the **MakerDAO** and **Maker Protocol** — respectively a decentralized organization and a software platform, both based on the Ethereum blockchain — that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin.

The DAO had an objective to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing both commercial and non-profit enterprises

Again. DAO, **as a management and vote system**, will not be abandoned. Certain projects will be. When talking about MKR, you are taking about specific project. It’s like saying that decentralized, open source monetary system is just a trend that will be abandoned because Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond has crashed.",2021-11-29 00:26:27

&gt;     - That's not a strong con in and of itself - most people interacting with smart contracts don't know how they work, you don't need to have a deep understanding of [how AMMs function](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/) to use a [DEX](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Still, I think a [seignorage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seigniorage.asp) system like [how Terra mints its decentralized stablecoin UST](https://research.thetie.io/the-terra-triforce-rise-of-the-lunatics/) is easier for folks to use and grasp - no need to [maintain a CDP](https://media.consensys.net/how-to-open-a-makerdao-cdp-and-earn-interest-on-compound-a-walkthrough-guide-b9e9f9584000), just burn LUNA to get UST. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Historically, DAI has fluctuated given market volatility and in the past the MakerDAO team have [debated different strategies to retain the $1 peg, including an 'emergency shutdown'](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/12/defi-leader-makerdao-weighs-emergency-shutdown-following-eth-price-drop/).
&gt; 
&gt; - The stability and collateralization of DAI is thus a function of MKR governance, which in my opinion has a lot of room for improvement:
&gt; 
&gt;     - There's a [lack of transparency](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1197153771564019718) and a lack of participation, leading to [whales dictating monetary policy](https://twitter.com/0xMako/status/1188824097918029825?s=21). To take a more recent example, a [proposal to remove USDT collateral passed with only 10 unique voters, one of which had 73% of the voting power](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmRNwrTy?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown).
&gt; 
&gt; - To me this is not the ideal of decentralized governance, but more akin to the Federal Reserve setting monetary policy.

Crispyshores,Eth &gt; stEth is a brutal taxable event for me as well so unfortunately not ideal.  At the moment I think Makerdao with straight Eth is the most battle tested option,2021-11-29 20:36:39
LongForWisdom,"As an aside. ETH-C is likely to be the cheapest and most long-term stable vault to borrow from. It does have a slightly higher liquidation ratio though.

As a minor unsolicited history lesson:

In the early days of single collateral DAI the Maker Foundation posted a few articles about how refinancing mortgages was a great use-case for the protocol because the stability fee was 0.5% at the time.

However, this backfired pretty badly when the stability fee was raised to maintain the DAI peg. Naturally those that had gone with that use-case were unhappy and presumably refinanced elsewhere when rates increased.

Maker Governance is obviously out of any one person's hands, but one of the goals the [MOMC](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-proposal-group-makerdao-open-market-committee/7355) (group that proposes monthly parameter changes), is that ETH-C supports the more long-term low-rate use-case for borrowing that had to be abandoned with single collateral DAI.",2021-11-29 21:27:33
YogurtclosetNo4072,"personally speaking I've been keeping my eye on Hubble Protocol. They are set to launch beginning of Jan, and something just feels different about them. its nice that a collateralized borrowing and lending protocol (built on Solana btw) will also carry a native token and a stablecoin for its users (they described themselves as the MakerDAO of Solana lol). 

more importantly Hubble preaches democratizing finance across all its users (pretty rudimental to the purpose of DeFi)--  the revenues they generate will be shared with the community that stakes HBB and deposits USDH into the stability pool that covers unhealthy loans, and a small percentage of this revenue is transferred to the protocol’s treasury. 

stablecoins FTW!",2021-11-29 23:45:36
