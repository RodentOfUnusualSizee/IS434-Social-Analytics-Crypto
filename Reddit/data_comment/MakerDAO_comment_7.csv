GrilledCheezzy,"Okay so assuming you’ve been learning about cryptocurrencies for years I find it interesting that most of the things you find valuable about this project are all related to marketing. That’s where I get turned off by the projects posted here. They’re all the same in which marketing seems to be the most important thing to the community. That doesn’t bother you at all? Like if you’ve been a part of crypto that long then you’ll remember the last bear market. Do you recall how impactful marketing was for projects to gain value during this time period?

Also I find it interesting that not having the ability to mint tokens is a plus. It’s fairly typical that projects have a minting function. Take makerdao for example, one of the most innovative and successful projects in defi - the ability to mint dai from your cdp vault is integral to maintaining the dai peg to 1$. I do know that some projects prefer to mint tokens at one time, hold in an owner wallet or an otherwise protected wallet but in my opinion it’s better to have a minting function. You’re relying on someone to have control over a wallet holding the entire supply and that would be considered centralization in my book. There are pros and cons to either approach. But one thing I do know is that makerdao has been using the mint function for over three years without any issues so that seems like a pretry ambiguity attach vector for an exploit. 

Now so like what’s the future for ultrasafe in your opinion? Like I get that it’s Safemoon but slightly different than Safemoon. Safemoon didn’t really do anything.  They didn’t provide any real innovation to crypto except maybe some slightly interesting economic functions. Is ultrasafe implement anything different from Safemoon other than the fact that they don’t mint the tokens as needed?

I know I sound like an ass but I really am interested to find out how someone that’s been around for a few years is seeing the value in this project. I would think that you have some kind of insight along with your experience but I know most is the buyers of these kinds of tokens are typically noobs.",2021-07-01 07:15:48
Ber10,"I am reading the Maker Dao Forum from time to time. And I have to say its amazing how far DAOs have come. I dont know of many other project that has this many involved players operating on such a high level. Compound governance is more centralized.

Defi is evolving infront of our eyes. With those 3 billion usdc that the protocol owns if they put that to work... MakerDAO is like an investment company with legal teams and real world actors acting on behalf of the protocol. And I see them making the jump to the real world economy right now. The DAO is branching out who knows what they will do. Maybe one day they will buy the empire state building and rent it out while the yields are going burn MKR the building will be collateralized to print more DAI.

I really cant see where this journey is going but its fascinating to follow.

MKR COMP AAVE those DAOs are truly gamechanging. But MKR has the best way to let the yields flow to the MKR owners.

Its truly undervalued. That Dai is heavily backed by USDC might not be such a bad thing afterall. MKR holds 10%+ of all USDC. They are extremly liquid they can do with it whatever is best. Diversify the backing away from USDC for example. They have some real leverage over circle.

INTJ-consultant,"With yield being proportional to risk, there's no straight forward answer to your question. There's no such thing as risk free yield, if you think about it, it's kind of obvious why this is inevitable truth. Another thing is your use of the term ""stable coin"". I guess it used to mean placeholder for USD, but these days it's not that simple anymore. USDC and BUSD are backed by Circle and Paxos respectively(centralized), while DAI is backed by MakerDAO(decentralized).

  
Lastly I want to point out MATIC is the native currency Polygon, ERC20 is a smart contract token standard and BSC is a centralized version of Ethereum. The fact that you grouped these three together is very telling about your level of understanding and your ability to evaluate risk in a well reasoned manner and asking the internet what is best is unlikely to improve your situation.

Except Reflexer left out that multi-collateral part and is ETH only. And RAI is a stable asset pegged to itself (by the PID controller), not a stablecoin pegged to USD like Dai is.

All things considered, I'd personally consider it very safe, because they re-used Maker code and they had a test build (protoRAI) on the mainnet for months last year and the current, actual release has been live on mainnet since mid-February, with no issues and RAI holding pretty stable, even through the major crashes and all market volatility, in general.

Plus, Reflexer has the same 1-hour price oracle delay like MakerDAO has, which is super convenient.

While it's still too early to suggest a real outcome, Polygon undoubtedly attracted a share of Ethereum's DeFi users; however, it is clear that DeFi dapps are still performing positively in the latter's ecosystem. With more DeFi dapps expected to extend into Polygon or other blockchains, it will be worth monitoring how the DeFi Status Quo really unfolds. Whilst DeFi dapps continue their strong performance in the BSC network, the launch of the Binance NFT Marketplace is an enticing event for the whole industry.

all loans are backed by collateral. something of value, so how cna u say dai is any different, crypto has value simply because people buy  it.

collateral might b something that deappreciats (using ur car). using your house is a volatile asset but pretty stable so u can get a loan using equity as collateral. 

makerdao isnt really any different with the minting of dai with an asset collateralising the loan. you have to think of DAI as a loan on the collateral. the risk params of getting liquidated are known are there are bots u can get to pay down debt or fund the collateral to avoid liquidation.

""Unsurprisingly lending protocols MakerDAO, Compound, and Aave are the largest consumers of USDC, holding ~23% of the USDC supply.

nikola_j,"Hey, saltyfinish.

CDP stands for collateralized debt position and that's the currently most common way to get loans in crypto - you deposit one asset as collateral, to borrow another.

Some of the most popular options for this have been MakerDAO, Compound and Aave, though as of recently there are also Reflexer and Liquity to consider.

As rgscg mentioned, Liquity is the most interesting option, as there are no streaming, on-going fees, just a one time borrowing fee at the moment you take the loan.

We actually just added Liquity to DeFi Saver like two weeks ago, so perhaps consider reading this [intro post on the DFS blog](https://medium.com/defi-saver/liquity-is-live-in-defi-saver-should-you-consider-switching-fa3d4584b6d0) if interested (there's a bit of a comparison with MakerDAO in there, too).

Please feel free to page me if there's anything more I can help with (disclaimer: I'm from the DFS team) and if you're thinking about going with DeFi Saver, keep in mind you have the Simulation mode available, so you can try any of these processes in a simulated environment before committing actual funds. Imho super helpful for first time DeFi users.",2021-07-03 03:24:39
nikola_j,"To answer this specifically - you can use MakerDAO through DeFi Saver, yes.

You'll be interacting with the same MakerDAO protocol and in the same way as in their default (Oasis) app. We stick to using standard Maker architecture based around dsproxy\* which means you can switch between DFS and Oasis at any point in time, just by loging in one app or the other.

\*Dsproxy is the standard proxy smart contract wallet that's been used by MakerDAO for years now. You create it with your account, and your account is its sole owner and manager. Having the CDP/Vault sitting on the dsproxy enables running complex transactions on that position with any number of different smart contract interactions, whereas you would be greatly limited if the CDP was sitting directly on your standard account. I tried making [a simple illustration](https://imgur.com/xSGS3dT) to explain how that works (especially at DFS where use the dsproxy for all supported protocols).

Possible-Event-9640,"&gt;so ud have to divide that with the total amount in the pool to figure our your %return\*365 as a guestimate

Basically you have in UniswapV2's Analytics, for each day, the traded volume, and the total liquidity.

If you want to estimate the APY using only the information of the last day, the math is really simple:

`( 1 + ((volume*0.003)/liquidity) )^365`

If you want to do that estimation based in the last **N** days, then the math is the following:

`[ (1+((volume1*0.003)/liquidity1)) * ... * (1+((volumeN*0.003)/liquidityN)) ]^(365/N)`

In Deunifi, you have this information already calculated, and additionally you can change the amount of days used to estimate the LP's APY and the Vault's APY.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;sounds too good to be true, if the calculation was 49%

49 % is in the case you are collateralized 200%, but the LP's APY based in the last 30 days is around 26.6%.

If you use only the last 7 days to do the estimation, the LP's APY's is 17.7 % and a vault with a 200% collateralization has a 32.2 % APY.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;then market participants will end up adding more to the LP until returns arnt worth it

That's not totally true. 

First of all, there is a Ceil limit for each UNIV2\* vault type. So the amount of UNIV2\* generated with this mechanism is limited.

More liquidity means more stability in price, this means less price impact, causing more opportunities that increment the traded volume.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;how is there a double earning of ffees? I get the fees earned from uniswap. but once i mint on maker, i have some DAI which i can then loan out or buy more eth/usdc and readd to the LP (just an example) is that what you mean?

Yes, that is exactly I meant.

You have an example of the manual steps to achieve this, in the Deunifi documentation:

[https://docs.deunifi.org/core-concepts/deunifi-transaction#manual-steps-to-invest](https://docs.deunifi.org/core-concepts/deunifi-transaction#manual-steps-to-invest)

And there are different examples on how, the same operation, can be done in only one step using Deunifi:

[https://docs.deunifi.org/getting-started#lock-and-draw](https://docs.deunifi.org/getting-started#lock-and-draw)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;is there a testnet where you can experiment with creating dai to get a feel for the process without putting funds at risk?

Yes, you can test this only in the Kovan network. That is because MakerDao only exists in that test network. Here is the documentation on how to do that:

[https://docs.deunifi.org/test-network](https://docs.deunifi.org/test-network)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;si thejre a way to automatically have this managed with ur wallet withjout a bot?

Automatically, only with a bot.

Personally I do not like to put my money in the hands of a bot with rules written by others.

The rules are only rules and can fail.

I think the best approach is to not be collateralized too much (except for the UNIV2DAIUSCD-A vault type), and always pay some attention to the market.

For example, in the case of UNIV2USDCETH-A vault type, a collateralization ratio of 200% when ETH as a price `P`, means that you are going to be liquidated in case the price move to `0,41*P`.

So if you invest in an UNIV2USDCETH-A at 200% collateralization ratio when ETH has a price of 2200 USD/ETH, that means your liquidation ETH price, initially would be 902 USD/ETH.

I think that it is an acceptable ratio, because going from an ETH price of 2200 USD to a price of 902 USD, in this days where DeFi is more mature, it is very unlikely. But if it happens, you are going to have time to do some action to avoid liquidation.

Remember that you are going to gain fees with UNIV2USDCETH LPs tokens locked in your vault. Then, this initial liquidation price of 902 USD/ETH, it is going to decrease as the time passes, reducing the risk of liquidation too.",2021-07-04 01:02:20

* Liquity - no on-going fees, just a one-time fee at the point of borrowing; minimum c-ratio allowed is extremely low at 110%, but there's some fine print to be aware of in regards to that (namely the recovery mode and the LUSD redemption mechanism),
* Reflexer - they are currently piloting a -0.5% Stability fee, so esentially a self-repaying loan as mentioned [here](https://twitter.com/reflexerfinance/status/1409864734275522564); min c-ratio in Reflexer is 145%,
* MakerDAO ETH-C - currently at 1% Stability fee, was at 2% up until one week ago, I believe; their ETH-C variant has a very high minimum c-ratio of 175% though, so you'd need quite a high ratio of ETH to borrowed amount to make that a low liquidation price.

I recently posted an intro post about Liquity when we integrated it at DeFi Saver, you can find that [here](https://medium.com/defi-saver/liquity-is-live-in-defi-saver-should-you-consider-switching-fa3d4584b6d0) if interested (contains a bit of a comparison to MakerDAO).",2021-07-05 07:07:19

Users can enjoy DeFi applications like Uniswap, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO, PancakeSwap, 1inch and more conveniently from the palm of their hand. 

Ontology network also has a bridge to Ethereum and supports ERC20 on Wing for their own native DeFi. Wing Finance is a lending platform and utilizes Ontology’s decentralized credit score system for one of the flash pools. Worth checking out WING while considering Ontology.

nikola_j,"*\*rolls up sleeves\**

CDPs are collateralized debt positions and it's a term that's historically in DeFi been mostly associated with MakerDAO, which introduced CDPs as a concept in this space, but since then there have been a number of new and different lending protocols that allow creating CDPs and Maker also tried switching to a different term with ""Vaults"".

In either case, today you can create CDPs in MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity, to name some of the more popular options. Each protocol has slightly or greatly different terms for borrowings, so that's worth looking into and comparing in order to make your pick.

I would personally suggest MakerDAO to first-timers in DeFi, as the positions (CDPs) are very simple with only one asset deposited and borrowed per one CDP, and there's the famous MakerDAO oracles with 1-hour delay, which is extremely helpful at times of price crashes, for example.

(However, MakerDAO also introduced minimum debt requirements which have now gone up to 10,000 Dai, so that may be a slight inconvenience for anyone looking to open relatively small positions.)

In terms of how to leverage more ETH using Maker or others, I would suggest reading this post I put together last year: [https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640)   
(I'm currently thinking of doing one to compare all the currently popular lending protocols, haven't see a nice summary on that posted just yet.)

As u/PhiMarHal also mentioned in the replies, you can just head directly to [https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/) and select Simulation mode - that will create a simulated environment (private, frozen mainnet fork) with 100 ETH in credits to play around with any of the integrated protocols.

I think you have a very rigid, too rigid, idea of what a stablecoin is. Their goal is just price stability. Most do it with a peg to USD, others peg to Gold and I'm sure there are other asset examples. But these coins achieve that in different ways, including algorithmically using lending like MakerDAO. They target the value of the dollar and if you understood how they did that, maybe actually look into the examples I'm talking about before calling me ignorant, then you would know that it's possible to target other values, including a slightly higher value to the dollar. And the price would be STABLE similar to Dai.

ethereumflow,"Someone had asked a question about wallets and then deleted the comment. I don’t want to delete my answer though. 

“What do you recommend for a wallet?” is the general question. 

Depends on the coin(s). Exodus is probably the best multi-coin wallet for a transition from exchange to cold storage. It’s a nice interface and easy to get setup but prone to some issues. Certainly suggest Exodus over Atomic wallet, which I have nothing but bad things to say after my experience. 

Coinomi is a good multi-coin wallet if you like paper wallets. It’s got an easy to use sweep feature and a simple interface. The beauty is in its simplicity. 

For Ethereum Metamask is the best choice for dapp exploration. But if you’re open to experimenting ONTO wallet works as an Ethereum wallet and has mobile support for most Ethereum dapps (Uniswap, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO and more) as well as Binance Chain and Polygon as well (mainnet not ERC20). You do not need ONT/ONG to use ONTO wallet. MyEtherWallet (MEW) is also worth considering. 

In general I always favour native wallets. For myself I have mostly Cosmos assets so I use Keplr and Cosmostation (both have Ledger support). For NEAR I use NEAR wallet but keep Moonlet for a mobile alternative. It’s not very convenient but I prefer having multiple seeds and various wallets instead of all of my eggs in one basket, no matter how secure that basket may be.",2021-07-11 04:07:46

I think that yes, there are a ton of redundant projects/platforms right now that we are going to thankfully see get weeded out as market selection does what it does.  DeFi will be the biggest growth sector, obvious, in crypto over the next decade -- we are still in very early stages.  I think most of the growth will be in non-ethereum blockchain projects (at least, relatively speaking, growth-wise) due to the fact that it'll help onboard a lot of new people and those who might want to try out different defi features/benefits without risking a $50+ transaction fee just for removing funds from an LP or something along those lines.

I see huge growth continuing to happen for projects like Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, etc.  The decentralized lending/flash loans that Aave offers are something that could never be available in a million years with traditional centralized finance...even in our market on defi taking a look at Aave's current lending pool utilization one can see that they are massively UNDER utilized, there's a huge upside potential for growth IMHO.",2021-07-11 19:51:33

* Automation cannot be used on positions sitting on standard Ethereum accounts (EOAs) - in order to use it importing to a smart wallet would be required

* Because transaction fees have been rather costly on Ethereum for the greater part of 2021, we have introduced a $60,000 minimum debt requirement for enabling Automation, as smaller positions could be increasingly negatively impacted by transaction fees. (If your debt drops under that while your position is automated, it will still remain automated.)

r-2-eth-2,"**How To Stake DAI To Earn Interest: Beginner's Guide**

&gt; DAI keeps in line with the US dollar thanks to automatic smart contracts that liquidate positions, incentivising and repressing loan creation and by leveraging the MakerDAO governance token, MKR. What is DAI staking and how does it work? Once transferred, your DAI tokens will begin to earn interest at the current DAI savings rate. To earn interest from DeFi lending, a user will need to find a DAI liquidity pool on either a DEX, such as Uniswap, or a lending protocol, such as AAVE. The liquidity pool will have an associated APY. Once DAI tokens have been deposited into the liquidity pool a user will start earning rewards.

just4linux,"I have followed on Kava for soon a year for now. So I might have some more detailed information to share. 

First we can tackle on the interest rate currently it is actually a lot higher than 20% it's closer to 35%. Whatever they offer for you on exchange is bad. The exchange takes their portion of the profit and leaves less for you. You should always stake directly to validators yourself to get best profit. 

The reason why % is now high is because they want encourage to get more people to delegate their kava to validators in order to have healthy balance on their blockchain. afterall validators are the ones that run the whole blockchain and if large portion of it is divided already it's more secure. Also many of them are the ones to give votes for governance to which is required to reach minimum treshhold to accept changes. 

Once the ratio for Kava on validators gets to better ratio it is expacted to have % lowered to probably what it was before which is something around 10-15% and most of that is inflation. As per time being it is possible to do transactions for zero cost on the blockchain so it means that supply is expanding. But if it gets too high, they can remove the option to have free transactions and start to burn the supply to manage it, if needed. 

As per what Kava actually is, it's a defi ecosystem. And it's a very good one. They have planned to make all the basic products that you could ever want, MakerDAO like stablecoin, then Aave like borrowing and lending and uniswap like AMM (to be released in few months). But the big difference is that at least for now they have controlled which tokens are allowed on the chain. In comparison to eth and bsc, which are overloaded with tons of trashcoin, there's only certain more reputable coins like btc, bnb, etc. allowed onchain. Soon USDC and ETH are planned to be added as well. This will make the ecosystem much more cleaner in comparison to most of other blockchains. 

And while their products are very little known, based on my experience they have worked very well and offer very high return. Currently you can gain more than 100% apy for stablecoins for example. Is it sustainable? most likely will lower over time, but I'll enjoy it while it's still high. For some reason they just havent received much attention. Maybe because their guides for new users to join in and marketing has not been that great in my opinion. 

But overall, I'd say with them having different approach  to defi with cleaner ecosystem, I see it as sleeping giant, waiting to be found. My opinion is biased but I tried to explain the information without letting my opinion come too much out on this. My portfolio originally had 10% in kava ecosystem but in the last half a year the portion has grown into 30%. Never put any extra in, just yield farming and volatility.",2021-07-16 14:15:22

downwithnarcy,"AFAIK, many DeFi borrowers tend to use stablecoins as collateral to borrow other stablecoins (due to the low chance of liquidations).

They also use StableCoins pairs in the liquidity pools themselves.

The MakerDAO collapse happened because the availability of DAI dried up in the system after the ETH price collapse….leading to a huge debt burden in the liquidity pools. They then had to print Maker tokens, to auction for more DAI to make up for the deficit.  

But theoretically, if you can keep enough supply of stablecoin, it could prop up the liquidity pools from completely collapsing.

This is just speculation. It could also be that we did see a huge DeFi triggered correction in May, it was just halted by other market forces. You can see a big influx of ETH value on Aave( [DeFi pulse](https://defipulse.com/) ) right before the big drop.",2021-07-21 13:06:48
InevitableSoundOf,"If most are using stablecoins as collateral then the risk of mass liquidations wouldn't happen if ETH tanked. De-pegging would potentially though if the borrowed asset didn't drop aswell. I think it'd just be a judgement call to decide on that one.

A substantial drop in the price of the crypto in a crypto/stablecoin pair would see large imperment loses. This would trigger a pullout of the liquidity pools as I don't see people pumping in more money to prop them up, as there is no gain. However previous price drops haven't seen a widespread pullout.

FaceDeer,"Maker would also collapse if ETH's value was to crater, too. Though less so than it would have back when ETH was the only collateral. The whole point of adding stablecoins like USDC was to mitigate the near-catastrophe Maker had back in March last year when a drop in ETH caused mass liquidations that couldn't be countered with ETH alone.

&gt; DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place.

Couple of problems with that. First, the purpose for which MakerDAO was created is to *maintain the peg of DAI to US dollars.* There's nothing in that that prohibits or requires any particular collateral types, MakerDAO's mandate is to go with whatever works to that end. Secondly, as this article says, MakerDAO is going to be fully decentralized now so the only ""strict rules"" left are the ones in the actual smart contract. It's up to MKR holders to decide what types of collateral to accept now. Decentralization means it's out of any particular group's control.

&gt; Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that.

We saw what was wrong with that back in March 2020, ETH's price suddenly dropped and there were mass liquidations. DAI nearly lost its peg. The whole point of multi-collateral is to diversify DAI's backing so that it's not as strongly affected by fluctuations in the price of any particular one.

At the end of the day, results are what matters. If DAI's peg fails then MKR holders will lose their money, so that's why it's up to them to make these decisions to prevent that from happening.",2021-07-22 00:11:21
admachbar,"Ok, ""you went full retard; you never go full retard"".  So let's bring you back from the brink. 

Even in the most decentralized of models where entities such as MakerDAO, Oasis and Uniswap may  operate, the 'natural and legal person(s)' acting (making trades , loans, tokenizing, etc.) on these 'platforms' are generally responsible for respecting regulation imposed on all participants of the said activity (That goes for taxation, market specific regulation, representation, etc.). In APE speak... you can't legally do stuff on blockchains which is illegal to do otherwise (that should not come as a surprise to most people with half a brain).

Decentralization, specifically second generation blockchains, provide multiple advantages over traditional centralized models and they offer the promise of shaking up the traditional world of intermediated trade. 

In fact... most of the bullshit we are fighting against right now is because of intermediation (Shitadel &amp; Co.). 

You could probably argue that the current DRS/Cede stock ownership model is deprecated and that it could be ""re-decentralized"" (remember, your grandpa used to keep his stock certificates in a safe).

The challenge today is the following: authorities don't trust citizens and believe that constant monitoring is required to ensure 'proper' market operation. Monitoring is super simple in a central/custodial model where one entity has access to all the data. 

For the same reasons as most of you .... I think that's bullshit. Citizens must recapture ownership and enforce trust. For that, though, citizens have to understand their responsibilities.",2021-07-22 02:07:50

It's not obvious, and Oasis isn't popular and well known like MarkerDAO and Uniswap.  Why Oasis instead of something like Synthetix?

To list Oasis in the middle of MakerDAO and Uniswap, two very well known entities in the DeFi space, is kind of sus tbh.  I'm not trying to be a dick, but could you please elaborate a little bit on Oasis?",2021-07-22 05:01:12

&gt; ETH is a leverage machine.

&gt; It’s useful and value-producing today (heck, it was value producing when we just had MakerDAO), but it’s going to be interesting to see how we can leverage ETH over the next few years and beyond.

You also get the choice to either simply claim the INST tokens or use them to add more collateral or pay back part of your debt or just swap them to whatever right away, like so: [https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9](https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9)[https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9](https://imgur.com/zm2kSe9)

For example you can utilize flash loans to repay your debt with part of your collateral, normally you’d need to introduce new Dai into the loan under the normal MakerDao Oasis interface. Or you’d have to manually withdraw some, sell on Uniswap, and repay (3-4 steps vs 1 step). 

For the auto saver part you asked about, it’s just constantly adjusting between loan borrowing and repaying depending on price movement. When price rises you borrow more from the collateral and stack it back into itself, and when it’s crashing you constantly sell to pay back collateral and safely exit the position.",2021-07-25 19:59:47

Sanguinius-kek,"Fraud investigator is not a uselss job. Having to go throguh several different countries as middlemen exchanges during a international bank transfer is however and takes ages. Additionally theres a minimum transaction limit which crypto heavily reduces. This video talks about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO9QAEuXzo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO9QAEuXzo4)

'muh blockchain takes ages' Spoken like someone who thinks ETH and other archaic tech is all crypto. Many take the same small amount of time . The example in that video being stellar lumens which has pretty much instant. Additionally youre only concerned with small transactions by individuals. Larger transactions such as those by corporations etc. across various economic zones takes longer (hence why the jobs exist which makes this irrefutable). 

Again you mention 'the blockchain' without stating which ones and ignore how the tech is developing quickly. It uses less energy than a bunch of people havign to go into work at financial institutes to do the same job and who can do mistakes. minimal support staff required (as shown again in that ONE example). You keep mentioning miners. Aka you think PoW is the only consensus method in existence. mining is mainly done for either BTC or ETH. BTC is essentially the equivalent of what gold is to fiat in terms of its price and its not very usable. But liek gold its a market indicator and store of value. Once its all mined (as it has a supply limit) then the energy costs are highly reduced. ETH is mined heavily because its a heavily trafficed network and thus mining for it is profitable. ETH however is a slow piece of shit as anyone who has done transfers over Uniswap will tell you. However it still serves its purpose and allows for transactions to occur in areas it wouldnt have. Furthermore if vitalik gets of his arse then the change to the PoS consensus method will be implemented sooner. The part that solves the major mining problem you bitch about. Oh whats that you think PoW is the only consensus method? Well shit that means you dont know what youre on about then.

people in those countries dont have access to buying such currencies due to laws or its very difficult to do so. Oh wait. They can just buy stablecoins such as USDT, BUSD, USDC etc. or buy the fiat on the crypto exchange themselves. Once again you dont know such things exist as you have done no research and think that crypto = just ETH and BTC or other volatile assets. Your argument on deflation is attributed to the realisation of value. By the point that occurs with fiat its already been fucked for several years before that point. Additionally you are assuming that all crypto is deflationary and has its value based in the same way a fiat currency is. Its not. inflation promotes spending. So why is gold not always inflating/devaluing then given thats pretty much the 'basis' or rather was for fiat? Because inflation and deflation alone do not serve as sole indicators of economic health for a country/economy. Furthermore you can spend your crypto. 'but muh cant buy shit new iphone' they dotn accept it yet? Cool you just buy fiat with crypto then and use that. Literall the same way you would with alternate currencies in different countries who do not accept your version of fiat. You can also store shitloads of fiat which happens on a huge scale with a small part of it beign in active circulation in an economy. Once again this occurs in stuff like the UK, the US, and the EU etc.

Your argument on USDT can be attributed to fiat. Except you can get away with it in fiat due to immense corruption in the world. Other examples exist which have their value based on the US dollar. these include BUSD, USDC and DAI which is part of the MakerDAO network: [https://makerdao.com/en/](https://makerdao.com/en/)

Crypto is not fiat you dumb cunt. It has its value MEASURED against fiat because thats the most recognisable wealth metric. You dont see stores putting the value of a loaf of bread according to gold do you? Youre implying that fuckign fiat isnt valued on percieved value, hype and a similar form of debt (as is all currency). Your GBP and USD all have value because you deem it has value. It represents value as value owed by labour etc. This occurs for all currency. What youre actually annoyed by is volatility. Volatility is high during early use of a currency or during huge events in a country. A governing body (in the case of fiat a reserve ran by the government) imposes restrictions to prevent huge volatility fucking everyday life up for its citizens/users. This occurs with stablecoins as well as shown in the MakerDAO example. Except in the case for some crypto currencies this governance isnt centralised. 

If the value of your fiat drops you also have nothing. It has no intrinstic value. Oh wait you still use it though? What because evreryone else uses it? No different to crypto then especially given most fiat is digitised and not physical. The difference here is that crypto is more efficient from a computational viewpoint and will eventually be implemented into widespread use. For example the UK treasury is interested in having their own 'stablecoin'. It would be the same as digitised GBP but transactions are far smoother/efficient. Crypto is similar to but not the same as digitised fiat. Plus if you actually thought they were the same then that completely goes against your own criticism. 

Ah yes so you some code monkey making shit products for what are essentially literal whos or low interest in the idea companies completely negates tghe technology's financial use. With your same shit anecdote I can find many people who do similar work who will say the opposite. Hence theres many different cryptocurrencies and many different networks. Many of them not shit. Just because you made a shit API or worked on a shitcoin that failed or was part of a rugpull (which can also happen with any asset) doesnt discredit the idea.

The bit on fraud proves you dotn use crypto and a blithering idiot. How do you buy crypto? You sign up to an exchange which requires identification to be used. You trade on a network freely. You can still get robbed with fiat and could easily before support networks are set up. Cryptio is new and doesnt have this implemented (and it still occurs wirth fiat and it used to be even more widespread in fiat). At best you have 1 exchange account that send to hardware wallets. Cool How do you cash out without usign the same account. The one with a public ledger that can be used to help stop fraud and laundering. I.e a more useable one than the mess that is data systems by banks etc. Plus money laundering and fraud happen shitloads with fiat especially if youre rich enough to just ignore it/have the data altered as its not immutable. 

Youve posted classic FUD, classic cope posts, and classic 'muh what about dis' tier arguments and even threw in a fucking shit anecdote that can easily have an opposite one posted. You clearly know fuck all about crypto given the drivel youve typed up (which makes me question how you were able to work with it/was your work just dogshit) and are simply another person seething about high GPU prices and need to place the blame on one group.

Just stop with the cope mate.",2021-07-29 23:57:32

Imagine Forex coupled with the power of DeFi. That'd be something. I like the prospects of making a payment in $ (as crypto, not fiat) to some one cross country with as low of a fee.

Ber10,"There  might be fluctuations but there is MKR tokens that back as a last resort and 40%  backed by Ether and other decentralized assets.

The US Dollar is definetly not backed 1:1 yet people still believe it has value.

The point is moot anyway. Maker DAO is aware of this problem and there is already plans in the making for diversifiying away from USDC to reduce counterparty risk.   I also hate the fact that USDC is so dominant but the truth is that MakerDAO has 3 Billion USDC that can be easily diversified. For example getting cash is an option getting US Bonds might actually be a requirement for stable coins to move forward.

The thing is whatever happens MakerDAO can react fast and mitigate any risk. USDC would be fucked if they freeze 12% of their USDC this would instantly destroy the trust people have in USDC so they would have to be forced by the government and this wont just go without notice because pretty sure that circle would sue them.. Also circle would be fucked if Maker decides to cash out 3.2 Billion USDC in Dollar which they could do anytime. MakerDao is in a great position. And if the governments crack down hard on stable coins DAI is going to be one of the few that can survive anything the government throws at them. So I rather own DAI to store my money than USDC.",2021-07-30 04:38:20

esbecavaqd,"If this continues, I'm pretty confident that soon we'll be seeing Forex brought to the Blockchain itself lol. I don't mean in a way that the FEDS can continue printing like crazy but in a manner that's decentralized. A good way to have that would be to back it by crypto (rather than Fiat, since you can then have the problems of Tether emerge). However, I doubt that the feds would do this so maybe Onomy (brings Forex to the Blockchain) and MakerDao are the only such protocols doing this?",2021-07-30 22:15:36
