StableRare,"If you are a believer in the ""Fat Protocol"" theory, that may be true.  Certainly all the DeFi hacks lately on the Binance Smart Chain are making lower yield, but more trusted DeFi base protocols such as Compound, AAVE and MakerDAO look more attractive.  The built in insurance mechanism with the safety module is a competitive advantage over Compound I would say, but I think they will come out with something similar soon.",2021-06-01 01:56:56

It's like MakerDao but instead of having an interest rate to keep the stablecoin close to $1, Liquity lets you liquidate people's CDPs by letting you exchange 1 LUSD for $1 worth of ETH. This keeps the price pegged to $1 since if it starts dipping you can arbitrage.

https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-multichain-strategy-and-roadmap-for-maker/8380

In short, they want to make sure that DAI travels through L1 bridges that are controlled by Maker to insure existence of the only DAI across all the supported chains. 

Gravity bridge looks like an interesting bridge for sure, perhaps one of the best ones I saw due to low gas consumption. Do you plan to cooperate with Maker to find a way to make Gravity an official Maker bridge to transfer DAI to Cosmos Hub? If Gravity bridge is truly that good then the official collaboration between Gravity and Maker would be a great thing for both parties and for the end users.",2021-06-02 14:18:41

cryptOwOcurrency,"That's a great question. Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:

* Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about the limitations of Cardano's EUTxO model, which I asked about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/) in April, and which SandaeSwap [wrote about in their whitepaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nqdun4/daily_general_discussion_june_2_2021/h0a4g8t/).

* Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about Cardano's fee model under full L1 load, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers/comments/myeodg/how_does_writing_a_dex_in_plutus_work/gvvnjjx/) and in countless other threads I've commented in.

* Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it's hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano's token transfers don't cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn't matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)

* Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network's ""watch towers"". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.

* Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don't have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It's a chicken and egg. I'll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don't have my fingers crossed.

* Significant amounts of *grassroots* projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn't matter how *many* projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I'll start taking a second look.

* IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the ""ERC-20 Converter"" does NOT do any ""conversion"" whatsoever, it's a BRIDGE, and rename it ""ERC-20 Bridge"" so that it's clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.

* Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it's still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.

* A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done. Huge pain in the ass.

* Being more honest about comparing either Cardano's *present* to Ethereum's *present*, or Cardano's *future* to Ethereum's *future*. A lot of the time, Cardano's future gets compared to Ethereum's present, and that's really unfair to Ethereum. Cardano's future 1M tx/sec gets compared to Ethereum's current 15 tx/sec instead of its future 100k tx/sec with sharding and rollups. Cardano's future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum's current Solidity-only support (which isn't even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.) Cardano's future gain in market share is compared to Ethereum's current market share, not the bigger and bigger market share it's likely to pick up over the next few years, etc.

* Being more honest about how Ethereum's lack of on-chain governance is a deliberate choice based on Vitalik's viewpoints, and how Cardano's on-chain governance is a divergence from those viewpoints to create a blockchain that has a different philosophy. Right now it's touted as a ""straight upgrade"" rather than a difference in philosophy. It also doesn't exist yet, tying into the previous point.

* In general, having better technical resources. I still haven't seen an easy, straightforward tutorial for how to set up a Plutus dev environment and publish a ""Hello World"" contract to the Alonzo testnet. Compare that to Ethereum where there's about a million tutorials on how to test and publish a smart contract on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo Wii and your microwave oven.

* Either Cardano's technology catching up to justify its ridiculously large market cap, or the market cap lowering to meet the current state of its tech. There are other chains like Solana that have working products with a lot more technically impressive innovations than Cardano but are worth 1/10th of what ADA is right now. ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it's not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason. There really isn't a lot more room for Cardano to run, because its run has already been *massive*.

These are a few of the things that would need to change in order for me to admit I am wrong about Cardano being a good investment looking towards the future. Right now, way too many of my questions are going unanswered about it. Unanswered on IOHK's website, unanswered in the Cardano Devs subreddit, and unanswered by any blog article or other resource I've been able to find on Google.

Because so many of my questions have gone unanswered for so long, at some point I am forced to assume that good answers simply don't exist. Otherwise someone, somewhere, would have written *something* that would have been picked up by Google, or someone around here would know something about and be able to point me in the right direction to get them answered.",2021-06-03 06:42:20

richards_86,"Since you're in the Maker forum, I'll answer the question in relation to MakerDao and not all of DeFi in general (although it's generally the same principles).

Maker charges a stability fee (like an interest rate on a loan) on the amount of DAI a vault holder mints. So basically someone deposits collateral, mints DAI (takes a loan), and then the system keeps track of the stability fee debt outstanding based on time. When the vault holder comes back to unlock their collateral they need to pay the original DAI amount borrowed, plus the outstanding stability fee amount. The earned stability fee is then injected back into the MKR token.

I had been lurking in the MakerDAO Reddit in 2016.  In early 2017 someone from the Radix community came over to ask about how Maker’s Dai stablecoin stacked up against Radix’s stablecoin (that they intended at the time).

Dug into what was available on Radix and loved Dan’s approach to identifying the problem and then iterating through solutions (even if it took 8 years :) )

Have been following the project since and was stoked to buy some eXRD in the past year.

Writing this made me think of these quotes (can’t verify legitimacy of them) which sum up the Radix problem solving strategy (IMO):

- it limits risk significantly. Supply and demand are directly linked through Compound itself, and only through Compound itself. Each money market is also contained, so anything happening with USDC affects you none if you're borrowing/lending DAI.

If you compare Compound with Curve for example, Curve offers much higher APYs but also exposes you to significantly more risk.

vuduchyld,"I agree with those below who say zoom out just a little bit.  

Don't consider me a credible source on this, but I think I read somewhere that some of the team recently had some lockups expire, which may have put quite a few MATIC in play on exchanges and generated some available supply.  May not be true.  I can't find that or cite it.  But it may be true...click on the 1-month view here: [https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network](https://www.viewbase.com/coin/matic-network)

But that is short term.  As for the L2/DeFi issue, I think Polygon will do well with retail DeFi.  Institutions are definitely going to be more interested by the security of Arbitrum/Optimism, but if BSC proved one thing, it's that there is a ton of retail demand for inexpensive and fast DeFi.  I tend to believe that even with L2s, 2.0, and everything we know is coming, scaling will be an issue for quite some time.  

I actually like some of the DeFi options on Polygon.  One can choose established players, such as Aave and Curve.  Unlike Alpha or 1Inch, they never went to BSC.  This gives Polygon at least a little bit of legitimacy.  Those teams are really fucking good and smart.  There are also some novel options available.  Mai Finance is at least prima facie similar to MakerDAO.  You can collateralize MATIC, borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin, and use that to farm or buy more crypto.  

I'm not fixing to sell off ETH for MATIC.  (Maybe Bitcoin, though!)  ETH wears the crown.  I deployed a bit of new capital to BSC back in February, though, and I am glad I did.  I've since deployed a bit more new capital and re-deployed BSC capital to MATIC.  If nothing else, it's a worthwhile testnet.  I'm a bit of an experiential learner, and I like being able to move in (AND OUT) of positions with some capital efficiency.",2021-06-07 01:04:46

* Both Aave and Curve are on Polygon.  I haven't looked at all the offerings in a while, but as I recall, there was a Polygon option that looked like 3Crv with 5-6% returns on your stables plus 15-20% returns in WMATIC.
* Mai Finance is similar, I think, to MakerDAO.  You can deposit MATIC into a vault, then borrow a MiMATIC stablecoin.  They have a few farming options that allow you to earn the QiDAO token, Qi.  That Qi token has recently had a run up in price from around 50 cents to around 80 cents, so that farming reward ends up being pretty substantial.  You can pool MiMATIC/USDC for farming pure stables to Qi or MiMATIC/Qi.
* My favorite aggregator is Adamant Finance.  I'm looking at their website right now, and it seems too good to be true...SO IT PROBABLY IS.  The rewards on stables are outrageously high.  I've got a couple of different stable combos running, including FRAX/USDC on Sushi and DAI/USDC on QuickSwap.
* Maybe somebody like u/LogrisTheBard can tell me what I'm missing, here, but Adamant TVL has jumped from under $100mm to about $130mm in maybe 48 hours.  Keep in mind...some of the rewards come from their ADDY token (not all...and it depends on the pool).  But the market cap of the token is less than $20mm.  They show monthly profits to stakers of the token at more than $4mm.  EDIT: and like the Qi token, the ADDY token has run pretty wild the last 48 hours...up from $34 to $57.
* So market cap to TVL is an absurdly low 0.15...and even assuming no growth in TVL or profits, they would be generating $50mm per year in profits that get paid to $19mm worth of hodlers....so 2.5x cash flow to cap?  How could that even be true in this universe?  Of course, the ADDY token, like the Qi token, has jumped from $34 to $57 just over the course of this weekend, so maybe it's true and people are catching on to it?

da-future-is-bright,"&gt;I mean you saw the absolute meltdown the community had over somebody uploading a rainbow logo. Extend that out to further hypotheticals with Voltaire.

What do non-crypto political disagreements have to do with Cardano governance?

&gt;Credible neutrality

&gt;Legitimacy is the most valuable commodity in cryptoeconomics, even though it’s invisible.

How can Ethereum governance be credibly neutral when the supermajority of stakeholders in the system have little-to-no voice in decision-making?

We've seen the censorship that plagues r/Bitcoin, CT, etc. Relying on social-media polling isn't a reliable-enough way to gauge sentiment for governing multi-billion dollar decentral financial platforms.

If a large portion of the Ethereum community:

- A) wanted to fire the existing core developers

- B) strongly disagreed with design choices / wanted to pivot in X way

- C) wanted to fund new protocol research

How would they go about doing that?

A / B are probably possible, but it would require rebelling against the core developers to such a large degree that the price would implode.

People were vocal about the EF's general inaction for a long time, but there wasn't much anyone could do about it, as they are beholden to nobody.

Cardano governance + treasury will allow the community as a whole to:

- hire / fire developers at will, based on past performance and transparency

- fund meaningful RnD / projects

- steer the platform in the right directions, instead of ossifying and dying in a ditch

After governance is implemented, IOHK/etc must submit funding proposals to the Cardano community. Can't get more accountability than that.

Research is also being done for Proof-of-Merit/other systems to further decentralize governance beyond mere stake-weight

Keep in mind Cardano governance isn't just: '51% of active stake can implement protocol changes' - there is deliberate separation of infrastructure and governance

There will be protocol politicians (much like MakerDAO/etc are planning to use) so instead of counting worthless followers/likes, we can see how much ADA is delegated to reputable researchers, developers and influencers.",2021-06-10 02:44:46
halfdayallday123,Right- if you want to be the “bank” then own Maker… MakerDao facilitates the home equity loan for the supplier of the collateral. If you own maker then you’re involved in the business of supporting the system and you’re able to reap the benefits of the revenue that is generated and you’re also able to benefit from the burning feature which should (in theory and so far in practice) reduce the supply of Maker coin and therefore increase the value of it.

Revanchist1,"For most well made projects and dApps, the documentation is usually the best place to learn about all the key parts. 

https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/

Most documentations are explained simply but may take multiple reads to fully comprehend how the systems work.

The Transmuter plays a major role in trying to maintaing the peg. The yield from the deposited Dai (earned via Yearn Finance Dai vault) is sent to the Transmuter contract. When you deposit alUSD into the Transmuter, you will be able to withdraw Dai at the 1:1 peg. The alUSD is burnt and Dai is distributed.

Things get more complicated though. 
u/LogrisTheBard 's posts explains it great.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nr5cic/daily_general_discussion_june_3_2021/h0htw0t?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

But due to some whales wanting to farm efficiently without incurring Slippage, there is a significant amount of Dai (permanently-ish) locked in the Transmuter which is earning yield for all users of Alchemix. Effectively boosting the interest earned on everyone deposits.

Another aspect is the arbritage opportunity. If alUSD loses its peg (alUSD worth less than Dai), you can swap alUSD via curve and deposit the cheap alUSD in the Transmuter to recieve the 1 alUSD:1 Dai. However by using the Transmuter, you are reducing the total amount of Dai in the system that is being used to yield farm. Which means you are reducing the effective yield of Alchemix Dai Vault for everyone. 


The ideas is simple but complicated systems have emerged from them.


MakerDao, Yearn finance, Alchemix, Curve Finance, Uniswap (AMM) These are the main systems that people new to the space should read up on. And you can get the best info from their documentations.",2021-06-10 05:22:19

Beechbone22,"Liquity isn't a lending protocol like AAVE or Compound. Nobody is lending stablecoins on Liquity. You create collateralized debt positions and mint an Ethereum backed algorithmic stablecoin, lUSD (Similar to the well known DAI by MakerDAO, but DAI isn't entirely collateralized by ETH but by a bunch of cryptos you can deposit to MakerDAO as collateral including other stablecoins, which is why I don't like it as much). LUSD maintains its peg to 1 dollar with a redemption feature and liquidity providers between lUSD and other stables are incentivized by pool fees paid by loan takers and arbitrageurs who maintain lUSD's dollar peg. The protocol mints lUSD, collateralized by a ratio as low as 110%. You pay an upfront 0.5% funding fee which goes to protocol token stakers. Stability providers can provide lUSD to the stability pool for the purpose of liquidations for loans below a 110% collateralization ratio, they are incentivized by protocol token emissions to do so, but more importantly they can buy ETH well below market prices during liquidations, especially if the protocol goes into recovery mode. The protocol can go into recovery mode if the global collateralization ratio drops below a certain threshold. Liquity is a very complex money market and I can't go into the nitty gritty technic details, but I like it much better than MakerDAO, AAVE and Compound to borrow long term loans. If they're shorter term, taking a loan on those platforms and paying ibterest for a short time is usually more profitable than paying Liquity's upfront fee.

The other key point of the thesis is that DeFi needs a store-of-value as collateral. Billions of dollars of ETH have been sucked into DeFi protocols like MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave and more. This continues to grow, and make ETH a stronger store of value than Bitcoin.

Finally, ETH is a capital asset: you can stake ETH and earn yield. Billions of dollars worth of ETH are also being sucked into staking.

&gt; Ethereum’s Role in DeFi

&gt; Decentralized finance involves the use of the blockchain in carrying out peer-to-peer financial transactions.  DeFi has ushered in a new era in finance through blockchain technology, which accomplished tasks unheard of in money markets.

&gt;Services such as Compound and Balancer allow for borrowing and lending to take place in a completely decentralized manner. Moreover, it provides a strong foundation for new financial services, which could prove to be game changers.

&gt;Ethereum is the most in-demand platform in the DeFi realm. Several Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, MakerDAO, and others, have become incredibly popular.

&gt;DeFi projects have been growing rapidly, and Ethereum has facilitated their expansion. DeFi Pulse estimates that roughly $64 billion worth of DeFi projects is locked up on the Ethereum blockchain. That number had grown by over five times since January, when it was $16 billion.

AusIV,"One of the problems DAI had before USDC was introduced as a collateral type was that the demand for DAI went down as ETH went up, and the demand for DAI went up as ETH went down, but the supply did the opposite.

If ETH is in a bull run, people want to use MakerDAO to leverage their positions. They collateralize ETH, borrow DAI, use the DAI to buy more ETH, collateralize that, repeat. But who's selling ETH to buy the DAI these people are selling? This puts some downward pressure on the price of DAI, as nobody really wants to buy in during a crypto bull market.

If ETH is in a bear market, people rush to deleverage their positions. They want to buy DAI back to pay off their debt so they don't get liquidated. But again, there aren't a whole lot of people looking to buy ETH while they expect the price to keep dropping - people would rather hold the stable DAI than expose themselves to the volatility of declining ETH. This can make the price of DAI rise, as nobody wants to mint DAI with ETH while that ETH is losing value.

But if you can mint DAI with USDC, this problem sorts itself out. While the price of DAI is rising during the bear market, people mint DAI with USDC and sell it for more than the USDC they bought. Other people use that DAI to deleverage their ETH-backed vaults. This keeps the price of DAI from rising too significantly, because it can be minted pretty cheaply with USDC, and if you assume DAI will eventually return to the peg you can make a profit from helping to maintain the peg. When ETH gets back into a bull market and there's a lot of people trying to leverage their ETH positions again, the demand for DAI that would have been falling can be met by people who elect to buy cheap DAI to close out the loans they took against USDC. This may mean that during a bear market they collateralize USDC to mint DAI, sell the DAI at around $1.03 (the high end of DAI being off peg), then during the next bull market they buy the DAI back at $0.97 (the low end of DAI being off peg), and pocket the $0.06 from the swing.

As for MakerDao adopting those assets as collateral, I'd say why not, it will need to go through voting I believe, but the issue with protocols (AFAIK) like Maker or AAVE is that your overall risk is as high as the riskiest asset in the protocol, if it goes down the whole protocol is impacted and therefore is much more complicated to increase collateral diversification.

On the other hand risk isolated lending/ borrowing pairs like on Sushiswap Kashi the drawback is the low liquidity in high risk pools.

Sure I might just be able to lend myself the money for the down payment but I figured that if a bank held the funds, it would allow me get a more favorable interest rate. 

I don’t see stable coin yields staying at 10% in the long term unless the FED raises rates I guess. Lender mentioned something about Chaffa down payment programs which help you pay 4% of the total home loan value which sounds similar to what you just described, but I would never yolo that loan after the down payment is set into DeFI. That just screams insanity. I’m a first time homebuyer so I’m not sure what the legality or feasibility is in getting a $500,000 loan, using $150,000 for a down payment. I thought the rest of the money was tied into the home’s value as collateral to protect the bank from default.

ArcadesOfAntiquity,"Let's talk about MakerDAO.

I have a positive opinion of MakerDAO. I had a CDP there for over a year and I'd have every confidence in it were I to open another at some point, which I'll probably do.

The question I have in my mind about Maker recently is, wouldn't it make sense to reward users for 

a) incurring stability fees? Perhaps with a token.

b) repaying their loan / not getting liquidated? Perhaps with some mechanism akin to a ""credit rating"", or with a token which could be cashed in to acquire a lower stability fee for a period of time in the future.

You can read about what currently happens to stability fees on [Maker's site](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/stability-fees/):

&gt;Where Stability Fees Go
&gt;Stability Fees are collected inside the Maker Protocol’s internal balance sheet. Once the maximum level of surplus is reached, the system automatically sends Dai to a Surplus Auction. During this auction, Keepers bid in MKR for DAI. Dai is released to the winning bidder while the MKR paid by the winner gets burned.

I like it, it's very serious-minded. Reading my suggestion, people might retort ""Maker is really trying to be serious. They aren't into this flashy yield farming reward token stuff. They are the bullet proof foundational money lego in defi."" Fair enough. But...

Accepting USDT and USDC as collateral makes it harder for me to see MakerDAO as such a serious-minded outfit. I guess it was just the way governance votes turned out so it shouldn't be held against the MakerDAO team themselves... the smart contracts themselves are not made any less reliable by which collaterals are available.

TLDR, I'm cranky and I want Maker (or a competitor) to either offer rewards, or kick out USDT and USDC as collaterals.

Thank you for reading my blog.",2021-06-18 21:29:00

Unfortunately there's no way to do this, as the Trove doesn't have a give/transfer function (like a MakerDAO Vault does). Really unfortunate they left that out, but it is what it is.

If you'd want to get access to our advanced features for Liquity (boosting, repaying, anything within the recipe creator), you'd have to close an existing Trove and create a new one on your Smart Wallet.

Really not a convenient thing to do, I know. Wouldn't really expect many to want to do that, either.

By the way, just to be clear - there is NO Automation support for now. It likely won't be available until our new Automation architecture is ready, which is likely months, not weeks away.

Hope the info helps!",2021-06-19 02:02:15
nikola_j,"By the way, just a quick attempt to clarify what a Smart Wallet at DeFi Saver is.

A Smart Wallet you use at DeFi Saver is nothing else than a MakerDAO DSProxy. If you ever used MakerDAO or Reflexer (but never used DeFi Saver before) - it would mean you already have a Smart Wallet of yours.

Basically, we just call it a ""Smart Wallet"" because we thought it sounds nicer than ""DSProxy"".

A Smart Wallet or DSProxy is created and owned by your EOA (e.g. your account loaded into MetaMask or Ledger) and ownly manageable with transactions executed from that EOA.

In that sense you can see DeFi Saver sort of like an app for managing your assets on the DSProxy or Smart Wallet, it does all the needed transaction creation for you to allow you to interact with protocols such as Aave and Compound and Liquity *through* that DSProxy or Smart Wallet.

Here's an attempt at an illustration: [https://imgur.com/xSGS3dT](https://imgur.com/xSGS3dT) (will definitely check with our designer about creating a better one for future use :D )",2021-06-19 02:14:39

Note that there's no way do destroy a MakerDAO Vault like it was the case with older Single-collateral Dai CDPs when closing them. They just stay there empty. If you'd really want to get rid of them for whatever reason, you could send them to 0x0, but wouldn't recommend doing that.",2021-06-19 04:33:27
nikola_j,"Hey, BrownBear!

Guess this was more of a question for the DeFi Saver discord or forum, but I hope others find the info useful, too. (For anyone interested, [here's a guide](https://forum.defisaver.com/t/converting-between-eth-a-eth-b-and-eth-c-maker-vault-types-using-the-loan-shifter/) for using the Loan Shifter to convert between different vault types.)

Now, to answer your questions:

&gt;With the markets being so volatile, I was thinking of moving my CDP from an eth vault A to an eth vault B. to take advantage of the lower collateral requirements just in case the market tanks.

Great idea, if you'd prefer not to use Repay (our option to pay back debt using deposited collateral), this is a good way to keep your position further away from liquidation as market keeps dipping.

If I do this, can I covert back from B to A once the market stabilizes for the lower stability fee?

Yes, you can. You can do that any point - two minutes after the initial switch or two months or two years. The protocol doesn't care about this. As long as the debt ceiling of the vault type you want to shift *to* isn't at 100%, you can do the shift whenever.

&gt;This is my first time using the loan shifter. Is there any thing I should be aware off? Or is it as easy as it looks.

It's as easy as it looks - but there is one thing to note, yes. The Loan Shifter currently uses Aave flash loans in the process and this means that there would be a 0.09% Aave protocol fee on the debt amount if you take this route.

However - you can do the same process, while avoiding the Aave flash loan fee. Using our Recipe Creator you can re-create the same shift, but using dYdX flash loans (which have no fees) instead of Aave.

The actions you want to put together for a Recipe to create a vault into a different sub-type of the same collateral are:

(1) Flash loan DAI from dYdX in the amount of your current debt rounded to the next whole number, (2) Pay back debt to your current MakerDAO debt, (3) Withdraw ETH from your current ETH-A Maker Vault, (4) Create a new ETH-B Vault, (5) Deposit the ETH into the new ETH-B Vault, (6) Generate DAI from the new ETH-B  Vault - the flash loaned amount and (7) Pay back the dYdX flash loan.

When put together, this ""recipe"" should look like this: [https://imgur.com/S8yDyHP](https://imgur.com/S8yDyHP)

By doing the process this way, you're avoiding all fees, except the transaction fee :)

&gt;Also if I go this route, is a new vault created or is my existing vault moved?

There's no way to change the type of an existing Maker Vault, meaning this process will create a new vault, with a new id#, yes.

Hope this helps and please let me know if I should expand more on any point!",2021-06-19 05:15:37

&gt; In brief, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is backed by, or in other words tied to, a more stable asset or commodity. The most famous example would be MakerDAO, which issues DAI. Another example, many such stablecoins rely on additional collateral tokens. If we take Iron Finance - IRON is the stablecoin, while TITAN is the collateral token.

brokemac,"I think it is because TCR is real and ECR is bullshit. Most projects are overcollateralized to account for changing price. I put up 2 Eth at $4000 total under Makerdao, borrow 2000 DAI, my debt/collateral is 2. Eth falls to $1500, my debt/collateral is 1.5. It gets too low, they liquidate because the collateral no longer exists.

The ECR allows for zero price drop to actually be collateralized. Their formula is USDC collateral over IRON supply. But that is bullshit. The truth is that if you lock up $20 worth of Titan and $80 worth of USDC, and Titan price drops by half, then 10 percent of your iron is simply not backed at all. It isn't backed by a combination of titan and usdc, it's completely unbacked.

Once you have unbacked iron, the only way to ever make that $1 peg sound again is to either hope for the price of titan to rise or to start adding greater than 100 percent collateral. Absent either of those solutions, the protocol can only afford to give 50 percent of people $1 for their iron or 100 percent of them 90 cents on the dollar. When you violate that, you need to hyperinflate titan to accommodate redemptions.

They increased TCR when Titan price fell so that over time, your percentage of unbacked iron in the total circulating supply would decrease. Except changing that is extremely sluggish. If we have 25 percent of iron unbacked at 500 mil marketcap, we need to mint  like 4.5 billion iron at 100 percent tcr to get to close to 98 percent collateralized unless titan price rises.",2021-06-22 02:34:56

nikola_j,"I'm going to feel sucky if I'm saying this to someone who already knows - but hopefully it helps someone in either case:

You can clear CDP debt using collateral that's already deposited in there. We have the option available at DeFi Saver, we call it *Repay*, and it does three steps in one transaction: withdraws ETH (or whichever collateral), sells ETH for DAI (or whichever debt asset) and uses those funds to clear debt.

We actually have this available for a number of protocols now - Maker, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity.

It's a *much* better option than liquidation - with MakerDAO there's a 13% liquidation penalty, while for using a Repay at DeFi Saver there would be a 0.25% fee (and a potential 0.09% Aave protocol fee for the flash loan, though we're trying to get those reduced or we'll switch to other providers).

Though for Compound and Aave you'd have to migrate the position to a proxy wallet for these kinds of multi-step transactions to be possible, while for for Maker and Reflexer you can just login at [app.defisaver.com](https://app.defisaver.com/) and hit it, we're fully compatible with default apps in both cases.

At the same time, you can also convert a standard ETH-A Vault into ETH-B (as described [here](https://forum.defisaver.com/t/converting-between-eth-a-eth-b-and-eth-c-maker-vault-types-using-the-loan-shifter/39)) to enjoy that 130% min c-ratio. The Stability fee is pretty high compared to ETH-A, but there are still certainly perks to using Maker.",2021-06-25 00:05:56
Mynoncryptoaccount,"""Good luck ever getting a loan if you don't use a bank.""  
So this is also my point - we shouldn't be relying on banks, which are private, profit making companies, to control our lives.

""It's like you're choosing to make your life harder by refusing to use technology there to help you out.""  
I'm not saying don't use a bank I'm saying you should have the choice - as it stands most people do not have the choice to not use a bank. Shouldn't it be my choice to be 'helped out' by a bank? 

Also I have had a loan without a bank, through MakerDao - I'd look into it before telling people that the banks are the ones with the technology to help you out.",2021-06-25 12:03:32
Hitchie_Rawtin,"This is 100% a price discussion post, incredibly disingenuous to suggest it isn't.

You seem to have no idea that utility tokens being utilised drives a number up and have completely ignored MakerDAO as a prime example. Is MKR magically pegged to USD value? No.

Can this drop more due to an outrageous distribution (received in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars)? Yes. Hopefully, even. People who don't want to buy when it's low don't deserve the high.",2021-06-25 15:01:45
Hitchie_Rawtin,"ICP only just came out, of course it has barely any usage.

I chose MakerDAO because it's a governance and utility/fuel token. The tokens on the layer above it (DAI or any other asset they want to represent) have little correlation with the price although it seems obvious that once billions in value gets locked in, MKR's price rises.

If you don't think ICP will ever be used on any large scale to compete with Azure or AWS, just don't buy it. If you do think it'll compete then every dollar of value that flows into the competition (and into any smart contract which doesn't require eternal censorship resistance) would be what's flowing towards ICP and moving it's price. Again, ICP's only out a month so it's not being used in any major way at all - yet. There's no reason for the price to be bouyed at all apart from staking.",2021-06-25 16:31:30
jigjagascrp4,I just want to add that you may never used makerdao or lack of knowledge but if i am not mistaken MakerDao is the first or one of the first defi app on the ethereum. MakerDao in its reserves holds approximately 2% of all the eth supply. I may be mistaken aboyt the percentage it’s better yo to check it out. Price of maker hugely back by it’s massive eth reserves. But once again MakerDao is a lending platform.,2021-06-25 16:37:17

BornToBeHwild,"From what I’ve read, as long as the deposit into the lending platform does not result in a deposit token, you should be safe from triggering a disposition. Does MakerDAO provide anything like that when you deposit ETH as collateral?",2021-06-25 18:58:08
kalbhairavaa,"Yeah. That's what I am also hoping.  [MakeDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#abstract) already does decentralised governance (SHIBANALYST explains it in one of his videos. He says SHIB would be a stable coin. If that is the case then SHIB would be like DAI from the MakerDAO system is also a stable coin .But DAI was pegged with ETH to keep the value at 1 USD, not sure how that works for SHIB ). I am just curious as to what the proposed DoggyDAO is and how it is different.  

Sure, my competency isn't blockchain but yeah, I am always open to new stuff. Thank you.",2021-06-25 19:05:04

cometothecaml,"You could just lock the money in a smart contract.

It probably wouldn't be too hard to make a contract that requires 0.01 ETH to submit a guess. Then after a month it could ask the MakerDAO oracle for the price and send the balance to the closest guess.",2021-06-26 00:34:32
vuduchyld,"On Polygon, you can also create a MATIC vault on Mai Finance.  You can borrow a stablecoin (MiMATIC) interest free.  It's similar to MakerDAO.  If you'd rather have USDC than MiMATIC, you can swap them out easily.",2021-06-26 09:50:24

DrDQDPM,"It's was not ""designed"" to be pegged at a dollar. 1 quadrillion tokens were created, half were given to VB, a quarter were put into uniswap and the key was thrown out. Nothing about this suggests that would be at a dollar. DAI, usdt, USDC, tusd, busd, gusd, were designed to be pegged at a dollar, hence their current price around a dollar. Perhaps they are confusing DAO with DAI. DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization and DAI is USD stable coin associated with makerDAO. And if you think the doggy DAO allows holders to vote on the price why would it stop at a dollar?",2021-06-26 21:33:08

blackdowney,"Lately I’ve been really into the r/collapse subreddit and it’s been great to get an outside world view that differs from “everything will be on chain” 


The question of “how do we prepare for something that governments and financial institutions are brushing under the table” comes up sometimes. “Where do I put my money”. Mentioning Ethereum is not different from saying Dogecoin, or Safemoon to even this crowd, and it’s funny how human nature works. One of the biggest similarities between r/collapse and r/ethfinance is that “The world just doesn’t get it, and when they do it’ll be too late”. I guess I’m in the middle of a Venn Diagram between both Ethereum is the future, but Society is fucked. 

Now I’m absolutely just mindlessly reflecting on one interaction so it’s not indicative of the whole, if anything this is pointless drivel. Still it’s great when you find communities online that are so “ahead of it all” and yet so locked into itself that it misses the rest. 

Now I’m checking out r/preppers and my first order of business is going to be buying some large drum barrels, or a trailer with a large tank for food and water. Hook up some solar panels, and buy a giant fresnel lens just in case it gets more rustic than that. And yes I’ll probably be using a MakerDAO CDP for that lol.

Between this experience and listening to David Foster Wallace’s ‘this is water’ again after years, I’m feeling a certain way about the future. Sure nobody knows what will happen but we have some ideas don’t we?",2021-06-28 04:47:34

FaceDeer,"And the funny thing is if people really actually wanted digital gold, it'd be pretty straightforward to create literally that on Ethereum. Just spin up a new MakerDAO instance whose tokens are pegged to the price of actual gold.

vacacow1,"It’s not exactly a default, since you effectively have no option. It’s a liquidation if the “value” of your eth collateral diminished past a treshold DAI bites and puts up for sale your ETH for a discount in the auction house, and it keeps lowering it’s price until there is a buyer, this has led to basically DAI giving away ETH for free.

Imagine it’s the night and you are asleep, ETH drops and your collateral drops, you need to add collateral to stop it from liquidating (much like financial derivatives markets) but instead of having the option, DAI automatically sells your position at a discount.

I’m bad at explaining shit, you can read the whitepaper here:

https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#the-dai-savings-rate

You can read about an example of a liquidation of DAI for basically 0 here:
