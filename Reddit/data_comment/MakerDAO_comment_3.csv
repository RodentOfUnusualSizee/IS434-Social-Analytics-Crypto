MrMoustacheMan,"&gt;1 DAI = 1 USD (more or less). But why?

&gt;Well, it boils down to incentives and smart contracts. When DAI dips below the peg price, the system makes it attractive for users to close their CDPs by repaying their debts – specifically, because interest rates are raised. This reduces the total DAI supply, as the amount repaid is destroyed. Should the price exceed a dollar, the opposite occurs: users are incentivized to open CDPs as interest rates are lowered. This creates new DAI and increases the total supply.

InvestigatorFeisty71,"The worst thing that can happen to any crypto is a hack that subverts the network in a way that allows controlling transactions or minting new coins. Another concern is a conflict leading to two or more potential hard forks where none can gain dominance leading to the slow death of the ecosystem. Those are risks for all cryptos though. Major things like government regulation, private chain dominance, competing hard forks, or other concerns apply to all cryptos. I’m not really sure about ETH specific issues.

Competing hard forks are probably even less of a concern for ETH than other cryptos because it’s such a built out ecosystem that major dapps like Uniswap and MakerDAO would likely coordinate and choose one of the forks to support. They depend on ETH so they have vested interest in joining forces to ensure the continued survival of ETH. That fork would then easily gain dominance since the community would follow the dapps.",2021-03-03 03:53:54
ah-hum,"it's possible i'm complicating, but my thought is that to be a part of the greater ecosystem there needs to be maximum exchange potential.  that to me means the concept of liquidity pools where one can lend/borrow safely and securely will increase global adoption and real life use.  borrowing is an important aspect in a world with not enough to go around, and the perpetual cycling of it creates the momentum that keeps us in balance as a global economy.  the other economies that do this well are ecological exchanges, some with a strict purpose, but with the lowest common denominators being the most basic and simple of all.  water, energy, etc.  I can see Nano's simplicity residing in it's adaptability to all scenarios, but I don't think it's wise to convince ourselves simplicity is single-purpose.  That's a major limitation of the beauty of simplicity.  Nano can be the energy of the internet, but borrowing and lending will be a factor (collateralized of course bc indebtedness is a scourge of humanity).

So if Nano was lent on liquidity pools, backed by borrowers' collateral, Nano lenders could earn yields from Nano borrowers.  Accounts in default slowly sell collateral and exchange for Nano which is provided to users (borrower pays exchange premium and fees).  This is Compound app, but replace Dai with Nano.  The protocol is Compound, governed by COMP, and MakerDAO provides the smart contracts for its Dai coin.  Allowing smart contracts in Nano allows new exchanges to happen so it can enter the larger ecosystem.  If it stays single-purposed it will simply be a tool used by those who control finance, energy and machinery.",2021-03-03 04:06:40

The_Roaring_Fork,"Theta 3.0 Mainnet

www.thetatoken.org

Mainnet 3.0 Overview

Building on this foundation, Theta Mainnet 3.0 introduces two protocol innovations:

Upgrading to Elite Edge Nodes will enable “Uptime Mining”, the tokenization of Internet bandwidth and availability. Users will be able to stake TFuel to an edge node to upgrade it to become an Elite Edge Node. Elite Edge Nodes can 1) earn TFuel through their staked TFuel, and 2) earn additional TFuel from video platforms for delivering higher performance. New 2%-4% TFuel inflation for uptime mining for edge nodes will be introduced in addition to the existing 5% TFuel rewards for validators and guardians. In the process of engaging with platform partners this year, it became clear that to support an existing platform that may see over 1 Billion logged in users per month or even a smaller partner with tens of millions of subscribers, requires an edge delivery network that needs to scale to tens and hundreds of thousands of nodes globally to deliver premium service levels, uptime and performance across all devices.

New TFuel burning mechanism will add a cost for using Theta edge network, namely a “network fee” as a balancing force against new TFuel supply. Since Theta network launched two years ago we recognized that there is significant value accrued to video platform partners in the form of content delivery network (CDN) cost savings, increased user engagement, and revenues resulting from shifting infrastructure costs to user rewards. All these benefits accrue to the platform partner at effectively zero additional cost. With Theta 3.0, a minimum of 25% of each TFuel payment to the edge network will be burned at the protocol level, effectively becoming a cost for using the network. In the long-run as Theta’s edge network becomes more widely adopted, this could meaningfully reduce the supply of TFuel.

At the application level, with Turing-complete smart contract support, potentially more temporary sinks for TFuel can be introduced, such as liquidity pools for Uniswap-like AMM DEX, asset collaterals for MakerDAO-like stable currency, etc. With both sources and sinks in place, TFuel circulation can be adjusted dynamically to adapt to actual demand. We believe this can maximize the utility value of TFuel and benefit all stakeholders of the Theta ecosystem.",2021-03-04 06:16:17

They said the system worked as expected and they only restored the MKR supplies at that time. After that, they opened the reimbursement to an on-chain community vote that resulted in pro-compensating the victims. The second vote with how much to compensate was for 0% (probably by MKR whales who have no incentives to compensate CDP users by losing their own money).

itis_so,"DAI is a decentralized Stablecoin from MakerDAO, and has been the essential building block which has allowed DeFi to exist and prosper. It solves the largest problem in crypto-based financial services -- volatility. 

While there are other Stablecoins such as Tether, DAI was the first decentralized stablecoin on a programmatic blockchain platform -- Ethereum. DAI is native to the Ethereum blockchain and is backed 150% by Ether and pegged to the US Dollar.

In my opinion, DAI is a fundamental building block of the DeFi economy running on Ethereum. 

\--

Tether is the oldest stablecoin, first issued in 2014, and still the most liquid in the world. At one point, (data source Coinmetrics) Tether averaged \~hundreds of millions of transactions per day. Tether now transacts on Ethereum as an ERC-20 since 2018 and branched away from the Bitcoin Omni network. 

Tether is not transparent. It's a dollar backed stablecoin, but you cant see where those dollars are held. There are constant issues surrounding banking and it seems that ordinary holders of Tether have always had trouble withdrawing into fiat currencies.

Basically, all of them are protocols built on Ethereum to provide financial services.  They have their own coins to regulate governance of the networks, allowing the people that hold governance tokens to vote on policy and various aspects to govern the protocol, but the underlying dapps largely operate on Ethereum Smart Contracts.  

I think the easiest way to think of it is, governance tokens a bit like ""Stock"" in the dapp ""Company"".  ""Stockholders"" are given voting rights to help define the direction of the company.  As more and more people use the networks, more and more people have a vested interest in the protocol, which means that they are more and more interested in having a say in what the protocol does, which means that more and more people will want to buy ""Stock"" to increase the weight of their votes.  Stock market sort of works a little similarly, as stockholders do generally get the opportunity to vote on major issues (for example, another company made an offer to acquire the company, the stockholders would be given the chance to vote on whether or not they want the acquisition to go through).  So, yes, there are a lot of other coins that are built on Ethereum, but those coins are largely governance tokens for dapps that actually have legitimate financial functions.",2021-03-09 22:04:21

\- If Eth screws up on Eth 2.0 launch or doesn't release Eth 2.0 or gets flipped by BSC or whatever causing Eth price and erc20 coins to crash to 0 then can that cause a protocol failure that can cause Dai to crash to 0 too or corrupt or breach existing running smart contracts at the time?  


\- Does smart contracts have a programmed algorithm in there that automatically protects users from losses if the above happens or can smart contracts detect Eth market collapse like mentioned above? Its called 'Smart' contract for a reason right?  


\- Can buggy code in a running live smart contract be patched up on the fly?  


\- If MakerDao coin crashes to 0 then will this drag down Dai to 0 too?

\- Finally lending out Dai or USDT or USDC for interest on ledger live has no centralized associated risks right like your stable coins being frozen etc? For Dai only risk is De-Fi protocol risk for example buggy code in smart contract yes?",2021-03-10 08:50:03

Depending on how much money you have in your hand and how much you need for the down payment, you could buy it all in BAT and put it in a MakerDAO vault and borrow DAI against the deposited BAT.

The main downside is that it's going at currently at 6%/year, which is probably more than you are paying for your mortagage. The upside is that you get to keep the BAT, so you don't miss anything if the price goes up and in case the price crashes, your vault is liquidated and you don't need to pay the load back.

Also zk rollups have been live on Loopring for at least 6 months now. They work well. Other rollups solutions have launched since then too.

It's mostly seamless. It does require a transaction to get your funds into the L2 to begin with, but the idea is that once every app has a L2 integration there will rarely if ever be a need to leave it.

3. Yield farming. Not like the really degen yield farming, but there's some really promising new projects, and it's cool to be able to ""earn"" tokens for them, without spending any money. Like trading without the risk
4. Borrowing: I don't plan on ever selling my ETH, so lots of it is in MakerDAO. I can borrow Dai against it, and put it in protocols like yEarn or Aave and make free money
5. Staking: some of my tokens are stakeable, which lets you earn fees or rewards. Synthetix is interesting because you use it to mint other synthetic assets, and can claim more SNX weekly for providing this liquidity
6. Governance: there's a couple protocols that I'm really passionate about, so I follow their governance process &amp; vote in proposals

ec265,"&gt;The problem with this is they are making eth deflationary by stealing from every single user every time they make a transaction by not passing on the funds to the miners. Literally theft in every single transaction.

Burning ETH is essentially being re-invested in the network. Burning BASEFEE ‘pays’ everyone, equally. Whether you are Staking your ETH, or have it inside of MakerDAO, Uniswap, Augur, in your wallet, in a game, BASEFEE is paid to your ETH. **If you hold ETH, you ‘receive’ BASEFEE indirectly.** ETH price is a function of supply and demand, and this will simply reduce net issuance and potentially overall supply.

&gt;I would argue EIP 1559 is worse than any kind of taxes, since at the very least, taxes are spent somewhere else, no matter how dumb of a place they use them, they're still used.

EIP-1559 *is* Ethereum’s taxation system, and all users are taxed equally. No individual will ever pay more or less in taxes than any other individual, per their use of the network.",2021-03-13 16:49:24

Coldsnap,"Welcome Eth-fam to another **Weekly-ish update** to my high level view of some of the bigger things happening in the Ethereum ecosystem upcoming.

People seem to like this laid out in a timeline, so, may as well keep posting it!

**Timeline impacts this week:**

~ The Eth1/Eth2 Merge was big news this week because people want it sooner. 1 - Vitalik publicly [reaffirmed commitment](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/HkIXJsDmd#Open-discussion) to getting the Merge done as quickly as possible, and 2 - a [WIP PR has been raised](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2229?s=09) for the Merge in GitHub. Things are definitely happening, so am sticking with the ‘Early 2022’ estimate at this stage although that may now be pessimistic! Consensys has [a good blog this week on the topic of sooner](https://consensys.net/blog/ethereum-2-0/proof-of-stake-is-coming-to-ethereum-sooner-than-we-think/).

~ The Eth2 summer upgrade is now called [Altair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s017DQlsCCw&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation), off the back of the decision to go with star names.

~ Feels like old news but was only last week… at the latest [All Core Devs meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWfR-WxjmYg&amp;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation] it was agreed that EIP-1559 [will be included](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1367858606889037824) in the London upgrade for release this summer. The difficulty bomb delay will also go into London. Still on the roadmap for June. 

~ On the same call it was agreed to [remove EIP-2315](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/263#issuecomment-790910171) from the upcoming Berlin upgrade, which has testing impacts, but they agreed that there would be no change in the dates. Berlin is still happening 14th April all going well. [Official launch announcement comms are out.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/08/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-announcement/)

**Layer 2 updates&gt;**

~ DeFi app MakerDAO is coming to the L2 party announcing that it has a [DAI/Optimism bridge in the works.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcing-the-optimism-dai-bridge-with-fast-withdrawals/6938
) This will, among other things, make it possible to mitigate one of Optimistic Rollups’ biggest drawbacks, that of the 7 day lockup period required to withdraw from L2. Basically this bridge will allow a loan in DAI to be created to cover the withdrawal immediately. This is pretty huge - have added to the roadmap for Q3.

~ Uniswap’s Hayden Adams has been engaging in a [reasonable amount of bantz on the socials](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1367335215128080384) with regards the hopefully impending Uniswap v3 (to maybe or maybe not include Optimistic Rollups) which should give us confidence, right? Let’s keep it in Q1 for now.

~ Argent this week [posted a great deal of detail](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/layer-2-plans/) around their plans to scale their wallet to L2 using zk rollups. I’d previously had this in the timeline for Q3, and will keep it there, but my read from the post is that this could be even sooner.

~ Immutable X, a L2 scaling solution for NFTs, is [imminently going to start rollout](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/04/immutable-x-gu-rollout/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=4mar21&amp;utm_campaign=immutable-x&amp;utm_content=imtblx-gu&amp;utm_adID=&amp;refcode=) for Gods Unchained. Looking forward to being able to trade and cheap minting.

~ Synthetix this week added an [improvement proposal](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-117) for L2 synth swaps (ie, the beating heart of the app) on Optimism. I’m adding this to the roadmap to coincide with Synthetix v3 previously announced as roughly Q2.

~ Hermez, a layer 2 solution that has previously announced they are working with Tether, has [released their public testnet](https://blog.hermez.io/hermez-testnet-is-now-public/). This isn’t on the roadmap below, but will put it on if/when Tether scaling is announced.

~ And finally, Rocketpool… clearly now in full FOMO mode, there’s also [juicy gossip](https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405164275036848128/814022039266000897) that other as-yet-publicly-named-teams are integrating with Rocketpool. Audits are still ongoing. The final beta has just been [announced to start next week](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-3-0-beta-finale-fb35c4f8e003). As such, this would indicate early/mid-April for live launch.

Liberosist,"MakerDAO has $7.5B AUM, 2.75B DAI in cicrulation, yet market cap of under $2B. Current revenues from stability fees are 102M DAI per annum and growing exponentially at the rate of \~5% per week. Once the surplus buffer is full (Q2) this is a buyback of 5% MKR's market cap \*and\* burn for -5% inflation per annum. This makes MKR significantly more undervalued than a mature S&amp;P 500 stock like Apple or Visa, despite also experiencing exponential growth. 

Why is MKR not in the top 5, instead languishing in the 50s? What am I missing? We all know the market is dumb as bricks, but surely, there's a limit to madness?",2021-03-14 23:24:43

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;SingularityNET are said to be considering it

It is incorrect to say that SingularityNET is ""considering"" switching to Cardano.  They are 100% committed to moving virtually all of their efforts to Cardano.  They will not be leaving their presence on Ethereum totally, they will allow people to choose where to have their AGI and their vision is multi-chain, although they expect virtually all AGI token holders to migrate to Cardano AGI platform willfully.  SingulartyNET is all but moving away from Ethereum and dedicating nearly 100% of their efforts to building out and deeply integrating with Cardano Blockchain.  Goertzel goes into why in this video.  A lot of it has to do with Haskell and with how Cardano blockchain is structured:

[https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=172](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=172)

&gt;SingularityNET's Founder on Cardano: [https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=320](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=320) the first infrastructure with the potential to be capable of supporting large-scale decentralized AI systems Ethereum launched something, but it doesn't have the sophistication or scalability of design to support \[the world computer\] vision Cardano with the Plutus smart contracts being released is a much more credible infrastructure for a world computer... a secure privacy preserving democratically governed world computer  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=2856](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=2856) if you have a private chain e.g. if a bank wants to so some blockchain stuff internally, but they also want to interoperate with a public network, then you can have elegant isomorphisims between a Private Cardano network and a Public Cardano Network if you're trying to do that with Ethereum or EOS or something, the mapping of private to public is more awkward and requires more work  
&gt;  
&gt;Haskell language has the ability to set up mathematical mappings between smart contracts in an automatic way A Cardano Haskell program is its own mathematical formalization vs. An Ethereum Solidity program is not (in a useful sense) its own mathematical description. A Haskell program is closer to being its own mathematical description if you need to map between a contract in a private subchain, and a smart contract on a public subchain - those contracts are very close to knowing how to describe themselves to each other, so you can just map between the two in a formal way it's quite elegant you can't build those isomorphisms (structure-preserving mappings) between two Solidity contracts in any practical way isomorphisms = a mathematical term for a structure preserving mapping you can map one contract into another in a way that preserves all the key properties In Cardano's Plutus: you can set up these mappings automatically between smart contracts In Solidity or WebAssembly: you cannot do this CONTRAST WITH WHAT CONSENSYS IS TRYING TO DO WITH ETHEREUM CONTRAST WITH WHAT JP MORGAN WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BLOCKCHAIN all those things are going to be much nicer with Plutus Financial Services Industry will see that because they're always early-adopters of technology They're also early adopters of AI technology You're going to see a big payoff for Cardano and SingularityNET: as DeFI Mainstreams as DeFI Merges with Traditional Finance then you have large traditional finance organizations that want blockchain inside and they're going to be increasingly dealing with public blockchain markets and they're going to want nice interoperation between them and they're used to software that is less crappy than Ethereum or WebAssembly their software frameworks are not as good as Cardano, but they're better than other blockchains so they don't want to take a step backwards but they will take a step forwards  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=3100](https://youtu.be/f8JVh1S774k?t=3100) This could be what turns Cardano into a 100 billion dollar market cap Cardano is going to become the engine of DeFI Then being the engine of DeFI... when DeFI merges with traditional finance... Then as AI gradually takes over Finance, and Singularity NET is jumping in there Within a few years you can have 10's of trillions of dollars of financial transactions being coordinated by: machine learning algorithms running on a combination of public and private Cardano blockchain if you look at the logic of it, it's something that almost has to happen

&gt;Celsius? Or are they staying with Ethereum?

jconn93,"You should definitely still be (and stay) skeptical - especially of any new protocols/chains. 

For DeFi in particular, unless you develop expert-level understanding of a particular protocol/product - the best thing to do is use basic heuristics like ""how long has this protocol existed and been securing large sums without anyone getting scammed or the protocol breaking?"". Great examples of ones that have long track records are Compound finance, MakerDAO, Uniswap. Over time, I think the reputations of protocols will sort of naturally evolve to the point that some will be kind of ""blue chip"" that everyday people are familiar and comfortable with. Until then, it's a bit wild west.

Pretty much the whole space is in an ""advanced beta"" release right now and maybe 2-3 months away from being scalable and ready for the mainstream. Ethereum (where almost all NFT live) is rolling out some amazing scaling solutions that have been in the works for years - until that happens NFT trading comes with high fees. Low-value use cases are critical for things like what you describe as ""low-art"", videogame assets etc. Things like the ""ImmutableX"" zkrollup are going to make this possible and completely change the game especially for users who aren't rich art collectors.

You should be **extremely** skeptical of new chains. Right now Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only game in town for things that are truly decentralized, have a long track record and have actual user adoption. There are up and coming competitors to Ethereum (and maybe they'll outcompete and win in the end), but right now these are on a spectrum from ""scam"" to ""awesome computer science project"".

Liberosist,"March 2021: The Scalability Race heats up. Utterly bananas how rapidly this space is evolving. Just shows innovation can go into overdrive faster than anyone can imagine when the need is dire. 

1st March: Optimism is coming this month! They have won this race!

A week later: Uh, oh, rumblings of a delay. But generalized ZK Rollups are years away, so no worries, Optimism will still win. 

9th March: Matter Labs says generalized zkSync will become said generalized ZK Rollup ""faster than many think"".

10th March: MakerDAO announces Optimism Dai bridge with fast withdrawals. 

16th March: Aztec launches, bringing scalability and privacy to ZK rollups. 

22nd March: StarkWare announces ImmutableX now does \~9,600 TPS and public launch is imminent. Likewise with dYdX. 

23rd March: Uniswap announces they will be on Optimism. 

24th March: StarkWare raises a cool $75 million, three times more than Optimism, presumably to accelerate development of StarkNet, their generalized ZK rollup. Looks like generalized ZK Rollups might just land in 2021, after all. 

25th March: Arbitrum announces they have a release candidate with BLS signature aggregation, commits to a fully public launch. Incidentally, Vitalik was in Optimism discord pushing them to support BLS just a day earlier. 

A few hours later: Optimism confirms the delay, public launch delayed tentatively to July, though whitelisted projects like Uniswap and Synthetix come earlier. 

27th March: Matter Labs drops the mic, generalized rollup zkSync 2.0 is done, public testnet in May 2021, public mainnet July 2021 if all goes well. Might I remind you as early as June 2020 everyone (including Vitalik) thought a generalized ZK Rollup was years away.

Coldsnap,"Right fam, this is the weekly ‘big things upcoming in the ETHosphere’ timeline update. 

For those not familiar we update first on developments this week that have impacted the timeline, then re-state the timeline itself. Post is getting pretty long these days, am *this close* to the reddit charlimit - may need to find a less ephemeral home for it soon, but don’t worry - r/ethfinance always in my &lt;3.

Lots to get into this week, starting with scaling updates:

—

~ Optimism, fresh off having to roll back their ill-fated ‘we’re unilaterally bringing forward our launch date’ announcement due to not first consulting their launch partners about said announcement(!), this week [announced a mainnet launch **delay** to July](https://optimismpbc.medium.com/optimistically-cautious-767a898f90c8)(!!) 2021. You could *feeeel* the collective disappointment in the ETHosphere. Optimism have since returned to their ‘public testnet first’ approach, which should happen towards the end of April, followed by a July mainnet launch. We’ll have to wait until then for that sweet sweet 1000+ TPS. Inb4 disparaging optimism puns said merely-in-jest but not really :/

It’s not all bad, however, as Optimism are still running what they are describing as a closed mainnet whitelist. That is to say that if partners are genuinely ready to launch prior to July, then they can still go live. Optimism are signalling that approx. a dozen projects are pursuing this approach including SNX (already live!), vital tooling-type projects eg oracles, multisig, and token bridges, and…

~ Uniswap hype levels increased this week as they dropped a [fun teaser trailer](https://twitter.com/naturalkapital/status/1374070444039475205) and shortly thereafter [announced their long-awaited plans for Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/). This is planned to launch 5th May. Note that v3 is initially without L2 scaling via Optimism, but as above, rollups implementation should be ‘following shortly’ in mid-May, [possibly 12th May according to this source](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1374408266118090753) as Uni is one of the whitelisted projects. Uniswap has indicated that there is a significant challenge to create a front end experience that avoids confusion for users when presented with both L1 and L2 DEX options… godspeed UNI UX gurus!

~ Worth mentioning that Synthetix, already live with Phase 0 of their transition to Optimism, confirmed this week that their roadmap towards full L2 remains unchanged, taskwise, but is [taking slightly longer than expected.](https://blog.synthetix.io/oks-update/)

~ One wonders if all of this opens the door to Optimism’s competitors? It’s likely no coincidence that rival rollup solutions, Offchain Labs’ Arbitrum and Matter Labs’ zkSync have both dropped big roadmap updates in the past few days.

Arbitrum [launched their optimistic rollups v4 testnet (their mainnet release candidate) this week](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-updates-buckle-up-80483d71718c). No details yet on how long v4 will run for but I’m guessing mainnet in April until someone tells me otherwise.

Similarly, zk rollups solution zkSync are offering trading of fungible tokens on L2 in April, followed by NFT minting and transfer in May, all on their current 1.x platform. In addition, their all-singing, all-dancing 20k+ TPS zkSync 2.0 platform is planned for public testnet in May, ahead of mainnet launch in August.

~ Last week I *rudely*, incorrectly, predicted that long-awaited NFT scaling solution Immutable X would not launch this week. Very happy to have been proven wrong as it has *kind of* launched, I guess? [It’s now possible to link your wallet](https://blog.godsunchained.com/wallet-linking-immutable-x/) to IMX on Gods Unchained. What are you waiting for? I’ll keep it on the timeline as [the next stages](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/04/immutable-x-gu-rollout/) roll out - Marketplace is next. 

~ And finally, the upcoming Eth1 and Eth2 upgrades - Berlin (April), Altair (June), and London (July) - are all still on track. Solid updates from [Tim](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2FH1US36qzO) and [Danny](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/24/finalized-no-24/) in addition to the [Eth2 dev call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0EbnFViJFk) this week. Big ticket item for next week will be discussions on the scope of the Shanghai upgrade… to merge or not to merge? It’s worth pointing out that merge proof of concept transactions are [already happening.](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1374979655782989824)

Then highlight to them the following, as all are scaling solutions that should help. Either by 1) reliving general congestion which opens up the network as a whole or 2) VISA implementing a specific rollup solution for benefit to themsevles. If that doesn't work (or they are too lazy to even skim a bulletpoint list and click a few links) then those fools are without hope and just ignore them. And yes, this is serious advice.

lukemulks,"Hi all, I work at Brave on Brave Ads, contributed to the BAT White Paper, have been a long time member of the team, and wanted to clarify a few of the points in the original post.   


&gt;*Brave’s Ad Network comes with a pretty steep budget that is only targeted at parties who can spend a minimum 15-20k.*

* The minimum spend requirement in our Media Kit, available on our website, is $10K/mo. [https://brave.com/brave-ads/resources/](https://brave.com/brave-ads/resources/)

&gt; *The agency I’m referencing was promoting two crypto products and one privacy related software on Brave. Seems like a pretty solid fit for the Brave community. Their CTR on Brave was around 15% out performing all products including YouTube Ad rolls. Amazing right? Well not when you look at engagement and conversion where Brave actually performed lower than any of the other products. In my neck of the woods this is usually identified as some sort of fraud. So what happened?* 

* The CTR stat included in our materials is 9%, and is a platform average, rounded down. 
* Brave has not released a 15% CTR or higher stat since July of 2019.  https://twitter.com/lukemulks/status/1191380440784887808?s=20 
* Brave released a 14% CTR in Oct 2019, and we've been updating the CTR in our materials quarterly as the platform averages reach more of a steady state as we scale over time. 
* Regarding clickthrough conversion stats: these vary, and simply being a crypto company does not guarantee that you'll have higher conversion rates than a company in another vertical. From our research, \~60% of Brave Ads users are actively using crypto, which often leads to higher scrutiny for crypto advertisers. There are a lot of factors at play with click/view through conversion rates that the platform cannot control (landing page copy, presentation, additional friction in funnel, etc.). There are some crypto products that outperform products in other verticals, including crypto. Others don't. Our audience is growing with Brave.  The key for brands is to test and determine if their products are a good fit with our audience, until we reach a larger scale where the vast majority of verticals have representative cohorts within the platform.   


&gt;*So what explains the extremely high CTR? Well... by opting-in you have the opportunity to earn Cryptocurrency up to a certain cap in USD ($20-30). Many users are under the impression that they will earn more if they click on more ads (They don’t), and this is the cause for really terrible analytics.* 

* The product mentions that rewards are from viewing the ads, not from clicking them. 
* Some users are likely to read past that, but if the problem were as mentioned our CTRs would not be steadying downward, vs the other way around as we scale (Brave 2x'd our user base from Jan 2020 - Jan 2021). 
* We also have users that are opting-in to ads, and while introduced in 2019, the ad model is likely new to a lot of people. 
* Push notification units historically have high engagement rates.   
[https://andrewchen.com/new-data-on-push-notification-ctrs-shows-the-best-apps-perform-4x-better-than-the-worst-heres-why-guest-post/](https://andrewchen.com/new-data-on-push-notification-ctrs-shows-the-best-apps-perform-4x-better-than-the-worst-heres-why-guest-post/)   
[https://www.airship.com/blog/7-mobile-engagement-statistics-that-show-how-push-notifications-boost-roi/](https://www.airship.com/blog/7-mobile-engagement-statistics-that-show-how-push-notifications-boost-roi/)  
*The mobile Ad Fraud is top of the line, desktop could certainly use some work, but overall the platform just doesn’t convert and gives extremely dishonest CTR that’s even being praised in publications. This agency however did buy quite a few of their tokens, not because they want to run anymore campaigns, but to simply dump later because Brave is growing through the roof.*   

* Do you have any links to \*extremely dishonest CTR that's even being praised in publications\*? As stated, our platform wide CTR is 9%. 
* Which agency are you referring to, and where is the evidence to substantiate a claim that they bought a few tokens to dump them later? This appears to be speculation, at best.   


What we're doing at Brave is disruptive to the market - it was when I left my role in Ad Ops / Products to join Brave in 2016, before GDPR was implemented. Brave has always pushed for an advertising and publisher model that operates with privacy by default, and delivers revenue to publishers, advertisers and users. 

Brave has, (always has) and will continue to block 3rd party ad calls and tracking requests. Brave does this, as a privacy product. Brave introduced Brave Ads, which introduces local ad matching on-device (in-browser), and anonymous but accountable event reporting protocols for. The reality is that Brave has had a strong interest in delivering an advertising model that complies with privacy by default, and has brought value to market by introducing that technology (several of the w3c discussions and proposals have referenced our work, and Brave is active in the w3c discussions involving privacy and advertising). 

This is not an effort like others in market that involves whitelisting advertisers for publishers that pay for the privilege. 

The funnel metrics have expanded and evolved over time based on feedback from customers and progress with the technology. Funnel in our media kit linked above, and has evolved to include view/clickthrough conversion reporting, and soon, introduction of the ability to have verifiable order IDs in addition to conversion events. 

Brave created a publisher/creator contribution model (enabled by default when users opt-in to Brave Ads) in advance of introducing Brave Ads, with a verified publisher/creator cohort accepting BAT that has grown to over 1M ([https://brave.com/transparency](https://brave.com/transparency)). We've had an interest, going back to 2016, of introducing a new model that disintermediates, and provides value to users, publishers and advertisers. Ads were still on the roadmap, even in early 2016.

There's no doubt going to be skepticism around our model. There was when we announced what we aimed to do in 2016. There was when we introduced our BAT white paper on ([https://basicattentiontoken.org](https://basicattentiontoken.org)) in 2017, and when we initially brought Brave Ads to market in April 2019. If people weren't skeptical, that would be strange. Disrupting the market is going to be controversial, especially one as large as digital advertising and the attention economy. Our best effort to address skepticism has been to release products that are open source, be open and engaged with the community and our users, and engineer the product to perform and compete in market.   


Just like any other platform, success will vary based on the brand and interest from our growing user base. As our user base has grown from 12M monthly active users (Jan 2020) to 25.4M monthly actives (current) to 50M monthly actives (target for end of 2021), conversion performance is likely to improve across more products and verticals, as they have over time. Brave has performed extremely well for a lot of advertisers, with our renewals being strong month over month. Like most cases, the best way to measure success for any particular brand is to test, learn and iterate.   


Anyway, I hope that this info/context is helpful. We've been delivering an alternative to market. We will continue to deliver alternatives not only with Ads and browsing, but into search and other offerings as well. The crypto space also has evolved from the ""blockchain all the things"" in 2016-18 to actual utility and use with attention, decentralized finance and for other use cases. Our approach is intended to adapt and evolve with the market; BAT began being used in decentralized finance in early 2020 when MakerDAO, Compound Finance, CoinList and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com). That happened organically in secondary markets, and we aim to support those use cases in our roadmap.

Maker was on the Skale ecosystem post ... but aside from that post, I've seen 0 connection between Skale and MakerDAO. Skale has been online for months but I've yet to hear of a single project integrating with it.",2021-03-30 06:12:41
nikola_j,"MakerDAO raised the minimum CDP size a few times over the past months - at the moment you can't create one if you're minting less than 5,000 Dai at that point. Once you have one that has over 5,000 Dai debt, though, you can mint 1 Dai if you'd like, but 5k is the minimum (`dust` parameter as it's called in the Maker protocol).

Creating a Maker CDP (which includes creating the actual CDP, depositing initial collateral and minting Dai) uses about 550k gas (random [example tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xce32124cb8f41b93197bc0fd1773bc421b6926dc6903990bf37c797ca717a01f)).

Creating an instantly leveraged CDP using DeFi Saver uses about 1,2m gas (random [example tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6e18ef8d050f794515de10d5e8070adbf0528f76d9e610033b8deaa25d0f2713)).

Depending on current gas prices, the price in ETH and consequently USD will vary a lot. At 120 Gwei, which seems to be enough for fast right now, that would be 0.066 ETH ($118) and 0.144 ETH ($260) respectively.

Hope that helps :)",2021-03-30 06:18:29
nikola_j,"True, and that's why we already have Reflexer / RAI integrated at DeFi Saver :)

And, additionally, I know that the MakerDAO vision was always that of a multi-collateral protocol, so all is well. Just sorry to see SCD disregarded like that, since we've all loved and used and built on it for so long.

The multi-collateralness definitely gives Dai greater growing power, though, no doubt about it.",2021-03-30 07:52:40

However defi is still imo on experimental stages. The biggest risk imo (as on secondary lending platforms) is the risk of liquidation therefore I always keep a healthy collaterization ratio. I don’t know if this is the latest but you can see here some of the audits https://github.com/makerdao/audits",2021-03-30 13:07:17
tim13467,"Yikes, this is terrifying for investors! Asset backed tokens are tough ones. PAXG's proposal has passed to be used as collateral for MAKERDAO but was paused only for ""[technical issues.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/lhqnpw/paxg_collateral/)"" 

Something is up",2021-03-30 22:17:45

TLDR: PAXG is shady as hell and may soon end up in MakerDAO. Every token in the supply of Paxos Gold $PAXG should be backed by 1 troy ounce of gold and only minted when purchased. This is verified by a Chainlink data oracle.

Chainlink reports 60,161.14 ounces of gold 

PAXG have minted 85,681.469 ounces of gold

Over $43,000,000 in difference. 

Using the PAXG gold allocation tool, the largest address shows zero gold allocated.

Their monthly reports make no sense.
