aqqlebottom,"When it comes to its trading structures, Uniswap relies on global liquidity pools and an automated liquidity protocol to facilitate the creation of distinct markets for each different asset combination. UniSwap is sometimes referred to as a decentralized exchange that enables automatic trading and the use of decentralized financial currencies, among other things. Hayden Adams, a software developer, developed it and released it on the Ethereum Network as an ERC-20 token in November 2018. It is now available for purchase on the Ethereum Marketplace.

Cons: 

•	Because Uniswap is non-custodial, it is just as secure as the Ethereum blockchain itself because the protocol does not hold any financial information. Several audits of the Uniswap smart contracts have been conducted, including audits by the same teams who verified the MakerDAO smart contracts.

•	To create liquidity for the new pool, ERC20 tokens and ETH need to be paired together. This means that you will get new tickets for trading far more quickly than you would with any other method now available.

•	The Uniswap exchange rate is dependent on arbitrage trading to keep it constant means that there will always be a need for other forms of exchange to keep it balanced.

•	Because of the greater risk associated with ERC20 to ERC20 token trades, higher gas prices are required. As Ethereum increases in scale (ETH2.0 sharding/Casper implementation is currently underway), gas prices will eventually become insignificant.

•	Unified Swap is still in the early stages of development; even their documentation has not been finalized. As the exchange's popularity increases, the true benefits, and disadvantages of using it will become more apparent.

•	The UNI decentralized exchange (DEX) token was created to be completely independent of other cryptocurrencies as a whole. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.

•	The UNI token has no associated fees. Thus there are no charges connected with utilizing the protocol.

•	A consequence of the open-source nature of Uniswap similar DEXs (such as SushiSwap and PancakeSwap) is that they are vulnerable to imitation and duplication, which leads to a reduction in their market share.

•	The risk of momentary loss when traders supply liquidity to Uniswap may deter some traders from utilizing the platform.

•	Cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Thorchain and Gravity DEX (Cosmos) may attract more traders in the future who are looking to trade across blockchains than Uniswap, which only trades in Ethereum ERC-20 tokens.

•	In contrast to trading on centralized exchanges, when you trade on Uniswap, you retain ownership over your private keys. While you are the custodian of your tokens, liquidity pools will trade directly with you while you are not. Due to the sole usage of smart contracts by Uniswap, the Ethereum network has incurred very high expenses. A smart contract is added on top of the transaction, which means that it does not occur directly between two users from a technical perspective. Consequently, users will be forced to pay fees twice when submitting tokens to the contract and again when sending tokens to the second recipient. When the market is volatile, both the number of transactions in the network and the cost of transactions in the network both rise as a result. If you sell your assets after they've started to decline in the liquidity pool, you'll incur much larger losses than if you keep them.

•	It is used by many fraudulent projects to promote their worthless tokens under tickers that seem to be legitimate currencies to trick consumers into buying their trash.

•	It seems doubtful that Uniswap will be legalized in the near future because it does not operate with fiat currency. The consequence is that those involved in projects and individuals functioning legally should take care while using any associated technology.

•	If Uniswap supports more chains, there is no indication in the project's strategy that this will be the case. At the same time, according to blocktivity.info, Ethereum transactions account for just 2.7 percent of all blockchain transactions in the United States.",2021-10-01 04:51:42

# USDC - the better Tether

USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin that is pegged to the price of the US dollar - so 1 USDC = $1. [It operates like this:](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/USD_Coin)

1. A user sends US dollars to the coin issuer's bank account.
2. The issuer uses a USD Coin smart contract to create the equivalent amount of USD Coin.
3. The newly minted USD Coins are sent to the user and the substituted US dollars are held in a reserve.

It was launched on September 26, 2018, in collaboration between Circle and Coinbase, and is an alternative to other USD backed cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) or TrueUSD (TUSD). [Bringing US dollars on the blockchain allows moving them anywhere in the world within minutes, and brings much-needed stability to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it opens up new opportunities for trading, lending, risk-hedging and more.](https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/)

Being the second largest stablecoin, it undoubtedly has some inherent advantages - especially against its main competitor, Tether (USDC). These include:

&amp;#x200B;

# Very reliable leadership team &amp; founders

* USD Coin is [developed by the Centre Consortium](https://www.centre.io/usdc), a partnership between Circle and Coinbase. The technology and governing framework are developed by Centre, while Circle and Coinbase were the first commercial issuers of USDC.
   * Circle is an [official Money Transmitter](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/us-licenses), which makes the company an open financial book, connoting that all USDC tokens are regulated, transparent and verifiable.
   * Additionally, Circle is one of the only crypto companies [backed by Goldman Sachs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-backed-circle-goes-live-with-currency-linked-stablecoin-and-anyone-can-issue-it-2018-09-26), a renowned investment bank.
   * Coinbase, the other 'half' of the Consortium, is the world's second biggest crypto exchange with billions of dollars in daily volume, so it is highly unlikely that they will perpetrate a stablecoin scam.
   * Moreover, Coinbase stock is already on the market while [Circle plans to go public via a SPAC](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/) \- which incentivizes them to keep running the USDC project lest their stock prices plummet.
* Meanwhile, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the world, has only 13 employees and is the [most valuable company on a per-employee basis in the entire world](https://cryptowhale.medium.com/the-tether-scandal-the-biggest-threat-to-the-crypto-ecosystem-23a169003205).
   * This is similar to the Madoff Ponzi scheme of the early 2000s, in which he robbed $65 billion of investors' money.
* Thus, USDC is the largest trustworthy stablecoin in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reserves are safe and are audited every month

* A top 5 accounting firm, Grant Thornton, releases audits of Circle's reserves every month. Its [August report](https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/2021%20Circle%20Examination%20Report%20August%202021%20Final.pdf?hsLang=en) revealed that:
   * There were no discrepancies in the market cap of USDC and the value of Circle's reserves.
   * The reserves themselves consisted of 92% cash &amp; cash equivalents, 1% corporate bonds, 5% USD denominated Certificates of Deposits, and 2% commercial paper.
* [In a crisis, there’s a strong chance that Circle would be able to meet significant USDC redemptions, if not instantly, then within a short timeframe. Putting it another way, if regulators bring in rules about the quality of assets that need to back stablecoins, it’s likely that USDC assets would easily comply.](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/circle-publishes-details-of-usdc-stablecoin-asset-backing/) And that can’t be said for Tether by a wide margin.
* The degree of transparency and quality of Circle's assets is significantly superior compared to USDT, where the asset backing raised concerns at the [Boston Federal Reserve](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2021/official-monetary-and-financial-institutions-forum-fed-week-financial-stability-session.aspx) and [Fitch](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/fitch-flags-stablecoin-risks-to-short-term-credit-markets/).

&amp;#x200B;

# Plenty of native uses as opposed to USDT

* Coinbase offers [no fees when spending USDC](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/) using the well-known Coinbase Card.
   * This incentivizes Coinbase users to utilise USDC to spend, rather than other cryptocurrencies.
* [VISA recently became the first major payments to allow the settlement of transactions in USDC.](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17821.html)
   * While this doesn't benefit consumers as of now, it allows crypto-holding companies such as [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and Tesla to natively transact USDC on VISA, eliminating the need to convert their crypto to fiat.
* Compare this to Tether, whose only 'partner company', Bitfinex, is actually the entity that controls USDT itself.

&amp;#x200B;

# Available on a variety of blockchains

* [USDC is powered by an ERC-20 smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and is also supported on other blockchains (Algorand, Solana, Tron, Stellar).](https://swissborg.com/blog/usdc-vs-usdt) It is an open-source project, which makes it a transparent and verifiable stablecoin on the blockchain.
* In addition, in the next few months [Circle is planning to add USDC to 9 more blockchains](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains/), including Avalanche, Celo, Flow, Hedera, Kava, Nervos, Polkadot, Stacks, and Tezos.
   * This will put it significantly ahead of USDT, which only supports 7 blockchains as of now.
* Each network has its own perks and flaws, all of which comprehensively make USDC more useful than it ever was.

&amp;#x200B;

# Can be staked for yields

* [By staking USDC, you can earn](https://www.blockfer.com/earn-interest/stablecoin-interest-calculator/):
   * 8.6% APY on BlockFi
   * 8% APY on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)
   * 11.55% on Celsius Network
   * Native earnings if you hold it on Coinbase
   * ... and many more options
* On another note, you can also utilise USDC to mitigate liquidity risk by using it as collateral for DAI in MakerDAO.
* However, nearly all stablecoins can be staked for yields, some more than others.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, USDC is undoubtedly a better stablecoin than Tether, and its multitude of uses justifies its $30 billion marketcap.",2021-10-02 04:57:50

Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund and Grayscale® DeFi Fund Announce Quarterly Rebalancing of Funds  
Smart contract platform Solana and decentralized exchange Uniswap have been added to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund  
October 01, 2021 17:57 ET | Source: Grayscale Investments  
  
...  
New York, Oct. 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments®, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, and manager of both Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund (OTCQX: GDLC) (the Digital Large Cap Fund) and Grayscale® DeFi Fund (the DeFi Fund), today announced the updated Fund Component weightings for each product in connection with their respective quarterly reviews.   
  
In accordance with the Digital Large Cap Fund’s construction criteria, Grayscale has adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings and using the cash proceeds to purchase Solana (SOL) and Uniswap (UNI). This announcement follows the July 2021 news that Grayscale adjusted the Digital Large Cap Fund’s portfolio and purchased Cardano (ADA), and is the first time Solana (SOL) will be included in a Grayscale investment vehicle.   
  
Solana  
  
SOL is the native token of the Solana network, a smart contract platform first conceived by Anatoly Yakovenko in a 2017 whitepaper. Like the Ethereum network, the Solana network is one of a number of projects intended to expand blockchain use beyond just a peer-to-peer money system. The Solana protocol introduced the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism as an alternative to pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Ethereum. PoH is intended to provide a transaction processing speed and capacity advantage over traditional PoW and PoS networks, which rely on sequential production of blocks and can lead to delays caused by validator confirmations.   
  
Uniswap  
  
UNI is the native token of the Uniswap network, a decentralized exchange originally conceived in 2016 by Vitalek Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, and later developed in 2018 by Hayden Adams and Uniswap Labs. Uniswap enables trading of digital assets without a central order book by aggregating digital asset trading pairs using smart contracts. On Uniswap, users exchange digital assets with one another by paying a transaction fee to independent market makers called liquidity providers. Holders of UNI have the ability to propose and vote on improvement proposals to adjust features of the Uniswap network.   
  
At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the Digital Large Cap Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Bitcoin (BTC), 62.19%  
Ethereum (ETH), 26.08%  
Cardano (ADA), 5.11%  
Solana (SOL), 3.24%  
Uniswap (UNI), 1.06%  
Chainlink (LINK), 0.82%  
Litecoin (LTC), 0.77%  
Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 0.73%  
No new tokens were added or removed from the DeFi Fund. At the end of the day on October 1, 2021, the DeFi Fund’s Fund Components were a basket of the following assets and weightings.  
  
Uniswap (UNI), 45.20%  
Aave (AAVE), 14.11%  
MakerDAO (MKR), 7.84%  
SushiSwap (SUSHI), 7.18%  
Compound (COMP), 6.73%  
Synthetix (SNX), 6.29%  
Yearn Finance (YFI), 3.92%  
Curve (CRV), 3.53%  
Bancor Network Token (BNT), 3.04%  
UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.16%  
Neither the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund nor the Grayscale DeFi Fund generate any income, and both regularly distribute Fund Components to pay for ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of Fund Components represented by shares of each fund gradually decreases over time.

This press release is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be illegal, nor shall there be any sale of any security in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.  
  
About Grayscale® Digital Large Cap Fund  
Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund enables investors to gain exposure to a market-cap weighted portfolio of large-cap digital currencies through a singular investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly. Through a rules-based portfolio construction methodology derived from the CoinDesk Large Cap Index, the Digital Large Cap Fund targets coverage of the upper 70% of the digital currency market and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\*  Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at: https://tradeblock.com/markets/dlcx.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund's investment objective is for its Shares to reflect the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less its expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Digital Large Cap Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Fund Components held by the Digital Large Cap Fund, less the Digital Large Cap Fund's expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, with variations that have at time been substantial.  
  
The Digital Large Cap Fund is an investment vehicle with Shares titled in the investor’s name, providing a familiar structure for financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries under estate laws. Additionally, Shares are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts.  
  
About Grayscale® DeFi Fund  
Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund holds digital assets that make up the CoinDesk DeFi Index. These digital assets are drawn from the universe of investable digital assets native to decentralized finance or DeFi. The Index methodology includes liquid DeFi assets on a market cap-weighted basis and is re-evaluated each quarter; however, the weightings of each Fund Component change daily and are published around 4:00 p.m. NY-time.\* Additional information on the Index methodology can be found at https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/.  
  
Grayscale intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market. However, there is no guarantee this will be successful. Although the shares of certain products have been approved for trading on a secondary market, investors in this new product should not assume that the shares will ever obtain such an approval due to a variety of factors, including questions regulators such as the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory bodies may have regarding the product. As a result, shareholders of this product should be prepared to bear the risk of investment in the shares indefinitely.  
  
 \*The compositions of the Digital Large Cap Fund and the DeFi Fund are evaluated on a quarterly basis to remove existing Fund Components or to include new Fund Components in their portfolios, in accordance with the Construction Criteria established by Grayscale or the Index Provider, as applicable.  
  
About Grayscale Investments®    
Founded in 2013, Grayscale Investments is the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, with more than $41.5B in assets under management as of October 1, 2021. Through its family of investment products, Grayscale provides access and exposure to the digital currency asset class in the form of a security without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly.

I_LOVE_MOM,"Existential question about dApps: 

Every change to the code of a defi protocol has a nonzero chance of causing a serious bug that results in loss of funds. Whether this is a 2% chance or a 0.00002% chance is up for debate, but there is a chance. 

Does that mean, given enough time and protocol upgrades, that every major upgradable dApp is destined to suffer a similar or worse fate than Compound? After all it only took until proposal 62 for an upgrade to cause major damage on compound. Do you really think we can get to thousands of merged proposals on MakerDAO and not have a single loss of funds?

After all, it may only take one major bug to kill a dApp.",2021-10-02 15:18:33

But code isn't law. It's *mostly* law in crypto and DeFi, because for the most part, code does what it's intended to do and when it doesn't, governments usually can't do much about it. But sometimes the chain isn't decentralized in some way, which allows the a ""legal under the law of code"" action to be reversed or mitigated. For example, in an extreme case, hack victims had enough clout to execute a 51% attack on their own chain (see [the DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao)).

If a hacker who has executed a flash loan attack is caught by agents of a government, then effectively, *law* is law. But it may be that when that happens, the law will just decide that code is law, or they may decide that code has to be written in such a way as to conform to certain laws.

Ive been thinking about Societe Generale (French bank). They applied for a 20M loan on makerDAO using their OFH bond token as collateral. Thru this theyll get 20M worth of DAI which they in return can play around.

esoetheric,"One of the reasons why I'm not a fan of on-chain governance is that token holders vote instinctively, without understanding the consequences of what they're voting for and they are easily manipulated by a good rhetoric.

I think everyone interested in DAOs governance should look at what is still happening to MakerDAO: from USDC being used as a collateral, to the proposal of accepting Société Générale bonds, to the recent proposal of becoming [""Clean Money""](https://twitter.com/tbr90/status/1445406224883896328?t=eM6v1UBgr6qTJIL7I0PmbA&amp;s=19).

How will DAI look like in the future?

LongForWisdom,"For what it's worth, from the introduction of MCD, MakerDAO was never intended to have solely decentralized (as in trustless crypto) collateral. The plan from that point was to have as much diversification in the portfolio as possible, including crypto-assets and real-world assets across as many different jurisdictions and entities as possible.

For me (and I think most at Maker) when we refer to DAI being decentralized we refer to.

* Lack of centralized control over the token DAI itself - not upgradable, not blacklistable.
* The idea that the collateral portfolio should not be controllable by any one entity or jurisdiction (but *not* that it should be entirely backed by trustless assets, which is generally agreed to not be scalable enough to allow us to produce the amounts of DAI that we'll need to if it is successful.)

Naturally the amount of USDC and dollar-backed stablecoins in the protocol stretches this significantly, and does represent an existential risk. Hence the multiple initiatives to reduce that reliance.

*However,* the introduction of stuff like other RWA collateral, Société Générale bonds, and the other types of collateral proposed in Rune's latest post is consistent with the idea of a token that is not exposed to existential risk from any one jurisdiction or entity - a decentralized DAI.

Regarding governance itself, there are definitely a number of downsides of on-chain voting, and it's fair to say that voters do not always understand the consequences of their actions.

The positive side is that bad decisions can directly result in financial pain for those that made the decisions. (IE screw up - mint MKR - devalue MKR token.) Which at the very least is preferable to many legacy systems where the negative outcomes of screwed-up decision-making do not land at the feet of those who most deserve it.",2021-10-07 01:15:59

ETH-A is the classic Maker CDP that can work for either way, while ETH-B is there for people who want to maximize their liquidity usage or leverage level (usually these people ride it quite close to the edge, with constant monitoring or some form of automation on it), while ETH-C is really best for long term borrowings where you would be making a highly collateralized position in any case.

Quick comparison of current stats for anyone out of the loop:

* ETH-A: 145% min c-ratio; 2.5% Stability fee
* ETH-B: 130% min c-ratio; 5% Stability fee
* ETH-C: 175% min c-ratio; 0.5% Stability fee

Here's where ETH-B shines:

* ETH-A starting with 5 ETH and \~2x leverage gives a liq. price of \~$2.600.

nikola_j,"&gt;What's the point of all this?

Safety and convenience. You want to keep max Dai available for minting somewhat limited, so in case someone finds an exploit for minting free Dai they couldn't abuse it too much. But you also want there to be sufficient Dai available for minting so we don't stall with minting like it used to happen before. And so nowadays each \`ilk\` (collateral type) has it's own ""hard"" and ""soft"" ceiling, as well as that gap to which the protocol adjusts each x hours.

This whole mechanism is called ""Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module"" and it was first suggested [over a year ago](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/debt-ceiling-instant-access-module-pre-mip-discussion/3924) and then gradually implemented for all vault types.

The way it works is through these three most important parameters:

* \`line\` - the ""hard"" debt ceiling where a governance vote is needed for changes
* \`ttl\` - the time that needs to pass between soft debt ceiling changes, where each x hours the ""soft"" ceiling is readjusted
* \`gap\` - the amount above the current debt of a certain collateral type the ""soft"" ceiling will be adjusted to

tl;dr - Yes, there's an automatically adjusting soft limit for Dai minting, as well as a hard limit that can only be changed by MakerDAO Governance.

On top of a rapidly expanding nonfungible token community, the Fantom network can now add a multi-billion-dollar DeFi protocol to its list of accomplishments thanks to the successful launch and liquidity build of Geist, a decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can lend or borrow crypto assets on the Fantom protocol.

Since the launch of the Geist protocol on October 5, the platform has rapidly ascended in the total value locked (TVL) ranking and has accumulated more than $11.1 billion worth of locked value as of October 8, according to the Geist Dashboard. The rapid rise in TVL on Geist confirms an active and involved community and solid backing from well-funded sources.

Assets locked on Geist include $2.44 billion worth of Tether (USDT, $604 million in Fantom (FTM), $1.3 billion in DAI, $2.32 billion in USD Coin (USDC), $2.81 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH), and $1.62 billion worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

According to data from DeFi Llama, a TVL of $11.1 billion makes Geist the sixth-largest protocol by TVL of all DeFi platforms, placing it in the league as some of the largest and most well-established protocols on the Ethereum network such as MakerDAO and Compound.

Even then liquidation isn't as much of a risk both because the penelty is only 13% and automation on DefiSaver can be turned on if the market is getting volatile near your liquidation ratio.

It's not risk free, but even if only goes to 5K in the next two years I'll be up \~10% in ETH after I pay back my CDP. And the best part, it's tax free in the United States because it's considered a loan.

Make sure you have enough ETH to make it worth while after gas fees though. I won't lie, I payed a little over 400$ in gas when all was said and done setting up my CDP. Depending on the portfolio this can still be worth it and in my case I'll be coming out ahead long term.

UST is only as valuable as those in the market for LUNA, or those willing to collateralize their Ethereum via Lido, an ETH 2.0 validator, which offers bETH (bonded Ethereum), which is essentially a Terra compatible version of their stETH (staked Ether) token provided to those who wish to delegate a portion of their ETH until the ETH 2.0 launch, but need a solution like Lido provides to aggregate their ETH, and others ETH, to reach the 32 ETH minimum validator node staking requirements. 

Initially UST was only collateralized by $LUNA, Terra’s native “collateral token”, but those who staked their $ANC governance in the Anchor DAO voted to approve bETH to also collateralize UST, allowing bETH providers to borrow against their bonded Ether.",2021-10-11 07:49:36

ApoIIoCreed,"There seems to be a lot of discourse on this MakerDAO subreddit regarding the burnrate of MKR – the age-old “use cashflow for dividends” vs. “use cashflow re-investment” debate. The reddit Maker community seems divided on the best path forward and it seems that nearly every thread has the two camps slinging mud at each other.

In contrast, the users on the official MakerDAO governance forum acknowledge that Maker is in a high-growth tech sector and that the best way to grow faster than the competition is through direct investment. They generally seem far more informed about how MakerDAO is using funds to invest, and far happier with the state of the project and tokenomics.

Personally, I think the difference in sentiment is due to an information imbalance between the DAO forums and the subreddit – those with less information on the status of the DAO’s projects and spending are the angriest about anything that interferes with the MKR supply reduction.

vvpan,"Good question. I am not number one expert.

Well, most other tokens are pegged coins. OHM has base collateralization but is not pegged. Although there is an assumption of future stability. This increases decentralization. I think those properties are in line with general trend in Defi of decoupling from USD.

They have been able to buy up their liquidity tokens. We used to talk about TVL. But TVL is not sticky. Olympus has excelled in the newer and, imho, more interesting metric POL (protocol owned liquidity).

And now there is Olympus Pro, which makes liquidity buy-back through bonds a service. A bunch of projects already jumped onto the bandwagon (Abra, shapeshift...). Usage of those bonds support Olympus treasury and is pumped back into growing OHM. There are also incentives coming for use of OHM in treasuries.

Olympus DAO the organization has shown itself to be very apt and innovative with OHM and then the bonds and Olympus Pro and community building. Actually I think they are the some of the most successful builders I have seen in DAO land. Compare, say, with MakerDAO.

There's also the gamble that a POW version of ETH will live on after the Merge, thereby leaving another ETC free money dumping situation. This won't be available to any ETH locked in the deposit contract.

&gt;My darkest timeline is Erigon leading the way for the old POW chain. They've been hating on the difficulty bomb in the past, both Alexey and Artem in old tweets. Which made me wonder, why is something so trivial so important to them? Total speculation here with horrible odds but I can't let it go. Didn't help that Erigon skipped out on the interop event in Greece.

&gt;Obviously the lasting POW chain would be a mess with all the stable tokens committing to POS, amoungst many other things.

&gt;However there's still a small chance to me we'll see a contentious split.

I wanted to reply but I think this is deserves to spawn a discussion.


I've been thinking about this and I may be wrong but hear me out. 



**Ethereum Is Unforkable Due To DeFi** 


Here's my thought process:


Bitcoin is a simple blockchain - no smart contracts.  One token, one consensus. Any contentious changes that causes the blockchain to split, results in users having free coins on the other chain (because of their access to the private keys on the other chain). We have seen this numerous times: Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, BitcoinZ, etc. 

There are no negative consequences for forking Bitcoin...to be more specific - there are no unintended consequences for forking Simple Blockchains.

We have also seen this in Ethereum with Ethereum Classic. For those unfamiliar with the DAO hack, [here's a nice summary from Gemini] (https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-what-is-a-dao). After the DAO hack in 2016, the 'Code is Law' group spawned Ethereum Classic from the resulting chain split. Ethereum was ~1 year old and the ***community*** decision to hard fork and return the stolen ETH was a tough but necessary choice. Imagine trying to implement PoS today when a single address held 3.6 million ETH.

***Ethereum Today***

The building blocks of DeFi are stablecoins. [Currently Tether and USDC make up ~60% of all stablecoins on Ethereum.](https://defipulse.com/usd) For better or worse, these two stablecoins are custodial and centralized. They are an IOU token that, in theory, should allow users to redeem them for $1 USD. From these stable coins, we get the numerous other applications that we find in DeFi. Money Legos. Everything built on top of each other. This composability aspect of DeFi is great for creating novel applications. However, if one piece breaks, the rest of the ecosystem will suffer the consequences.


MakerDao's Dai was thought to be a fully decentralized stablecoin initially backed only by Ethereum. But the need for Dai's growth and liquidity, resulted in MakerDao's governance incorporating USDC into it's balance sheets. [USDC now represents over ~50% of all Dai generated.](https://daistats.com/#/)


Let's focus on USDC because I believe it's the main reason why a minority chain can never exist.

USDC represents ~$30.22 Billion that is being circulated on Ethereum. If a minority group were to ever split the Ethereum Network, there would now be two copies of all tokens and all stablecoins. And because USDC is an IOU token, there can only be one official record of that token to be redeemed. [CENTRE, the group behind USDC,](https://www.centre.io/usdc) will have to choose a chain to support and blacklist the addresses on the other chain. 


Whatever chain CENTRE chooses, the other chain will fall apart. 

* USDC becomes worthless 

* Dai becomes worthless 

* The entire Curve market place falls apart due to USDC and DAI losing their peg

* USDC/DAI debt is now effectively paid off for free 

* Liquidity Pools that are paired with USDC are drained as users quickly try to get rid of USDC 

* Lenders of USDC/DAI cannot get their USDC back in time and are left holding bags of worthless USDC/DAI tokens. 

I could go on and on. The outcome would be horrible as the entire DeFi space on the other chain is crippled.



**Author's note**: *It was at this point I came across this article while writing this -_- it seems someone smarter than me has had this thought before but I'll continue with my thought process and add it as supplemental reading material. Glad I was on the right track though.
https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/ethereum-is-now-unforkable-thanks-to-defi-9818b967738f*

In it's current state it would take Miners, Node Operators, Exchanges, and Custodial Stablecoin Operators to choose the chain to support. 

And a quote from the article I just found that summarizes it better than I could have:

&gt;What this little thought experiment tells us is: Ethereum is not what it used to be. In 2016, Ethereum was still a proof of concept, and ETC could plausibly claim to be a better vision of how the “world computer” should evolve. But today, it’s clear that ETH is valuable because of the systems that exist on top of it. Unlike Bitcoin, whose ledger is simple enough that forks are functionally airdrops, ETH’s ecosystem is incredibly complex. Because its applications are intertwined with unforkable components, the entire system is rendered unforkable. Any minority fork is doomed to obscurity.",2021-10-13 02:06:04

samsimon123,"Flare direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs. Songbird is open systems and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. It's super cheap fees (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Use cases: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl is game changer and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins.

For larger positions, Lido's stETH gives you exposure to staking, and might be accepted as a collateral for MakerDAO vault pretty soon. This could let you borrow more DAI at a very conservative rate, and buy more ETH, or put that DAI to work earning yield elsewhere.",2021-10-15 15:08:24

FlamesRiseHigher,"*I'll preface this by saying I do have a small amount of my portfolio in Olympus.*

There's been a lot of craziness with OlympusDAO in the past 24 hours as many have been discussing. I had a bout of insomnia last night so ended up following along live as the price basically halved. It was actually pretty interesting. /u/CaterpillarKitchen67 suggested I come back and do a write-up about it if I find any info on what caused all this, so this is my attempt to explain what went down.

The general game theory strat behind Olympus is the whole ""(3,3)"" thing, where the value goes up if everyone stakes and holds. It's certainly has a ponzi effect, which I suspect may inevitably lead to volatile periods. The insane staking APY (currently %8000) is set to go down over time so I do personally believe that OHM could achieve more stability in the future. 

In any case, the more degenerate strategy employed by Ohmies as of late is called ""(9,9)"", where they can take their sOHM and use it as collateral to borrow against it. Of course, they then reinvest in Olympus and get more sOHM. I think this was also likely a factor in the exponential price growth we saw recently. The most popular vault I saw people discussing using for this (9,9) strategy was ""Tetranode's Locker"". Tetranode is a whale who's well known on crypto twitter (CT). His locker is a Fuse pool on Rari where participants can borrow against up to 76% of their sOHM. This led to a lot of people with risky liquidation prices. What happened last night was a liquidation cascade which caused a lot of people to lose their sOHM. It seems to have been caused by a whale, but it's unknown if it was done on purpose or not. Here's a tweet  ([https://twitter.com/sayinshallah/status/1448998447340732423](https://twitter.com/sayinshallah/status/1448998447340732423))  from one of the Olympus guy's on CT about a whale doing a max borrow limit with 30m, so seems like that must be what triggered it, but whether they just fucked up or were trying to make this happen seems to still be up in the air. If you want more info, @sayinshallah works for OlympusDAO and will likely keep posting updates as they learn more.

*Just a side note here, but while I was researching this I came across this stat on CT:* [*https://twitter.com/adampatel23/status/1448891525853765650*](https://twitter.com/adampatel23/status/1448891525853765650) *. OlympusDAO made up 58% of Sushi's volume in a 24 hr period. Crazy!*

In addition to this, last night Banteg (Yearn Finance dev) posted this tweet ([https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1448476044713922568](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1448476044713922568)) about some concerns that MakerDAO folks had with OlympusDAO's keys. The actual Maker forum discussion can be found here: [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ohm-olympus-dao-collateral-onboarding-application-mip6/10709](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ohm-olympus-dao-collateral-onboarding-application-mip6/10709). I think this is kind of moot already as Olympus already announced ""Olympus v2"" which moves everything to a new contract, so the necessary changes will be made to correct that. Additionally they're adding community governance through a ""gOHM"" token. You can read about Olympus v2 here: [https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-v2-c4ade14e9fe](https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-v2-c4ade14e9fe) 

In the end, I think Banteg's tweet ended up only fanning the flames a little, but ultimately it wasn't an impetus of this volatility, nor does it seem it will be a concern much longer. 

**TLDR** is basically: Ohmies got too risky with their borrowing and got caught in a liquidation cascade caused by whale who was either an idiot or acting maliciously.

My personal feelings on this are basically ""I'm not shook"". This DAO has proven that they can be great innovators and are willing to think outside the box. This is experimental economics so events like this will happen from time to time, but I can't help but believe in their goal of becoming a decentralized reserve currency. Additionally, OlympusPro's bonds are very interesting to me and I think could provide a real service to many DeFi protocols. 

Also please don't take this as an endorsement to buy now. DYOR, it's a complex economic model with some ponzi-like effects that I fear will inevitably lead to these hype trains / volatility till the APY eventually comes down.",2021-10-16 00:44:23

thebestboner,"The MakerDAO Protocol Engineering team was able to get my ether back! 

I honestly cannot believe this. As soon as I realized what had happened, I was positive it was gone forever. I cannot describe how grateful I am. These guys had no obligation to me whatsoever and yet they still took the time to figure out how to do something that many people, including myself, thought would be impossible. 

I'm not exaggerating when I say this ether is almost everything I have in the world. I've never made very much money. My car is twenty years old and trimmed with rust. I was lucky enough to learn about Ethereum in 2017 and ever since then, invested invested a hundred bucks or so out of every paycheck, sometimes not even leaving much left over for food. All my tax returns went into Ethereum. All my covid stimulus money went into Ethereum. These guys were able to return all of that. All of that time, all of that hope. I am so grateful for what they've done. Thank you!

I also want to say thank you to everyone here who read my posts and offered advice. Thank you! When I first posted here, I had no idea where to turn. It was you guys who steered me in the right direction and helped me get in contact with the right people. And it was your comments of support that helped me through those first few days. I cannot overstate how important this subreddit has been to me. Thank you, everyone!",2021-10-16 02:00:39

13blues13moons,"Ok so Maker is a token on the Ethereum network, and it's part of the Dai protocol (as a governance token). Thus people using the system and wanting to participate in governance, that's what drives up the price (or, it's a factor). Traders wanting to buy Maker and sell for a quick profit, they also influence the price. 

So, right now there's big news in both the Ethereum corner, and the Bitcoin corner. Remember, limited resources means limited choices. A lot of people right now just want to buy ETH and stake it, or at the very least hold on to it. Also, to use MakerDao you have to spend ETH. So, maybe if people think ETH is going to explode in price, or gives them better earning opportunity, not as many people will want to pay the fees. Or, they will use the ETH for other things like AAVE or Compound.

graph_marine,"I'm not big on price predictions, because I don't know when they will come to fruition and I don't know what the future holds. However, I can give you some data points to work with and I can also give you my personal thoughts on where we may end up in the next few years. 

&gt;Monthly query growth: \~20% (on average since 2019)  
&gt;  
&gt;Total queries in June 2021: 30 billion billion  
&gt;  
&gt;Total queries in October 2021: 46-60 billion  
&gt;  
&gt;Daily queries: 1 billion (last quoted June 2021)  
&gt;  
&gt;Number of subgraphs: 22,000  
&gt;  
&gt;Estimated cost per query: $0.00017-$0.000017

Some of this information has to be taken with a grain of salt, however. For the past two years, The Graph was a hosted network on AWS and was provided as a free service to developers who created decentralized applications. Most of the activity was on Ethereum, until The Graph provided support for an additional 23 EVM-compatible networks (eg, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, etc.). Most of the data above is based on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks, and is not representative of the number of queries The Graph will receive once it completely indexes and supports Solana, Bitcoin, Near, Polkadot, etc.

Developers who want to create applications on these networks almost universally use The Graph. If a new developer wants to create a new subgraph on The Graph's network, they'll need GRT to pay for the queries that their subgraph/dapp yields. That's why there will always be demand among developers to have GRT. If The Graph is supporting a dapp, and it goes down, the dapp does not function. These dapps are onboard as well, and will be paying for query fees because it is faster, cheaper, and decreases their bottom line to do so (rather than indexing these chains themselves). See AirSwap's community decision on the matter for reference: 

[https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth/proposal/QmRqyFdwa1SQQuVPgn816CfxnTCUqRkVa25LmVozxwQcRb](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth/proposal/QmRqyFdwa1SQQuVPgn816CfxnTCUqRkVa25LmVozxwQcRb)

I'm kind of rambling here, but the bottom line is - The Graph makes it easier for developers to create applications. Aave, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Pancakeswap, EIP1155/EIP721 standards (ie, ALL NFTs on Ethereum and other chains), MakerDAO, Balancer, Synthetix, all ***rely upon*** The Graph to function. If you believe blockchain-based decentralized applications will continue to grow in development and use over time, and if you believe in the networks that The Graph supports, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Near, Celo, and others, then GRT's token price will exponentially increase as long as Web 3.0 continues to grow.

I think $10 within the next year or 2 is inevitable. I'm hoping for/thinking of $50 by 2025 and $100 by 2030, though I could be underestimating the future potential of Web 3.0.",2021-10-16 05:47:27

throwawayqt8yq3iuae,"I'm thinking about exchanging the borrowed stablecoin (collateralized by my ETH) for fiat, then withdrawing that fiat. 

For example, you can borrow DAI if you deposit ETH into [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/en) for basically 2% interest. Then exchange that DAI for USD, then take out the USD for the down payment. When I pay back my DAI debt, I get my ETH back in my custody, but it was always there as collateral / the ETH wasn't sold.

GrilledCheezzy,I just found out about alchemix  which I found interesting bc the collateral you provide is used for farming while you have taken a loan against it. So it earns a yield which slowly pays back the loan automatically. A bit of added risk for sure that the collateral in another project like sushi could be the victim of an exploit but that’s always a possibility with all of the dapps really.  I found that to be very interesting. I use bprotocol right now which is built on top of makerdao but it provides a unique liquidation protocol for other applications that it integrates with.

Revanchist1,"I understand that it's all the same but **if** these newer platforms work, I would consider it DeFi 2.0. DeFi 2.0, in the sense that a next generation of devs are building on what came before.


The Original Defi Platforms set the foundation for what future DeFi applications will be building on (MakerDao, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Yearn, Curve, etc.) These will probably stay the foundational building blocks for all of DeFi.


These DeFi 1.0  projects spawned a host of copy/paste projects with minimal changes (new token name or a changed variable), on the Ethereum network and on other EVM chains.


DeFi 2.0 uses the 1.0 platforms to create something new or create new efficiencies within the 1.0 platforms. 


I think the main idea of the 2.0 branding Scupytrooples was talking about is the lineage of DeFi Platforms. When you think Defi 1.0, you think of the originals in the space. And 2.0 would be the next generation of DeFi dApps. They won't replace the 1.0 dApps, they are just the wave of DeFi dApps that will inevitably spawn a whole host of innovations.",2021-10-17 00:18:44

I have a MakerDAO ETH/DAI vault that went from 220% collateralization to 370% on its own. Granted, this is partly due to the eth price increase. But if we go back down to sub $2k, I'll still sit prettier than before thanks to compounding LP fees.

no-nonsense-crypto,"&gt;The Olympus treasury is now the second largest.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;And it’s quickly growing full of stables and non-native tokens. The bonding program is becoming a new standard in sustainability.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;If you don’t understand the implications of this, I suggest you continue to do more research.

You're literally just spreading straight up misinformation. The graph you posted maybe can get away with not being technically a lie, because it just says, ""Total"" for the Y axis, and you could claim ""total"" means anything since that's a vague term that nobody uses.

Rest assured however, if you're thinking that means ""Total Value Locked"", you'd be wrong: UniSwap's TVL is just under $5 billion. The graph says they have a little over $10 billion.

Your claim, that this means ""treasury"", is wrong: see MakerDAO over on the left of the graph? Their treasury contains over 3 billion in stable coins alone--orders of magnitude more than any claim about Olympus, and that doesn't include non-stable coins.

Maybe you think it's market capitalization: that's the first possibility where any of the numbers on the graph were maybe correct at some point, but if that's the case, then the graph is leaving out a ton of major projects which are larger than Olympus.

In short, I have no idea where you got this graph, or where the graph got its numbers, or even what the numbers are supposed to represent, but Olympus isn't close to being the second largest project on any metric I can see.",2021-10-17 04:28:14
TREYisRAD,"TVL is mostly meaningless, and it's definitely not the metric I'm showing here. I'm certainly not confusing market cap. What is being show here is what matters: \*Protocol Controlled Value\*

Who cares if Uniswap or Maker have multi-billions in mercenary capital locked in their system? That capital can move elsewhere in an instant. 

PCV is what the Protocol Owns, and as token holders / DAO members, the number that you should care about.

[Maker has $56 million of DAI in their treasury](https://openorgs.info/organization/makerdao). Not $3b. Stop spreading misinformation if you do not understand the difference between value locked in a protocol and value \_owned\_ by a protocol.

[Olympus has the highest](https://i.imgur.com/33OautZ.jpg) % ownership of non-native vs. native protocol tokens ownership in their treasury. Here's [more charts](https://dune.xyz/shadow/Olympus-(OHM)) to digest.

\*What does this mean?\*

It means if UNI were to go to $0, UNI token holders would be entitled to nothing. The protocol treasury owns nothing except now-worthless UNI tokens. If OHM were to go to $0, token holders would still be entitled to a half-billion dollar treasury of non-native tokens. 

And that treasury is growing very quickly. The Olympus Pro Bonds-as-a-Service program has been wildly successful in just its first couple weeks, generating tens of millions. And there are dozens of additional protocols waiting to be onboarded to the service.

Naturally, the market would decide that OHM \_won't\_ ever go to $0, because of that PCV backing the value of OHM.

If Olympus' revenue stays at the current rate, then the PCV grows by $100m per month.

That means the \*baseline market cap of OHM is growing by over $1b/year\*

And remember: \*99% of protocols have a baseline market cap of $0\*. They are \_purely speculative\_.

And Olympus' revenue is only accelerating. $1b/year is extremely conservative.

What will happen when APY is reduced to single-digits, and `1 OHM == PCV / Supply`? 

Well, as revenue continues to be added to the PCV, the value of OHM will simply go Up Only... for as long as the protocol is revenue generating. As a token holder / DAO member, you are entitled to your share of that treasury. You are effectively investing into a bank vault that is growing every second.

Again, I implore you to do more research. You seem to not grok PCV and it's implications for a DeFi protocol.

Curve - Deposit Dai into 3crv pool

Abracadabra - take 3crv token -&gt; deposit into Abracadabra -&gt; use MIM to 5x+ leverage back into 3crv pool.


Interest from 3crv pool should be enough to pay monthly mortgage/insurance. 


There are a lot of worst cases. Smart contract risks, usdt losing peg causing ramifications throughout DeFi and Curve.


Worst Case is your CDP loan gets liquidated and you lose your ETH collateral in the CDP but you still get to keep earning your leveraged 3crv earnings. The alETH loan will eventually pay itself off so you never ""really lose your ETH""... (however long that will take).


Your CDP debt could be reduced by deleveraging from your 3crv pool and paying back some of the debt in case of an ETH price drop. 


But the earnings from farming the 3crv pool  with leverage will be more than enough to either pay the mortgage or heavily supplement your normal income. Rates are subject to change but you could probably find safe good paying farms in the curve ecosystem.",2021-10-17 14:51:12

falkerr,"I would say that all of Defi would fit that bill. We are talking about the decentralization and automation of the financial industry. This allows the billions of unbanked people in the world access to financial products with nothing other than a smart phone. Stable currency can be sent on a layer 2 settlement platform for cents making it significantly easier and cheaper for immigrants sending remittances. This might not seem valuable to you(it still is though) but it is valuable to billions of people. 

Some projects would be Aave, Compound, MakerDao, Layer 2s like Loopring, Arbitrum and Polygon. 

Next crypto gaming could be revolutionary for the gaming industry. Really interesting how that will play out. Illuvium, axies, are interesting crypto projects that will continue to progress the industry( making games is a long process) 

Cool projects like Klima Dao that aim to help our environment by buying up carbon credits and making them more expensive. 

A big argument to examples like I just showed is that the government, big tech, banks, or gaming companies would never let any of this become successful. However, the truth is that this is disruptive tech and disruptive tech will always eventually win out in the long run whether the old players like it or not.

InvertedDick,"The decentralized talking point is not as good as people think. For proof of work, eventually it’ll only be the wealthy that can afford specialized mining hardware, which then gives them a lot of control because now they can control the processing of transactions. Proof of stake is harder to game but still possible since all it takes is to purchase a large amount of coins, although yeah weighted randomization does help out. 

Both cases mean that there still is centralization happening, except this time it’s free from regulation and now the rich are truly able to do a lot of money laundering if they wish. Not to mention the environmental harm it does despite it processing in many orders of magnitude less than the current financial system. ETH’s proof of stake is shit in that regard, while still being better than a lot of proof of work. Proof of work is just flat out terrible. 

Another issue with this decentralization gimmick is that it is possible for transactions that were already processed to be reverted if they deem fit. Why does immutability matter when they can wipe out records that don’t benefit them? I mean, this flaw is fair game supposedly. https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao

For example, there are autonomous protocols that can manage collateralized debt to create a synthetic stable asset and conduct transactions/ provide yield (Liquity, MakerDAO, Alchemix), all running on a provably secure, decentralized and turing complete ledger. This fact is far more important than some vague indictment of *""hurr da shadowy super coders are using their 1s and 0s to run 'ponzis' because I don't understand the difference between ponzi's and fractional reserve banking.""*

MrQot,"Because if you had 1 ETH before the merge, you'll have 1 ETH on the PoS chain and 1 ETH on the PoW chain. Which is the ""real"" ETH? Which one will you be able to bridge to other chains like Polygon, using the existing bridge smart contracts? It'll be whichever one is deemed [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) by the community and market at large.

But it's not just eth, it's *all* the value locked in DeFi on Ethereum. If you had 1000 USDC before the merge, now you have it on both chains. But it's not like you magically made $1000 out of thin air, only one of those will be legitimate and redeemable. Same for NFTs, same for all the tokens out there. 

If you have 1000 DAI on both chains well, MakerDao ultimately sets the price and the price depends on what the oracles say the price of ETH say. So if MakerDao decides the PoS-ETH chain is legit, then the PoW-ETH oracle will be shut down or feed a value of $0 per ETH which would most likely fuck shit up on PoW-MakerDao and liquidate everyone's collateral. It's not impossible for part of the community to fork MakerDao as well and recreate DAI but it would be a lot of effort.

The DAO hard fork was in Ethereum's infancy when DeFi was barely a thing. The price of 1 ETC diverged for 1 ETH according to the market and that was it, but now the whole game is different.",2021-10-18 22:30:26

DeFi will be completely broken on any fork

First of all, any fiat-backed stablecoin (USDC, USDT, etc) and even WBTC will be completely worthless. That means that the millions of dollars of liquidity in DEXs will allow buying ""forked ETH"" for $0, meaning the price of forked ETH will crash in price, bringing down many protocols that rely on ETH as collateral.

Plus, oracles will not be updated on the new chain, meaning any oracle-dependent application (MakerDAO, Aave, Compound, Synthetix) will completely break.

With the entire DeFi ecosystem collapsing and the price of forked-ETH plummeting, it's hard to imagine there will be any value left on chain. If people want a cheap EVM compatible chain, there's already many better alteratives.",2021-10-18 22:39:50

Your collateral drops to $1300 and the hour delay passes so now your CDP is able to be liquidated. MakerDAO wants $1000 + %fee (is it 13% right now) to square the treasury up.

The auction system sells enough of your ETH to get back $1000 + liquidation penalty. And you get whatever is left, if there's anything left.

So now you have your $1000 DAI (or spent it on anime figurines) + the ETH that is leftover from your CDP - (whatever it was auctioned off for + the liquidation penalty)",2021-10-19 00:14:23

tldrthestoryofmylife,"Small nit: The problem isn't what it's backed by, rather the lack of transparency around the whole thing.

Personally, I'm a Cardano bull; Charles and friends have researched into creation a new type of stablecoin called a Djed that's a perfect example of this. It's like a MakerDAO pair with mathematical assurances; you can verify mathematically as part of the implementation that the price will not rise or fall beyond a certain tightly-bound threshold and that there will be no bank runs (where the last guy to pull his money out finds nothing remaining).

That's an example of a system with ""monopoly-money"", i.e., synthetic money printed against the ""real"" value of gold or \[laughably, but in theory\] USD. The difference between a bank and a stablecoin system like Djed or MakerDAO -- the latest in decentralized stablecoin protocols -- is that the former is subject to no transparency requirements relative to the latter and pretty much allows them to do whatever they want to get a profit on *their* side (particularly in revocation of Glass-Steagall, which allows banks to do literally whatever they want with the money in your 0.5-1% APY savings account.)

You're not wrong in that the money needs to be backed by ""real"" assets; however, some claim that faith in USD is given by faith in the US itself, i.e., its military power. My only point is that the whole thing revolves around *transparency*; even if the Fed deployed PowellCoin tomorrow, and the government itself offered better yield than USDC, it still wouldn't be good for the economy or the world b/c the Fed isn't transparent about the monetary policy and is thus obliged to do whatever the fuck it decides on the day.",2021-10-19 01:43:57

FaceDeer,"&gt; Sounds bad until you realize the alternative is the price of DAI shooting up to like $5 and a good portion of DeFi exploding, and everyone losing trust in DAI as a stablecoin.

A lot of people overlook this. The Prime Directive of MakerDAO, the thing that is the whole point of it existing, is that it must strive to maintain the $1 peg above all else. Decentralization is a tool for accomplishing this, it isn't an end goal in itself.",2021-10-19 03:18:03

Secondly be your own bank!
1) convert btc -&gt; wBTC (shouldn't be taxable)
2) lock a portion in makerdao

4) sell dia for usd (on Coinbase). 

Since this is a conversion and a loan it shouldn't be taxable.

The btc is still yours and you can gradually buy dia and burn it in your vault to reduce liability. Eventually you'll be able to unlock all your BTC.

Maker dao will let you borrow up to 66% of your BTC value in dia. Don't use all that collateral, because if BTC price drops you will need to lock additional BTC up in your vault (or lose all your btc). On the other hand you now own your house in the clear and no one can take that.

What's the percentage on this because I don't really see it.  Most of the money in defi is locked up in reliable projects.  It's only on the absolute fringes, the farthest out on the risk curve that you can possibly go that you start seeing rug pulls.  Go to a site like defillama.com.  You're saying a huge percentage of stuff like Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Sushiswap, 1INCH,  Quickswap, Benqi, Serum, Venus, MDEX, PancakeSwap, etc, etc, etc are all just rugs?

That's a little loopy imo.  Obviously they aren't.  Defi gets a bad wrap because it's your money and it lets you be as stupid with it as you want.  Refuse to use any trusted protocols?  You live life like a skydiver and if you can't die from it then what's the point of doing it?  There's protocols out there for you.

That's not most of defi nor a huge percentage.  It's only really impacting people that would rather be executed than take safe, relatively risk-free bets.",2021-10-19 19:48:35

I took out a loan on Makerdao in early 2018 when ETH was close to $900. Then ETH started dropping and dropping and dropping and eventually dipped under $100. The initial loan was collaterized with only a relatively small percentage of my ETH stack, but it was still a pretty sizeable loan. By the time ETH dipped below $100 I had had to put pretty much my entire ETH stack in the CDP to avoid getting liquidated. (I did not have access to enough cash to pay off the loan and did not want to sell my ETH during a big downturn). There was a happy ending to this, as ETH started recovering and ultimately was able to make a profit, but the constant fear of a sudden market crash and getting liquidated made it all very stressful. I will not take a big long term defi loan again unless I have a ton of collateral to protect it. Be careful.",2021-10-20 08:10:45

I don't think BTC/WBTC is an alternative to StableCoins. StableCoins are generally of two type...

1. Pegged StableCoins, e.g. USDC/USDT/BUSD

2. Algorithmic Stablecoins, e.g. UST/RAI

DAI is a mixed bag by MakerDAO. It has both Pegged component, as well as Algorithmic component. Instability in Pegged component will disturb stability overall for sure. So, the true alternative IMHO are Algorithmic Stablecoins, e.g. UST/RAI. These are not battle tested yet though. Upcoming bear market will tell us how strong their algorithms are against a highly volatile market.",2021-10-20 23:30:53

rosadefoc,Do you see any risks in getting into MakerDao? Seems it has been lagging on the trend. Any reason i am missing?,2021-10-21 05:55:27
MerkleChainsaw,"I’m also on the fence. It has a wonderful mission and decentralized stablecoins are necessary for Ethereum to be the best it can be long term. It has a wonderful team who has pioneered in the space and truly wants good for the ecosystem rather than going for a money grab (see the recent post on them recovering funds for a user who made a mistake). It has as close to an equity / revenue sharing mechanism as you could hope for in a token. 

The part that scares me is it’s losing market share and the competition both for stablecoins and for lending platforms is only heating up, including action moving to L2s. MakerDAO needs to move quickly to stay relevant. I see they are working on a lot of interesting new areas, but it’s hard to judge  the odds of success.",2021-10-21 06:06:04
thebestboner,"Just want to give one final shoutout to the MakerDAO team. After everything else they did for me, they even sent out a [Maker Swag Airdrop!](https://i.imgur.com/KapZkEd.jpg)

Can't overstate how awesome these guys are!

Also, just an update regarding the transaction fees, since a couple people had asked. All together, the entire retrieval ended up costing around 2.2 ETH, which I was more than happy to pay. However, when I got in contact to reimburse, /u/chrisbducky from Oasis, let me know that they had already covered all the fees since this all happened on their site. Thank you, Chris! When all this first happened, I had no idea how helpful everyone would be. This is better customer service than I've ever had from a bank, and I hope it goes a long way toward boosting people's confidence in these projects and their teams.

Finally, I've gotten a couple messages regarding my personal security. Since my reddit username is now out there on twitter, along with my wallet address and how much is in it, I'm going to be taking their advice and ditching this username as well as transferring everything to a new wallet. I'll still be part of this community, it'll just be under a different name.

And again, thank you to everyone here who commented and took an interest. Without you, I would have had no idea where to turn, and things could have turned out much differently. Thank you, everyone. You have no idea how grateful I am.",2021-10-21 07:35:45
MerkleChainsaw,"That’s so great. I think before you go you should consider making a post on the cc sub with your story. First it’s a cautionary tale on ensuring which transactions are supported, but more importantly everyone should know how awesome the MakerDAO team is.",2021-10-21 07:44:28
iPeculiarly,"Hell yeah! Glad things worked out and I'm glad it was a fairly cheap hack back! I'm blown away at how well Oasis team / Makerdao team handled this. Makes me more confident in DeFi as a whole, especially makerdao / oasis!",2021-10-21 08:27:23

samsimon123,"Flare direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs. Songbird is open systems and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. It's super cheap fees (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Use cases: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl is game changer and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty.",2021-10-22 22:37:36

aula21un,"Has to be Onomy.io since it's onboarding a $6.6T market to the blockchain (i.e. Forex). In doing so, it has tokenized versions of denoms that are collateralised by its native token and will provide a hybrid dex to facilitate its trading.  
If you ask me, centralized stablecoins are a ""false utopia"" and if anything, the world does not need more centralization and decentralized stablecoins like MakerDao (it's mostly limited to the $ so that's a shortcoming) and Onomy's denoms.

Basically in the near future, that sweet 5% APY you get just for holding Algo will be gone (scheduled for 3 months or so from now). You will get rewards by participating in the governance. This will have proposals most likely dealing with transaction fees, expansion of the network, etc. A typical Gov token like MakerDAO or Compound. 

The first gov period has just started, hence the large talk, and the first topic to be voted on is if there should be a penalty for people who pull out of gov early. So all these people pulling out now would lose 8% of their committed Algo for pulling out early. Right now they lose nothing, and if Option A win, it will remain this way. 

Gov in short terms is you ""commit"" Algo, each Algo is a vote. Then you need to vote on every topic. If you keep your wallet balance about the committed amount, and you voted in every topic, then you get the APY.",2021-10-23 04:26:42

BothEmergency,"&gt;How is UST differ to decentralized Dai stable coin?

##Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) Stablecoins

Provide Collateral (ETH, yvTokens) &gt; the Protocol lets you Mint/Borrow a new Stablecoin against your Collateral.

**Examples of CDP Stablecoins**:

- alUSD, alETH (Alchemix)

- MIM (Abracadabra)

- LUSD (Liquity)

- DAI (MakerDAO)

- RAI (Reflexer)

##Algorithmic Stablecoins

In the case of UST, there's a Symbiotic Relationship here.

Demand for UST goes up ↑ — More LUNA gets Burnt to Mint UST.

Demand for UST goes down ↓ — Some UST gets Redeemed for LUNA.

That's an Elastic Supply.[[1]](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1396368188900667398?lang=en) LUNA isn't gone forever.

- IBC and Wormhole has been enabled, anyone can export UST to other chains (Solana, Osmosis, Secret).

- The Terra Spacecamp Hackathon had a vision of Projects increasing Demand for UST.[[2]](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1439012005273296899)

Vice versa for any fiat currency, enough speculation will make any currency volatile.

cryptOwOcurrency,"I'm sorry but this is one of the worst takes I've ever seen on Ethereum, and I've seen some pretty bad takes.

From a technology point of view, NFTs are about the least interesting thing happening on Ethereum right now and account for a small fraction of the transactions sent (and therefore the revenue the protocol generates in the form of fee burn). It's all about fungible tokens and DeFi. If Ethereum had NFTs but not DeFi, gas fees would be sitting at 10 gwei and the Ethereum network wouldn't even be profitable (deflationary) before PoW rewards like we are now.

Out of all the most important, interesting, and revenue-generating projects in the space - impermax, alchemix, balancer, uniswap, makerdao, liquity, opensea - only one of them has anything to do with art NFTs or art NFT platforms (though *useful* NFTs do have their place, such as representations of unique resources like ENS names, or LP positions).

The public face of Ethereum is NFTs, but the real party happens in the back, for people in the know. Learn more about DeFi and you will quickly realize that the NFTs the CNN talking heads are reporting on are just the tip of the iceberg.",2021-10-25 13:17:38

DeFi_ance,"The arguments for it are that MakerDAO is prioritizing growth via re-investment over focusing on the deflationary aspect of allowing surplus to be burnt. And not only is burning rare at this point as the surplus is constantly raised and tapped for funds before it crosses the burn barrier, but yes indeed, they are now talking about issuing more MKR above the 1 million original cap to use for ""growth"" primarily for funding the dev team. The justification is that the powerful DAO players who are basically a voting cabal consider retaining the talent they have to be crucially important, and they *need* to be extremely generous to keep their talent and continuing developing new protocol expansions to pave the way for future growth of DAI utilization overall.

Personally, as a holder who is certainly no whale but has 5-figures in MKR, I am becoming disillusioned at this pivot away from the monetary caps that for so long was a hallmark of MKR's value proposition. I fear they're going to loot the protocol to subsidize the lifestyles and gains of the privileged insider devs/delegate blocs, while debasing the value of MKR for everyone else involved. Is my fear justified? Only time will tell. But I have been seriously considering lately selling off 90% of my MKR and taking those funds elsewhere for growth, probably just back in ETH itself.

It's a really unfortunate situation, because I understand their arguments about growth requires reinvestment to stay ahead, but I also see that as competition ramps up for the stablecoin market, they could end up losing the growth battle *and* eroding the investor-base's value through inflation. My confidence and enthusiasm for Maker has certainly been seriously shaken the past few months. I think even if this works out it's just going to result in them scaring off smaller holders who don't have much voting power or can't afford to delegate, which means the protocol's top voting blocs will just become even more entrenched and even more privileged. Shitty situation.

Go to the r/MakerDAO subreddit and sort by top, this has been discussed plenty in the last few months, and the community seems pretty split on it.",2021-10-26 04:04:11

Lazy_Physicist,"I remember reading that the maker dao plans to take all their usdc and put it into a usdc-dai pool or something. That way the usdc is generating value for the protocol via fees and maintaining a liquidity pool while mitigating any potential freezing issues with usdc. Itll essentially remove the risk of the protocol being backed by frozen usdc and replace it with a LP which could potentially be frozen while not impacting maker directly.

Rune4444,"I have been making some proposals about my vision for how we can bring maker governance on a more powerful path for long term growth and value creation, and to support the Clean Money vision I recently proposed where MakerDAO will use its economic power to support environmentally sustainable projects in order to benefit from climate alpha, keep Dai stable, and provide Maker Governance with a more compelling purpose that will encourage more MKR holders to become active in governance. 

A part of those is to issue MKR in order to create staking rewards for MKR holders participating in governance, and do yield farming to expand MKR holders to a much broader group that could help getting more governance participation. 

The MKR issuance would not be used for funding the team, only for MKR holders staking rewards/yield farming. We do still need to grow the team further because of the immense complexity of the Maker system, and the goal is to do these things so we can simultaneously allow the team budget to grow to a point where it uses all profits to reinvest into growth, while MKR holders get their benefits and payout for being holders from the staking rewards.

There's already around 100 people hired by Maker in a completely decentralized and flat hierarchy. It still is just getting started, so a lot of transparency and reporting of results are missing - and to get these things properly in place, we need to find ways to get regular MKR holders squarely in the drivers seat of Maker Governance, and thats where things like staking rewards for participating in governance can have a huge effect. 

We have already begun to see some amazing results, such as work on a starknet L2 version of Maker, and some recent collateral onboarding results with extremely high potential collateral such as staked ETH or the Aave Direct Deposit Module, and of course the massive BD win with the collateral proposal from Societe Generale (third largest bank in frace). With strong governance in place we can support these efforts and create even more success, and in particular gain the capacity to begin large scale marketing.

PhiMarHal,"Everything about MKR is telling me to sell it. 

They likely have the greatest technical team of crypto, and they keep improving the protocol. stETH vaults are coming tomorrow. USDC reliance is decreasing every day. Their work is amazing.

But MakerDAO also had a history of throwing small users and holders under the bus, for the sake of insiders. Starting from the backroom VC deals at the beginning of the protocol, to endless ""sucks to be you"" answers whenever people got liquidated because of protocol flaws, oracle failures, gas congestion. Lavish spending on employees with little oversight or discussion.

Now these new tokenomics from Rune. Conveniently happening once there's no MakerDAO foundation anymore. The grand plan being to break their long-established social contract of 1M hard supply, and all for a vague plan of saving the world through investments in renewable energies. An industry that is rife with corruption and exploitation in real life.

I want to believe the pattern will be broken, because I tend to invest in fundamentals. But I think this is wishful thinking. MakerDAO will continue to deliver a fundamentally sound system to the whole crypto space. Yet the value created by that system won't accrue to MKR holders.

Still not selling. Definitely married to the bag. Here's hoping the above is all wrong.",2021-10-27 21:59:13

jvdizzle,"rETH is more than likely a security. SEC has already said crypto debt instruments are.under their purview. rETH is exactly that. The ETH providers are loaning their ETH to the protocol which in turn loans it to the node operators. This is why Coinbase Earn, most centralized and decentralized lending platforms are also securities.

RPL is bit more nuanced, since you can't earn yield on it unless you are also performing a service as a node operator.

Now question is: what would the ramifications be if SEC said Rocketpool is working with securities?

Well the smart contracts are all on the blockchain. The protocol is run by the oDAO and will eventually become more decentralized. This is a good buffer to regulatory oversight.

There are routes teams can take to become more decentralized and resilient to centralized regulatory oversight as well. MakerDAO is a good example. It is now fully decentralized and the foundation has stepped back from control of the protocol. Devs are just working on open source at that point, with no central organization pulling the strings.

I personally am not too concerned. Honestly the SEC will label the entire crypto industry as a security as long as they are incentivized to do so, which they are. It's up to the community to become more resilient to centralized oversight and control.",2021-10-28 04:13:21

samsimon123,"Full Interview On Thinking Crypto - Tony Edward Hugo Philion Interview Flare Networks SongBird Spark FLR Token Airdrop New Crypto Assets - https://youtu.be/d_wkq1fRRuU

Flare is a direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs, etc. Songbird is open systems, and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. This is the best network for smart contracts because fees are super low (per transaction), secure, very fast, and uses almost no energy. It’s great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a Songbird/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything BEP 20, ERC 20, XRPL, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols, or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance, and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty.",2021-10-29 23:27:54

Major DeFi investors piled into the Ardana project, including some that have never invested in Cardano before.Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem may be showing glimmers of primordial life following the close of a $10 million raise for Ardana, a new protocol that aims to provide stablecoin minting and exchange services.The round was led by Three Arrows Capital and Ascensive Assets, with participation from Morningstar Ventures and Mechanism Capital.Ardana co-founder Ryan Matovu told CoinDesk in an interview that in many cases this will be the first Cardano-native project in which many of the participants have invested – perhaps a sign institutional investors are beginning to believe in the chain as the next emergent DeFi hub.“Cardano is going to follow the path we’ve seen from chains other than Ethereum,” said Matovu. “Step by step other alternative chains pop up, and what we’ve seen is that a few teams build key protocols and then the ecosystem pops up around them.”ccording to Matovu, Ardana is targeting a number of verticals that are popular on other chains.  
“The simple comparison is that we’re building the MakerDAO and the Curve Finance of Cardano with foreign exchange on top,” he said.  
Users will be able to deposit collateral to mint an asset-based stablecoin, dUSD, and the project will also be home to an automated market maker (AMM) for swapping between various stablecoins will low slippage.  
Matovu noted that staked ADA to be an accepted form of collateral, which is currently a massive pool of unused liquidity – 52.2% of Cardano’s circulating supply is currently staked.
