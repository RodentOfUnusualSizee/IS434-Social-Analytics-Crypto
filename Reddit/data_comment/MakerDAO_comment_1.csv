biba8163,"Yes, you are probably right that there is greater usage of ETH and a lot more people in the crypto space than in 2017 going by gas prices and total addresses, etc.  Also GrayScale ETHE has quite a bit locked up, as has MakerDAO contracts and other such projects.  But overall, I think there is a much bigger supply in circulation than in 2017 going by the millions more in circulation since 2017 and countless ICOs who dumped millions on the market.  I think a lot of people have been misleading and cheerleading Ethereum investors with the idea that Ethereum suddenly has become more scarce than 2017 when it has not.  I see a lot people with influence in the Ethereum space like Ryan Sean Adams misleading investors with Ethereum scarcity narrative and even the EIP-1559 narrative that ETH is going deflationary which clearly isn't happening anytime soon.  Anyway, good luck with your investment.",2021-01-01 01:54:40
jolly_octopus,"The definition of security broader than the examples you listed; I've listed the SEC definition below. I'll also give some examples of cryptocurrency that I think are securities under the SEC definition:

-Binance coin is pretty obviously a security which represents a stake in the profitability of Binance. Because of the quarterly burn, there is an explicit ""profit-sharing agreement"" (see definition below). It was also distributed via an ICO. This is is definitely 1000% a security even by the most conservative definition of security.

-MakerDAO token is probably a security for the same reasons listed above. Plus, it enables governance voting, which could be seen as investing in a ""voting trust certificate"" (see below).

-Stablecoins in general might be considered ""evidence of indebtedness"" (see below) which could lead to arguing that they are securities. But I think DAI is a special case due to 1) the Dai Savings Rate implying a return on your investment, and 2) it's collateralized by ETH and MKR, making it a collateral trust certificate (see below).

__________________


""(1)  The term ""security"" means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a ""security"", or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.""",2021-01-01 05:26:31
Think-notlikedasheep,"&gt;Binance coin is pretty obviously a security which represents a stake in the profitability of Binance.

It is not an equity, so how does it represent a stake in the profitability of binance?   If Binance disappeared tomorrow, the coin would still have value (albeit lower)  but only because of the lack of liquidity since binance is the largest exchange it is traded on.      This is like saying dollar bills are a security because of the Federal Reserve's profitability.

&gt;MakerDAO token is probably a security for the same reasons listed above

How? Does Binance's profitability depend on it?  I doubt it.  

Using your example of ""quarterly burn reprsenting a profit sharing agreement"" bitcoin counts as a security because people keep having their bitcoin locked up or losing their keys.   In fact, fiat currency would be a security since people lose their fiat.  For example $60 million of pennies are thrown in the garbage every year.  

So the definition is FAR TOO BROAD.  

You can argue using that definition that baseball cards are securities, since there is a burn (people lose their cards, or their parents throw them away, or they put cards in the spokes of their bikes, effectively destroying them.

&gt;Stablecoins in general might be considered ""evidence of indebtedness"" 

Indebtednes of WHOM?     Someone borrowing money from someone using an IOU, that's a security?  Really?   Evidence of indebtedness deals with bonds and warrants.  Why isn't the SEC cracking down on payday loans, pawn shops, banks and people who lend money to other people on an informal basis?

So what you're doing is trying VERY HARD to extend the definition of security to things that are not securities.

So using your interpretation, a gift certificate or gift card is ""evidence of indebtedness"" and thus is a security.  Why isn't the SEC cracking down on all the companies issuing gift cards and gift certificates?   They're ""unregistered securities"" and illegal.",2021-01-01 06:06:36
gremlin0x,"So the current large debt system is MakerDAO. It allows minting Dai backed by a variety of tokenized assets.

On your stable eth thing, the guy talking about lambos isn't wrong. For good or bad, to bootstrap any new technology, you need to incentivize early investors and adopters to find future research and grow the network. Imagine a company whose stock was pegged to $1 through whatever mechanism you want, but gave yearly dividends based on revenue. That company would end up being quite boring since it would basically be no different than some kind of bond with variable interest rate. I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but if the goal is to monetize the network effects of new technologies, you don't want the base equity to just be pegged to a dollar.",2021-01-01 07:02:27
freehk_fktheccp,"This is not exclusive to Ethereum by any means but as a result of network effect most of what's interesting in programmable blockchains is happening on Ethereum.

Right now there's a clear separation of truly private money (cash), spending money (debit/cc), investment (brokerage). Programmable blockchains provide a platform where all of this can exist under one umbrella.

If I want to take out a loan against my assets, there are quite a few options but one of which is MakerDAO. Better accessibility also makes it so that rates are competitive, currently, a loan against ETH is 2% but variable.

In real life application supposing I did this via brokerage there's significant lag time to actually move that money from my brokerage to my ""spending"" accounts. Or from cash into my brokerage accounts. On Ethereum this is instant.

Accessibility to p2p lending in real life isn't that great but on Ethereum I have easy access choices such as Aave, Compound where I can lend my USDC for pretty good rates, ~8% currently, with the obvious risk being maybe the contract is hacked and everything blows up. As a result of this risk we're now seeing both centralized and decentralized insurance options regarding smart contracts such as Opyn. Being able to buy insurance for the ""what if"" scenario eats into your yield but it's a nice option.

If I care about privacy and want the same kind of privacy that cash provides in real life it's very difficult to achieve this in real life. In Ethereum there are projects such as zkDAI and tornado.cash which provide ease of accessibility to privacy.

Programmable money lowers the barrier to entry of competition and definitely will continue to force laws to play catch up as innovation continues to progress very quickly.",2021-01-01 08:25:34

nootropicat,"I think they are in a very bad spot now, as there's no reason to use dai over usdc. Especially borrowing dai is extremely risky, I barely escaped liquidation when it mooned on coinbase to 1.3usdc.  
For some weird reason eth collateral rate is 150% when every defi platform is at 120%-125%. Bad deal from every possible angle. They have some adoption inertia but usdc is taking a bigger and bigger share of the pie. A large part of DAI's demand is 'fake' in the sense that's it's only used to farm (especially CRV).  
Even on eth pairs it was flipped by usdt.  

https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2

In general they were proven incompetent, as their governance structure forces small incremental changes when drastic moves were required. Rather than having a USDC vault at 101% collateral ratio the proper move was to directly sell new DAI for usdc until it's at $1. Makerdao would have a warchest that could then be used to stabilize the price, possibly earning interest on unspent reserves and using that to burn MKR. In the kyc event it would be easy to get rid of USDC even by selling it for eth as a last measure. It's going to be way harder to get rid of the USDC vault without driving DAI wildly off the peg again.",2021-01-01 20:14:22
in_a_land_far_away,"Sure well it depends really who you trust your money with. USDC is backed up by identical dollar amounts locked up in trusted 3rd party accounts and is considered very risk free. However, if the price of the dollar does really collapse in the distant future I would be sceptical if it survives. So short term say 5 years USDC is fine, but DAI is much better in terms of trustless security its quite tricky to explain I will link a youtube video but essentially its a debt that was created by certain erc20 tokens as collateral and held in makerdao vaults gl

At the end no one can complain about being liquidated. It's getting your remaining ether sold for zero that is the problem. 

When black Thursday happened it was estimated people lost 8.25M. Today that ether is worth 75M. Do you think people are just going to sit and let that be?

You bet there will be a waterfall of lawsuits coming towards the Maker Foundation. With these prices a lot of people will find it profitable to go through the trouble and spend in lawyers and arbitration costs.

mexfogel,"There is already an ongoing court case here in San Francisco. It was a class action law suit but it was moved into arbitration. That's a win for the maker foundation because instead of being liable for all 1,000 or more victims at the same time now each person has to bring their own case independently to arbitrate. Not everyone can afford to do so but with current ether prices a lot of people will feel compelled to do so.

It will be up to the judge in the arbitration case to decide if the maker foundation is responsible for any losses. 

They will have to look into the terms of use and see if makerDAO made it super explicitly clear that using the maker dao contact meant a potential loss of 100% of your assets.

Also, they'll look into how the contract was not supposed to allow zero bids. Not only did user lost their collateral completely but also MakerDAO lost 4 million of dollars due to the same auction bid flaw. 

One thing is to use a contract that is risky that can lead to losses and another one is that the contract was flawed and caused losses. 

How come the makerdao printed and sold MKR to repay their own losses yet left its users hanging in the air at a loss for the exact same flaw? The Foundation will say decisions are made by the makerdao decentralized governance but since the flawed contract was written by them It will be up the judge to decide if they are ultimately liable or not.

Regarding the US global jurisdiction i believe it's pretty global and it has a span to all major first world countries. If the arbitration rules against them they will have to pay.

jonaslamis,"The term Freezing Assets is a specific example of ""being able to update the contracts"".  The StakerDAO Governing Council (Olaf, Luke Y, Shaishav, Spencer Noon, and myself) can vote to ""update the contracts"" to any specification that is proposed through governance.  This includes things like: 
- pausing the contracts because there is some sort of bug or hack
- implementing a tax on the vault (currently set at 0%).  Think of this as MakerDAO adjusting their interest rate.
- doing something more substantial like moving all vaults to a FA 2.0 token or changing how the overall system functions based on tickets, privacy, or some other layer 1 upgrade.

An anti-goal is to ""freeze assets"".  But it is necessary to balance security and upgradability against contract control.  We're trying to navigate that at StakerDAO with first the council model, and then evolving to the community controlled model.

For those who have been paying attention to Ethereum based defi, this is the same kind of architecture that Compound and Uniswap have implemented.  Tightly controlled contracts at launch that moved to more decentralized control with the issuance of their governance tokens.",2021-01-05 08:53:17

yahehe,"My interpretation of ""Unrelated Debt-Financed Income"" is there's an implied third party supplying debt to the IRA, basically accessible funds not funded by contributions or gains. So if I wanted to buy a rental property with my LLC and took out a mortgage, or took out a loan to buy even more Eth, those funds would not be tax advantaged.  


With MakerDAO there's not really a third party, you're loaning assets to yourself via a protocol. DAI isn't borrowed from other users, it's created when you open a vault, and it's burned when you repay. You can't withdraw your Eth while it's in the vault without paying back the loan, so in a way you're temporarily *reducing* the value of your IRA. I'm not sure if it would fit the definition of ""acquisition indebtedness"", but I would be very interested to know what an expert has to say. I wonder what this would mean for other DeFi dapps like Compound as well. Definitely a complex space to navigate, I've been thinking about finding a CPA/tax attorney as I'm in a similar boat.  


As an aside, I've started planning for a first house and contemplating taking a $20k loan (me + wife) from my SDIRA, and I realized I could probably do that without losing any gains by opening a CDP.

&gt;Looks like a solid project and it seems that the team has been able to assemble some of the big hitters in the defi space, which is promising for stETH (Lido's eth2.0 derivative) integration in the various defi protocols. I am not so happy about the economics and distribution of the corresponding LDO governance token, as only 36% are allocated to the DAO-controlled treasury. That being said, there is no need to hold the LDO token in order to stake.

&gt;Just a heads-up, there is chatter about a Badger-style targeted airdrop for early adopters. Still early days but might be worth interacting with the protocol in case there is a successful governance vote.

The airdrop is currently being voted on

And you can check if your address is eligible here 

https://github.com/vshvsh/ldo-airdrop/blob/master/snapshot/lido-07a-human-readable-balances.json 

It looks like this first airdrop really only rewards stakers who have taken on additional risk by depositing ETH early on. The cutoff block was around 10 days after genesis. There are however ideas discussed in the governance forum to have a second airdrop with a future cutoff block.

i-love-the-pink-one,"Still learned here, but what is the reason auctions take so long? Surely it would be better to speed up the process to ensure that liquidations occur and are processed in full? That way, keepers can immediately return to the debt auctions and keep the process going in the event of a sharp drop in collateral value.  

For example, if ETH value drops 30-40%, I'd have to imagine there would be a significant number of liquidations to process. If it dropped another 30-40% over a couple of days (please no), shouldn't we be ensuring all the vaults that need to be liquidated are so to maintain the health and confidence of the MakerDao system and the value of Dai?",2021-01-06 19:14:19

keynya,"Here comes a little rant:

Not everything has to be a moonshot in my life (shocking, right). So I was looking at the possibilities using a ""stable"" coin in kind of crypto savings account which returns a few percent interest each year. I love DAI. Unfortunately it is pegged to the devaluing USD. The USD lost over 10% against my native currency (Swiss franc) over the last year. Lending it out on Aave or Compound would make me loose money over time. Even with the more risky yearn DAI vault I would just barely break even. A part of this 10% devaluation against the Swiss franc is due to the Swiss franc increasing in value, but the USD also lost against other major currencies like GBP, JPY etc. So, even for these currencies lending out a USD pegged stable coin on Aave or Compound is not a viable strategy.

Why don't we have proper stable coins in crypto? Something which is stable against inflation and whose price is not controlled by nations and their endless money printing. As far as I remember, MakerDAO initially wanted to build something like that, but they went with a USD pegged stable coin.

Long story short I do not like losing money slowly, so I went for the moonshot again by providing WBTC-ETH liquidity.

Looking forward to the time I can have a savings account using stable coins which actually deserve their name and I can finally get rid of my old school fiat bank account.

If you have good tricks to make a savings account on Ethereum. I'm all ears.",2021-01-07 16:02:19

You serious here? Algoritm is mathematical based. Dai is based on collateralization. It gets it's feed from 14 exchanges, that's how it determines the price of eth. 

 Dai has been here for years FYI. You actually CAN manipulate it if you can manipulate the price of eth, you can then force a collateralization of eth, but that's not an easy feat on itself and the more it gets adopted/used, the less likely that will happen too. 


""What if the algo fucks up"" sounds extremely ignorant by the way. Since it's based on mathematics/code and it's contract is open source afaik. You can audit it yourself if you want and see if you can find a hole. In fact, holes has been found in several smart contracts, including makerdao, and it has been patched up. The contract is open source too, so if you really don't trust it you can audit it yourself. 

Imo what is truly dangerous is trusting a third party with your money. USDT, usdc, all custodian stable coins should be avoided. Only stable coins like dai, based on code should be used/trusted as that is part of the decentralized finance revolution.",2021-01-08 21:04:08

jsibelius,"Yes, one benefit of having custody over your funds is that you can actually *use them* in DeFi and to interact with the whole Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. In fact, once you try it, you will find that it provides incredibly powerful financial instruments. Throw them in MakerDao and you can get a decentralised, permissionless loan. (It seems in the future banks will accept stablecoins like Dai so it might be possible to them buy something directly with it instead of exchanging the dai for USD) I strongly encourage you to check out the whole DeFi space :) You can get mad returns on your ETH.

Another benefit is that you don't have a ""counterparty risk"". This means that Coinbase (or another custodian of funds) being hacked or going down for some reason doesn't mean that you will lose your crypto. However, with more power comes more responsibility - you are now responsible for securing your crypto - you need to own a hardware wallet if you own a large amount to protect yourself from hackers. You need to manage your seed words (the words from which your private key is derived)  so you don't lose the funds.",2021-01-09 16:23:15

You mention however DAI loss of peg, but you present it as if it was a good thing (excess demand) whereas we were all worried about the health of our investment when DAI could not go back to peg after months.

Finally, whales were perhaps worried when they realized that the original, decentralized DAI could never scale. Instead, Maker had to compromise and include custodial assets, which, for some people, was the end of this fantastic experiment because DAI would become partially centralized and censorable.

So overall, while DAI is still thriving, there are some concerns on the long term success of the initiative. Personally, I loved the old DAI (SAI), I am ok to use the new DAI, but I put it on par with USDC now, even lower than USDC, since USDC has more regulatory clarity.",2021-01-10 04:26:14

JustCryptoFun,"Not entirely true:  


""MakerDAO launched with 1,000,000 MKR tokens at its inception. The tokens are created and destroyed under different circumstances. MKR is destroyed when the Maker Protocol’s system surplus exceeds a minimum threshold, resulting in excess Dai being auctioned for MKR that is then destroyed. Inversely, when the Maker Protocol is running a deficit and the system debt exceeds a maximum threshold, **MKR is created** and auctioned for Dai in order to recapitalize the system.""

ethereumflow,Do you know what MakerDAO is?,2021-01-10 13:22:06
Treyzania,"&gt;the same way a program is coded into IOS apps

This is pretty misleading.  The kinds of things you want to build using a smart contract is very specific and you want to go out of your way to minimize the amount of actual code running on the chain.  Smart contracts are relatively useless and you want to shift as much of the logic as possible to the client side, treating contracts on chain as at most basic of a primitive as possible.

In the MakerDAO case, that primitive is fairly sophisticated so there does naturally end up being a lot more logic executing on chain to make it work.

To OP:

Think of contracts executing on chain as programs executing in a trusted fully transparent computer that anyone can pay a small fee to interact with.  You can only interact with contracts through specific interfaces, so you can treat these interfaces and the logic of the contract as trusted and can build more sophisticated systems using these primitives.  Systems like MakerDAO being one example.",2021-01-10 13:28:21

Instead, Maker had to compromise and include custodial assets, which, for some people, was the end of this fantastic experiment because DAI would become partially centralized and censorable.

You should do a better job researching because it's been on the roadmap since day one to include other (also centralised) stablecoins and eventually off-chain assets, which will always require an enforceable legal framework.

I understand a lot of people want a *100%* decentralised, permissionless stablecoin system, who doesn't, but MakerDAO's longterm goals to include off-chain assets eventually makes that impossible.

re76,"Basically the people who do their own research and can understand the implications of a technology like Ethereum have information that the rest of the population might not have.

For example when I read about MakerDAO in 2018 I was beyond excited about the implications. At that point I could understand the implications and make some educated guesses about how it would create immense value. This was information I had that others did not. That’s all I mean when I say information asymmetry.

This time, with a MakerDao CDP I opened last night for my stack, even though it is underwater by several thousand dollars, and even though it is collateralized at 225%, and even though I made this trade just after the monthly high (on its first bounce), I'm not selling.

itovault,"Sometimes an asset could be grandfathered in.  The MakerDAO was afraid the DAI was going to be a security for a long time, but then it turned out to be okay.  Are you mostly afraid the government taking the token from you?  Is that the main blocker for you (e.g. if they solved regulation, you'd buy it immediately).",2021-01-12 14:06:03
BUIDL000,"On open market (exchanges), the peg is maintained by trading bots and traders that believe it should be on peg. Behind open market, within the MakerDAO system, the value of minted DAI tokens are maintained by the automated liquidation system that holds auction allowing bidders to obtain ETH below market value, using DAI, effectively recycling circulating DAI and burn them away, making unbacked debt disappear as the collaterals are released. This internal mechanism gives market participant confidence about the DAI's truly backed, hence they will go out to maintain the peg should there be any deviation. 

When there's not enough market participant actively controlling the peg, the natural supply and demand will overwrite the strength of peg-maintaining traders. 

Example scenario 1: there's an expansion in DEFI requiring larger amount of DAI than the existing circulating DAIs, the unavailability (shortage) of DAI will cause people to name a higher price on DAI to just get them in hands, creating competition with other DAI buyers. 

Example scenario 2: Forget about DAIs, let's say CAD attempt to run fixed exchange rate with USD but offer a much higher saving rate or offer much greater CAD denominated investment opportunity while both countries have similar import/export with each other without trade imbalance. In this case, it will cost Canada central bank a lot of money to maintain the fixed exchange rate unless they stop/limit the inflow of USD into their country. 

Likewise, if Maker governance made the wrong combination of policies, DAI will go off peg too, and it will cost MKR holders money, with the mechanism of printing more MKR or lower reduced MKR token price, or stagnant MKR token price in crypto overall bull market. It's in MKR holder's best interest to come up with policies to maintain the peg so their MKR holdings will worth something. 

If you simply pull a fork without publicly telling people why you should be supported (think Roger Ver and Craig Wright), you won't get people to open up vaults to deposit collateral then print, and you won't get bidders to grab collaterals during liquidation auctions so your plan won't work out.  If the fork you created don't have any traction on the price of your forked MKR and there's not a group of governance people holding your forked MKR with interest in maintaining the peg of forked DAI, it will also collapse rather quickly.",2021-01-12 15:46:46

&gt;DeFi Saver is an advanced management app for decentralized finance protocols and we have built-in service fees for our advanced features. We will list all existing fees per each of our dashboards below.

&gt;**MakerDAO, Compound and Aave dashboards
Standard interactions** (e.g. Add/Withdraw collateral; Borrow/Pay back debt)
have **no service fees.**



&gt;**Advanced interactions** (Boost, Repay, Create leveraged position, Close leveraged position) have a **0.25% service fee** (of the transaction size).


&gt;**Automation adjustments have a 0.3% service fee** (of the transaction size, per automated adjustment).
(Simply having your position Automed and monitored by the Automation system does not include any sort of fee over time.)


&gt;**Loan Shifter**

&gt;Depending on the complexity of the shift you are making, any **existing fees will differ**.

&gt;**Protocol shifts have no service fees**, but do **include a 0.09% Aave flash loan fee**.
&gt;**Collateral and Debt shifts include a 0.25% service fee, as well as a 0.09% Aave flash loan fee.**


&gt;**Exchange**
All token swaps in the separate Exchange **have a 0.125% service fee** (of the transaction size).
Smart Savings dashboard
All options in the Smart Savings dashboard are without any sort of service fee.
The fees collected help us continue and accelerate further DeFi Saver development.

&gt;We will always publicly disclose any changes to existing fees in DeFi Saver in a timely manner.",2021-01-15 01:18:47

AlethiaArete,"People already get liquidated when theres a
crash. As much as its thier fault for not understanding the risks, you dont want liquidations especially since a lot of crypto people dont get finance at all. Having both sides of the equation volatile increases overall risk by 2x at first look.

The worst case is the asset (silver, for instance) skyrockets up 50% as in my example above and the collateral (WBTC, ETH) crashes some 50% (or more) as is known to happen and suddenly you have a 100% swing and everyone with less than 200% collateralization is liquidated.

The way it is with USD is that since USD is whats being measured, only one pole of the equation can swing meaning while you CAN get massive falls in ETH or whatever of 50%+ your not going to get in a situation where your adding another 50%+ to the swing and thus 150% is relatively safe (200%+ is better) and people still get liquidated during the big drops because they go full on risk and leverage to the hilt without realizing risk is risk.

MakerDAO is meant to be stable. That's why they added a ton of collateral types and even stablecoins. There are other platforms that allow for assets like your talking about, MakerDAO doesnt need to do that too.

And honestly in most cases debt is not good. When you use a system like MakerDAO, Nexo, Compound, etc for a loan your locking up between 150%-200% of value that could be earning interest and your paying interest on top of it for 100% of value and then theres gas fees also. Your earning less money taking a loan unless you transfer what you borrowed into an asset and capture a moonshot. I'd rather just buy outright under those terms.

Finally, PAXG looks pretty trustworthy for a crypto. If you want a decentralized version of a metal, than buy it physically and keep it in your house.",2021-01-15 03:01:11

maqstica,"I would prefer to wait until we have a clear date in sight to for the ETH bridge to be completed. But, we are making good progress. Building the ETH-ZIL bridge requires us complete the following sub-projects:  
1. Adding new language constructs to the smart contract language =&gt; This is done.  
2. Writing the cros-chain contracts =&gt; This is done and has been tested as well.  
3. Adding a few new things in the blocks to allow light clients to check transaction data =&gt; This is more or less done but needs testing and integration at the protocol-layer.  
3. Writing a relayer that will pass information from ZIL chain to ETH chain =&gt; This is work in progress but needs 3 to be fully ready  
4. End to end testing  


Once we have all this done, we will have to build some front-end interface for end users.   


The bridge will bring more assets on the ZIL chain such as ETH and other ERC20 tokens. This bridge is somewhat generic, so it can also connect to BTC allowing people to wrap their BTC and bring it on the ZIL chain. Once these assets are on the ZIL chain, they can be used in LP pools on ZILSwap -- a Uniswap-like DEX or can be used as collaterals in Pillar which is similar to MakerDAO. More assets would mean more on-chain transaction volume which would mean more gas paid to the network.

In 2021, we will focus on the following key areas:

1. Dev Tooling and Usability: We developed quite a few toolkits for developers to use but I think we need to add a few more and improve upon what we already have.
2. Governance: So, far we the core development team has been on the driving seat but we plan to change it by providing the community the right tools to do so. Through our staking programme, we are distributing governance tokens aka gZIL to the stakers which can be used to vote on all aspects of the protocol. Just yesterday, we launched a governance portal for gZIL holders to vote on. More will come on this.
3. DeFi dapps: In 2020, with the help of our ecosystem partners, we saw a stablecoin being launched, a DEX, staking and several fungible tokens. More DeFi dapps such as MakerDAO like applications will be launched in 2021. We expect a lot more tokens as well.
4. ETH-ZIL Bridge: We are currently building a bridge between ZIL and ETH. This will bring assets like ETH and other ERC20s on top of Zilliqa including BUSD (Binance USD).
5. Core protocol optimizations: Last but not the least we will continue to improve the platform to increase the throughput and lower the latency.",2021-01-15 23:28:51
AusIV,"You wouldn't really use a smart contract that way.

What you might do is have the employer put the employee's wages into a timelocked escrow contract. If the employee completes their tasks, they can claim the money from the contract. If the employee doesn't show up for work, the employer can intervene and stop the payout.

In this example, it would be possible for the employer to cancel a payout despite the employee doing the work - with several caveats. Since it's happening on a public blockchain, future employees could see that this was a common practice of the employer. Additionally, the employee could see that the money for their wages exists and is allocated to them, so there's no risk that the employer actually doesn't have the money.

More practically though, smart contracts are used for more atomic transactions. With something like MakerDAO or compound, you can collateralize an asset of an established value and borrow another asset against your collateral. If you don't pay back your debt, your collateral gets taken, but nobody is even capable of taking your collateral while you are meeting the terms of the loan. You can also trade digital tokens through smart contracts; you make an offer that you'll pay X units of Token A for Y units of Token B, and someone else can complete that trade, but only under the specific terms spelled out by the contract. Tokens themselves are smart contracts, which have specific rules for token issuance, transfers, etc.

It doesn't totally do away with the need for contracts in the physical world where an employer commits to paying an employee for providing a service that cannot be measured by a smart contract, but it covers off a lot of neat use cases.",2021-01-16 00:30:11

Amrit's response: ""I think the main difference would be what users could do once those tokens are moved from ETH to another network. There has to be a usage for those tokens beyond just trading. On the Zilliqa side, it could be used on ZILSwap to provide liquidity, in Pillar as a collateral or other yield generating products.

everynameitryistak3n,"This is what I was going to say (Celsius or Blockfi).  Loaning DAI on Compound has a variable rate, so it is not always 13%. And, depending on how much you are talking about here, the gas fees for making a vault, generating DAI, and putting it on Compound mean it could take you a couple months just to break-even.

Also, the apr you get for keeping ETH on Celsius is currently 5.5% (5.25% on Blockfi).  Let's say with the makerdao/compound route you maintain a safe 300% collateral.  So you earn 13% on the DAI you borrowed, which is 1/3 the value of your staked ETH.  In terms of the total value of your ETH tied up in it, you are earning 4.33%.

DeviateFish_,"&gt; I'm not sure what prompted you to reply this. I don't disagree with it at all. That's exactly what I meant with the race for position continuing as-is.

I was replying to the ""people don't know what they could pay to still get included"" bit :)  Some people are very aware that they could pay less and still get included, but inclusion isn't what's important to them.

&gt; Sure you can use the median gas price, but it would still be more than you would have needed to pay for inclusion. This is just basic tragedy of the commons.

I don't see how this is a tragedy of the commons situation though.

&gt; Given that it is trivial to prove, please share a link or elaborate on that proof. I fail to see how it doesn't conflict with your earlier statement that ""Basically, fees escalate more quickly under EIP-1559, and are incapable of staying at sustained high levels for as long as they can under the first-price auction, meaning demand spikes are dampened more harshly than they currently are.""

We've had multiple times over Ethereum's history where the transaction pool grows more than twice as fast as the quantity of transactions that get included on the blockchain.  Any time this is the case, even having 2x blocks won't keep up with that level of demand.

Unfortunately, it's not like anyone logs transaction pool statistics.  The closest thing I have for a source for that was when the mempool got flooded to help push the zero-bid liquidations in... MakerDAO, I think it was?

It doesn't conflict with my earlier statement because it's an example of it.  When there are huge spikes in demand like this, an inelastic block size means the spike is over when the backlog is transacted; under EIP-1559, transactions cannot get included until the `basefee` drops to an adequate level.  Given that this requires a reduction in demand (and mining multiple blocks of &lt; 1x throughput), I suspect this means that spikes are stretched over a long period, during which time *only* the highest-paying transactions can be included, even if there is available space.

&gt; How does it make it more expensive to end users? Worst case (spikes of &gt;2x demand), we reduce to the first-price auction system that we currently have.

The cost of inclusion goes up during periods of large demand, and require a ""cooling down"" period before a lower cost of inclusion is achieved.  In the first-price model, the spike is done when all of the high-paying transactions are included, which means the very next blocks can be full of lower-paying ones, without having to wait for `basefee` to decline far enough to include them.

In order to compensate for this, users will have to pay more, on average, to meet the bar for inclusion.

In light of the above, I'm not sure you can actually completely separate ""inclusion"" and ""position"", given that ""inclusion"" is just ""position"" with respect to blocks, rather than position within a block.",2021-01-18 13:56:26

There will always be a market for instant and feeless transactions.... I think that market can then be segmented into USD vs. non-USD. Nano is competing for the latter. As the US continues to print USD, the market for the latter continues to grow.

2. Community - many here think Ethereum is the ultimate chain, so there may be difficulty persuading some that bridging or a full migration is necessary",2021-01-18 19:07:24
richards_86,"In a period where there is more potential for upward price action, I'd be looking at leveraging the ETH I have to purchase more ETH. There are a variety of ways to do so, but the one I like is using MakerDao's vaults. Now, with that being said it does require a little more ETH than doing something on a more centralized platform as transaction fees can be a bit of a bite but in the grand scheme of things, it wouldn't matter if the leverage is deployed at the right time and managed effectively.

Essentially the process would be:

\- Open MakerDao ETH-A vault (or ETH-B if you don't mind a higher fee for slightly more leverage | you can also do wBTC and a bunch of other collaterals)

\- Lock your ETH in- Mint a DAI (a loan to yourself)

\- Swap DAI for ETH- Lock ETH into the vault

When it comes time to close your leveraged position, with enough price action up you'll be able to pay the stability fee and outstanding DAI balance with a fraction of the ETH you bought on borrowed money. What I like best about this approach is that you're dealing in DAI and your collateral of choice, no other side token hustle.",2021-01-19 03:47:14

pietjepuk_,"&gt; We've had multiple times over Ethereum's history where the transaction pool grows more than twice as fast as the quantity of transactions that get included on the blockchain. Any time this is the case, even having 2x blocks won't keep up with that level of demand.

&gt; Unfortunately, it's not like anyone logs transaction pool statistics. The closest thing I have for a source for that was when the mempool got flooded to help push the zero-bid liquidations in... MakerDAO, I think it was?

&gt; It doesn't conflict with my earlier statement because it's an example of it. When there are huge spikes in demand like this, an inelastic block size means the spike is over when the backlog is transacted; under EIP-1559, transactions cannot get included until the basefee drops to an adequate level. Given that this requires a reduction in demand (and mining multiple blocks of &lt; 1x throughput), I suspect this means that spikes are stretched over a long period, during which time only the highest-paying transactions can be included, even if there is available space.

I'm sorry. Is this the ""trivial proof"" you alluded to? It does not really look like a proof to me, let alone trivial to perform. You're saying that if would have history of the entire mempool (and magically somehow know how actors would increase/decrease their gas prices under different circumstances), we could prove that EIP-1559 does not help. Foregoing the proof, I would've expected you to at _least_ run some ""trivial"" simulations modelling the behavior you mention, and showing that EIP-1559 is worse (or not better) than first-price auctions.",2021-01-19 05:35:50

Revanchist1,"ATH today! I can feel it in my bones! 


All this consolidation near the ATH makes me feel more comfortable that we won't just dip when we hit ATH and might perform similar to BTC and blow past all time high with a minimal dip. 


ETH price is important in the long run. I made a post before where I said it's All or Nothing. If Ethereum accomplishes its goal/aim, it WILL have a market cap in the trillions. The price of ethereum is liquidity for the system - Economic bandwith. It allows more things to be done on the network. 

Ethereum is so young and all the applications that have been developed already is mind-blowing. A few years ago, I could not imagine half the thing we have today. What are we going to see 5+ years from now? I know new applications will be developed but I don't know what they will be. So far everything has been somewhat similar to what we have today with traditional finance. But we are already seeing applications stray from their traditional counterparts. And the fact that systems can be freely be built on top of one another is only going to accelerate these developments.

There will be pillars/supporting structures in Ethereum that will be worth holding. MakerDao and Uniswap come to mind. These two support structures have allowed so many new applications to be built. Synthetix and Aave also come to mind. They are pillars that will further be developed upon by other applications.

Keep an eye out for new applications that create new ""support structures"" that allow new functions that have never been done before. Makerdao with Dai - stablecoin, Aave with flash loans, Synthetix with Synthetic Assets, Uniswap and their AMM.

Currently a small blockchain called Near Protocol has been attracting Chainlink, 1inch, Balancer and MakerDao to build on them because they are a shared blockchain, can help them ease congestion and will help them prepare on how to build a compostable system on a shared blockchain similar to ETH 2.0.

FidelHimself,"Simply put, a DAO is a way to organize around a common purpose. The first DAO was MakerDAO and their purpose is to lend dollars, accepting Ethereum (a cryptocurrency) as collateral. 

A DAO makes up it's own governance model depending on the participants and the mission. [Curve.fi](https://Curve.fi) provides liquidity for large trades to make them less expensive. Token holders recieve the profits proportionate to their stake and vote on the general direction of the DAO.

We do this in a permission-less fashion, meaning any child with funds and proper knowledge can interact without a bank or license and begin earning money.  Individuals interact directly with the protocol so their is are no middlemen. There are software developers who code the new features of the DAO but nothing is commited to the blockchain without a vote from the DAO. Said programmers are paid by the DAO which is all visible on a public blockchain.

By comparison, we don't even apply blockchain to traditional government voting which is criminal imo.

Anyway, you apply a DAO to a traditional HOA and you have basically what I'm advocating for. HOAs usually cover basic maintenance and/or security for a community but I'm suggesting that they provide basically everything the traditional governments provide today. In this way we don't have to all live under each other's rules. My Capitalist community can be a quarter mile from a Communist community so long as both communities have voluntary participants. How much conflict would this solve today?

Socialists could form their own DAO with a token that re-bases or redistributes the entire token supply over night for example. Or a less extreme example could be Socialists only except CommieCoin and you can only get CommieCoin by surrendering privately owned means of production.

nikola_j,"Hey u/oakridgefarm and u/Mkkoll.

Automation for MakerDAO runs on Maker price oracles and your configurations. Regardless of current market prices, the boosts (and repays) will happen based on the price in the Maker protocol as that is what affects your ratio.

As of now, Boosts happen only based on the current price, not nextn one. So only once the next price becomes the current, live price.

That means that a boost will happen even if the market price potentially went lower than what the Maker oracle updated to.

Next price is only considered for Repays, where an Emergency Repay will be triggered when a next price gets scheduled that pushes your ratio less than 10% above the liquidation ratio for the used collateral.

And the next oracle price is on chain, too, it also goes through the OSM.",2021-01-20 21:23:25

FaceDeer,"If literally *none* of them switch over, then the new fork never gets going and the old fork remains as-is.

This is pretty unlikely, though. Even if miners organize and a large number decide to remain on the old fork, some number will switch to the EIP-1559 fork instead. This would result in a contentious fork, with both sides continuing to run in a similar manner to Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

At that point the users will decide which chain they prefer. It's unlikely that the result will be ""both"", they'll pick one or the other en masse (since much of Ethereum's value these days comes from network effects - if only one chain has a functioning MakerDAO, for example, lots of other dapps will only function well on that chain).

This will result in one of the chains having tokens with value similar to Ether's current value and the other chain having tokens worth a lot less. The one with high-value tokens will be able to support a lot of miners, the one with low-value tokens will only be able to support a small number of miners. Market forces will drive the miners to the high-value chain - those who refuse to follow the market will hemorrhage money.

So if it's looking like there's going to be a contentious fork there may be a couple of days of rough markets while this all gets sorted out, but I expect in the end the user-preferred chain will continue as if there hadn't been a contentious fork in the first place and the user-dispreferred chain will remain as an irrelevant minor coin nobody in particular uses.

Given how popular EIP-1559 seems to be with users and developers, I expect that'll be the chain that survives. It may not pay miners as well as it did before EIP-1559, but it'll be preferable to not being paid at all and so miners will mine it.

greengenerosity,"Simplest explanation for why some legitimate crypto company complying with the laws and regulations would launch their own stablecoin is just the publicity and prestige since the coin in volume and marketcap becomes a proxy for the trust of the actual company, the USDC web page starts out with how it is a Circle / Coinbase partnership. I don't know of any other direct financial reasons why they would do it, I don't think they have any income from the interest of the cash reserves.  


The people behind DAI get prestige and influence and it is a proof of concept from the makerdao organization. It is the smallest of the big coins despite being the most crypto with supposed provable collateralization.  


I know Binance does not fit in your question, but it is easy to see that ""Binance USD"" is basically advertisement for their exchange and a partnership with a company called PAXOS (Which has their own stablecoin called ""Paxos Standard"") PAXOS advertises three way 1:1 conversion between BUSD/PAX/USD and advertises itself as a way to exit crypto through stablecoin-to-wire transfers.  


Stablecoins themselves let people who want to exit the price of ETH do it without having to go to a centralized exchange. The only way to stay in crypto while not risking a IOU on a exchange at a fixed price is to hold the private keys of a stable coin, stablecoin-collapse or frozen-address risk only. Stablecoins does not make it easier to enter crypto, but it is supposed to make it easier to exit with less KYC/AML by sending the stablecoins to some service that then does a wire transfer.  


The potential minuscule upside for non-criminals and crime victims of regulated stablecoins like USDC is that they can freeze coins that are stolen/scammed/involved in crime, Circle will freeze any address that law enforcement requests them to as a example.",2021-01-24 06:36:50
MrMoustacheMan,"So there will definitely be [CBDCs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp) coming in the near term, but as the name implies they are not decentralized.

imo the issue with most crypto is that, even if they're satisfactorily decentralized, they are treated more like speculative assets, and the volatility may not make them attractive as a currency (though they are divisible). While BTC was supposed to realize the cypherpunk dream of ecash per the whitepaper, it's transaction fees and confirmation times make that untenable so it is now considered more attractive as a sore of value akin to e-gold.

Proponents of some projects like Nano I think are more optimistic that near instantaneous transactions and low fees make it more viable as a currency, but I'm not well versed enough to argue the point there.

CuriousDetective0,"It turns out MakerDAO vaults don't issue a token. They issue you a CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) which contains your tokens, you can draw dai against it and you can pull your collateral out of it. Nobody else can do that, your are technically still in possession of it. 

In order for it to be an exchange doesn't some other party need to receive your tokens and give you something in exchange?

In MakerDAO the minimum collateralization ratio for AAVE is 175% (so a maximum \~57% LTV), while in Aave v2 the maximum LTV (or collateral factor) is 50%.",2021-01-29 02:19:16
Neophyte-,"yeah this already existts actually synthetix has already tokenised some etfs, maybe some more.

how it works under the hood, not sure. you would need price oracles like in makerDaO to price DAI. i guess chainlink could be used. that said tracking a stock / index is different to tracking USD for decentralised stableccoins because if you say tokenise TSLA you would need to provide some way for settlement i.e. buying / selling. this again would need to be done via the oracle as its outside the blockchain.

honestly i wouldnt touchc this products with a 10 foot pole. just open up a brokerage account. but yes i see the point about trading commodities / stocks in a censorship resistant fashion. that said if stock xyz is banned on all real brokerage exchanges. how could blockchain possibly gain exposure to the stock? perhaps if the company issued their equity on blockchain. which then would remove the need for collateral to represent synthetic assets like in synthetix. 

a stock if issued on a permissionless blockchain could just be represented as an ERC20 token on eth for e.g.",2021-01-29 04:50:15
intersecting_lines,"i would start looking into how Ethereum works and then into DeFi

bitcoin is popular because it's trusted and it works. It's simple as hell though, basically it's just a ledger that is not owned by 1 person (a central bank) but by everybody who participates in said network

Ethereum is a base layer upon which decentralized applications can be built on top of. Start researching coins like MakerDAO, Synthetix, AAVE, UNISWAP. That is where the future is heading",2021-01-29 09:31:22

socketshot,"With the greatest respect you don't have a clue what you're talking about. The entire point of algorithmic stablecoins is that they don't require collateral. The entire point of algo-stables is that they are decentralised and uncensorable in comparison to the centralised stablecoins like Tether or USDC. They use game theory incentive mechanisms to encourage network participants to keep the price at peg. A good example of this is the coupon model in DSD. To date - they've been quite terrible experiments, only benefitting the rich. However as with all technology, iterations are required.

&gt; Stablecoins are the leaders?

You've completely missed my point here. You need to look into MakerDAO &amp; Dai to understand what I'm talking about. Decentralised Finance on Ethereum required stablecoins for it to work. People can't engage in financial activities and the associated risks of liquidation if the system is backed by volatile assets. This is where collateralised debt positions come into the picture. I asked you in my previous reply to explain if you understood this and you conveniently ignored it. This is an area for you to further your knowledge. Remember as I said, only the wise succeed here.",2021-01-30 00:52:28

socketshot,"The point of MakerDAO is that it allows people to create stable assets out of volatile assets. This is achieved by opening what is called a ""collateralised debt position"". 

- A user deposits or ""collateralises"" some of their own assets into a Maker vault (eg 10 Eth @ $1300 per Eth). 
- The user then has a balance of 10 Eth in their maker vault which they can use to mint Dai. 
- The protocol requires all minted Dai to be ""over collateralised"". This means for the 10 Eth in the vault you can only mint at most 5 Eth worth of Dai (aka 200% collateralisation).
- The user now has $6500 worth of Dai which they can pay back at any time to get their 10 Eth back.
- If the price of Eth was ever to fall below $650, the users collateralised position would be liquidated. This is the point of the over collateralisation requirement - it gives the user breathing room on the underlying volatile asset.

This approach to stablecoins falls under the category of ""collateralised stablecoins' and I believe the above explains your question about ""soft-pegging"", collateralisation = soft pegging.
I would also group RSR in this category, although their product is designed with very different use cases to Dai.

The 2 other types of stablecoin are 1-1 backed such as Tether and USDC, and algorithmic stablecoins as explained previously.",2021-01-30 01:46:56

i-love-the-pink-one,"Can anyone recommend projects on various test networks to try out?  

I decided that, seeing as I hold Zkswap tokens (which I purchased because I was looking for a random moonshot in which to put $100 of ETH), I should do some more research into the token. Given my limited information I started with (medium and cointelegraph articles written by Zkswap themselves) as well as their social feeds, I thought it best to try it out on Ropsten. Now, I haven't tried Loopring yet (as I've been saying I would for the past few days) but if the experience is similar to what I've tried tonight....  

Damn! Layer 2 exchanges are awesome! Transactions are cheap as chips, basically instant and it's all so smooth! I'm learning about how quickly and easily I can transfer my tokens and safely, cheaply and quickly swap them for others. I'm also beginning to learn about providing liquidity as an investment strategy, which means I understand a little bit more about Yearn.Finance and Curve. Maybe I'll take a dip on those platforms in the next few weeks.  

Just quickly, can anyone recommend any other test network dapps that I can try out to learn? If rather try stuff that doesn't make me want to cry when I look at fees.wtf .  

Its so much fun actually using this stuff instead of just holding or trading! I feel like I did when I discovered MakerDAO and SAI for the first time, or when I looked into Enzyme.finance . There's so much on offer!",2021-01-30 22:20:46
