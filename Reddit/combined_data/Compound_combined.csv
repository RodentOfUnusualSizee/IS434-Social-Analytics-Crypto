I really love the concept here and think it’s very clever. What I’m struggling with is how Compound makes money. What is the revenue model for them? I can’t see why VCs would invest in them if there is no revenue potential.

USDC: 8.74% supply, 11.11% borrow

USDT: 13.67% supply, 16.56% borrow

My question then is what is stopping anyone from borrowing a significant amount of USDC, trading it near 1:1 for USDT, then putting that USDT down as supply? They would earn the difference in interest rate (13.67-11.11=2.56% in this case) virtually for free, right? I'm a believer in efficient markets, so this really doesn't make sense to me.

When we are talking about the governance of a money market this is to be expected, but has anyone else thought there should be a way for smaller COMP holders to have more collective power?

What if someone were to create a DAO in which smaller COMP holders would delegate to, and whenever a proposal is up for vote, COMP holders in this DAO would vote which way they want the DAO to vote (potentially 51% or higher).  If this gained enough traction, a ""public interest"" non-profit DAO could potentially be among the top addresses by voting weight.  

We could even implement some semblance of yield farming, by incentivizing people to delegate COMP and vote in the DAO by issuing some sort of DAO governance token.    

Sure this idea needs some fleshing out, but I'd be willing to work on it with anyone else that is interested.

The more value locked on Secret Network - Ethereum bridge, the better anonymity for its users. ERC20 pools with more than $100K TVL will be eligible for SCRT bridge rewards.

I have a wallet on Coinbase and a wallet in ledger.  The coinbase wallet currently says tether is earning 2.5% apr.  The Ledger wallet says Tether is earning 1.67% APY.

Based on this, I put some USDT in coinbase a few weeks ago, and it tells me that I've earned $0.13 in that time.

yesterday I decided to do the same in Ledger.  I wanted to make my coins more secure so I moved some tether into ledger, and set up the lending contract.  After 24 hours, it's already earned $0.25 in interest.  

Why are they earning such different rates?  Why is the lower APY actually earning more interest?"

I've been using crypto for a little under a month now, and I've been trying to use Compound Finance. I know that to transfer the Ethereum based tokens, I need some Eth to pay for gas, but It seems to be unrealistically high.  
I have only seen gas prices reach around $8 at the highest whenever I've been transferring tokens, but using compound on the Exodus wallet, it wants me to use over $160 of Eth at the current market price.  
The exact words are 

 A minimum balance of 0.12375 ETH is needed to use this App.   
 Exchange for or deposit at least 0.11017157 ETH into your wallet and then try again 

This is even more confusing to me because in the official Exodus tutorial, the guy says that he usually has around $20 worth of Eth.

Why is it all so much more expensive compared to regular Eth based transfers?"

Peanut joins forces with Curve!! This is mega bullish guys!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/l1b3qw/peanut_joins_forces_with_curve_this_is_mega/,Useful_Platform_,1,2021-01-20 23:15:02,0,/r/Compound/comments/l1b3qw/peanut_joins_forces_with_curve_this_is_mega/,,"Peanut will connect its protocol to Curve to balance price of trading pairs. In addition to the unique formula for equalizing the value of tokens in Curve trading pairs (more information in this article), Peanut will create for Curve users an additional layer of protection from slippage and from skewing the tokens value.

Due to the high volatility of the crypto asset market, the lack of unified trading platforms, as well as dynamic changes in supply/demand for a particular asset, crypto traders are quite often exposed to slippage as one of the negative factors.

Curve protects its users from slippage by using a unique formula for determining the value of assets in trading pairs. Additionally, Peanut protocol will integrate with Curve which will result in reducing negative effect from slippage and mitigating risks of impermanent loss. Due to the system of a two-level pool of assets operated by Peanut, placing even a very large order will have only temporary instant effect. When large buy/sell orders are executed, the Peanut pool automatically and simultaneously makes the corresponding deal on two levels, that is, on other DEX and CEX, and provides additional liquidity for specific trading pair. As a result, slippage in trading pair disappears.

At the moment, the Peanut team is winding up with integrational settings for Curve trading platform. In a few weeks Curve will be connected to Peanut protocol on the regular basis.

Speaking about Curve, Alex Momot, CEO at Remme and founder of Peanut said:

“The main challenge for us during the testing period is to check the ability to resist one-block flash loan attacks. Successful results will significantly improve AMM mechanics and will give much more confidence to all market participants.”

&gt;*Michael Egorov, CEO of Curve, said:*  
*“Balancing prices by exploiting liquidity on both DEX and CEX platforms is really a good idea. And also very promising. It will be very interesting to see the results of Peanut testing on Curve.”*

Peanut solves existing problems inherent in both centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Namely, the loss of customers as a result of slippage. And we are doing everything we can to improve our algorithms.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV](https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV)

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:

For example, one user withdrew [65k COMP](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb6d5122afe04a9905adc5de7f708cabc5821e65fb7d6f0bfd571d35b1ddab7f2) and another one [30k COMP](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbc246c878326f2c128462d08a0b74048b1dbee733adde8863f569c949c06422a)

Now the smart contract is empty and I and other honest users cannot withdraw the accrued COMP tokens I had there because the contract is empty. 

Meanwhile, the developers are saying ""Users don't have to worry about their funds; the only risk is that you (or another user) receives an unfairly large quantity of COMP."" and ""Please return it to the Compound Timelock.  Keep 10% as a white-hat.  Otherwise, it's being reported as income to the IRS, and most of you are doxxed.""

It looks like this new finance paradigm is run by morons and scammers.  Just buy shithereum with real money so you could pay $100 for a single contract interaction, and then they ""update"" the contract and some other developers empty the smart contract and you get nothing in return while miners and developers and scammers get rich."

Full proof of my earnings &amp; payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV](https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV)

You will receive most earnings in BTC (over $200). There are over 50 other coins (ETH, ADA, BNB, MATIC and many more) to earn but BTC brings the best ratio. Compound is available too :)

How does it work:  
DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in over 50 coins. I only do payouts with the coins featured to be paid out to Coinbase. Therefore I don't pay additional fees.  
How are you able to get the best possible earnings on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

So there are many lenders supplying crypto assets with some of them using the supply as collateral to borrow assets. However, with some of the supplied assets lent out, isn't there a shortage in the Compund protocol compared to the supply balances of the users?

Consider this example: 

* User A supplies 10000 DAI without borrowing anything
* Another user B supplies some ETH to get a 10000 DAI loan

So with the 10000 DAI loan of user B there now should be a supply of 10000 DAI and a total borrow of 10000 DAI, resulting in 0 actual DAI remaining in Compounds smart contract.

Now what happens if user A decides to withdraw their 10000 DAI? Ther aren't any DAI in the contract, are they?

I get that there are the ETH from user B as collateral, but swapping those to DAI would be pretty destructuve to user B.

How does Compound handle this situation?"

Earning Report: I earned $573.14 worth of Crypto in 10 months of DutchyCorp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/qpddnl/earning_report_i_earned_57314_worth_of_crypto_in/,Klaasiker,1,2021-11-08 21:14:09,30,/r/Compound/comments/qpddnl/earning_report_i_earned_57314_worth_of_crypto_in/,," 

So I tested the Faucet DutchyCorp and will share my experience with all of you.  
Most important: I earned **$573.14** in **ten months**.  
Time spent: About 5min per day while watching TV/Netflix or Youtube.  
Full proof of my earnings &amp; payouts directly to Coinbase: [https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv](https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv)

You will receive most earnings in BTC (over $200). There are over 55 other coins (ETH, ADA, BNB, MATIC and many more) to earn but BTC brings the best ratio.  
Link: [https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=SLimon)

How does it work:  
DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in over 50 coins. I only do payouts with the coins featured to be paid out to Coinbase. Therefore I don't pay additional fees.  
How are you able to get the best possible earnings on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

I’ve been thinking of a plan to help me accumulate as much ETH as possible. 


So I spend a large portion of my income on rent every month. If I could just spend it on Eth, I’d have so much by now. 

I have this plan where instead of spending my fist directly on my rent, I can instead supply it as collateral ETH on compound, loan it to myself as USDC, Convert that USDC back into fiat and pay my rent.

This is not fool proof, especially because I can only borrow less than 80% of my collateral and it’s possible for the price of ETH to crash which could liquidate the money I have in collateral. 

If the price of ETH increases in the long run, I could use these gains to pay back the money I’m borrowing and keep the profit from accumulating all this ETH. 

What do you guys think?"

Full proof of my earnings &amp; payouts directly to Coinbase: [https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv](https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv)

Is it worth the time? In my eyes yes.

You will receive most earnings in BTC (over $200). There are over 50 other coins (ETH, ADA, BNB, MATIC and many more) to earn but BTC brings the best ratio.Link: [https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=SLimon)

How does it work:  
DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in over 50 coins. I only do payouts with the coins featured to be paid out to Coinbase. Therefore I don't pay additional fees.How are you able to get the best possible earnings on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

I'm new to Defi and fascinated by the idea of combining decentralized governance and finance together. I've been reading Compound whitepaper and docs but I'm still confused by a few questions and hoping I could find answers here so I can confidently make my investment decisions.

1. The interests of borrowing and lending are different, which is source of profit in traditional banking industry. But where does this ""profit"" go in Compound protocol? Does it go to the company (Compound lab) or go to some sort of reserves/ treasury?
2. What other usage does Comp token have aside from governance? Correct me if I'm wrong, Comp token does not share the profit from interest rate spread. Besides, only a very small percentage token holders participate the governance/voting. So there should be a continuous selling pressure. But what maintains it price? 

Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!"

DutchyCorp experience: Earned $605 worth of Crypto in 11 months,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/rkmojf/dutchycorp_experience_earned_605_worth_of_crypto/,Klaasiker,1,2021-12-20 20:56:50,0,/r/Compound/comments/rkmojf/dutchycorp_experience_earned_605_worth_of_crypto/,," 

So I am sharing my experience of DutchyCorp.

*What is DutchyCorp?*  
DutchyCorp is a Faucet which runs automatically and earns you Crypto the passive way.

*How much did you earn?*  
I earned **$605.16** in **eleven months**.

*How much time did you spend?*  
Time spent: Max. 5min per day while watching TV/Netflix or Youtube.

*Can you prove that you really earned $605?*  
For sure. Here you can see all of my earnings &amp; payouts directly to Coinbase: [https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv](https://imgur.com/a/R895hgv)

*Is it worth the time?*  
In my eyes yes.

*Which currencies do they pay out?*  
You will receive most earnings in BTC (over $200). There are over 50 other coins (ETH, ADA, BNB, MATIC and many more) to earn but BTC brings the best ratio.  
Link to DutchyCorp: [https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=SLimon)

*How does it work?*  
DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in over 50 coins. I only do payouts with the coins featured to be paid out to Coinbase. Therefore I don't pay additional fees.How are you able to get the best possible earnings on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

*How did you make your payouts?*  
I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

he hospitality industry is evolving as one of the largest industries in the world. It is an excellent example of an industry that grew in response to the growth of customer needs. Your aim as a hotelier is to stay on top of today’s market by improving service and efficiency.  A hotel must adapt its services to the changing needs and lifestyles of its customers to increase their loyalty and retention. In recent years, hospitality and technology have been the primary agitators to help hoteliers innovate their service offerings and deliver added value to their guests. 

With the developing value of business events – which with latest studies showed that it generated $10.3 trillion in direct spending. The hospitality industry can no longer rely on good meals and clean rooms to attract guests. Hotels and large venues started to compete to stand out by offering a unique experience.

I've been using the card for more than a year already and made way more from the cashback and Spotify rebates than my initial investment!

This is a very big company: recently [they started a huge ad campaign starring Matt Damon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8) and they [bought the naming rights to the Staples Center in L.A. for 20 years](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples).

The Ruby Steel card tier offers a **$25 instant bonus, free Spotify and 2% cashback on all purchases,** and a nice premium metal card, for €350 worth of CRO coins that you need to hold for 6 months. After this time you're free to sell them again (or keep if you want to retain the card benefits).

You can easily **recoup the initial cost within a year** and after that you can still use the benefits.

If you want to try it out for free first, you can also opt for the **free** Midnight Blue card which has no fee and **1% cashback** :)

**Important note:** you don't need to put crypto on the card, you can just load it with Euro or USD and spend it!

Earn $30 of crypto by depositing $50 on Cake Defi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/rqcukr/earn_30_of_crypto_by_depositing_50_on_cake_defi/,Klaasiker,1,2021-12-28 18:24:55,0,/r/Compound/comments/rqcukr/earn_30_of_crypto_by_depositing_50_on_cake_defi/,," 

Cake Defi is a decentralized finance platform based in Singapore, utilising the Defichain blockchain which is secured by anchoring with the Bitcoin blockchain. Cake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50 of crypto. This does not require any additional transactions or trades, just a deposit which you will be able to instantly withdraw if you need to.

Cake Defi is currently best accessed via the website, although mobile applications are being developed and are currently undergoing beta testing.

[Referral-Link to get the $30 Bonus](https://app.cakedefi.com/?ref=571562)

[Non-Ref Link (no Bonus)](https://app.cakedefi.com/)

1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link to ensure you receive the bonus
2. Verify your identity using photo ID. This used to take up to 72 hours, but is much quicker now
3. Deposit $50 of cryptocurrency. There is a limited number of cryptocurrencies that can be used and if you are planning to withdraw your deposit instantly I would strongly recommend DASH as it has the lowest withdrawal fees. Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.
4. Once your deposit has been received, your sign-up bonus of $30 will be paid into your account instantly as DFI. This will be staked and locked for 180 days however it does earn interest during that time, currently around **35% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.
5. The DASH, or whatever you deposited, can be immediately withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account.
6. After 180 days, withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued.

I have been really impressed with Cake and Defichain as a whole. I invested a bit more than the $50 and due to Liquidity Mining it already gave a nice bonus which I really apprechiate. I am now using the Freezer on Cake Defi to stake more DFI over a much longer timeframe than the initial 6 months as the APY is fantastic, the longer timeframes gives discounts on fees and I can see the value of the coin appreciating over the next few years.

Cake do have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools or via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.

For anybody struggling with buying DASH, it can be purchased at Bitpanda as previously mentioned, but also Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex and Kucoin. Deposit/withdrawal fees and methods across these exchanges vary.

firstly, I see a lot of questions about fees.

yes! the fees to set up are Kind of absurd, but think of it as a start up investment.   


the first fees come in the form of letting comp use your wallet. This is usually a few bucks.

Compound and other liquidity protocols reward borrows and lenders in the form of great rates and token. by removing banks as middlemen this is possible. It’s literal socialism and libertarianism in harmony. Anyways,

While in theory it would be awesome to collect interest on my $50 deposit of liquidity, in reality it’s not because the price of gas/eth for transactions right now. what is $50 really going to do to help borrowers? Nothing, so if it does nothing for the system why would it do anything for you?

The price of the smart contracts is a bitter pill to swallow if you’re fucking with less than I’d say $500-1000. depending on the coin, as a deposit OR a loan. I’ve seen it as low as 17 and as high as 70 depending on the traffic and gas rates. 

eth Gas station is helpful, but not as much as I hoped. You should still use the site to huge the traffic at least. Works better to see if I should hold off a transaction rather than guide me on the cost I pay at that moment.

at first I couldn’t really see why I would want to borrow, but it’s incredible Really. Banks usually lend out your money you deposit into them at absurd interest rates, shave a sliver off the top for you and take shit tons of cash in fees from borrowers. In defi utopia land, I can now borrow against my own liquidity and speculate on other coins on other exchanges, short all kinds of coins, it’s amazing. Using aave, which is similar to comp, I shorted 0x tokens and it was a glorious feeling. Had it not been for the smart contract fees I’d have done a lot better than break even. Was super fun to do, and had I just added a zero of two to my original amounts, I’d have made a pretty penny.

&amp;#x200B;

so the next big thing is what I suppose everyone refers to as liquidity mining, which is my new favorite term and can’t help but rofl every time I hear it. I’m a long time crypto user but only just getting back into it heavily after a few years and defi gives me the tingles.

after staring at these interest rates for 10 hours straight I realized I can borrow money off my deposit it back into the system and make out with a net gain despite the interest I pay for the loan. The comp token basically incentivizes this. I basically am being incentivized to deposit, borrow, depsosit, borrow. The net gain of interest and comp token is greater than the sole interest rate of my initial deposit  


Why the fuck would I not do this? The banks loan at money they create out of thin air via fractional reserve banking, why can’t I? Feels illegal because in the traditional world, these incredible schemes and maneuvers are only accessible to the pink shorts Georgetown fucks. The empowerment defi gives to the little guy is pretty amazing. This shit is revolutionary, folks.  


I can now use my credit card to pay for living expenses while never digging into my savings aka comp deposit. by borrowing off the deposit and earning comp reward I ultimately pay nothing for these comp earning loans and maintain my initial balance while earning interest. My initial deposit is never being interrupted. Totally different than when I’m poor and have to break into my savings for groceries. I use The comp loan to pay off my Credit card, and keep earning points on my card as well, lol. Credit cards are like 20-30% interest. A comp loan for eth is 2%, and like 8% for DAI. I can trade either to Coinbase and exchange for usd. Keep in mind the fees though. With half my initial comp deposits I can borrow both eth or DAI and use the balance of the two to mitigate my collateral ratio from falling into liquidation threshold

&amp;#x200B;

I know I’m missing a few other things so if I remember or if anyone asks, I’ll follow up.

&amp;#x200B;

by the way, I know nothing about finance. I’m a poor Jazz musician and I love to play magic cards. The parallels between magic the gathering and crypto Are Astonishing to say the least. Game theory, mt.gox, immutability, Turing completes, etc.

i use my friend’s Success at Friday night magic (precovid) to better understand the way I think comp is incentivizing me to use it:

my friend is really good at magic, He almost never loses at tournaments. similar to the way a day trader in crypto or finance can be good at trading and netting mostly gains, my friend just wins at Friday night magic against whomever he plays. His knowledge of the game is thorough, and can confidently navigate his way into in serial wins.

&amp;#x200B;

i think comp allows it’s users that have made deposits to “go infinite” in the way my friend has at his local game store.

My friend made the initial investment of buying himself a good deck. Coupled with his confidence in His ability to win, and his statistical history of doing so, he wins more store credit than it costs to enter tournaments. he continues to accrue reward for his ability to make the right plays, and decisions in the form of store credit, and since he almost never loses. He reinvests his store credit into reserve list dual lands (will never be printed again/fixed supply I.e. another bitcoin/gold parallel) and as a result he continues to accrue huge amounts of profits based off good plays and good plays alone.

so basically comp opens up a world of possibility to working people (rich folks always had this opportunity) who may have the talent to make wise crypto trades that now can borrow off their initial investment when they want to pay for something instead of cracking open your savings. It’s brilliant.   


I know this is what yield farming and liquidity mining is, but I think people are missing the implications of this 80 and how revolutionary this is. This can literally help poor people get out of debt, since no banks are squeezing the system dry, and interest rates are being redistributed in a fair way. I’m worried the powers that be are not happy that automation will replace bankers before farmers

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: if your friend asked for some $ to pay for their bills and offered you interest, would you offer them $12 or the $500 they really need? Approach compound with this mindset. Gas is pricey, make it worth it."

Essentially, is Tether the best crypto to currently stake as it has a combined APY of 16.38%?

Also, for voting it wants to charge me a few $ worth of ETH, is this a 1-time transaction or every time I want to vote?   
And lastly, I see people are encouraging putting in piles of money due to gas fees. Would I still profit in the long run (6+ months) if I start out with around $100 worth?

Fairly new to Comp and its uses. I decided I was going to supply Comp with 100 Dai. I connected my Coinbase wallet and also bought like $20 of eth for gas. I started the transaction on the comp dapp and confirmed the transaction in my wallet completely. Cool, so gas money was taken and the transaction was a success according to etherscan.io. I have yet to receive the 100 Dai I supplied to the comp app. I checked my wallet and there is no recent transaction history for my Dai wallet... but definitely is for my Eth. Did something happen or am I missing something here? Do I need to wait longer? I'm so confused...I feel like I got my gas money stolen...

My first ever post on Reddit here. I was wondering if anyone could explain to me what I should expect from Metamask after I submitted duplicate minting orders to convert $500 USDC into cUSD. The reason I submitted two of the same orders is because I tried to low-ball the network with a low gas price. I then submitted the second one with a higher gas price. 

The one with the lower gas price actually went through first, and now I have the equivalent cUSD I wanted from Compound - all set on this front. I only have $50 USDC leftover in my wallet. What will happen to the pending minting request for $500 USDC when my wallet does not have enough in it? I went on the Etherscan page for the transaction and it says it was dropped from the block/node. Not too sure what this means, and I would appreciate any guidance.

Thank you!"

I'm relatively new to the concept of defi and I've started my research on this subject before going in with investing any funds. At this stage I do know all the other lending platforms and that several few of them have experienced hacks / security breaches which resulted in stolen funds.

Certainly the idea of having a true passive income in a decentralised manner is appealing, but nothing comes free, and I know that we get paid for risking our capital. I'm looking to find and understand if Compound has ever had a security vulnerability/hack/exploit/breach that I can learn more about?

Gas fees unsustainable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/lrdhsm/gas_fees_unsustainable/,Jaycera,14,2021-02-24 21:58:21,41,/r/Compound/comments/lrdhsm/gas_fees_unsustainable/,,"Hi all,

Fairly new to Compound and DeFi, but have been trying to get used to the protocol with some minimal exposure at first. I'm somewhat confused by how prohibitive gas fees seem to be and was curious if I was doing something wrong, if this was the product of the current bull market and congestion, or if this was a product of the small volume I was experimenting with.

For context, I moved about 0.2 ETH into a wallet to begin experimenting with DeFi. I bought some DAI to use as a test run for supplying in Compound and beginning to earn COMP tokens. I was turned off by the gas fees to deposit at first, and waited a few days until I found something that I thought was reasonable (approx $8 USD) and enabled DAI on Compound. Then, to my surprise, I also was met with more gas fees to deposit my DAI into the supply, this time the fees were approximately $73 USD. I rejected that for now and am sitting here feeling half-fulfilled. I've now ""wasted"" fees on withdrawals, deposits, and enabling the token on Compound, but haven't begun actually earning any interest or COMP tokens yet.

Prior to getting into this, I naively thought that my gas fees were going to be nominal (i.e. &lt;$1 USD on a given transaction), but it seems there is a new fee around each corner and that they are quite high. Am I wrong? Is this a product of the current environment? Is this a product of me using relatively small volume and the solution is deal with transactions in higher volume to save on fees? I don't really understand. I love the concept of DeFi and what Compound offers, but I am feeling roadblocked by the associated fees at the present time.

Thanks in advance for any insight."

PSA: You earn Compound tokens when you supply AND borrow on Compound,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/lwy0db/psa_you_earn_compound_tokens_when_you_supply_and/,leakyvalve,18,2021-03-04 00:32:14,58,/r/Compound/comments/lwy0db/psa_you_earn_compound_tokens_when_you_supply_and/,,"Just wanted to bring awareness to this topic because IMO this is Compound's biggest value and I feel like not many people know about it.

Let's say I supply Compound with $5,000 USDC and the APY for USDC is 5% and Compound distribution APY is 4%. That means I earn 5% APY for USDC and 4% in Compound for supplying.

I then look to the borrow assets column to borrow USDC.  The APY to borrow USDC is 6% and Compound distribution is 5% APY.  This means that I can borrow USDC at a 6% interest rate and EARN 5% in Compound for borrowing.

If I completely ignore the interest I am earning for supplying USDC, the loan to borrow USDC is really only 1% because I am earning 5% in Compound for borrowing.

If I do not ignore the interest I am earning for supplying USDC, I am getting paid to borrow USDC.

Is cDai/Dai rate ever-increasing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/lxiclt/is_cdaidai_rate_everincreasing/,Virtual_Ad_3722,2,2021-03-04 19:23:35,9,/r/Compound/comments/lxiclt/is_cdaidai_rate_everincreasing/,,"This is a dumb question and perhaps is asked many times. As title suggests, I thought the exchange rate should be ever-increasing, otherwise it doesn't make sense that for example, I deposit 10 DAI with rate 0.02, but redeem later with rate 0.019 which amounts to less than 10 DAI that I initially deposited.

However, when looking at [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound-dai](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound-dai), we can see the price of cDAI is fluctuating, so the above scenario is possible? How to interpret the price chart here? I know DAI fluctuates in USD, so perhaps a cDAI-in-DAI chart will show correctly the non-decreasing price? Or I misinterpret the mechanism of cDAI?

Another example is interest-bearing ETH from Alpha. I thought ibETH value in ETH would be non-decreasing so ibETH holders can redeem increased amount of ETH over time at any moment. However, the chart [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/interest-bearing-eth](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/interest-bearing-eth) suggests again the fluctuation.

Where in the compound smart contracts can I see this logic. I’m confused about how to do this in a way that doesn’t involve pushing a transaction every single block which obviously seems wrong and not how it works. I see how cTokens accrue their interest every block (without needing to constantly push state updates each block) but I don’t quite see how this works for COMP. 

Naively if we just notate the block height at which a user e.g. deposited collateral and starts earning COMP rewards, then at the time of COMP withdrawal we miscalculate the amount of COMP owed to the user if we only use her proportion of the pool *at withdrawal time* since it may have been way more of that pool for most of the blocks COMP was accruing and then a massive whale came into the pool only the last few blocks. So how do we keep track correctly or what am I missing here. I read solidity so if you can point me to the relevant code in the compound-protocol codebase I could probably work it out from there"

Compound is the #13 seed in the Bitcoin bracket. Its opponent is #4 THETA. This is Compound's first appearance in the UCT.

Those familiar with March Madness, or remember this from last year, will get it right away. Starting tonight at midnight, on Twitter @ UltimateCrypto7, there will be a poll for each game, open to all. The coin with more votes after 3 days will be declared the winner and move on. 

Like last year, the Ultimate Crypto Tournament pits the top 64 coins (by market cap) in a single elimination tournament. Crypto is a collaborative, cooperative space with room for all, but we can still have some fun.

So, vote early, tell your friends, and may the best coin win! The games begin at midnight tonight and run until 11:59 pm PT March 18.

Could someone explain to me what is the point of Compound protocol? It's supposed to work as a lending/borrowing platform for cryptos. Alright. AFAIK, in order to borrow some crypto, you have to place into the system some other crypto that has at least the same value, as collateral. That's to prevent the situation when someone borrows crypto and doesn't return it. Ok, but then what is the point of borrowing anyway? Borrowing in ""real life"" occurs when person A doesn't have money, needs the money, so he borrows it from person B and promises him to return it at a later date with some additional interest. Person B (the banks usually) has the power and right to punish Person A if he doesn't fulfill his promise. In Defi, this system cannot work because there are no promises. You have to put in collateral first, in order to borrow. But then. why borrow if you already have the equivalent amount of value in other crypto? Why not to just swpa the cryptos on some exchange?"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks and ptc ads, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is dutchy corps [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

What happens to the protocol if asset prices fall very fast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mitmnf/what_happens_to_the_protocol_if_asset_prices_fall/,alsonotjohnmalkovich,1,2021-04-03 05:05:04,9,/r/Compound/comments/mitmnf/what_happens_to_the_protocol_if_asset_prices_fall/,Question,"Here's a scenario:

1. Some bad news, bug, or whatever (humor me) causes a panic sale of a large chunk of the crypto market, and lots of buyers cancel their orders
2. The market price of the collateral falls and triggers the sale of the collateral at an 8% discount. At this point the value of the collateral is still above the value of assets lent.
3. The price is still falling very fast, only a few arbitrageurs grab the discount because the arbitrage is uncertain, or the protocol isn't moving fast enough
4. The market value of the collateral is now under the value of assets lent. The protocol is still offering a discount. At some point when prices stabilize arbitrageurs will return a portion of the lent assets to the protocol, and that portion will be smaller than the deposits.

Questions:

1. Did I get this right? Am I missing something? Theoretically, is there in fact an asset price decline speed fast enough that could trigger this scenario?
2. Is that plausible in the least? Are we talking Black Swan territory or ""you're more likely to get hit by an asteroid"" territory?
3. How does Compound determine the price of an asset? E.g. how does it know how much USDC an ETH is worth?

I'm just curious how the Distribution APY works on borrowing.

So I took a screenshot below and let me know if I'm thinking about this correctly.

If I am to borrow COMP then I will pay 5.81% interest on the amount I borrowed. 

I will also receive 14.11% COMP on the amount I borrowed as a distribution.

So now that bring me to this, can I exchange the COMP I borrowed into USDC coin where I can earn:

1. 8.66% on USDC coin
2. 2.47% COMP on distribution apy
3. and also continue to earn 14.11% above from borrow distribution

I use to be apart of the faucethub community and had fun with their platform. Over time the site got watered down, claims were difficult to navigate, more hoops to jump through, eventually it was just not worth the time, so that chapter ended. That was a few years ago

Recently I got back into airdrop hunting and came across [FaucetCrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/1074770) and checked it out since SFMoney seems to be a scam and I'm upset cause I had much time invested in the project and it seems it was for nothing.

**What is Student Coin**  
The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**  
Oxford Student Token (OXF/STC)  
Melbourne Student Token (MLB/STC)  
STC LP Token (It seems to be for liquidity pools)

  With a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and the potential to explode when this hits the exchanges (July 2021).
  

  The ICO was originally scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases in only 9 days.
  

  Very important additional aspect for my investment decision: only 100 Million tokens total supply.
  

  Compare to 1 Billion DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion XRP !

How would the USDT supply and borrow rates develop in case of Tether insolvency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mqq59e/how_would_the_usdt_supply_and_borrow_rates/,torkildj,1,2021-04-14 21:05:10,3,/r/Compound/comments/mqq59e/how_would_the_usdt_supply_and_borrow_rates/,Question,"I am thinking about taking a USDT loan to do some yield farming, there are some good arbitrage possibilities. I am trying to gauge the risks in the case of a Tether insolvency event. When it is clear that Tether cannot maintain the peg to the dollar, obviously people would lose faith in USDT, which will send the value of the USDT token gradually towards zero. How would this effect the supply and borrow rates on the Compound platform? Intuitively, people won't want to supply USDT if the value goes down, so the supply yield would go up, and consequently also the borrow rates. I am right in my reasoning, or are there some other aspects that I am overlooking, perhaps some oracle/algorithmic logic that I am not aware of in the protocol."

At this moment we are in phase 56 with the price at $0,75 and it  will continue till phase 100. If there is any token remaining on 30 June  they will be burned.

**How i can pay?**  
In  my case I choose to pay using Litecoin with Coinbase Wallet. It was the  lower fees I found to pay using Crypto. The other possibilities  it’s  to use Visa or Mastercard or even Bank Transfer.

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Exa2dygw6k) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Exa2dygw6k)is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.

I have recently sent some ETH funds from my Exodus to CoinBase Pro trading account. Checking Etherscan I’ve realised it didn’t go directly but there was some detour. At some point, a wallet in between sent COMP token to an unidentified wallet (CoinBase custody I suppose). My question is, does CoinBase use COMP somehow to channel user’s ETH tokens? If so, why? I’m new and keen to learn. I’ve read that it’s a lending platform so far."

Thoughts on a $1500-$2000 compound price soon?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/msk8ge/thoughts_on_a_15002000_compound_price_soon/,CryptoKing778,1,2021-04-17 12:44:33,9,/r/Compound/comments/msk8ge/thoughts_on_a_15002000_compound_price_soon/,,"So I wanted to get a few price opinions for comp, short term in next month or two, if possible. Between myself and 2 friends we own close to 200 comp and none of us plan on selling anytime soon and possibly will be holding for years. We've been discussing about future potential of the top defi projects and obviously comp and aave are the ones atm.

So comp's circulating supply is only 5.1m atm and total supply is 10m, which is close to half of btc's total supply. It also more and more comp tokens are being held/staked and so forth instead of being traded recently . Also I would think comp has just as many intuitional investors keeping their eye on this project as btc tbh. this platform could turn into something insanely huge in the near future. Compound and similar top defi platforms seem to be the next logical step in evolution for finance loans/staking and so on and I would imagine the big players will want their piece of the pie sooner than later.

Price wise, I've heard price predictions here and there and discussed with friends of a $1500-$2000 comp in the upcoming 1-2 months and maybe $5000+ towards the end of the bull run this year considering the potential growth of this platform and the total 3bill market cap. Also do you believe like some others that compound could hit 50k-60k+ next bull run? Call me overly excited for this project :) 

Thoughts friends?"

I now have 193$ as collateral for Ether. I never touched these to date.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I need some cash because of financial difficulties and tried to get them out (and eventually convert to USD). Every time I do though it appears that the network fees (Eth gas fees?) is higher than the actual amount I have as collateral and therefore they cannot be taken out.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this for real. Gas fees of &gt;200$ for a transaction? Is trad baking now for plebs and crypto for zillionaires?

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.

The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**  
Oxford Student Token (OXF/STC)  
Melbourne Student Token (MLB/STC)

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.

we currently work on a uni project to create a decentralized NGO based on donations with a clear focus on the 17 sustainability goals of the UN. Donations are received through customers of e-commerce platforms that offer customers to increase the price of a product and become sustainable. By donating, customers receive voting rights and can decide via a crowd voting platform to which sustainability project they want to allocate funds from the treasury.

Could someone please provide us with help, cause we are struggling with the voting/governance token, whether to burn after voting or let them free-floating. 

Thanks a lot for reaching out!"

One thing I'm still struggling to understand is what interest rate I'm actually earning on a loan. I understand that the supply APY rate is constantly updating - does that mean it updates over the lifetime of my loan or do I lock in a rate at the time that I supply the loan? For example, if I initiate a loan of 100 USDT at a time when Compound says the APY is 4.0%, do I lock in that 4.0% and definitely earn 4 USDT at the end of the year? Or if the rate later fluctuates I could end up earning more or less than 4 USDT?"

5 months ago it was Coinbase referral spam, now it's ""Student Coin ICO"" spam, whatever that is. It's gunking up my feed. Let's get Automod on this!

[According to /u/Compound_Team they do not own this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/jtok9j/goodbye_rcompound/gcfe1rv/), so I humbly ask the current owner /u/dotcomedy if they are up to the task of fixing this spam issue, or alternatively if they would be open to adding the Compound Team as mods.

#### In a Nutshell?

This brings crypto to every PoS-Terminal and consumer protection to crypto via smart contracts. 🤝

The missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to everyday mainstream electronic payment adoption:

&gt; ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

To me this looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and with the potential to explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Only 100 **Million** tokens total supply – still at only **$0.85** each right **NOW** !

Compare this to 1 **Billion** DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion Ripple and check their current prices.

💎 **The best part?**

Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet! ☝

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

The price on ICO phases is going up $0.01 for each new phase reached, and the amount of each phase size is going to increase to provide strong resistance and not allow price going down when listed on exchanges. The tokens that are not selled up to 30 June will be burned.

Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

💎 https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

To me this looks like an exclusive and undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (POS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) with the potential to go parabolic and explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Limited to only 100 **million** tokens total supply – still at only $0.85 each right **NOW** !

Compare this to 1 **billion** DOT, 2 **billion** Filecoin, 45 **billion** ADA, 100 **billion** Ripple and check their current prices.

Some people on twitter already see it at $15 and even $100 in the future. 🤷‍♂️

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently also, I have seen them get integrated with different platforms like Avalanche, Injective Protocol and other DEFI protocols. For me, it is time for COMP as well to get added. You may vote with me here: [https://www.orionprotocol.io/vote](https://www.orionprotocol.io/vote) You may also want to buy some $ORN tokens because the staking is coming soon. Better get some by buying some Orion here: [https://trade.orionprotocol.io/](https://trade.orionprotocol.io/)

Orion has  37 tradable assets on the terminal, resulting in 652 tradable pairs and they are still adding more as days passes by! So once the other plugins, decentralized brokerages and B2B transactions, we will be bigger in volume."

💎💎 Merchant Token - The largest DeFi ICO in 2021 - DeFi Payment Protocol that enables POS terminals on blockchains and brings consumer protection to crypto payments 💎💎,https://merchanttoken.org/?ref=T4JQJ9Y49,Brave-Post-48,1,2021-04-26 04:01:31,0,/r/Compound/comments/myga30/merchant_token_the_largest_defi_ico_in_2021_defi/,,

#### In a Nutshell?

This brings crypto to every POS terminal and consumer protection to crypto via smart contracts. 

The missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to mainstream electronic payment adoption:

&gt; ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

To me this looks like an exclusive and undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (POS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) with the potential to go parabolic and explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days.

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Limited to only 100 **million** tokens total supply – still at only $0.87 each right **NOW** !

Compare this to 1 **billion** DOT, 2 **billion** Filecoin, 45 **billion** ADA, 100 **billion** Ripple and check their current prices.

Some people on twitter already see it at $15 and even $100 in the future.

**The best part?**

Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet!

First of all:  
Please stay friendly. This post is supposed to show people, who don't have a regular income a way to grab some crypto for free. This page (obviously) won't get you rich. It's supposed to give you a start without a risk of loosing money.

I spent about 30min per day on this page and was watching Netflix with it.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa](https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa)  
I exchanged my payouts afterwards into Compuond to safe some fees. But the Autofaucet also runs with Compound.

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%"

The value of each borrowed asset coin increases/decreases respectively with the value of each collateral asset coin. This account should never be insolvent right?

I started with $1k trying to earn the Coinbase promotion in November 2020. I transferred that USDC to the Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase added $3 USDC, .0186 ETH, and .1038 COMP ($10 reward then worth $65 now!)  as the rewards and to cover transfer costs. Basically I was net cashflow neutral. I left that alone until February 2021 when both APY and gas fees were climbing. I transferred another $2k and paid .02659009 ETH to add to the pool. 2.5 months later I pulled everything out, possibly to explore other defi projects.

The supplied balance had grown to $3,059.88 and the APY has really fluctuated between 3-14%. I also earned .08797966 COMP. To close the contract I had to pay .00942222 ETH and to get the COMP I paid an additional .0096908 ETH, then a final $5.37 to transfer the USDC out of my wallet. With the rewards/interest/etc. I made $80.65 on the total $3k investment with all crypto converted to current prices. Basically fees ate all the ""interest"" and the rewards were my only profit. Obviously I could have left the funds for longer but the APY has been low so I wanted to look around. I agree with the general sentiment that the fees are only justified by larger transactions and there's not a lot of transparency or certainty with regards to what you're paying with these projects so I hope this helps someone.

TL:DR  
USDC $3,000 + $3 reward - 11.90 fees + 68.76 interest =&gt; 3,059.88 USDC  
ETH +.0186 reward - .05873701 fees =&gt; -99.21 at 2,467 ETH/USD  
COMP +.0108 reward + .089797966 =&gt; +119.98 at 625 COMP/USD  
Net gain $80.65 (including $113.83 in rewards)"
how to “cheaply” claim COMP using Etherscan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/mz8t48/how_to_cheaply_claim_comp_using_etherscan/,silvester2ish,1,2021-04-27 05:41:09,1,/r/Compound/comments/mz8t48/how_to_cheaply_claim_comp_using_etherscan/,,"[https://www.comp.xyz/t/insane-fees-to-collect-compound-distributions/593](https://www.comp.xyz/t/insane-fees-to-collect-compound-distributions/593)

The “claim” function attempts to withdraw COMP earned from every market – it’s not very efficient. You can use it when gas prices are low, or if you’re feeling skills in smart contracts, call function 20 (claim) via [Etherscan 41](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b#writeProxyContract) with your address and the cToken’s address - this is a “cheap” way to collect the COMP.

Can someone explain where to find:

\- holder (address)

\- cTokens (address\[\])

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

Capital gains/losses for cTokens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n01vs4/capital_gainslosses_for_ctokens/,dr_rokstar,1,2021-04-28 07:44:38,6,/r/Compound/comments/n01vs4/capital_gainslosses_for_ctokens/,,"Everyone's favorite topic, I know.

It's my understanding that supplying and withdrawing tokens is a taxable event since cryptocurrencies are being exchanged.  If there's a price movement in the token that was supplied, then capital gains (or loss) will be generated when the token is withdrawn from Compound.  E.g. a supply of 1,000 BAT @ $0.32 followed by a withdraw of 1,000 BAT @ $0.40 results in $80 of capital gains.  Not great, but you'd have to pay taxes on those gains anyway when you eventually sold the BAT.

Now consider the situation where you borrowed and later repaid those 1,000 BAT.  You'll still owe $80 in capital gains at the end, but there's no BAT left to sell.

Is my understanding correct?  It's unfortunate that the cToken transactions are considered taxable events and not just a bookkeeping method used by the protocol."
old SAI borrow fucking me up - hard to get out of,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n02nsc/old_sai_borrow_fucking_me_up_hard_to_get_out_of/,seblt,1,2021-04-28 08:27:23,4,/r/Compound/comments/n02nsc/old_sai_borrow_fucking_me_up_hard_to_get_out_of/,,"So I originally borrowed 625 SAI in late 2019 which resulted to 625 USD. Since then I didn't pay back the loan which results now, due to the price movement of SAI and SAI being pegged to ETH's price, to over 9k USD which I have to pay back in SAI to get my collateral (ETH) back out of the loan contract. Pretty fucked up, but okay. (Any work around?)

Okay, now I have to get the amount of SAI and this is where the next problem appears - liquidity. Uniswap is the only platform on where I can get SAI, but since there isn't enough SAI around I'd have to pay a premium of over 45% price difference, meaning 45% more ETH than the equivalent amount SAI is actually worth. Any way around that either?

If all of the above is true, and there is no way for me to solve this, I'm completeley fucked.

Thanks for help."

The more reading and listening I’ve been doing, the more interested and excited by Ethereum I have become. There’s a number of projects I’m keen on, but for me, right now, the Ethereum network and ETH specifically are the things I have to struggle to not spend all my time talking about. 

Last night I was tooling around on Coinbase and got $9 (USD) worth of COMP. I’m holding onto it and trying to learn more about it. I was wondering (and please remember I’m very new at this) how COMP’s performance relates to ETH’s performance as both are part of the Ethereum network. 

Are there any pieces of news and development that have you feeling bullish for COMP? I’m so new to it that I don’t know what I don’t know, so it’s hard to even start the learning process. Hope you guys don’t get a ton of posts like that and are annoyed by them. Thank you for reading!"

A failed experiment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n29498/a_failed_experiment/,DistantKarma271,1,2021-05-01 10:25:17,9,/r/Compound/comments/n29498/a_failed_experiment/,,"So I should have known better, but I just dropped a marginal sum of ETH into the Compound supply from Metamask just to get my feet wet. I knew it would be bad, but even after interest and COMP, I'll be enjoying only .57% APY TOTAL at the cost of about $20 in gas upfront. Yikes.

So at this point do I just leave my ETH in there until gas prices come back down? Or just chalk it up to inexperience and trade back in the cETH? Can I leverage the cETH somehow? Is there any other approach I should be considering? 

I think defi really has potential, and I want to gain experience but as I've read and now know firsthand, it's a whale's game until gas prices fall. I am not fond of the idea of Binance but I suppose they have a market for just this reason. Maybe I just need to play over there?

Thanks in advance for suggestions."

As you can guess it quickly caught my eye again recently as when I originally was interested the price was in the 460 range. 

I’m currently holding a little over .5 with an avg cost of $628 and I really want to have at least one full COMP VS. a partial. I’ve heard of a rule in stocks when buying only put in half of what you plan to (possibly 1/4) and then if/when it climbs 25% (I think) put in the other half (possibly just a half and then another 1/4 later)clearly not certain on the numbers but you get it. 

I think I’m beating around my actual question which is do you think this is just a pump or could this be the new norm? Wanting to wait for a dip but by the time that comes the current price could be the dip price. Thoughts?"
🎯🏆 5 reasons why Merchant Token could be a great deal! 📋🔍,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n3k8j0/5_reasons_why_merchant_token_could_be_a_great_deal/,Fugarinon,1,2021-05-03 08:54:01,1,/r/Compound/comments/n3k8j0/5_reasons_why_merchant_token_could_be_a_great_deal/,,"I made some research about this ICO that i found here in this sub and i’m writing here some details i found about the project and some reasons why i decided to invest on this.

In these last year I started to invest in low market cap projects, like HBAR, ONE, HOT, BTT and in the last month I started to look to ICO/IDO to try to get projects in the very start.

First of all, ICO is much more risky than investing in projects in an advanced stage. That's why I decided to invest only a small amount of my portfolio on ICO generally. Always do your own research.

Here on the website you can find all the info about the ICO: [https://merchanttoken.org/](https://merchanttoken.org/?ref=YK5XR7MZ6)

Here the reasons will i decide to invest, i tried to resume much as possible:

1 - The project is amazing! In resume, they will provide consumer protection and concepts from the tradicional card payment industry to enable credit card terminals to accept any crypto with support for smart contracts, like Ethereum, Cardano or Solana.

It solves a real problem that is common to all merchants, the chargebacks. There are very interesting concepts like Automatic Dispute Management (ADM) and Community Dispute Management (CDM) you can find more about in details on whitepepper.

2 - The team behind the project is a Sweden company (Hips) and they work with POS terminals for payments using credit card, qrcode and others already processing payments for over 200,000 merchants globally. This gives the team the perfect background for the team!

3 - As the project is registered Finansinspektionen (FI), Sweden's financial supervisory authority under the number 80658. As it’s being registered in Sweden it will also be under Sweden laws, which gives me some peace to go sleep at night.

4 - It was already announced a partnership with The Payment House, to start in november this year to provide crypto as payment method for over 30,000 taxis in UK and Scandinavia.

5 - There are only 100,000,000 tokens as the maximum supply, with a fully diluted market cap only 120 millions! If this project reaches the market cap of only 1,2 bi it will make 1000% on the investment! As comparison some projects with similar market cap would be Bakery Token, Celo, Ankr, Kucoin and others around #87 to #93."

#### The Merchant Token Opportunity In A Nutshell?

This brings crypto to POS terminals and consumer protection to crypto via DeFi smart contracts. 

The missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to mainstream trust and electronic payment adoption:

&gt; ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583 enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""

This is not financial advice, **do your own research** if you like the project, but check out their very interesting white paper:

https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf

This is **HUGE** in my opinion. This to me looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance in a global mega market (POS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) with the potential to go parabolic and explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).

The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days. 😱

The ICO will progress for a total of 100 phases. For each phase the token price will increase by $0.01 until it reaches ~~$1.20 at the end of the ICO~~ $1.11 in phase 92. After that, the token price will increase by $0.09 for each of the last remaining 9 phases until it reaches $1.93 in phase 100 at the end of the ICO, which is scheduled to be at the end of June. 

But because of the huge demand the ICO is already in phase 95 and will probably be sold out in the next few hours or days! (see [documentation](https://docs.merchanttoken.org/docs/ico-phases) and [twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/merchant_token/status/1389136821335044096))

Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to **BUY**:

Limited to 100 **million** tokens – still at only **$1.38** in one of the last ICO phases right **NOW !**

Compare this to total supplies of 1 **billion** DOT, 2 **billion** Filecoin, 45 **billion** ADA, 100 **billion** Ripple and check their current prices.

Some analysts on social media already see it at $15 and even $100 in the future.

&gt; ""The Hips Payment Group is already partnered with over 200,000 merchants and as the widespread adaptation of digital payment systems continues to infiltrate every aspect of our consumerist society, I think it's fair to say that the possibilities for the Hips Merchant Protocol and the MTO governance token within the payment services industry and fintech sectors are seemingly endless, and the use case is rock-solid.""

**And the Best Part?**

**Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet!**

To me the idea, the project, the whitepaper do look profound. I hope they can deliver the best.

Obviously they need funds for that.

I see that dollar prices wouldn't be provided anymore as Ethereum has no knowledge about USD, but that wouldn't really be an issue because you can lend only ERC20 on-chain assets anyways on Compound. Prices are all relative to each other so Dollar doesn't matter."

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me."

Some thoughts on how to raise token price,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n6qns4/some_thoughts_on_how_to_raise_token_price/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 12:52:19,1,/r/Compound/comments/n6qns4/some_thoughts_on_how_to_raise_token_price/,,"As MSI’s price continues to plummet just as my heart, I’ve been collecting my thoughts on how to establish solid fundamentals for Missile Farm going forward in the DeFi world, so that more investors might find this project worthy of staking-and-farming, and more importantly, valuable.

What makes token price keep rising?

I summarized 3 types of logic for rising token price.

What is the rational token economy model behind token price? How can some cryptocurrencies’ price keep solid in the long run?

Vitalik once mentioned in his blog his valuation for medium-of-exchange token based on Fisher’s formula: M * V = P * T

Here:

— M is the total number of coins;
— V is the velocity of money, that is, the number of times an average token changes hands everyday;
— P is the price level, this is the price of goods and services in terms of the token, so it is actually the inverse of the currency’s price;
— T is the daily transaction volume, which is the economic value of transactions per day

To put it simply, if there are M number of tokens, each of them changes hands N times a day, then there’s a daily economic transaction scale corresponding to the value of M * N tokens. If daily transaction volume is T, then token price is T / (M * N), and the average price level P is T’s reciprocal: M * N / T.

If we simplify the analysis, let H = 1 / V, then H represents the average time span a user holds the token. Let C = 1 / P, so C represents token price.

Then M * V = P * T can be simplified as M / H = T / C or M * C = T * H

We can come to a simple conclusion, purely from a market perspective, that when other basic conditions (M and T) stay the same, the longer a token stays in user’s hands (H), the higher token price would rise.

Of course, the above is a static model. In reality, demand and trading volumes keep changing.

In fact, this is an important reason the U.S. stock market has prospered all these years. A large number of institutional investors and even individual investors in the US stock market are holding stocks for a long time. The holding time is often measured in years.

So in DeFi perspective, what could make users hodl tokens for a long time?

Now we can talk about our main topic: the logic behind rising token price.

On the high level, we all know that creating more token usage scenarios and increasing demand for tokens certainly help promote the rise of token

From a token engineering perspective, successful blockchain projects with good token economy design can be roughly divided into three categories:

The First Category is Tokens with the Mining Logic：

When the token has good fundamentals, the mining token provides a passage for rising token price：

The feedback process of token price growth：Found price of mining coins as A -&gt; price rises -&gt; more miners join -&gt; mining cost increases -&gt; mining cost rises to high level

With a good fundamentals, tokens with mining logic provides a good price support.

The feedback process of price support works like this: the price of coin falls -&gt; price falls to the mining cost -&gt; miners reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; coin price stop falling

The more miners, the more stable the system will be. With the mining cost continues to rise, coin price gets a high support and the bottom of the mining cost to rise.

In the long run, as long as the feedback loop continues to go on, Bitcoin’s price (no matter as digital gold or as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash) will have a higher and higher price support.

Of course, mining is not something that all tokens should take. In some cases, a 51% attack can wipe out the entire value of a project. Mining logic is valid only if the value of the blockchain project itself continues to grow.

The perfect thing about Bitcoin is that the more miners, the more stable the system, the more obvious the network effect of Bitcoin, and this fact itself raises the value of the Bitcoin network.

The Second Category is Tokens with Delegated Proof-of-Stake

To some extent, EOS’s supernodes are like miners, and in order to obtain mining rights, supernodes need to buy EOS tokens in the market to obtain mining rights; EOS will allocate a part of the additional issuance of EOS to these supernodes.

It is important to know that there is a capital cost to participate in the supernode election due to the lock-up of EOS tokens. Furthermore, some of the EOS tokens of supernodes are borrowed, the costs above are to some extent the mining costs. The hardware cost, operation and marketing costs can also be considered as fixed mining costs.

The feedback process of token price rise：price rises -&gt; more people join supernode election -&gt; cost for being elected as a supernode increases -&gt; cost for being elected rises from B to B1.

The feedback process of price support: token price falls -&gt; price falls to cost B1-&gt; supernodes reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; DPOS token price stop falling.

During this process, it is more ideal for the supernode election to happen in real time. Since the DPOS tokens will inevitably need to have additional issuance, the demand for DPOS coins must be increased.

The Third Category is Platform Tokens:

By platform tokens we specifically refer to tokens from trading platforms that regularly distribute profits to token users. The most successful case is BNB from Binance Exchange.

Benefits of BNB: 20% of the quarterly net profit of Binance Exchange is used for BNB buyback, and the BNB tokens which got bought back are burned.

Now sitting at over 600, BNB’s buyback-and-burn mechanism is proved to be one of the most successful method for price-pumping.

The feedback loop of token price growth is that the buyback action will directly raise token price. Some people will buy tokens because they want to arbitrage, which will push up the price. So every time buyback happens, the price will be pushed up, which in turn will push up the cost of holding these platform tokens. In fact, a buyback program with token burn is very similar to a dividend program.

Another hidden logic for platform token is that: If platform token holders can enjoy the usage of the tokens, they will be willing to hold it for a longer time, otherwise the arbitrageurs will sell soon after buying. Similarly, platform tokens are not suitable for large-scale additional issuance.

Platform tokens perfectly conform to two characteristics:

The first is that all the holders of the token are protectors and even promoters of it.

The second is that the holders of the tokens are also the users of the tokens, so people will purchase platform tokens to use them.

It is obvious that the platform token logic is only valid when the value of the blockchain project itself has growth potential. In the case that an exchange can continue to prosper, the price of the platform token will continue to rise.

The bottom line of the price support for the platform token is provided by the value of the platform itself. If the exchange users are exhausted, the platform token might still drop to zero.

To summarize：

The three models above are summarized as follows: turning speculation into investment and allowing holders of the tokens to obtain stable return.

Of course, for methods like staking and mint-and-burn to successfully decrease the liquidity of tokens and increase holding time of tokens, it requires the support of the value of the project behind the tokens so that the tokens are actually used.

Team Missile Farm is determined to create more use cases for MSI so that it is granted an intrinsic value rather than a nominal value. Furthermore, we will adopt more of the buyback-and-burn mechanism to fully incentivize the market to hodl more of MSI. Last but not least, Missile Farm will develop more features to support its core feature-the farming aggregator such that investors will find MSI more valuable holding long-term than selling for speculative returns."
Estimating gas fees for USDC deposits,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n6rxdr/estimating_gas_fees_for_usdc_deposits/,Mr_Evil_Guy,1,2021-05-07 14:16:55,6,/r/Compound/comments/n6rxdr/estimating_gas_fees_for_usdc_deposits/,,A while ago I wanted to deposit some USDC onto Compound but balked at the gas fees (roughly $100 at the time).

How does Missile.Farm work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n6u1jq/how_does_missilefarm_work/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 16:51:31,0,/r/Compound/comments/n6u1jq/how_does_missilefarm_work/,,"**We** know that many have lost money in altcoins and have high levels of skepticism about this new opportunity.

So let’s break down what Missile Farm does in language as close as possible to how the current financial world works.

1. You know what interest is:

You have $10,000 in your bank account and you earn a 12.5% annual return on your investment. After 12 months, you receive a deposit of $12,500 as an interest payment. After five years, you have $16,250.

2. You know what compound interest is:

It’s interest on interest. You get interest on the initial amount you put in, and you get interest on the interest already accumulated from the previous years.

So with compound interest, after 5 years you won’t have $16,250, you’ll actually have $18,020.

So far, so good.

***But what if there was a “third way”?***

This is the question we asked ourselves as programmers.

3. Here’s what Missile interest is:

When you take your crypto and lock it up on Missile Farm we find ways to add to the compounding of your asset. If one of the platforms we use gives away a promotional coin on top of any interest, then we take that promo coin and sell it for more of what you staked.

‌���The result is a significantly higher overall annual return.

When Missile Farm combines your 3402% annual compounding interest with the 2480% interest of another site’s promotional coin, you get 5882% APY on Missile Farm.

Missile Farm’s wBNB vault is doing just that. At the time of writing, you get 6132% APY for your BNB.

***After just 1 month, that 10,000$ would already amount to 20684.5$. How about 12 months? An astounding 613,200$! ; even with a more realistic APY, which according to our predictive model would approach to 280% in 6 months, the 5 year ROI will be around 1,721,036.8$; all in the asset you actually staked!***

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock"

Couple of questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/n8tgem/couple_of_questions/,fyrefli666,1,2021-05-10 10:20:15,13,/r/Compound/comments/n8tgem/couple_of_questions/,,"First off I'm aware gas fees are super high, and I'm not necessarily looking for a large return right now, more of just looking to get a good idea of how to work defi into my overall investment practices.

So first the background:
I bought ethereum through coinbase.com's app, and was able to link coinbase wallet and get it transferred over.

Now that the eth was in coinbase wallet, I was able to link the wallet with compound, paid the gas fee to enable the protocol for supplying eth, and was able to convert my ethereum to be able to supply and start earning compound with it.

Now I'm aware I can convert the cETH through coinbase wallet, but it seems wildly more expensive than doing it through the dApp for compound. 

When I go into the dApp though, it only shows my available wallet balance as .0007 eth, when the balance of ethereum (not cETH) in my coinbase wallet is closer to .006, thus giving me errors if I try to do any action that would require a gas fee.

So number one: which balance is it referring to in compound, and how would I be able to update it to the amount of ethereum in my wallet so I can move stuff around? For the sake of argument, let's say I do have .5 ethereum in my coinbase wallet.

I might have more questions if someone can possibly answer me, or point me in the direction of how to contact compound support."

It is a platform where you can get a crypto loan for just 5% APR. We also have other cool features like unlimited loan terms, no recurrent payments, and the loans are almost instant to take (unlike Nexo, for example). In fact, it usually takes about few minutes to receive your loan. 

Right now we are just walking around Reddit, trying to see if there are people in coin communities who would be interested in loaning/borrowing specific assets. And of course trying to spread a word about the update if the coin has been added already. 

So, the question is: Would any of you guys be interested in loaning COMP against USDT/USDC?

Even though we are a relatively young project there are some reputable partners working with us already such as ChangeNOW and Guarda wallet. Also, we continuously look for more great projects to work with!

Also, we’d be grateful for literally any feedback — be it positive or negative. If you like it, let us know. If you think it looks scammy/unreliable, PLEASE let me know. Cheers!"

New to compound here. Can I ask  a newbie question? Or can you guys guide me to a newbie FAQ post? Much appreciated

Is there any significant risk of using compound to earn interest? I have read many people on other sub crypto reddit have posted that they use some yield farming platform and got their eth/crypto currency transferred away (damn scammers) story and they claimed they have never given their seed phrase otherwise.

I just want to understand some basic idea of how does compound work? 

1. When I stake ADA, for example, ADA always stay in my wallet (adalite) and I don't need to give my ADA to the staking pool manager, which makes it risk free to earn stake interest.  
2. When I stake ETH with coinbase, I have to transfer my ETH from my wallet to coinbase account, which is riskier because I have to trust coinbase can handle my asset safely.

So which format does compound take? 

Thanks

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

I think is a good way to start earn some crypto without spend money, if someone did register and want some tip I use to do the shortlinks and ptc ads quickly feel free to message me. I suggest to use an adblock"

**Earnings would be way over $260 if the Crypto Market wouldn't had a 30% drop...**

First of all:  
Please stay friendly. This post is supposed to show people, who don't have a regular income a way to grab some crypto for free. This page (obviously) won't get you rich. It's supposed to give you a start without a risk of loosing money.

I spent less than 30min per day on this page and was watching Netflix with it.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa](https://imgur.com/a/IpkT5qa)  
I exchanged my payouts afterwards into my desired Coins to safe some fees.

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%"

My next question is about the open-price feed. Does compound uses this data source right now? And where can I find how many data providers are connected to it?

Thanks alot! Hopefully you can answer my questions."

I'm new to the Compound community, but I'm absolutely stunned by how powerful DeFi is.

I have my ETH and Uni collateral locked on Compound, and have taken out a USDT loan (currently @ 50% of my borrowing limit). With the currently level of market volatility, I am naturally worried I might wake up one day and find myself liquidated. This could happen overnight, or if I'm at work and am unable to view my position status from my work computer.

TLDR: Is there an easy way to keep an eye on my position, without having to connect Metamask through my home computer? Not knowing how the current market volatility impacts my position is a bit concerning. You get it. :)

Centralized vs. Decentralized factors aside, is the appeal of Compound in this case that they offer a percentage of the payout in COMP, which has the possibility of price appreciation (along with its inherent usefulness?)

Hi Reddit, I recently wrote a blog post about Compound to help me learn how the protocol works. I tried to keep it as ELI5 as possible so it's full of drawings and clocks in at a 6th grade reading level. End to end it's about a 5 minute read time.

If you know anyone who's trying to wrap their heads around how defi and crypto please share, happy to answer any questions they have in the Twitter thread below.

- you supply ETH to Compound

- Tether freezes all USDT for whatever reason (eg it turns out it is unbacked) 
- you cannot close your loan, so your ETH is stuck perpetually

Is there a way to solve this outside of eg governance voting to shut down all USDT positions?"

SecretSwap, an automated market maker on Secret Network has just had governance go live! $SEFI holders can now participate in shaping the first front-running resistant, cross chain and privacy-first AMM. 

It also marks the world's first private voting application on a public blockchain. This will allow $SEFI holders to create proposals and vote privately on the future of SecretSwap.  

With the Terra Bridge and Monero Bridge on Testnet and an aim to connect to IBC in September, there is a lot to look forward to on SecretSwap.

After doing some research, I have summarized some of the best parts of the project.

* Apricot Finance is the first DeFi project on Solana to do the lending-and-borrowing service.💰
* It will minimize the liquidation penalties unlike other traditional lending-and-borrowing projects such as AAVE, Curve.
* Any new features?🤔
* 🙋Orderbook-based fixed rate loans (unsure about the tech behind, still seeking for answer from their Discord)
* ✊Close to zero collateral loans (Keeping an eye on this! It will save a lot if it actually works!)
* A humongous and supportive community with over 25k members on their discord channel (Disclaimer: I am one of them)
* What makes Apricot so special? 🌻
* It has a very experienced team with over 20+ developers and managers in the team. They have spent over a year on this project by surviving through various market conditions and overcoming many obstacles. They are working actively on new features to push the project one step ahead of other borrowing-and-lending projects.

🚧That's about it! Hope this article helps you in your search for a stable DeFi project to work with.

\## Disclaimer: The purpose of this post is not to pick on AAVE or Curve. This post was purely my personal opinion about the environment and some macro observations, and I do apologize if it offends anyone at all! :) 💙"

I was skeptical of the governance so I discovered that a16z and a few venture capital firms along with the developers share the significant voting weight and all have alot to lose if there are any problems. They also have deep legal and lobbying resources.

[Compound](https://sevenb.io/currencies/compound) (COMP) – is a lending platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. With help of this platform, users can deposit cryptocurrencies and earn interest, or borrow assets by depositing collateral. The protocol is managed by smart contracts, which provides a high level of automation and security of financial transactions.

Unlike direct lending platforms, Compound does not have direct interaction between users, but has a common pool of liquidity. It is a market through which funds are available for borrowing. When you provide assets to the protocol, your balance is displayed in the form of cTokens. Each participant of the network can borrow and take cryptocurrency at interest. Interest rates are a function of the liquidity available in each market, and fluctuate in real time depending on supply and demand, and the more the token is demanded, the more the lender can earn.

## Why should I trade Compound? 

At the moment, we can safely say that the prospects for profitable COMP trading are extremely optimistic for the following reasons:

1. The demand for DeFi services is growing exponentially. Compound, as a prominent player in the DeFi industry, has a great chance of prosperity. The project was the first in DeFi to reach a Total Locked Value of 10 billion. 
2. Looking at the COMP price chart, we can note an obvious increase. Analysts from DigitalCoin and Wallet Investor consider COMP a good long-term investment.

On August 19, 2021, the price of the COMP coin is approximately $451.95. The market capitalization reaches $2,481,915,663. The minimum price of the asset on June 18, 2020 reached approximately $61. The maximum price was set on May 12, 2021 and amounted to $911.20.

### What to know before exchanging Compound? 

Cryptocurrency exchange is one of the simplest actions, but there are still a number of recommendations for those who want to do it safely and without losses:

1. Make sure that you have made the right choice of the exchange platform. Study the reviews about the service on third-party resources.
2. Make sure that you are familiar with the service fees. Compare the exchange rate of several sites.
3. Make sure that the service supports the cryptocurrency and exchange pair you need.
4. Make sure that you entered the recipient’s address correctly.

# Compound use cases

COMP is a native token of the Compound network with the following use cases:

* Decentralized protocol management. COMP holders have the right to vote for the proposed changes and propose them themselves.
* COMP is automatically distributed among users interacting with the platform: depositing funds into the pool, loans, and so on.

We are a research collective working with Kevin Werbach (UPenn), Primavera de Filippi (Harvard/CNRS), and Gina Pieters (UChicago) on an industry-wide survey of blockchain governance, and we’d like to ask Compound to participate. Since Compound is collectively-governed, we’d love to see a wiki-style response from the community itself! I’ve created a stub response in this Google doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcRxYEcX78wrGjQXgUUzQ03Tjtf4KcZIx4G6sfyw0Rc/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcRxYEcX78wrGjQXgUUzQ03Tjtf4KcZIx4G6sfyw0Rc/edit#). Please help us fill it out—it could be as simple as dropping a few links or summarizing a few key governance posts from this forum!  Participating in the assessment will help the community better understand Compound’s governance and how it compares with other major blockchain projects (especially important because a lot of other blockchains have forked Compound’s governance), and help make governance better and more transparent for the entire ecosystem. All data and analysis will be made public at the end of the assessment period.  If you’d like to see what a completed assessment looks like, you can see a bunch of examples here [https://cryptogov.net/participating-projects/](https://cryptogov.net/participating-projects/) from projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Uniswap, Tezos, etc.  Feel free to hit me with questions or to use this thread for discussions."

We think being part of Compound would be a valuable addition to the protocol and a great next step for the GUSD.

[GUSD](https://www.gemini.com/dollar) can always be created and redeemed with USD 1:1 on Gemini. As one of the most popular exchanges and fiat on-ramps, we think our users would find Compound’s interest rate markets attractive and bring further growth to the protocol. We also believe Compound and the general DeFi ecosystem can benefit from diversifying exposure to different centralized stablecoins by including trusted, highly regulated issuers like Gemini.

In addition, we are increasingly exploring strategies that can augment Gemini’s value-add to DeFi and support for the ecosystem. These include thinking about possible product integrations and having active relationships with regulators to figure out the friction points and possible solutions that can help us best collaborate with teams like Compound Labs. GUSD could act as a natural gateway asset for these future plans and facilitate possible integrations and support for Compound.

**Proposal**

We propose including a GUSD market with an initial collateral factor of 0% to start with.

Later on, we’d love to have conversations with the Compound community about increasing the collateral factor and adding COMP distribution for the market.

So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It’s a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use “staking” as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

If you, like me, are delighted with passive earnings with DeFi, please share your experience and thoughts. What platforms have you already used?"

I’m in my mid thirties, and I have struggled with debt my whole adult life, I’m still paying for mistakes I made in my 20’s and to make matters worse - I still struggle with CC debt. I’m off the payday loans highway robbery game thank God, but I live pretty close to paycheck-to-paycheck and have my own apartment, in my name, for the first time in about 10 years. The CC debt is part of how I “afford” to live - or more accurately a part of my liquidity strategy to pay my bills - or at least it was until today.

Since learning about Compound, and thinking it was just the best damn idea I’d ever heard, I have been staking whatever I could afford until I finally reached enough staked to borrow the exact amount of my credit card debt, and stay below 60% lent. Well I finally fucking did it and as a grown ass man I don’t tear up easy, but this struggle with constant debt and uncertainty has really been a weight on me these past few years and I can’t help but shed a few as I close these fucking credit accounts forever.

Today own my own debt, today I pay the rate I chose and not one that was chosen by my shitty credit score, today I am finally free of the mistakes of my youth that set me on such a difficult path - and I owe it in it’s entirety to the Compound team, and to the DeFi world in general - without their effort and brilliance I don’t know how I would have ever climbed out of this hole and I just want to say thank you, and that to anyone else in a similar situation you can do the exact same thing - you can take your life back and be your own lending house - your own investment firm - and your own person - thank you all so much, good luck to everyone, and God bless"

This morning I found myself logged out, with a prompt to connect a wallet to log in, with only Metamask, Ledger, Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet as options.

Question 1: Is TrustWallet no longer supported?

Question 2: If TrustWallet is no longer supported, can I use TrustWallet to get my USDC out using the Receive button? I was always planning on hitting unstake in Compound whenever I was ready. 

When I look in my TrustWallet app, I see my staked USDC, but no COMP. 

Question 3: Is my COMP gone? Assuming it's linked to my TrustWallet address, and if I can't log in that way, how can I receive my COMP when unstaking via Compound?

Any help would be VERY much appreciated, thank you!"

I spent on average maximum 5min per day on this page and was watching Netflix with it.

Here is my full proof of all my earnings and payouts: [https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV](https://imgur.com/a/WvRhNBV)  
Most earnings are in BTC (over $200). There are plenty of other coins to earn too but BTC brings the best ratio.  
Link: [https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=SLimon)

DutchyCorp let's you do tasks and surveys where you get awarded Dutchy Coins. With these coins you are able to let a Faucet running and you can get paid in about 50 coins. Payouts to your Coinbase Account are without fees.  
How are you able to earn so much on DutchyCorp:  
\- Do the Coin Rolls and Dutchy Rolls for daily Bonus  
\- Run the Autofaucet on weekend with 20% claim Bonus  
\- Do Surveys on Offerwall to be able to earn more DUTCHY and increase your own level  
\- be active to get some free Coins by the RainBot  
\- Go to the Shortwall and click on the pages on a daily base  
\- Run the AutoFaucet with Balance Mode for additional 10%

I did my payouts directly to Coinbase. Payouts are really fast and after about ten seconds you get confirmation of your withdrawal. If you are new to Coinbase, you can get an additional $10 of Bitcoin after you have bought Bitcoin worth $100 with this link: [https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy\_u](https://www.coinbase.com/join/lussy_u)"

2) What are Compounds direct competitors? Are there any coming down the road?

3) Will they be able to add other token and asset pools over time? How about asset pools that are not ETH/ERC token related?
