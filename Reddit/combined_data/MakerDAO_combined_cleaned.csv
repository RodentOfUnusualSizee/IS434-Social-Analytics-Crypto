They introduced a new “bailout” mechanism.  Such a mechanism was necessary for the market, as automatic auctions did not solve the problem of liquidations of bad debt.  Due to this, the situation with MakerDAO in March 2020 will not happen again.

This counteracts the bull view, which is that at current stability fee rate, MKR is trading at only 20x earnings and growing rapidly. If I could get comfortable around above issue, I’d say buying MKR at these levels is a no brainer

Theo như những thông tin được biết trong khoảng trang web chính thức của GIC, quỹ này được có mặt trên thị trường để quản lý dự trữ ngoại ân hận của Singapore với hơn 100 tỷ đô la Mỹ tài sản tại hơn 40 đất nước trên toàn toàn cầu.

khi mà đấy, Coinbase tiết lộ họ đã huy động được 300 triệu đô la Mỹ trong vòng tài trợ vốn chủ nhân Series E vào tháng 10 năm 2018, đưa trị giá tiền sau huy động của nó vào thời điểm đấy lên đến 8 tỷ đô la.

Với vòng tài trợ do đơn vị đầu cơ Tiger Global Management dẫn dắt, Coinbase tiết lộ thêm vào thời điểm ấy một loạt các người ủng hộ lừng danh với các khoản đầu tư vào ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử – như Y Combinator Continuity, Wellington Management, Andreessen Horowitz và Polychain, cộng với những đơn vị khác. Singapore GIC không nằm trong số những nhà đầu cơ có tên nhắc trên.

The case for $200 UNI - A short thesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/kqtoi2/the_case_for_200_uni_a_short_thesis/,sexydefi,1,2021-01-05 15:58:20,3,/r/ethtrader/comments/kqtoi2/the_case_for_200_uni_a_short_thesis/,Discussion,"UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, which is the most used decentralized exchange ever and likely will be. And it is going to $200 in the coming alt-season, in my humble opinion.

Uniswap's daily volume yesterday crossed $1 billion, not for the first time but it looks like it will sustain at such levels in coming days, weeks and months as ETH has crossed $1000 without much hype and with much criticism. Liquidity is over $2.7 billion, even when there are no incentives.

Institutional liquidity is flowing into Bitcoin and it will soon flow into Eth too. Eth will get it’s CME futures, the OCC has given banks a go ahead for launching stablecoins on public blockchains and Ethereum has the ecosystem and toolset ready for everything that is about to come. After Bitcoin &amp; Eth, DeFi governance tokens will be tokens people would want to hodl. And in that, the top ones. And when the HNIs &amp; institutions (non crypto-native ones) start looking into DeFi, the first thing they’d come to know about is the likes of UNI, Comp, etc., the products which are not much difficult to understand and have good reputation and are decentralized. By the time this happens, Uniswap will also likely be on Optimism with the cash-flow switch turned on. With the interest rates close to zero and negative, P/E ratios can virtually be infinite. That’s another point to add to the value proposition. And don’t forget Uniswap v3.

Besides this, Uniswap is deeply integrated into the DeFi ecosystem and all the projects. MakerDAO now accepts Uniswap LP tokens for minting Dai. And also, think about this as betting on the Uniswap team. We know what the team is capable of and we know they’re highly competent and innovation won’t stop at v3. 

At $200, Uniswap's fully diluted valuation will be $200 billion. So, really, am I being stupid here? Nope. $200 UNI will happen when BTC is above $100k, ETH is over $10k. When we're back to a Jan 2018 type of scenario. I'm not saying that it's an 'if', but a 'when'. Cardano, for context was trading at a fully diluted value of $40 billion in last cycle's alt-season, without any product or users, pure hype.

And of course, $200 won’t be sustainable for the next couple of years at least, but we are early. Even crypto people from 2017 don’t want to hold crypto tokens for a few months. They just want to flip and most end up burning their ETH &amp; BTC. Just by buying now and holding patiently would be rewarding imo.

UNI is between $5 and $5.50 now and I’m putting this out here that UNI is going to $200 in the coming alt-season.

The ""major"" competitor to Uniswap is Sushiswap, but at the end of the day, Sushiswap is just a fork project. They can add new features, refresh their front-end and blah blah but it is what it is- a fork. Sushiswap has volume and liquidity right now only because of its ongoing liquidity incentives. And Uniswap doesn't have it going right now. Look at what happened to Swerve (the Curve fork)- I think that is what will ultimately happen to Sushiswap. Sure, Sushiswap is now a part of Yearn Finance but you don't see new projects providing liquidity for their projects on Sushiswap, you don't see projects celebrating Sushiswap listings. Uniswap is the king in the DEX space.

Balancer and other such tweaked and more innovative AMMs are good but the volume and liquidity on Uniswap speaks for itself.

The high gas fees problem- retail can't use it. Uniswap has shown us already that it can work well on Optimistic Rollups. And Optimism is starting their launch this month. In a few months, this won't be a problem and so we don't have to worry about AMM volumes being drained away to other blockchains.

So what I'm saying is, SEND IT!!!

And above all, do your own research. This is not financial advice. Don’t buy UNI just because I said so. Think for yourself. I'm not responsible for your losses or profits.

I would love to hear what you all think about this :)"

**CZ CEO of Binance highlighted Spartan Protocol:**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=4610&amp;v=8vg-6mMdHYo&amp;feature=emb\_logo

**Description:**

The  Spartan Protocol is a protocol for incentives liquidity and synthetic  assets (assets pegged to the price of another asset) on the Binance  Smart Chain. The core piece of the protocol are liquidity pools, similar  to Uniswap, but instead of a fixed-rate fee model a liquidity-sensitive  fee model similar to THORChain’s slip-based fees is used.

Currently,  liquidity providers (and traders) are penalised on automated-market  maker protocols, such as Uniswap, because of manipulation from  value-extracting arbitrage bots. These arbitrage bots have been around  for a long time now, and suck up millions of liquidity from unknowing  users on a weekly basis.

As  well as, synthetic mining protocols such as MakerDao and Synthetic use  illiquid collateral/markets to liquidate collateral on, which makes it  vulnerable to a downwards spiral which has already caused multiple chain  liquidations in the past.

Spartan  wants to solve these issues through an AMM protocol, through the use of  a single settlement asset and protocol-wide incentives to grow  liquidity. A slip-based fees model is used to reward liquidity providers  rather than slippage bots, a solution discussed and researched a lot by  THORchain. Finally, collateralised pool shares (synthetic assets) are  used instead of liquid collateral. Synthetic assets are generated  through the protocol, using price anchors offered by the liquidity  pools, collaterised by liquidity pool shares. These shares are  on-market, value-stabilised and can instantly be liquidated. Thanks to  this, positions can be liquidated within causing downwards spirals.

The  protocol aims to be community-driven and therefore uses a DAO  (governance) set-up for fee rates, time factors and upgrades of certain  parts of the code (voted on by holders who get incentivised to do so).  But, doesn’t overcomplicate governance or sets high requirements for any  proposal to pass.

Because  the protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain, BNB is required to  use the protocol and pay for fees. Similar to how ETH is used to pay for  gas on the Ethereum Network.

**Summarised, I got interested in Spartan Protocol because:**

* It took the best parts from the most popular AMM protocols, combined them and created a very solid protocol by doing so.
* The  protocol was launched on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a very  unique value proposition at this point, subject to Binance exposure.
* Higher leverage, lower fees and much faster then $SNX
* The SpartanDAO is build directly on smart contracts"

What happens if DAI loses it's peg and goes to $2 for example?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/kt403z/what_happens_if_dai_loses_its_peg_and_goes_to_2/,TheCurious0ne,1,2021-01-08 22:56:06,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/kt403z/what_happens_if_dai_loses_its_peg_and_goes_to_2/,,"So, please bare with me and imagine this scenario.

At 15th Jan, NYAG decided Tether is fraud and/or Tether is unbacked throwing the full power of the US government against it.

Tether obviously loses it's peg and starts racing to $0, that wouldn't be huge deal but it's in every DEX AMM pool with other stables 

So let's make this simple example

in AMM DAI/USDT pool, USDT goes to 0 and DAI goes to $2

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly people that have borrowed $300 worth of DAI against $1000 worth of ETH (at relatively safe margin level of 300%+)

Owe $600 instead of $300.

At the same time other with riskier margin levels get liquadated and ETH price dumps as well, causing even the safe guy above being under collaterized with $600 worth of DAI against $100 worth of ETH (if ETH drops 90%)

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldn't that crash the whole system? And not just makerdao of course but pretty much everything?

I realize this is unconfirmed black swan FUD at this point, but black swans do happen from time to time and I just woud like to know if the above scenario is ralistic if that does happen, your thoughts?"

So where will blockchain go? (Short timeline included),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kthl27/so_where_will_blockchain_go_short_timeline/,cehhiro,1,2021-01-09 10:09:42,15,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kthl27/so_where_will_blockchain_go_short_timeline/,TRADING,"As a quick recap:

1. Bitcoin came with Script code. Very simple, not Turing-complete. (11 years)

2. Peercoin and Namecoin came with purpose-specific uses. Both are active projects but their price is but a shadow with no hopes of recovery. (9 years)

3. Ethereum came with a general-purpose VM. Active project and price is still going. (7 years ago)

4. Token and their projects are basically an application of Ethereum, so they don't count as a ""wave"". (5 years ago)

5. Zilliqa and Aelf came with cross-chain communication to solve sandboxing with prices down 90%. (3 years ago)

6. Uniswap existed before, as well as MakerDAO, but swaps got a lot of public attention with Uniswap 2. Price is still in discovery. (1 year ago)

So the big question is, what's coming this year? A trend is a trend until it isn't, but it seems like every 2 years some new idea is sparked in the community and explodes into the latest fashion. Where are your bets on what's the upcoming bubble?"

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols generate $ 20.18 billion in crypto assets.

Indeed, the pioneer of the segment, MakerDAO, leads the DeFi Pulse ranking. The value of stranded funds (TVL) in this project exceeds $ 4 billion.

Next, the Aave Landing Project and the leading non-depository stock exchange Uniswap follow MakerDAO closely. The TVL of these projects is $ 2.68 billion and $ 2.53 billion, respectively.
In addition, a DeFi user recalls that barely a year ago, the total TVL of the decentralized financial sector was only $ 1 billion.
Finally, we note that recently, DeFi Pulse did not include the so-called “bitcoins on Ethereum” in the overall rating. Their TVL is $ 4.76 billion. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) accounts for almost 80% of the market share in this segment."

Benefits of applying block chain technology in business,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Norajoy/comments/kv1bvz/benefits_of_applying_block_chain_technology_in/,Norajoy,1,2021-01-11 20:01:31,0,/r/u_Norajoy/comments/kv1bvz/benefits_of_applying_block_chain_technology_in/,,"Block chain technology allows new ways of managing economic operations, decreases intermediary-related costs and time, and enhances trust in an ecosystem of participants. An upcoming research stream and different companies that explore the future applications of block chain technology illustrate the influence of this seminal technology. Business from different industry domains[hire dedicated block chain developers](https://dxminds.com/hire-blockchain-developers/)for business growth. Although there are promising use cases of this emerging technology, research and practice on modifying current and developing new business models are still in their infancy.

Benefits of block chain technology in business

**Decentralised**

Decentralisation is also its main asset, being one of the most interesting features of the blockchain. The block chain framework is fully decentralized instead of being stored at some single stage, which implies that it is not possible for an overarching authority to advance its own agenda and manipulate the network. In addition to being a fair district structure, decentralisation often translates into more stability.

**P2P network**

As information between network participants is exchanged and continuously registered, the network becomes stronger with a growing number of participants. An integral and important aspect of block chain technology is a P2P network. Under the block chain network, the word 'peer' applies to the computer system. In this network, a user simultaneously makes use of and provides the basis of the network. Each peer is called a node, and it is considered equal to each of them. 

A peer offers certain services to other users, such as bandwidth, processing speed and disk capacity, without any servers or hosts being centrally coordinated.

**High Security**

Once every block is cryptographically locked, copying, removing or editing is impossible, guaranteeing the digital ledger's immutability. Owing to the very existence of network decentralization, central points of error or failure within the system should never occur. With the lack of weak points for hacking inside the device, there can be zero chances of malicious, which increases the r of the network. In addition, each transaction involves the digital signature by both private and public keys that use distinct cryptographic schemes to ensure maximum encryption.

**Transparency**

In a public, decentralized ledger, it is possible for users to verify and monitor transactions. The entire record of transactions can be seen by any person. Besides, any modification of data is extremely difficult for the program, which is open source. With several eyes glued to the network, any modification is sure to be seen in the logged data, adding to the block chain's transparency and protection.

For companies that want to streamline business processes and issue digital properties, block chain technology has become an integral part of the enterprise software stack. Not all companies need a block chain solution, but the technology can be revolutionary for those who do the technology can be transformational. India is one of the best outsourcing destinations for block chain  development, companies from different industry domains [hire dedicated block chain developers in India](https://dxminds.com/hire-blockchain-developers/) for better block chain solutions.

Block chain can also alter the way you run your company, which includes the following five applications, from day to day.

**Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts are like normal contracts, except that the contract rules are executed on a block chain in real time, which removes the middleman and brings standards of transparency to standard agreements for all parties involved in a way that is not possible. This saves time and money for companies, while still ensuring enforcement from everyone involved.

**Cloud Storage**

Another application that organizations should take advantage of would be cloud storage. Storj, which is still in beta testing at the time of this writing, is one such company that provides stable cloud storage while decreasing dependence.

**Paying Employees**

Since the block chain has its cryptocurrency origins, it only makes sense that it could be used as an employee compensation application.

Let's take a look at some of the real-world block chain technology implementations across different industries,

Hello MakerDAO! (Turkish Review MKR),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/kvd0ch/hello_makerdao_turkish_review_mkr/,Dontcrymebaby,0,2021-01-12 05:48:03,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/kvd0ch/hello_makerdao_turkish_review_mkr/,,"[https://kriptohayat.com/maker-token-mkr-nedir](https://kriptohayat.com/maker-token-mkr-nedir)

# Maker Token (MKR) Nedir?

  
 

**Maker coin**, [**Makerdao (MKR)**](https://makerdao.com/) **merkeziyetsiz** uygulamaya sahiptir. Bu uygulamanın işlevleri ise, Maker karşılığında **DAI** (Stablecoins) basmanıza izin veren bir alt yapısı bulunmasının yanında **merkezi olmayan** kredi alma ve kredi verme platformu olmasıdır.  


Geleneksel piyasada basılan paraların ne yazık ki bir dayanağı yoktur. Merkez bankaları tarafından basılan paraların ucu bucağı yoktur. Hatta bazı merkez bankaları ne kadar para bastıklarını dahi yayınlamamaktadır. Bu paranın doğasına bir ihanettir.  


Makerdao ise Maker kripto parasının işlevlerini ortaya çıkarabileceğiniz bir platformdur. Maker platformu merkeziyetsiz topluluklar tarafından yönetilir ve en küçük paydaş dahi yönetime katılabilir. Maker tokeni DAI basmanın yanında asıl önemli işlevi, bir yönetişim tokeni olmasıdır.  


Maker platformunda yönetişim modelinde yer almak ise oldukça kolaydır. Merkezsiz cüzdanınızda bulunan maker kripto paranız ile yönetimde alınacak her karara katılabilirsiniz.  
**Cüzdanlar, Merkezsiz finans uygulamaları (dApps) ve merkezsiz finans (DeFi)** entegrasyonu olan bu platform yüzlerce ortağa sahiptir. Bu uygulamaların hepsi yönetişime bağlıdır.  


MKR sahipleri, aynı zamanda **Dai stablecoin** için politika ayarlamayı, yeni teminat türlerini seçmeyi ve yönetişimin kendisini iyileştirmeyi içeren Maker Protokolünü yönetmekle de sorumludur. Herkes MKR sahibi olabilir ve herkes merkeziyetsiz finansın yani DeFi’nin geleceğini şekillendirmede projeye katılabilmektedir..  


## Makerdao Kar Payı Veriyor Mu?

Makerdao, maker token üzerinden dolaylı yoldan kar payı dağıtımı yapmaktadır. DAI oluşturma ücretlerinden belirli bir komisyon alan ve buradan sağladığı gelir ile maker token burn mekanizması oluşturan bir platformdur.  


**Token burn** (token yakma) mekanizma mantığı ise **akıllı sözleşmeler** ile belirlenmiştir. Her yeni Dai basıldığında ve Dai’ler geri verildiğinde platform ücreti üreten bu platform, ekosistemine bu ücretleri dağıtarak akıllıca bir ekosistem yaratmayı başarmıştır.

## DAI Kripto Dijital Para Birimi Nedir?

DAI tamamen merkezi olmayan, tarafsız, istikrarlı **kripto para birimi**dir. 1 DAI=1 ABD DOLARI olarak eşitlenmiştir. 1 DAI her zaman 1 dolara eşit olacaktır. DAI’nin bu işlevi istikrarlı bir para olma isteğinden gelmektedir.

DAI ile aynı zamanda bir mesaj göndermek kadar kolay ve hızlı para gönderebilirsiniz. Kripto dijital paranız her daim sizin kontrolünüzde olacaktır. Dijital cüzdanlarınızda DAI’lerinizi saklayabilirsiniz. Böylelikle aracı kurum riskini de ortadan kaldırmış olursunuz.

## Maker (MKR) Analiz, Yorum:

Maker token (MKR) Yorumumuz ise oldukça merkeziyetsiz bir proje olmasından dolayı olumlu yöndedir. **Ethereum** ekosisteminde, ethereum ekosistemi ile uyumlu çalışan ve bir çok siber saldırılara dayanıklı **blokzincir** altyapısı ile insanlara güven vermektedir.  


Henüz yeni çıkmasına rağmen 2021 yılı itibari ile 5 Milyar dolarlık kredi platformu her geçen gün artmaktadır. 2021 yılının başlarında her gün %10 büyüme kaydeden bu miktarın yıl sonunda 100 milyar dolara çıkabileceği beklenmektedir.  


Kripto para platformuna katılan yeni insanların ve yeni yatırımcılar ile beraber çok daha hızlı bir şekilde büyümesini sürdüreceği kaçınılmaz bir gerçekmiş gibi duruyor. **Merkezsiz finans (defi)** uygulamaları arasında kapsayıcılık bakımından lider konumda olan maker platformu, paranızın kontrolünü tamamen sizin elinizde tutmanız açısından da oldukça iyidir.

### Maker token (MKR) fiyatı

**Maker token fiyatı** 2018 de ilk zirvesini görmüştür. 1800 dolara ulaşan ve daha sonra tüm kripto paralar gibi düşüş göstermiştir. Coinbase, Binance gibi büyük kripto para borsalarında işlem gören bu kripto para 2021 yılında büyük bir atak yapmıştır.  


2021 yılı itibari ile zirve fiyatı olan 1800 doları aşarak 2000 dolar seviyelerine ulaşmıştır. Her geçen gün merkezsiz finansın rağbet görmesi ile birlikte, **maker (MKR) fiyatı** da yükseliş göstermeye devam ediyor.

What is DeFi?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronChain/comments/kvqrdi/what_is_defi/,LadyMariann,1,2021-01-12 20:29:31,0,/r/NeuronChain/comments/kvqrdi/what_is_defi/,,"DeFi are financial instruments in the form of services and applications built on the blockchain.   


The main goal of DeFi is to become an alternative to the banking sector by implementing open source protocols. That is, open access to decentralized lending and new investment platforms for a large number of people. And let them receive passive income from cryptocurrency assets, as well as save on fees for transfers, loans and deposits.  


Most of the existing DeFi are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and the most famous project is MakerDAO, a decentralized lending protocol.   


**Advantages of DeFi applications:**  
\- Any user can get one or another financial service, for example, lending, bypassing the bank.   
\- Decentralized landing protocols minimize risks and open access to borrowed funds 24/7.   
\- The procedure for creating your own digital asset and its introduction to the market has become noticeably easier and has become available to almost everyone.   
\- Payment processing does not last several days, but a maximum of a couple of hours  
\- interest rates and commissions have become much lower.   
\- For developers, the ease of creating applications is becoming a clear advantage due to transparency and open source, in addition, DeFi projects can be developed on any platform that interacts with smart contracts.  


**and disadvantages:**  
\- in times of high volatility, DeFi users will have to pay higher commissions to timely fulfill the necessary obligations to services, which in turn can lead to a sharp increase in commissions or to massive liquidation of assets.  
\- the risk of hacking smart contracts, since there remains a need to trust the smart contract code that is written by a person.  
\- centralization of data flow.  
\- DeFi loans are inferior to loans in the traditional finance sector, since the amounts that can be obtained with the appropriate collateral are relatively small.

UniLend Finance - Unlocking the True Potential of Decentralized Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jamm77_/comments/kvvbgj/unilend_finance_unlocking_the_true_potential_of/,jamm77_,1,2021-01-13 00:47:50,0,/r/u_jamm77_/comments/kvvbgj/unilend_finance_unlocking_the_true_potential_of/,," Since the launch of DeFi Applications in the crypto space, the sector has exploded and I believe it will be even bigger in 2021. DeFi which stands for Decentralized Finance, essentially cuts out the middleman i.e. banks via the use of Decentralized Applications (Dapps) allowing users to have more control over their finances no matter who they are, their background and where they live making it extremely appealing. You can also earn interest on certain assets at a much higher rate when compared to a traditional bank which is a big attraction for many too. For more information on DeFi please check out my other post- [What is DeFi?](https://www.publish0x.com/cryptojamm/what-is-defi-xyvkkzy)

The more prominent Dapps in the DeFi realm currently are MakerDAO, Compound, Aave as well as others. There is however one project that has recently come to light and is bridging the gaps that other projects are lacking, they are UniLend Finance. Currently the DeFi space is rather fragmented, as users with specific requirements will find themselves hopping between multiple Dapps to fulfil their requests making the experience not so streamlined and convoluted. UniLend Finance wants to change this for the better by streamlining processes and incorporating everyday useful features into their DeFi solution such as:

* Spot Trading
* Lending/Borrowing
* Governance Model
* Tokenization of Assets
* Permission-less Listing of Tokens

## What is UniLend?

I first heard of UniLend Finance back in September 2020, where they raised $3.1M in seed and private sale rounds and gained attraction from some of the biggest companies and individuals in the crypto industry including Woodstock Fund, Signal Ventures, Bibox, TRG Capital, Sandeep Nailwal (Matic Network co-founder) and many others. A full list can be found here: [https://unilend.medium.com/unilend-successfully-raises-3-1m-7dc6f950dfa](https://unilend.medium.com/unilend-successfully-raises-3-1m-7dc6f950dfa)

From doing further research I was intrigued and very much interested in what they have set out to achieve and have been following them ever since. UniLend Finance is essentially a DeFi protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and services through smart contracts. Thereby creating a permission-less and decentralized platform for users to engage with for all their finance needs by providing them an all-in-one solution, something that has yet to be done in the DeFi space and thus differentiating it from other products. UniLend has been built from the ground up to truly revolutionize DeFi.

The limitation with existing DeFi platforms is that they act as a gatekeeper in selecting which projects to be a part of their pool which means other viable assets are blocked and unable to participate in the DeFi ecosystem. UniLend does not behave in such a way and allows for a permissionless listing which enables any ERC20 token to be listed making it a truer decentralized and fairer platform.

In conjunction with permissionless listing, the UniLend platform incorporates spot trading functionality for its users allowing them to trade their assets in-platform, meaning users don't have to leave the platform for this specific requirement. These two unique features make UniLend a very appealing product as they are the first DeFi platform to do this. Other features of the UniLend platform include:

* Lending and Borrowing - Assets can be used as collateral to be borrowed against as well as for lending to earn interest.
* Liquidity - By becoming a liquidity provider (LP) users are able to receive fees in proportion to their liquidity pool stake, allowing participants to earn additional tokens on idle assets.
* Governance - The UniLend protocol will be governed through its token holders via proposals ensuring that any adjustments to the protocol are made with a majority consensus.
* Native Utility Token - The native utility token of UniLend will be $UFT the UniLend Finance Token. This token will have numerous use cases for governance, platform utility and much more.

## The UniLend Team

As for the team in charge of the Unilend project, they have a wealth of experience that I strongly feel will help bring the platform to fruition. The Co-founder and CEO Chandresh Aharwar was Vice President of Marketing and Strategy at Matic Network, another successful and popular crypto based project. He therefore brings a lot of knowledge and experience to the table from his work at Matic. Suryansh Kumar is the CTO and prior to this co-founded MetaTransact protocol, which is also another crypto platform that allows users to pay gas fees in tokens instead of Ether. And Tarun Malik who is their CPO also co-founded MetaTransact together with Suryansh. Together with the other team members, UniLend can achieve big things in the Defi realm.

## UniLend Features

As discussed earlier in this article, there are already some established DeFi Dapps, however all have a missing functionality and thus do not provide that all in one solution that will cater for various DeFi users. This means users will have to keep swapping between those Dapps that will help fulfil their requirements. UniLend has plugged this hole, and has released a series of articles on how they differ. Let us start with:

##### UniLend Vs Compound

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 05\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/ysruw2o7jxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b04e1a4c2a7abce5035b634ff6d028130bc2c093)

Compound does not have the ability to support any asset without the involvement of community proposals and voting, UniLend on the other hand allows users to list any Ethereum-based asset in a permission-less manner. Spot trading is another feature missing from Compound which UniLend have incorporated that will allow users to participate in decentralized spot trading of listed assets.

##### UniLend Vs Balancer

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 07\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/i4dqut5ajxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64996ace2a47241484598373ac9da3ce789812be)

From the image above the main differences between UniLend and Balancer is that Balancer lacks lending and borrowing services as well as the option for users to tokenize their assets. Borrowing and lending services is a fundamental part of DeFi as it allows users to borrow against their assets by using it as collateral, and also earn interest through lending it is therefore great to see that it will be part of the UniLend protocol. Tokenizing ones assets will also play a big part for users as it permits them to unlock the farming potential of any assets they hold. Farming is the process of obtaining extra tokens by providing liquidity to liquidity pools enabling the user to maximise returns on their holdings.

It is important to note that UniLend recognise the Balancer DEX platform as one of the leaders in the space so much so that $UFT can be traded seamlessly on the Balancer protocol.

##### UniLend Vs Maker

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 11\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/5pmwlokdjxa61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6105cd0d39be02d178f116935593d2c35b7c35d5)

The differences between UniLend and Maker are quite distinguished, Maker primarily centres around the stablecoin DAI and therefore is limited in the number of assets it supports. There is no spot trading facility as the Maker protocol's main initiative is to regulate the DAI supply, therefore their lending and borrowing services will pay any interest in DAI as well generate DAI against collateralized assets. UniLend's money market on the other hand is a free market, where any ERC20 token can be listed, borrowed and lent out as well as traded.

As someone who has used the Oasis.app platform, which is Maker's DeFi Dapp I can say that it is rather limited and not very exciting to use.

##### UniLend Vs Uniswap

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 17\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/fjuni73fjxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28e1747e6f2db651afecaeccc34a89bdba072ce0)

Uniswap at the time of writing is the most popular decentralized exchange according to [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/) based on the Total Value Locked (TVL) but still does not offer users a complete one-stop shop for their DeFi needs. As Uniswap is essentially a DEX it does not offer any borrowing or lending services, whereas UniLend places huge emphasis on being a platform that allows people to borrow and lend any ERC20 asset. UniLend also intend on being an interoperable platform meaning that they will be able to list assets from other blockchains and not be restricted to just Ethereum. The main similarity to point out is that both platforms allow for permission-less listing, permitting users to list any token onto the platform creating a free market for trading tokens and increasing liquidity. I believe this is an important attribute to have for any platform as it opens up the platform to a much larger market and will give users flexibility.

Unilend have openly acknowledged that they hold Uniswap in high esteem especially as they are the current market leader for DEXs, and as a result have taken inspiration from them which is definitely understandable and a great thing for them to do. But UniLend are also expanding on this by opening up their platform to those who wish to borrow or lend their assets as well as tokenize them. which will cater for those who want this facility creating a truer DeFi experience.

##### UniLend Vs Aave

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 24\/11\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/6hvhe12hjxa61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99ba3e9923d038981269a50e1bd1a4d32c181729)

Aave is one of the largest cryptocurrency money markets currently and has been growing in popularity since its inception, playing an important role in the world of DeFi. And they have managed to achieve this without incorporating 2 features that I feel are critical to DeFi- the support of any ERC-20 asset and spot trading. By not having the mechanism to provide a permission-less listing means Aave are limited in the number of assets they can list and therefore limited in the type of user they attract. And by not offering the ability to spot trade in-platform will more than likely result in users going elsewhere for this facility. UniLend have opted to have an in-platform spot trading facility and this is something that I feel is better to have than not have and will result in users not having to leave the platform for this feature. It is important to recognise that Aave have come a long way in a short span of time and are continuously pushing the boundaries in the space.

##### UniLend Vs bZx

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 12\/12\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/vx67fufjjxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48a29e5ae50761038f9356aa124238242a47413d)

From the image above, bZx is missing 3 key features and thus denying these benefits to their users- the ability to support any asset, spot trading and the tokenization of assets. With UniLend they will be supporting any ERC-20 based asset which opens the market up for users making it more appealing knowing they can trade practically any asset without any restrictions. UniLend will also permit the tokenization of assets making it possible to farm additional tokens in return.

##### UniLend Vs Cream

&amp;#x200B;

[Image as of 09\/01\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/d1h7uwaljxa61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a52eb7cbffb3098af55994589cca178669ff959)

When comparing UniLend with Cream Finance the main difference is that Cream does not support the listing of any asset without first going through a governance process, whereas UniLend does not making it easier for users to list assets. Based on user feedback it also seems that while Cream does have the ability to trade assets, users can only do so if they are providing liquidity to the said token, which can act as a hinderance. In addition to this, there is also an issue with the lend/borrow feature as users must make many transactions in order to achieve their goal, again making it difficult for users to participate in. UniLend have recognised these issues with the Cream Finance UX and have confirmed that their UX will be seamless.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tat46bonjxa61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da985ff8cd8e5a2e3d0e976ac20a52f32062384

Above is a side by side comparison of all the aforementioned DeFi protocols.

## Roadmap

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bi9qmyepjxa61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d84c3f88723e65adef4c13fdab9faa52c374071e

Since UniLend's inception in Q3 of 2020, they have so far completed the following milestones as per their roadmap:

* UniLend Swap Feature
   * This feature consists of an automated market making pool which negates the need for centralized components and maintains the liquidity needed to support trading in addition to lending and borrowing, in a completely decentralized manner.
* UniLend Lending Smart Contract
   * UniLend's lending smart contract works differently to existing lending protocols and it thus required a complete custom development. This was completed in Q3 of 2020. Instead of going down the normal route of using multi-asset pools, the UniLend protocol consists of separate pools for different assets (multi-pool system). Creating separate pools for each token is an essential architecture-level advancement that opens up UniLend for permissionless DeFi options whilst limiting exposure of lenders and borrowers to any potential risks associated with all tokens in a specific pool.
* UniLend's Alpha Release - Initium is now live
   * Released on 29th December 2020.
   * This release contains four main functions relating to the lending and borrowing functionality - Borrow, Lend, Redeem and Repay. Borrow and Repay are functions for borrowers on UniLend, and Lend and Redeem are functions for lenders.

Updates to look forward to in Q1 of 2021:

* Liquidity Mining/Staking
   * Liquidity providers are a key component in ensuring the sustainability of a decentralized finance protocol by facilitating liquidity within the protocol. Once the full-featured platform is launched, LPs will be rewarded for their service with governance rights in the form of UFT tokens, in addition to a percentage of trading and borrowing fees.
* UniLend Beta Release
   * This release will entail the launch of a production-level platform which includes all the comprehensive features of the UniLend protocol.
* Comprehensive Audit Report Release
   * UniLend have been working with the best audit teams in the industry since the early days of the project and they will undergo comprehensive audits to ensure the platform is secure and not prone to any vulnerabilities. This report is then to be shared with the community.
* UniLend Mainnet Launch
   * The fully-featured UniLend protocol/platform will launch towards the end of Q1 of 2021. By this point the protocol will have been battle-tested and will offer all of its comprehensive features, including decentralizing trading, lending/borrowing, and liquidity mining all running on mainnet. UniLend will then be accessible to anyone and everyone for all DeFi functionality.
* Integrations and UniLend Ecosystem Expansion
   * Pending third-party integrations upon launch of mainnet include:
      * Wallets - Confirmed Frontier Wallet
      * Aggregators
      * Partner Platforms (external integrations) - Confirmed partner includes CryptoLocally
      * Partner Platforms (internal integrations) - Confirmed partners include OpenDeFi, CyberFi and 3Commas
* Fusion Farming
   * Is a mechanism by which users will be able to attain multiple tokens via liquidity mining for certain assets. Farming campaigns will be initiated for certain projects' tokens which are listed on UniLend. During these campaigns, users who provide liquidity for specific tokens will be able to secure both UFT and the token in question via liquidity mining,

## Partnerships and Integrations

##### [CryptoLocally](https://cryptolocally.com/en)

UniLend have teamed up with CryptoLocally, who are a community run P2P trading platform. CryptoLocally will also use UniLend's lending and borrowing services, allowing for more ERC20 based staking within their Finance Wallet. As a result of this partnership, UniLend's native token UFT has been added to the CryptoLocally platform for trade.

##### [CyberFi](https://cyberfi.tech/)

CyberFi is a non-custodial intelligent automation platform that is reshaping the DeFi experience. This partnership with UniLend will make all their tools accessible to UniLend users, which includes automation tools that will allow users to automate their lending and borrowing as well as execute a borrow or lend position on a token based on a specified price. It is thought that  the tools CyberFi is integrating into the UniLend ecosystem will add immense value to the community making it much more convenient and efficient especially as it allows for smart lending solutions.

##### [StaFi](https://stafi.io/)

Staking finance protocol StaFi will be joining the UniLend ecosystem in bringing their unique rTokens onto the platform. rTokens have the ability to enable users to utilize their staked tokens on DeFi protocols such as UniLend, and integrating these tokens opens the door to a new stream of liquidity on the UniLend platform that will enable users to take advantage of new avenues of yield generation.

##### [CoinDCX](https://coindcx.com/)

UniLend has entered into a strategic collaboration with Coinbase funded CoinDCX, India's largest and safest cryptocurrency exchange with daily trading volumes exceeding $15 million. Through this collaboration, CoinDCX users will have access to new DeFi capabilities, powered by UniLend from directly within the exchange and includes UFT farming. CoinDCX is spearheading the crypto revolution for both retail and industry players and has chosen to become UniLend's official liquidity provider.

##### [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/)

ProBit, one of the largest and most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges in the World, joins the UniLend's ecosystem to offer DeFi functionality to their users. It is thought that ProBit's strong user base and global outreach will increase the strength of liquidity on UniLend whist contributing to the overall momentum of DeFi together. This collaboration will accelerate DeFi adoption by bringing CEX users into DeFi. The partnership between UniLend Finance and ProBit Exchange will explore possibilities for ProBit users to interact with tokens listed on UniLend without leaving the ProBit platform via UniLend's permission-less listing capabilities. This will include the ability to liquidity mine $UFT tokens by providing liquidity to UniLend. And for UniLend users this will mean the farming of $UFT tokens. ProBit is currently one of the top 20 cryptocurrency exchanges in the World with over 800,000 monthly active users and with over 100,000 members in their community.

##### [3Commas](https://3commas.io/)

3Commas is a cryptocurrency trading tool platform with the goal of making trading easy via automated trading bots. They are now looking to break into the DeFi space via their collaboration with UniLend. The 3Commas platform works with most major cryptocurrency exchanges and includes features such as dollar-cost averaging bots, portfolios, and more. They will thus be bringing this suite of sophisticated tools to the UniLend protocol including the Smart Trade Bot, which enables traders to take profit, utilize stop loss features and sell at multiple targets in a manually automated trading fashion.

##### [OpenDeFi](https://opendefi.finance/)

This collaboration will allow UniLend to offer trading, lending and borrowing of synthetic real-world assets. This will also give rise to a larger addressable market cap of these assets, which has now increased by an additional $15 trillion. The OpenDeFi protocol will facilitate bringing physical real-world assets (such as gold and silver) into the DeFi space, so that they can be integrated with DeFi protocols. OpenDeFi will assimilate real-world assets onto the blockchain by utilizing synths, or synthetic assets, that can tokenize real-world assets. On OpenDeFi, all of the tokenized versions of the real-world assets will be backed 1:1 by the real-world assets themselves. These assets will be held by a custodian, and not the company to ensure investments are secured. It has been noticed that there is a growing demand for real-world assets to be integrated into DeFi markets, which UniLend is capitalizing on by leveraging the OpenDeFi protocol.

##### [Fire Protocol](https://fireprotocol.io/)

Fire Protocol enables cross-chain asset support while offering new and robust money markets and DEX/swap features, all while maintaining high speeds, cost-effective transactions, and security via Huobi Eco Chain. The integration with UniLend is set to bring more assets onto the Huobi Eco Chain allowing it to grow frictionlessly alongside those on Ethereum. In addition to this, both teams are working together to explore wrapped $UFT on the Huobi Eco Chain, which will open a vast array of opportunities for holders. Interoperability is also a common interest and both teams agree this will play a big part in the DeFi realm, Fire Protocol has their own cross-chain technology.

##### [Nord Finance](https://nordfinance.io/) (Most Recent)

Nord Finance will integrate UniLend Finance into the Nord Advisory portion of their tech stack. This will enable new DeFi investing strategies for the DeFi community. In addition to this, the UniLend protocol  will be used in conjunction with Nord's proprietary algorithm, which ultimately assists with users' goal-orientated diversified portfolio management. Nord Finance has been designed as a block-chain agnostic platform with multi-chain interoperability, where their aim is to offer users easy access to a plethora of financial products including, but not limited to, yield-farming aggregation, funds management, robo-advisory and loans against assets.

## Conclusion

UniLend have clearly made an impact in the DeFi space since their inception just 3 months ago. Within this time they have made important partnerships and integrated with numerous exchanges, this shows they are a serious player in the DeFi sector. They have been listed on India's biggest exchange CoinDCX and also ProBit in South Korea, with the latter allowing them to tap into a huge market of over 800,000 monthly active users. Many of these partnerships will  not only give access to a wider audience but also a broader range of user. India as well more recently have taken a softer stance towards crypto based projects and I believe have recognised their value towards the economy. India is also home to 1.3 billion people where the average age is 29, a prime demographic for DeFi related products.

The UniLend mission is to become a one-stop shop for all your cryptocurrency borrowing, trading or lending needs. They have recognised that existing DeFi protocols will have one specific feature such as lending/borrowing but then lack another, creating a merry-go-round for the average DeFi user that is looking to maximise the potential of their assets. With UniLend they have all the major DeFi bases covered catering to all kinds of users allowing them more control over their assets. The permission-less listing of tokens feature will give users access to over 6000 tokens allowing UniLend to tap into a $16.7 billion untouched market, I should also point out that this is not a standard feature found on most other platforms. The facility to allow spot trading from within the platform will mean users won't have to leave the platform in order to trade one token for another. The tokenization of assets and governance model will enable users to farm tokens and also vote on key changes respectively. Borrowing and Lending is the bread and butter of the DeFi world and therefore has been incorporated into the UniLend protocol but now having access to over 6000 token will attract many more users to the platform. Attracting users to the platform is something that the team have really mulled over and have come up with a number of incentives for those who utilize the UniLend protocol from LPs to general platform users. Their governance model will allow $UFT holders to vote on proposals which require a majority consensus to be implemented. Ecosystem participants who use UniLend for lending, borrowing, or trading will be rewarded with governance power in the form of $UFT tokens, the same will go for any LPs. 15% of the total $UFT token supply will be allocated to liquidity mining and yield farming rewards. UniLend have definitely ticked all the right boxes in ensuring their product will reach as many people as possible in bringing the benefits of DeFi to those who want it. 

But at the end of the day the crypto industry is about bringing out working products as per the whitepaper and roadmap, and UniLend have stuck to their roadmap with the launch of their Alpha Release- Initium. As mentioned previously this release contains a sleek interface that exhibits 4 main functions relating to the lending and borrowing functionality, it can be found here- [https://app.unilend.finance/](https://app.unilend.finance/) . This is a good indication that the team can deliver what they have set out. And therefore I look forward to the launch of the UniLend mainnet towards the end of this quarter Q1 2021. The team leading this project have done extremely well thus far and based on their crypto backgrounds I believe they are well qualified in taking this project to the finish line. I very much look forward to using the platform for maximising any gains especially as UniLend have ensured that all coding will be audited by external teams and this will be a huge comfort to participants. Enter [UniLend Finance](https://unilend.finance/), the protocol that will enable users to fully unlock the true potential of decentralized finance.

As of 12/01/2021 the $UFT token is trading at $0.49 and can be found on:

Stablecoins Pros and Cons,https://www.reddit.com/r/DEXFin/comments/kxthxb/stablecoins_pros_and_cons/,dexfinplatform,1,2021-01-15 20:21:42,0,/r/DEXFin/comments/kxthxb/stablecoins_pros_and_cons/,," 

An essential feature of today’s cryptocurrency markets is high volatility. The prices of crypto assets can rise one day and plummet the next day. While some crypto investors have experienced serious losses, smart investors are using stablecoins to reduce risk.

Taking into account that stablecoins are starting to become truly mainstream, and are turning into a useful tool for managing price volatility and reducing risks, we’ll focus on several important aspects of stable coins that every cryptocurrency investor should be aware of.

## What Is a Stablecoin?

Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency which keeps a stable price and is not affected by a rise and fall in the market. Tether (USDT) is one of the most popular stablecoins. It’s a crypto coin that is consistently priced at $1. As the market continues to become unstable and unpredictable, stablecoins are gaining more popularity. The more the crypto price drops, the more people are being drawn towards stablecoins. Investors convert some of their regular cryptocurrency into stablecoins so that even if the market collapses, the actual holding price in USD remains stable.

Imagine this situation. After buying Bitcoin for 5,000 USD, it went up to 10,000 USD, but the market started to crack again. If you keep holding BTC, you may end up losing some of your profit. If you want to keep the dollar value stable, you can invest in stablecoins whose prices rarely change.

## What Are The Types of Stablecoins?

There are several [types of stablecoins](https://defiprime.com/stablecoins), depending on the backing used to make their price stable:

* Stablecoins backed by fiat.
* Stablecoins backed by crypto.
* Stablecoins backed by assets and commodities.

Depending on the platform used, stablecoins can be based on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), EOS (EOS), and more.

### Stablecoins Backed by Fiat

This is one of the most popular types of stable coin. The crypto coins with fiat backing are the easiest to create because they are pegged to a fiat currency like the USD. This stablecoin is created in such a way that a certain number of currencies (typically USD) are collected, and then cryptocurrencies are pegged at a 1:1 ratio to this backing currency.

Nonetheless, this type of stable altcoin requires regular checks to ensure that the backing currency from which the stablecoin was issued is not removed. This method of creating a stablecoin should involve a third-party custodian who acts as a guarantor that the fiat currency truly supports it. Examples of stablecoins with fiat backing are [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [USDC (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/), and [TrueUSD (TUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/).

### Stablecoins Backed by Other Cryptos

Crypto-pegged stablecoins are the second type of cryptocurrencies with stable prices. These classes of crypto coins made a recent appearance on the market. Some examples of this type of stablecoin are: [Dai (DAI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/), Ethereum-based stablecoin. [EOSDT (EOSDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eosdt/), USD-pegged decentralized stablecoin based on the EOS blockchain and the Equilibrium framework. [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/) backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio.

### Stablecoins Backed by Assets and Commodities

These types of crypto coins are backed by commodities, such as gold, silver, oil, and other commodities and assets. The value/price of these stablecoins is, again, stated in fiat currency, typically USD. An example is [Digix Gold Token (DGX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/digix-gold-token/) where 1 DGX reportedly represents 1 gram of gold on Ethereum.

## Stablecoins Pros

Stablecoins come with several benefits. Let’s see why stablecoins are popular with traders and the entire cryptocurrency market.

### Safety in Unstable Times

The biggest advantage of stablecoin is the fact that it provides security during periods of market fluctuations. This can be seen when the market experiences a sharp collapse. Crypto coins like Tether (USDT) and other stablecoins help traders stabilize during these turbulent times in the marketplace. By ensuring that the price remains stable, the trader’s holdings remain the same. Traders can reinvest in the market when the price starts rising again.

### Store of Value

This feature applies to both stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, one of the great features of stablecoins is that it serves as a store of value and can be utilized as a digital currency, and can be used for buying goods or services online. In this case, stablecoins are especially useful.

### Standardization

By acting as a standard store of value, a stablecoin could be a benchmark in the economy of cryptocurrencies. Given that stablecoin is consistent across a variable dominant market, these collateral-pegged currencies are useful for those searching for a unit of measure to compare market values. Conventionally, the price of stable coins remains unchanged irrespective of the rate the market moves at.

Stablecoin has also been widely used in countries where the government shows less interest in cryptocurrencies. For example, many people in India started buying stablecoins. As the central bank bans transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges, Indian crypto investors are converting their assets into stablecoins.

## Stablecoins Cons

Stablecoins also have their disadvantages. Let’s take a closer look at some of them.

### Dependent on the Asset

These currencies can be risky because they are completely dependent on underlying assets. If the price or value of the underlying asset weakens, it affects the token and all its holders. This is exemplified through the Saudi Riyal fiat currency. Saudi Riyal is pegged to the US dollar, and anytime the global value of the US dollar rises or falls, the same is replicated on the Riyal as well.

Crypto-pegged stakes can be much riskier. If the crypto market falls sharply and the cryptocurrency falls to a very low price, the stablecoin backed by such a crypto will also face a sudden collapse, causing losses.

### Not for Investors

Stablecoins are designed to keep their value/price stable which might be a plus for holders (hodlers). But they do not grow in value over time. If you buy stablecoins for 1,000 USD, their value will most probably be the same $1,000 after a year or five years, which won’t give you any profit.

### Not Completely Decentralized

For real crypto enthusiasts, decentralization is the key point. But stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies and other assets are not completely decentralized.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tether (USDT)

[Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) is a well-known and largely utilized stablecoin. This cryptocoin is fixed to the US dollar at a ratio of 1:1, meaning 1 USDT equals 1 US dollar. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of dollars in reserves that should be equal to the number of USDT in circulation.

### Passive Income With Tether (USDT)

Instead of term deposits with returns usually lower than the rate of inflation, you can use staking when you lock your crypto assets at an exchange, typically for a year.

&gt;**Staking USDT at** [**DEXFIN Exchange**](https://trade.dexfin.com/) **earns you 11% per year; on top of that, you can get 11% per year with DEXFIN (DXF) token, 4.8% with BTC, and 20% with VICTORIA VR (VR).**

### USDC (USDC)

[USDC (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) is another stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Every USDC in circulation is backed by USD that should be held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury Bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, states that USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions. The Centre Consortium has two founding members – the Coinbase crypto exchange and the peer-to-peer payment services company Circle. This consortium is open to other crypto companies.

### Dai (DAI)

[Dai (DAI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) stablecoin wasn’t launched by a private company but via a software protocol by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The currency is backed by the US dollar, but it’s fully supported by Ethereum. The price of each Dai is one US dollar. To maintain price stability, DAI is collateralized by a mix of cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart-contract vaults every time new DAI is minted.

### Binance USD (BUSD)

[Binance USD (BUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/), launched in September 2019, focuses on maintaining 1:1 ratio with USD. BUSD is a digital fiat currency, issued as ERC-20 token, supporting BEP-2 (Binance Chain Evolution Proposal 2).

### TrueUSD (TUSD)

[TrueUSD (TUSD)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/) is another widely utilized stable coin. TrueUSD is a stablecoin launched by its parent company TrustToken and described as “the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US dollar.” This cryptocurrency is fixed at the ratio of 1 TUSD to 1 USD. Nonetheless, with regards to the market cap, it is far from the Tether (USDT), and from USDC.

### Diem

Diem Coin from [Diem Association](https://www.diem.com/en-us/association/), formerly known as [Libra](https://blog.dexfin.com/crypto-world/libra-takes-it-all/), is one of the latest additions to stablecoins. Diem Coins are set to be backed by a reserve of assets made up of fiat currencies or cash equivalents and very short-term government securities.

### CBDC

Central banks in over 45 countries (as of May 2020) are exploring ways to create a stable [CBDC](https://blog.dexfin.com/crypto-world/central-banks-exploring-blockchain/) (Central Bank Digital Currency), often with the use of a limited form of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). Some of the reasons for doing so is the issue with the current fiat money printed out of thin air.

## Stablecoins Among the Top Players

Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that differs from others because it comes with a stable value that doesn’t change. Nonetheless, one of the biggest concerns about stablecoins is whether they’re pegged to the fiat currency or the commodity they claim, given that there is considerable ambiguity in investigating and confirming these collaterals.

Currently, Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) are among the top players in the industry, and as additional names like USDC, BUSD, and DAI come up, more and more investors might appreciate the value and usefulness of these stablecoins. As one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value, Tether’s incredible success shows that stablecoin could be an important element to have in your crypto portfolio these days."

&gt;Децентрализованные финансы (DeFi) продемонстрировали свою значительную роль в криптографических деньгах, особенно поздно. Благодаря таким предприятиям, как UniSwap, Compound и MakerDao, децентрализованные деньги превратились в нечто большее, чем катастрофа ICO на поверхностном уровне 2017 года, центром которой были токен-сделки и краудфандинг, а не сертифицированное бескорыстное развитие.  
&gt;  
&gt;У DeFi многое делает решающий шаг, от этого нельзя отказаться. Соглашения о ссуде, торговые возможности, самоуправляемые обмены - все это через исполнение неразрешенного хитроумного соглашения. Предприятия DeFi 2020 проделали особенно невероятную работу по расширению области кредитования и получения и включают в себя очевидные существенные препятствия в нынешней крипто-атмосфере, аналогично централизации криптовалютных сделок.

**Проблема DeFi**  
Это ни в коем случае не проверяет проблемы, с которыми сталкивается DeFi прямо сейчас. Добавьте к этому растущие расходы на газ, незащищенные строгие соглашения (один сломанный фрагмент кода может привести к полной потере активов), нестабильную организацию, отсутствие защиты ресурсов и не очень хороший UX, для того, чтобы решить эти проблемы. Очевидно, много задач по силам. Например, причиной проблемы с DeFi на удивление является отсутствие децентрализации.

В основном это связано с тем, что новые задачи, подобные, например, DEX, не готовы к работе с огромной клиентской базой без, вероятно, некоторых экспериментов. Без устранения ошибок и аварий тонна наличных денег может быть потеряна или даже распылена. Реформистская децентрализация - это полуновая методология, при которой администрирование предлагается клиентам в течение длительного времени, а не в то же время, когда дела могут быстро пойти на юг без наилучшего возможного направления.

**Ставки** \- это способ заинтересовать вашу криптовалюту путем утверждения обменов в публичной цепочке блоков, и это не новость. С момента зарождения криптовалюты существовали разные его циклы. Подумайте о майнинге, но без всего оборудования, высоких счетов за электроэнергию, постепенного уменьшения вознаграждения и, очевидно, постоянной опасности нападения 51%. ставка криптовалюты похожа на хранение денег в банке. В любом случае, у обычного банковского вклада есть очевидные недостатки, во-первых, вы добились централизации.

**Swan Finance** \- это расширение между вселенными инкорпорированных и децентрализованных денег. Он дает лучшее из двух вселенных. SwanFinance предлагает простой в использовании интерфейс для получения процентов, в то время как SwanCredit предоставляет децентрализованный этап совместного кредитования.

SwanFinance - это децентрализованная денежная стадия, на которой клиенты получают высокий доход от цифровых валют, которые они решили хранить на сцене. Размещая токены SWAN, зарегистрированные клиенты могут получить значительно более высокую премию, до 20% годовых.

Swan Finance is a Blockchain innovation based environment that is turning into a scaffold between a unified customary monetary framework and a decentralized framework through the environment created by their group, which will give another Blockchain-based environment in which the environment incorporates two frameworks into one spot. Their environment offers a stage with a simple to-utilize interface for things like procuring interest on resources conveyed, distributed loaning, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Its clients store their resources on the Swan stage to procure interest through alluring APYs, what's more, clients can utilize their crypto assets as guarantee and loan to others to get extra interest when utilizing the stage in the environment. The environment created by Swan Finance has different other intriguing highlights, for example, a completely utilitarian trade and edge exchanging, interests in which clients can appreciate similar capacities as conventional frameworks, a wallet that gives a spot to securely store resources, exchanging with the stage, which can be coordinated with AI and an installment work that permits clients to utilize their crypto resources for pay for different administrations or different things. Their biological system is exceptionally finished and disentangles the client experience without utilizing another stage. Recently, fortified by globalization, mechanical headway and fortifying overall competition, there has been a creating design towards the extending institutional and land gathering of financial systems and markets. All the while, there has been mounting insightful and methodology premium in the financing issues looked by new and little firms, which are commonly considered to encounter the evil impacts of a subsidizing hole. These twin headways give the motivation to this paper, which attempts to throw some theoretical and observational light on whether the spatial relationship of the cash related system impacts on the movements of subsidizing to little firms across regions. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has exhibited to be a critical part in cryptographic cash, especially beginning late. With adventures like UniSwap, Compound, and MakerDao, decentralized cash has set up itself as more than the surface-level ICO catastrophe of 2017, whose middle was token arrangements and crowdfunding instead of genuine, unselfish turn of events.

 That isn't regardless, checking the issues defying DeFi at this moment. Append rising gas charges, unprotected sharp arrangements (one broken piece of code can achieve a complete loss of resources), an insecure association, a nonattendance of asset insurance, and a not excellent UX, it will take some immense basic intuition aptitudes to address these issues. Clearly, a ton of assignments are fit. For example, a supporter of the issue with DeFi is  surprisingly  a nonappearance of decentralization. This is generally because new errands, like a DEX for example, aren't set up to manage a colossal customer base without presumably some experimentation. Without working out the bugs and wreck ups, a huge load of money could be lost or even pounded. Reformist decentralization is a semi-new procedure, where organization is offered out to customers as time goes on, versus simultaneously where things can quickly go south without the most ideal bearing. Swan Finance goes probably as a framework between the universes of united and decentralized cash. It gives the best of the two universes. SwanFinance offers an easy to use interface for securing interest, while SwanCredit gives a decentralized stage to shared crediting. While the crypto stores are securely made sure about on the SwanFinance stage obtaining income, customers can use their crypto stores as an assurance and advance to others to procure additional interest on the SwanCredit stage through an Automatic Credit Swap. We use an ERC20 token called SWAN. Use the SWAN token to get the prosperity rate. Stake SWAN tokens to acquire higher premium, up to 20% APY on SWAN tokens, and up to 12% APY for various computerized types of cash recorded underneath. You can pick one month or multi-month store lockup periods. Interest is paid out at standard stretches using the SWAN token.

 works as an expansion between the joined and decentralized cash universe. It gives the best of the two universes. SwanFinance offers a simple to-utilize interface for procuring interest, while SwanCredit gives a decentralized stage to common credits. While the crypto shop is safely made sure about at the SwanFinance phase of procuring, customers can use their crypto shop as protection and loan to others to acquire additional interest at the SwanCredit stage through Automatic Credit Exchange. SwanFinance is a decentralized cash stage where customers acquire significant yields from advanced monetary standards that they choose to keep in front of an audience. By marking SWAN tokens, enlisted customers can procure a lot higher charges, up to 20% APY. We began with SwanFinance. Nonetheless, this is just the start of the Swan Ecosystem which will include: SwanCredit, SwanInvestments, SwanPay, Swan.Exchange, SwanTrade, and SwanWallet. There will be more ways to deal with increase and cutoff points for marking and misusing SWAN tokens.

Hi everyone  
I am new to MakerDao and the MKR token and very intersted.

I  have noticed that the circulating supply is different then the total  supply, I was wondering how does that work, and where are the funds that  are ""out of circulation"" but still part of total supply?

How can I find out how many are in and how many out of supply?

In addition to the unique formula for equalizing the value of tokens in Curve trading pairs (more information in this article), Peanut will create for Curve users an additional layer of protection from slippage and from skewing the tokens value.

Due to the high volatility of the crypto asset market, the lack of unified trading platforms, as well as dynamic changes in supply/demand for a particular asset, crypto traders are quite often exposed to slippage as one of the negative factors.

Curve protects its users from slippage by using a unique formula for determining the value of assets in trading pairs. Additionally, Peanut protocol will integrate with Curve which will result in reducing negative effect from slippage and mitigating risks of impermanent loss. Due to the system of a two-level pool of assets operated by Peanut, placing even a very large order will have only temporary instant effect. When large buy/sell orders are executed, the Peanut pool automatically and simultaneously makes the corresponding deal on two levels, that is, on other DEX and CEX, and provides additional liquidity for specific trading pair. As a result, slippage in trading pair disappears.

At the moment, the Peanut team is winding up with integrational settings for Curve trading platform. In a few weeks Curve will be connected to Peanut protocol on the regular basis.

Speaking about Curve, Alex Momot, CEO at Remme and founder of Peanut said:

“The main challenge for us during the testing period is to check the ability to resist one-block flash loan attacks. Successful results will significantly improve AMM mechanics and will give much more confidence to all market participants.”

&gt;*Michael Egorov, CEO of Curve, said:*  
*“Balancing prices by exploiting liquidity on both DEX and CEX platforms is really a good idea. And also very promising. It will be very interesting to see the results of Peanut testing on Curve.”*

Peanut solves existing problems inherent in both centralized and decentralized trading platforms. Namely, the loss of customers as a result of slippage. And we are doing everything we can to improve our algorithms.

&amp;#x200B;

The lending platform is one of DeFi’s main models. Its future development direction and innovation opportunities have been the focus of DeFi practitioners, with attempts in directions such as introducing “credit loans” and new collateral. This paper analyzes from the perspective of the characteristics of DeFi lending platforms and the demand of market liquidity, and presents how lending platforms would develop in the short-term and the long-term, as well as providing specific designing suggestions for the mortgage model of some assets, which can be viewed as references for platform developers and operators.

# 1. What is the DeFi Lending Platform?

# Interest Rate Protocol and Money Market

A few months ago, Jake Chervinsky, general legal counsel for Compound, published the article *DeFi Protocols Don’t Do “Lending”*, and in the article, he discusses the difference between “interest rate protocol” or “money markets” and the traditional concept of “borrowing” in the financial sector. The article clarifies some of the misconceptions about DeFi lending protocol and, to a certain extent, explains its current status: most existing DeFi lending protocols follow the interest rate protocol or money market model presented in the article, rather than the traditional credit-lending model.

However, the article did not fully answer a series of questions: why participants entered the “interest-rate market”; what value the market brought to them; why the pledge rate was generally set at 50–75%, a similar ratio to mortgage lending, but not higher or lower.

# The Pawn Model

In my opinion, all types of existing DeFi lending platforms are closer to a kind of pawn model at the level of protocol. The pawn model has the features of mortgage lending and money market, so over-emphasizing on one aspect can lead to misunderstanding and deviation of development direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img cjhdh3e1x1e61...*

On one hand, as the article discussed, if we understand this business model as borrowing, we would inevitably develop towards a broader lending model, such as credit loans (unsecured), which is exactly what some DeFi platforms claim to do. From this point of view, I agree with Chervinsky that this is an area that DeFi protocol should not involve in. At least for now, smart contracts know nothing at all about men’s credit and repayment ability in the real world, and recording credit information on block-chain is far less effective than the centralized model of combing big data with risk control.

On the other hand, simply emphasizing the characteristic that borrowers do not have to repay their loans does not fully portray the real motivation behind borrowing, and thus does not explain the value of the market. For example, if money markets reflect only the supply-demand and interest-rate differences between currencies, why not just imitate the foreign exchange markets? Stable currency exchange market applies this model. The essence of this model is Exchange, but not the current mortgage-lending model. Thus, we cannot deny that the essence of DeFi borrowers is to collateralize their borrowing with excess mortgage assets to gain the value of borrowed assets, whether it acquires liquidity by buying value-added assets or takes profits by selling short, they ultimately have to repay to cash in real gains. As Chervinsky says, “Borrowers are free to leave and never have to repay, without any additional risks to lenders.” This is just a possible outcome, not a motivation.

The characteristics above are very similar to pawn. On one hand, pawn is a standard pledge model, and pawnshops generally do not have the ability of banks to create money, so the source of its funds is simply self-owned funds or third-party funds (Mortgage loans appear to be similar to DeFi lending protocols and pawn models, but involve credit derivatives in their essence, so it is a completely different financial model, which will not be discussed here). The source for fund pools of DeFi platforms is consistent with this. The pawnbroker, on the other hand, is essentially a model of exchanging the pledge of low-liquid assets for liquidity. In the end, if the pawnbroker fails to redeem the pawn in time, the assets will be cleared. The difference between DeFi lending and pawn-holders is only in terms of the conditions for clearing, counter-parties and processes.

This latter point is crucial, although, on the surface, the pawn shop and DeFi lending platform have completely different roles in the process of financing and clearing, but, in nature, they are the same in the direction of assets and funds transfer, which can be compared to the difference between self-owned e-commerce and platform e-commerce. Therefore, the existing DeFi lending system/interest rate protocol/money market is essentially a “third-party pawn platform business”, which provides the protocol infrastructure, connects the supply and demand parties, and charges the interest rate spreads and the service fee.

# 2. Liquidity provision is the core value of the DeFi protocol

All financial systems are essentially liquidity-providing mechanisms, such as exchanges, lending, insurance and derivatives. Pawnshop is one of the standard liquidity-providing mechanisms. In many articles and courses, the author has expounded that DeFi is a better liquidity-providing model, and thus a better financial service system due to its liquidity carries features of transparency, borderless nature and contract certainty. Therefore, we should analyze the role of DeFi platform from the perspective of liquidity provision, and then decide where its future development is heading.

# Who are the real demanders for mortgage loans/pawns

In the author’s pinion, as a pawning model, DeFi lending can satisfy their needs only by giving the pledgee the ability to exchange low-liquidity assets for high-liquidity assets, which is the fundamental reason for their entry into this market.

Looking from this perspective, we can see that mainstream lending platforms, such as Compound, generally support only a few basic currencies to “mortgage” with each other, (even recently added some currencies but it is still a small deposits), and these currencies are actually high-liquidity assets that can be cashed in at any time, and even buy other assets as basic currencies (e.g., ETH) in exchanges. Therefore, storing these basic currencies as collateral to borrow other basic currencies actually reduces the total liquidity (since the ratio is usually 50–75%, significantly less than the value of the original assets). For the people who store these assets to borrow, they are not real liquidity buyers, and many of them are arbitrageurs revolving collateral based on the logic of rising currency prices. For the whole market, the overall liquidity has actually shrunk (because more liquidity has been locked in, not into the market), that leverage has risen, and the risk of assets being liquidated has increased, which is not necessarily a healthy model.

Therefore, who are the real demanders of liquidity in the DeFi market? There are generally two kinds of people: one is those who own non-mainstream currencies, such as investing in projects that hold large amounts of tokens (commonly referred to as “small currency”), but at a price that is not properly cashed in. Another is those of the DEX market makers, whose funds provided to DEX can obtain market-making income, but they get the liquidity pool voucher (LP) itself is a kind of illiquid assets. If they go to the secondary market to sell, they lose the underlying assets, fee income and all other rights. So, their liquidity was frozen by market making.

For both groups, mortgage lending is clearly the main, if not the only, model that can help them access liquidity. But for platforms, the first group has asset prices that are volatile and their use as collateral is clearly inappropriate, so the platforms are cautious about opening up lending in small currencies, at least by setting their collateral rates very low. For the LP of the DEX, it is obvious that the asset value of mainstream currency transactions is guaranteed, even if for the “XXX-USDT”, half of which is small currency, and another half is mainstream currency transactions, the volatility of LP is less than single currency volatility, and at least 50% of the value is guaranteed. Meanwhile, considering that the LP has market-making income, LP mortgage lending is allowed to be used, which is similar to the model of stock pledge: assets, rights, earnings still belong to themselves, but they can get new liquidity, or be further invested in other assets. In the future, it can be redeemed only with pay interest, which is the real model of raising liquidity.

Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that, DEX market-makers are the real players in the DeFi market at this stage, who have the right assets for mortgage lending (pawning) and the need for liquidity. Lending platforms should design mortgage-lending models for such assets and encourage this group to borrow.

# The Current Status of LP Mortgage Lending and Improvement Measures

When we look at the current mortgage market, we see an obvious phenomenon: LP mortgage lending is hardly going on: Compound does not open up mortgage lending at all, and AAVE has opened up some UNISWAP LP’s lending pool, but which was left there without almost anybody to care for it. The status quo seems to be contradictory to the conclusion made above. To do this, we need to analyze from the platform and the mortgagor’s point of view respectively:

First, from the platform perspective, LP is a low-liquidity asset, in other words, they are less likely to be loaned. After all, the people who borrow the assets intend to get liquidity to invest in other assets. As a result, the storage of LP becomes a mere “liquidity taker” without providing liquidity to the platform, which leads to differences between TVL and the total liquidity. If the difference is large, it can be consider there is a risk of a liquidity imbalance across the platform, which means there is a relative shortage of money to borrow. Of course, this can be improved by adjusting algorithms and parameters, such as reducing the pledge rate for LP assets, or placing them in a separate pool like AAVE, which does not take up the borrowing capacity of other pools and can also raise their lending rates. As we discussed in previous paragraphs, LP mortgage lending is “rigid demand” for DEX market makers, and clearly these measures do not affect their borrowing needs.

Second, from the point of view of LP holders, there are two problems that may affect their storage willingness (AAVE, after all, has launched LP lending without a lot of storage). The first is that LP has fee income. From the contract level, during the mortgage, LP is not in the hands of the platform, and there is double about whether contract will get LP corresponding fee assets. In addition, after platforms such as Uniswap have launched liquidity mining, some LP can be mortgaged to these platforms to mine, if the lending platform does not have the ability to help users with mortgage, LP holders would lose potential mining profits. Second, if LP assets can be loaned out, the problem above is more serious: it is good for borrowers to have fee income and mining income before the borrower returns, but the original holder lost revenue. In addition, borrowing LP can be a bit of a hassle for borrowers, because lending interest is denominated in LP, so borrowers have to operate by themselves to increase liquidity, so they can return all their assets, which is also a cumbersome process. To solve these problems, it can consider the labeling LP as a “non-loanable” asset, so that the holder has no risk of transaction fees or mining losses. At the same time, the platform should be able to transfer the assets to the corresponding mining platform to obtain mining proceeds for users (also depends on the premise that LP assets cannot be borrowed). As a result, the lending platform has the same ability with some of the platform dedicated to helping users with LP mining platform, while at the same time it can allow users to borrow to increase liquidity, which will reflect a clear competitive advantage.

# 3. Development Directions and Opportunities of DeFi Lending Platforms

Overall, DeFi Lending Platform is a platform that provides users with liquidity through mortgage lending/pawn models. It finds users with liquidity needs, and designs corresponding mortgage lending models for their illiquid assets, which should be the main direction of the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 7nru9m4bx1e61...*

The second part of this paper takes the LP assets of DEX market-maker as an example, analyzes the liquidity demand of the holders, and gives the ideas and key points of designing mortgage and loan products for LP assets. In this basic model, DeFi lending platforms should develop in the direction of looking for other collateralised assets to serve a wider user base.

At present, we see that platforms, such as MakerDAO, even are not a model of borrowing, but are also greatly expanding the type of mortgage assets. Especially with the introduction of “real world assets” rather than native digital assets as collateral, it is a very important step. For DeFi lending platforms, the people who own such assets, is apparently the demander of liquidity, to whom the platforms should provide with mortgage lending services. At the same time, their demand for asset mortgages is closer to LP assets rather than high-liquidity assets, such as a person who wants to mortgage a house for liquidity, apparently he or she does not want his or her house to be “loaned” by others on the platform. Therefore, LP’s design can basically extend to digital voucher mortgage lending models of real-world assets.

As we all know, “physical asset chain” is a commonplace problem. There is no perfect “Trustless” solution, so it must be based on the credibility of asset managers. For example, the house chain must have the real estate management organization to cooperate with, so it can guarantee that the house ownership can transfer to the liquidator hand when the asset clears. Gold, dollar and other assets must also be digitized by the financial institutions that manage them, so that they can enter the DeFi world. In this process, financial institutions, which are the same as the concept of “**digital banking**”, should have inherent advantages. The term “digital bank” refers to a financial institution that, on one hand, has a commercial banking license, and can engage in asset management, mortgage and currency issuance, while on the other hand, it can convert a legal tender into a stable currency on a block chain, and can digitize vouchers such as gold and property.

This kind of financial institution is the bridge between the real world and the digital world. The author has always called it “the bridge of the parallel world”. The platforms, such as DeFi lending, can cooperate with this kind of financial institution to further improve the efficiency of providing liquidity, which is the major opportunity for the development of DeFi lending platforms, and is also the only way for future continuous improvement of DeFi’s overall scale.

*DeFi platforms allow traders to freely operate their digital assets in a decentralized market.*  

*Until recently, one of the best and most sought-after tools for connecting users with products like stablecoins, loans, and interest-bearing accounts has been MakerDAO. However, with the launch of Kava's new-generation decentralized bank which Forbes magazine describes as “the hidden gem of the decade”, traders have much more room to maneuver.*

*Taking the principles of MakerDAO as a basis, Kava.io has become its main alternative and according to analysts at QDAO DeFi, it is going to demonstrate steady rapid growth.*

**What is Kava?** 

Kava.io is a multi-chain DeFi platform for collateralized decentralized loans. It allows users to operate digital assets outside the Ethereum blockchain in order to mint Kava's own stablecoin - USDX. 

The scheme is quite transparent. The user signs a smart contract (a CDP) by depositing some amount of currency into Kava as collateral. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cisx3r61s2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265601d8419e902606a0480f484bf3f6320e00b3

Thus, the user then has the opportunity to mint a fixed amount of USDX, depending on the size of the collateral, for further usage. The Kava stablecoin can be operated on various blockchain networks, leveraged, hedged with interest or just held as a stable asset.          

The collateral is held by the platform until the USDX loan is paid off. All transactions on the platform are conducted in BNB but the developers are planning to integrate BTC, XRP, ATOM and other major cryptocurrencies.  

**Why Kava?** 

\- It is fully interoperable with CosmosCDK. It means that, unlike MakerDAO, this platform provides the opportunity to operate different cryptocurrencies via different services.

\- Kava.io doesn't oblige traders to conduct KYC verification or provide credit history. 

\- Traders using Kava.io can get USDX minting rewards. In order to qualify for KAVA distributed from the rewards pool (74,000 per week), the user has to generate a USDX loan. The amount of reward depends on the loan size. 

*The main risk of such loans is connected with the collateral price. If the BNB rate goes down, the platform will ask the trader to deposit extra currency. Otherwise, the collateral is liquidated.* 

**How to use the platform** 

As mentioned above, Kava.io supports different blockchain systems. There are 2 ways to deposit digital assets and start minting USDX. You can access the platform by creating a CDP via Kava-supporting wallets: Cosmostation, Frontier etc. or directly through Kava's Web App. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img otm0183yr2e61...*

The built-in interface shows all the information about your digital assets: the amount of collateralized (locked) and available BNB, borrowed USDX, borrow limit and wallet balance. At the very top you can find the collateral liquidation price and current market price of your locked assets. 

Kava's Web App is intuitive and allows you to stay on top of the needed parameters, so let's suppose that we picked it to start minting stablecoin. 

**Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the Kava developers' software.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now you should choose a wallet to connect. We are going to pick Trust Wallet. If you don't have one, you can download it from the App Store (IOS) or Play Store (Android). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/70d8rortr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=384dd9423d06a05686f7288cf451c9f7897558b2

Make sure that Kava is enabled in your Trust Wallet. Search for “Kava” and turn it ON. 

&amp;#x200B;

You need some BNB to make a transaction, so send the currency to your Trust Wallet. Copy your Binance Chain address and use it as the transfer recipient. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now you can attach your wallet. Go to Kava's Web App, press “Trust Wallet” and scan the QR-code provided by Kava's Web App. 

To do this, you need to open Trust Wallet on your phone and press the Gear (Settings) button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then choose “WalletConnect” and scan the code using the camera. Then press “Connect”. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw6opkyor2e61.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ba981dbc4fd45c9de2ccd3cf3c0d9badf78d965

Now you need to transfer your BNB to the Trust Wallet Kava address. Once you've attached your wallet, the platform recommends that you make a transaction. 

Enter the amount of currency you want to deposit or press the “MAX” button to automatically fund all your balance. Then you need to confirm the transaction in the pop-up on your Trust Wallet app and press “Done” once the transaction is complete.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p5vvtfqlr2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f272eba6c181e04156a9424b5b468882d1ba4f68

Voila! Now you can take out a loan. Although you’ve transferred 1 BNB, the amount shown is a bit less due to transaction fees.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 3snbbux7r2e61...*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9em458gir2e61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da46675eab8710a30741e99907b71fcb12c30ff7

Press the “Borrow” button in the “USDX Borrowed” window on the main page of Kava's Web App. Enter the amount of BNB to lock and the amount of USDX to borrow. You can see the information about your balance, the current market price of BNB, and liquidation price as well. 

Confirm the transaction in the Trust Wallet App. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you are the holder of USDX stablecoins. 

Our team recommends that you regularly check the BNB rate in order to avoid collateral liquidation. Lock more BNB or repay USDX in order to protect your borrowing and be especially careful when leveraging the assets received.

Case Study #EP2: DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l8klrq/case_study_ep2_defi/,mrkez,1,2021-01-30 20:22:28,10,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l8klrq/case_study_ep2_defi/,EDUCATIONAL,"Dear Redditors,

I've been reading a lot about DeFi lately and I thought about sharing some information about what DeFi is and what it consists of, especially for beginners.   
I’ve started the Case Study series with 2 coins of choice ([ADA and VET](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jve3mz/case_study_ep1/)), however, this time I’ll focus on DeFi as it is getting a lot of attention in the last few days, especially because of the GME stock case (check r/wallstreetbets if you don't know nothing about it). Most of the people don’t know what DeFi really is and we should try to educate them since we believe it is indeed the future of our economy and financial system. If this post gets attention, I might make more case studies explaining in a more detailed way what you can do thanks to DeFi.

I also want to promote discussion within the community, all of us are here for a reason and I don’t think pumping Doge is that reason. I want to learn as well as there’s still so much stuff to know. **Fool is one who wants to learn what he already knows.**

DeFi is expected to grow further in the coming years as you might be noticing in the last months.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Decentralized Finance?**

DeFi is the movement that allows users to utilize financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without the need to rely on centralized entities. These financial services are provided via Decentralized Applications (Dapps), in which a majority of them are currently deployed on the Ethereum platform.

DeFi is a set of products and services that acts as a replacement for institutions ranging from banking, insurance, bonds and money markets. 

In order for DeFi Dapps to work, it usually requires collateral to be locked into smart contracts. The cumulative collateral locked in DeFi Dapps is often referred to as the Total Value Locked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Decentralized Finance vs Traditional Finance**

It’s tough for the unbanked to compete on a level field. The DeFi movement is about bridging these gaps and making finance accessible to everyone without any form of censorship. DeFi opens up huge windows of opportunities and allows users to access various financial instruments without any restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

Banks enable money to move around the world by providing value transfer services and much more. However, banks are managed by humans and governed by policies that are prone to mismanagement and corruption.

DeFi seeks to build a better financial landscape made possible by the advent of the internet and blockchain technology, particularly in three key segments of the banking system:

**Payment &amp; clearance system:**

Remittances involving banks worldwide typically take a few working days to complete and involve all sorts of fees. There may also be issues with documentation, anti-money laundering laws, privacy concerns, and more.

Cryptocurrencies that powers the DeFi movement allow you to bypass intermediaries who take the lion’s share of profits of these transfers.

**Accessibility:**

The World Bank estimates that as of 2017, there are 1.7 billion people who do not own an account at a financial institution and more than half of them are from developing nations.

Accessing DeFi Dapps only requires a person to have a mobile phone &amp; internet access, as opposed to going through lengthy verification processes. The World Bank estimates that two-thirds of the 1.7 billion unbanked have access to mobile phones.

**Centralization &amp; Transparency:**

There is no way for regular investors like us to fully know what financial institutions do, however we did get a glimpse the last week with everything that is happening at wall street.

It will be different with DeFi. DeFi protocols built on top of public blockchains such as Ethereum are mostly open-sourced for audit and transparency purposes. They usually have decentralized governing organizations to ensure that everyone knows what is happening and that no bad actors can single-handedly make bad decisions.

DeFi protocols are written as lines of codes which run exactly as they are programmed to, and any flaws quickly become evident as it is open for public scrutiny. At the end of the day, DeFi’s biggest strength lies in being able to cut out intermediaries and operate with zero censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

**The DeFi Ecosystem**

DeFi Dapps stand to revolutionize traditional financial services by removing the need for any middlemen. However, it should be noted that DeFi in its current state is still highly nascent and experimental with many projects being rapidly improved upon daily.

**How Decentralized is DeFi?**

DeFi can be centralized, semi-decentralized and completely decentralized.

**Centralized**:

Characteristics: Custodial, uses centralized price feeds, centrally-determined interest rates, centrally-provided liquidity for margin calls.

Examples: Salt, BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius

&amp;#x200B;

**Semi-Decentralized** (has one or more of these characteristics but not all)

Characteristics: Non-custodial, decentralized price feeds, permissionless initiation of margin calls, permissionless margin liquidity, decentralized interest rate determination, decentralized platform development/updates.

Examples: Compound, MakerDAO, dYdX, bZx

&amp;#x200B;

**Completely Decentralized**

Characteristics: Every component is decentralized.

Examples: UniSwap, SushiSwap

&amp;#x200B;

**DeFi Key Categories:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Stablecoins**

The prices of cryptocurrencies are known to be extremely volatile. It is common for cryptocurrencies to have intraday swings of over 10%. To mitigate this volatility, stablecoins that are pegged to other stable assets such as the USD were created. 

Decentralized stablecoins are created in a decentralized manner and are governed by decentralized autonomous organizations. Its reserves can be publicly audited by anyone. Stablecoins are important in making DeFi applications more accessible to everyone by having a stable store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lending and Borrowing**

Borrowing from banks comes with other restrictions such as having a good credit score and having sufficient collateral to convince the banks. Decentralized lending and borrowing remove this barrier, allowing anyone to collateralize their digital assets and use this to obtain loans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchanges**

To exchange one cryptocurrency to another, we can use exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance. Exchanges like these are centralized exchanges, meaning they are both the intermediaries and custodians of the assets being traded. Have you ever heard of “not your keys, not your coins”? Users of these exchanges do not have full control of their assets, putting their assets at risk in case the exchanges get hacked and are unable to repay their obligations. 

Decentralized exchanges aim to solve this issue by allowing users to exchange cryptocurrencies without giving up custody of their coins. Without storing any funds on centralized exchanges, users do not need to trust the exchanges to stay solvent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Derivatives**

A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from another underlying asset such as stocks, commodities, currencies, indexes, bonds, or interest rates. Traders can use derivatives to hedge their positions and decrease their risk in any particular trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fund Management**

Fund management is the process of overseeing your assets and managing its cash flow to generate a return on your investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lottery**

Putting a DeFi spin onto lotteries allows for the removal of custodianship of the pooled capital unto a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. With the modularity of DeFi, it is possible to link a simple lottery Dapp to another DeFi Dapp and create something of more value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Payments**

A key role of cryptocurrency is to allow decentralized and trustless value transfer between two parties. With the growth of DeFi, more creative payment methods are being innovated and experimented.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insurance**

Insurance is a risk management strategy in which an individual receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company in the event of an unfortunate incident. While most projects have gotten their codebases audited, we never know if the smart contracts are truly safe and there is always a possibility of a hack which may result in a loss.

"The State of Coordination, Community, and Future Impact",https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/pzb54l/the_state_of_coordination_community_and_future/,mjrossman,1,2021-10-02 00:06:40,0,/r/ethereum/comments/pzb54l/the_state_of_coordination_community_and_future/,,"TL;DR - Pretty simple, we have come a long way, and we're having a bunch of fun in thousands of   
similar directions, but there comes a time to reflect on what we have, what the incumbents want to keep, and why it's so important for us to coordinate on ecosystem-wide frameworks.

Firstly, I'm warning you that I'm going to shill some amazing things in the Ethereum ecosystem. I would even go so far to say as some of these things are so positive sum and self-evidently public goods that shilling them in the ethereum subreddit should be considered neutral. For example, [GitcoinDAO](https://gitcoin.co) is a place where we all have the permissionless ability to coordinate in building tools and services, like [dapptools](https://dapp.tools), for all open-source software, full stop. There's ways to fundraise in public besides joining Discord or sliding into Twitter DM's, like [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money). There is a plethora of industry leaders exploring decentralized hosting for bluechip-scale applications, such as [Skynet](https://siasky.net/).

But why in the hell am I starting off with shilling a bunch of things? Well, two recent publications started to make me think about the gravity of our success. Firstly, as many of you are aware, [Visa is testing out a stablecoin/CBDC payment channe](https://decrypt.co/82233/visa-universal-payment-channel-stablecoin-cbdc)l, similar to L2. OTOH, u/vbuterin has proposed (and there is a team implementing upon) an [account abstraction framework](https://medium.com/infinitism/erc-4337-account-abstraction-without-ethereum-protocol-changes-d75c9d94dc4a). There is a paymaster-mediated, sponsored transaction concept in this post that, imho, changes everything: 

&gt;1. Allowing application developers to pay fees on behalf of their users  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Allowing users to pay fees in ERC20 tokens, with a contract serving as an intermediary to collect the ERC20s and pay in ETH

Now, the disclaimer is that there is higher gas overhead for this framework (and we still need to scale Ethereum via sharding/rollups/PoS), but we're talking about atomically spending in a potentially more stable denomination (much like what happens on xDai). The other implication (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that protocols that offer fixed-rate appreciation of stable value also offer, depending on the transaction cost basis of which layer/chain they're situated, virtually limitless access to Ethereum. In other words, we may see an imminent future where institutions and newcomers with a predictable rate of usage can optimize the amount of upfront capital required to use Ethereum for free. (if anyone is more familiar with gasless transactions/zksnark cost basis, please correct my assumptions in the comments)  


Okay, that's all well and good, but what are the implications of Ethereum's presence from the perspective of incumbents? We've all heard the regulatory FUD revolving around DeFi, and that anticompetitive pressure is simple to understand when one considers that permissionless protocols do not bleed their potential profit margin into middlemen by default. Ethereum, as an ecosystem, is better than any financial monolith, and it has more capability to be transparently self-regulated than any government with central banking. From the present onwards, we're going to see more [banks](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/) and [corporations](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-launches-first-creator-led-nft-collection-powered-by-immutable-x) opt for using Ethereum because the social/financial benefits outweigh all risks (be they capital or regulatory). However, there will be [experimentation in reserve currencies/treasuries](https://olympusdao.medium.com/?p=d8db3052fca5) that will naturally outcompete such ventures. This is the future of France.  


Here's really where things get tricky. Because the current bull season is focused on DAO formation and development (building on NFT summer), my guess is that we're going to see a lot of competitive pressure get exerted on SMBs. Sure, it may not look like this at the moment because the missions of a majority of DAOs do not extend past the ecosystem (I'm referring, of course, to many missions that relate directly to NFT releases and DeFi protocols). However, there are DAOs that [are acquiring properties](https://twitter.com/CityDao/status/1442247714729861121) &amp; others that are forming subsidiary structures (like LLCs and C-Corps to begin with). Take the operating system that is Ethereum, the fiscal advantage of DeFi rails, and the social playbooks that are DAOs and it is only a matter of time until all common goods and services are produced by networks that can outperform monolithic structures. In an academic sense, I am confident we are demonstrating the merits of [Elinor Ostrom's  work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution), as well as addressing the theory of [transaction cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost) economic in the process. We should celebrate the accomplishments of community leaders and contributors as we stand on their shoulders to continue building the digital ""Eighth Wonder of the World"".

&amp;#x200B;

But what does all of these mean for the large picture? Well, for one, I think most people on this subreddit would agree that we should move past zero-sum activities like copying NFT drops (and generally saturating social media with exit liquidity marketing) ad nauseaum. The other priority should be to ""defeat Moloch"", in other words taking note of what's already out there so we don't split our capital and incur more costs than necessary.  Are there security concerns in siloing parts of Ethereum or introducing single points of failure? Are concepts like upgradeable proxy contracts potentially catastrophic to the ecosystem? Yes, we need to have these discussions, but additionally, we should battle-test these. It shouldn't be prohibitive to make a redundant protocol, but this sort of trend can also be complemented by coordination protocols for the public good.  Let's not facilitate the process of Ethereum being a victim of its own success by accelerating the formation of incompatible social/capital siloes.

Disclaimer: I realize that I may be drawing assumptions that are inherently flawed, and I may volunteering opinions that many do not agree with. Please comment on why you think I'm wrong; I want to hear what you think."
Community Update #13,https://www.reddit.com/r/xDai/comments/pzdqx0/community_update_13/,ScarlettBurgan,1,2021-10-02 02:14:04,6,/r/xDai/comments/pzdqx0/community_update_13/,,"September r/xDAI Airdrops Go Out Tomorrow!  

As a DAO, we're always looking at ways to:

* Promote xDAI as an exceptional EVM sidechain
* Grow our community with quality devs and blockchain enthusiasts
* Prudently experiment with Governance and DeFi innovations that would position our organization as a first-mover with innovative use cases and position ourselves as collective thought leaders

As it stands, for DAO-specific revenue, we lend out RxDAI to dApps that want to develop and not have to sell their xDAI-blockchained tokens, to remain fully vested in the exciting ecosystem that is xDAI, but we're also going to embrace another community-minded push: free trading on-boarding.

We have people who have expressed an interest in crypto trading, either for fun, education, or as part of their investment asset allocation strategy. At almost 1000 strong, we also have community members well-versed in this space, many who have traded professionally previously or do so to the present day. These trading veterans, as RxDAI holders, have volunteered their time to provide on-boarding tips, answer introductory questions, and provide a hand-holding experience that exists no where else without cost, if one simply joins FTX with the xDAI DAO's affiliate link. All affiliate funds will be distributed to HODLers of RxDAI in the Swapr monthly liquidity pools.

October's staking Pool is up with 25,000 RxDAI actively airdropping.

[RxDAI Swapr Oct &amp; Sept pool. Switch over monthly.](https://preview.redd.it/nnnvl6luovq71.png?width=458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c7c03a678227b6bb85f535374217b39e526246a)

One of our investment partners, who signed-up via our link, has segmented a treasury of 3x tokens held by this DAO including ETCBEAR, BNBBEAR, and many low-cost tokens that are largely trading at exactly their net asset value or better. 

These are largely purchased inexpensively, for fractions of a penny, but the power of 3x compounding, especially if a token dumps, is powerful. A crypto that increases 5% for 30 days will 4x, a 3x token for this same underlying asset will 66x. Why is this important to a risk-averse DAO? These positions can be hedged against on the spot market for 0.88% APR, virtually nothing. The ultimate payoff for this is when an asset moves quite a bit. If a $0.00001 ETCBear goes to $0.01, even if it's hedged on the opposite site, it's earning fees every step of the way as these tokens have large bid/ask spreads. Savvy 3x traders will buy them when they are below NAV and sell them when above. From an affiliate perspective, that $1 investment, which is 100% hedged earned:

* Open maker and taker position fees for 3x and spot positions
* Close maker and taker position fees for 3x and spot positions

Pretty soon, as the hedged position goes all over the place, that $1 in investment will have amassed $3, $30, $300+ in fees, of which $1 has been reverted back to the xDAI DAO from that principal investment.

This is the type of recurring model that:

* Can ignite the DAO to grow with a sustainable profitability and use this to excite a thirst for airdropped RxDAI
* Allows capital put in to be used efficiently to harvest trading fees that come as a result of crypto's characteristic volatility
* Sustains most all crypto influencers and crypto education projects handsomely.

The ultimate, albeit ambitious, goal of this DAO is to enjoy the same price-to-earns tokenization enjoyed by Aave, MakerDAO, and others, which can often surpass 200. That means that $100 in daily revenue, from RxDAI borrow fees, FTX affiliate income, and key dApp partnerships, would yield a DAO worth $3.6MM. In a crypto world where you need to unicorn with a billion dollar valuation to even get firmly into the top 100 crypto projects by market cap, this may sound modest, but growing the right way--incrementally and not hastily--is the way that xDAI, 1Hive, and the ecosystem as a whole have successfully done it: ready-aim-fire rather than fire-aim-ready.

How can I get involved?

* Monthly Airdrops (thoughtfully comment and post)
* If you do have an interest in trading crypto, using vanilla or advanced strategies, message the mods to get connected with someone who knows this ecosystem inside and out to handhold you and prevent you from making mistakes that are common getting going, like putting in a market order when you really wanted a limit. Look for a dedicated Discord later this month.
* If you're an experienced trader, you can just use the FTX affiliate link.
* Buy [RxDAI on Hedgey](https://app.hedgey.finance/xdai/trade/buy/rxdai/xdai/call) and Stake it on [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.link/#/pools/0x6B0f8A3Fb7cb257AD7c72ADa469Ba1D3C19C5094/0xe91D153E0b41518A2Ce8Dd3D7944Fa863463a97d/0x45ef37AEBd907a8e6D6888374Bc39202D3721CC7?chainId=100)."
How does Yield farming works? What are the top yield farming protocols?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/pzds5f/how_does_yield_farming_works_what_are_the_top/,KOMPWND,1,2021-10-02 02:15:40,2,/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/pzds5f/how_does_yield_farming_works_what_are_the_top/,DISCUSSION," 

Yield farming, also known as yield or liquidity harvesting, involves lending cryptocurrency. 

In return, you get interest and sometimes fees, but they're less significant than the practice of supplementing interest with handouts of units of a new cryptocurrency. 

The real payoff comes if that coin appreciates rapidly.

Here are the top 5 yield farming protocols you can invest in right now.

Aave - The best part about this protocol is that its coin is growing, so it’s good to invest in right now.

Uniswap - Recently Uniswap has registered the most number of transactions in amount as Defi TVL crossed $180 Billion.

Then there is 

Compound - It’s a Defi protocol that has been hosting various lending pools and provides an opportunity to earn interest on various cryptocurrencies.

Kompwnd - Kompwnd offers 5 different ways to earn money. But yield farming is one of the best ways to earn, as it is less risky and you don’t have to do anything. Just sit back and relax and your investment will grow.

MakerDAO - It is an unbiased price-stable currency that you control. More than 400 apps and services have integrated Dai.

Isn’t that amazing?"
Is it possible to earn passive income through arbitrage opportunities?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pzqzsp/is_it_possible_to_earn_passive_income_through/,kenjirai,1,2021-10-02 16:03:25,26,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pzqzsp/is_it_possible_to_earn_passive_income_through/,TRADING," 

It seems decentralize exchange like Uniswap exist because of arbitrage opportunities. Beside Uniswap other decentralize protocol such as Makerdao also encourages arbitrage.  

I’ve never dip my toes into arbitrage opportunities, however lately, I’ve been thinking about exploring it and try to write some arbitrage bots. My concern is do traders really make money through arbitrage opportunity? since most of the time Ethereum gas fee is high and one have to be quick enough to successfully execute the trade.  

Should I expect passive income through arbitrage opportunities?  Any insight from the expert arbitrage traders would be helpful. Thanks."

Recap: DeFi Week of Sept. 26,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDefiant/comments/q0u3tk/recap_defi_week_of_sept_26/,TheDefiantNews,1,2021-10-04 08:07:48,0,/r/TheDefiant/comments/q0u3tk/recap_defi_week_of_sept_26/,,"Hello Defiers!

The whole crypto-goes-mainstream thing has been a cliche since, well, forever. Even so, it’s pretty amazing to see the mojo at the intersection between DeFi and TradFi. There was a flurry of news this week demonstrating that this cliche is morphing into just plain normal business.

To wit: Visa unveiled a plan to make central bank digital currencies interoperable, with itself, naturally, at the center of new global monetary superhighway. Societe Generale, the French banking giant, announced it’s going to borrow 20M Dai on MakerDAO, a pretty bold move even for an institution known for avant-garde finance. And the prolific Brady Dale plumbed Twitter’s move to let its 206M users use NFTs as profile pics, a surprising tack given Jack Dorsey’s sniffy ‘tude toward non-Bitcoin crypto.

Yet the splashiest proof point of the DeFi-TradFi confluence must be Jay Pegs Auto Mart’s campaign to tokenize the 2007 Kia Sedona minivan. Who would have thought rolling this immortal vehicle onto the Ethereum blockchain would be present such a vivid vision of the future? Well, Jay Pegs, that’s who, and Brady Dale hopped a ride on the huckster’s magical mystery tour in our Weekend Read.

Switching channels, our fearless chiefess, Camila Russo, conducted our seventh Jam Session on The Defiant’s YouTube channel, this one covering the gateways to web3, with guests hailing from Argent, Dharma, Instadapp and other DeFi frontends. Robin Schmidt covered the Twitter story, non-fungible debt positions and Barnbridge’s SMART Alpha in on his must-see streams. Don’t miss SuperMassive reading aloud from Snow Crash in The Defiant Weekly. Also don’t miss the solid beat reporting by Owen Fernau — he covered newsy moves by Avalanche, dYdX, 1Inch and AngelList this week.

If all that wasn’t enough, Humpty Calderon wrote a provocative DeFi Essay on how decentralized identity is far more important than anyone realizes. So plenty to input this weekend as you calibrate for the week ahead. Imagine how much smarter you’ll be by Monday!"

After deciding I need to move from low-cost moonshots to high-quality coins, I discovered Maker (MKR). It’s a governance token built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin.

Recently MKR has made headlines by striking a potential deal that’ll likely be the largest step towards institutional adoption of DeFi to date.

[Source](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/)

It has a 1m max supply, although it’s designed to create more in the instance of an unexpected shortage. This can be confusing, but it’s design *should* prevent this from being necessary. It’s more of a safeguard, if you will.

MKR is one of the biggest contributors to the DeFi industry and over 2% of Ethereum supply is locked up in MKR. 

The DAI stablecoin is unique in that it’s decentralized, and although tied to the US dollar, it’s backed by crypto and not fiat. There are multiple advantages and unique characteristics of DAI but it’s soft-pegged and has issues slipping a few cents above or below the dollar. You can see why this would be troublesome for large transaction. This is being worked on.

Every holder of MKR is granted authority to vote on changes to the MKR protocol, which also includes management of DAI. MKR is currently priced at $2,481.66 per token with a market cap of $2,460,811,822.21.

I hope you enjoyed my shill/pump/awareness post. I also hope it helps some of you decide to look beyond moonshots and see there’s not only monetary value to be had elsewhere, but also good projects to invest in that will create a better world for our children.

Feel free to correct me or add anything you feel is important I missed in the comments. Here’s to your successful journey in crypto 🍻"

Most recently he did about a week ago in a long form post he put out:
https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html
Basically, he states that coins don't always work for governance and that the holders of a governance token shouldn't always have a say in certain things. This is mainly because MakerDAO, which started out as a stablecoin backed by DAI, is now toying with the idea of having their hodlers vote to make a loan to a company to build a solar power plant and use this loan to generate income. Yes, that could work out, but a lot of people are upset that this puts DAI at risk for possible regulation. Most didn't sign up for this when they started at MakerDAO. DAI is now at risk of having issues with regulation since it is now backed by a decent amount of centralized collateral. DAI actually may end up using some RAI to make itself more decentralized. But RAI and DAI are still somewhat competitors.

Stablecoin regulation is coming, RAI is the going to have massive adoption once this happens. Every DeFi protocol + Big brain like Vitalik knows this is the case. This is why if you have been paying attention to DeFi, you can see every large protocol is now trying to incentivize RAI in some way. The DeFi people know that if stablecoins get rugged, the whole space could collapse. RAI is important for the resilience of the crypto space. Lots of moves being made by the protocol and team in the past month and a half. FLX is still down in price from when Vitalik first admitted he held the token, back in May. It didn't get much of a run since the entire market crashed literally a day or two after he said this."

How to actually DYOR about DeFi and where to begin,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q2ml16/how_to_actually_dyor_about_defi_and_where_to_begin/,Beechbone22,8,2021-10-06 23:17:10,28,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q2ml16/how_to_actually_dyor_about_defi_and_where_to_begin/,DISCUSSION,"There was a post about how you can't really DYOR and determine if a crypto asset has actual value or utility and I intended to post a comment there but it got longer ans I thought it was better to just post this. The world of DeFi is pretty much endless and there are new projects popping up every day, but I've noticed that most people are quite DeFi illiterate, even about the basics. If you are a degen yield chaser zoomer bridging to a new chain every week and always chasing the next liquidity incentive program, shitcoin farm or flavor of the week chain, this isn't for you. This is for the people stuck in 2017, and people holding AAVE on their CEX account with 0 on chain transactions.


Many people can't actually research and understand protocols because they don't understand where it fits in the puzzle. Before you can do your own research you should learn about the current DeFi landscape such as dominant money markets on different L1s, different DEXes and the niches they fill, liquidity incentive programs, different yield aggregators and DEX aggregators, insurance protocols, synthetics, collateralized debt positions, liquidity pools and other DeFi primitives . Learn about them and then go and actually use them. See what the UX is like. The same goes for NFT platforms or different L1s, nothing teaches you about crypto and DeFi faster than actually using it. Otherwise you won't have a clue about what a particular protocol or L1 brings to the table. For example, if you aren't familiar with Compound, AAVE, Maker and other money market / synthetic stable platforms, you shouldn't expect to understand the value proposition behind Liquity's interest rate or the efficiency of its liquidation mechanism. Just understanding what you're investing in isn't enough anymore. You should thoroughly understand the current crypto landscape and compare your investment in relation to competitors that are trying to fill a similar niche. I see hundreds of posts and comments shilling scalable and inexpensive L1's because ""it's very scalable and solves the trilemma"" without actually having a single on chain transaction using that particular L1 or any of the dApps in its ecosystem. Don't invest in something you don't use unless it's Bitcoin, because honestly who the fuck actually makes more than a handful of Bitcoin transactions a year? But it's still Bitcoin.


Just to make it clear, this is not a guide explaining the current DeFi landscape, it's a guide about how to go about researching it and it should serve as a starting point for your research. Go and actually learn about these, read blog posts, watch videos, read whitepapers or even better, use them.


If you're looking for a place to start, first of all, you should probably learn about bluechip DeFi protocols on Ethereum. These are:


Uniswap: The most dominant decentralised exchange on Ethereum. V2 had the standard constant product Automated Market Maker that was forked a million times and subjected to vampire attacks on Eth and other EVM compstible chains. V3 has a novel approach to AMM's (that has once again been replicated by other protocols), where liquidity is concentrated on a limited range set by the user and swap fees are structured in different tiers. V3 is much more capitally efficient for LPs and also more efficient for the users.

Curve: Another decentralised exchange. Capitally efficient liquidity pools for different assets pegged to the same asset or different derivatives of the same underlying asset, allowing LPs exposure to yield bearing pools without impermanent loss. Examples are swaps between different stablecoins, synthetic tokens and base tokens, liquid staked ETH and regular old ETH. They also have new pools for volatile assets such as the atricrypto pool. Also very multi chain friendly, they have already expanded to multiple EVM compatible side chains including Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche as well as ETH L2's such as Arbitrum. This is also true for a couple other platforms. AAVE and Sushiswap are also famously multi chain friendly with AAVE having recently launched on Avalanche in addition to Polygon. Sushiswap is on every EVM compatible side chain under the sun but support Sushi incentives only on a couple of them.

Sushiswap: Yet another decentralised exchange. It started as a fork of Uniswap V2 with a vampire attack prior to the launch of UNI token. After some troubled times, it has now become one of the multi chain DeFi bluechips. Sushi team works faster than almost any other DeFi team I've seen. Sushi is no longer just an AMM, they also do isolated lending on borrowing via money markets (Kashi), flash loans, an IDO launchpad and they have an upcoming AMM (Trident) which caters to different niches filled by Uniswap V3 (concentrated liquidity), Curve (stable asset swaps) and Balancer (customizable multi asset pools). 

Balancer: Also a DEX. Liquidity pools with a custom number of assets and a custom ratio between them. It opens new avenues for LPs who are looking to diversify their DeFi holdings while also functioning as a standard AMM.

Note: You don't have to use these protocols individually, there are DEX aggregators like Paraswap and 1Inch that pool liquidity from all these different sources and automatically route your orders through the liquidity pools with the best price, ensuring you buy low and sell high.

Compound: A money market and the protocol that kicked off DeFi summer and yield farming as we know it. Also nototiously suffered from a bug very recently that allowed millions of dollars worth of COMP tokens to be minted and distributed essentially for free. You can lend crypto assets to earn interest and borrow against your crypto via collateralized debt positions, achieving greater capital efficiency on holdings.

AAVE: Another money market like Compound where you can borrow and lend crypto. Currently winning the multi chain money market race IMO. There are also differences with the allowed collateral, collateral ratio at which liquidation occurs, differences in UX, etc. 

MakerDAO: Issuer of DAI, which is a synthetic stable asset minted using other cryptoassets as collateral, and pegged to the U.S. Dollar. It used to be a much more decentralized option, but since USDC became available as collateral, more than 60% of the collateral used to mint DAI has become USDC, which is a custodial, centralized stablecoin issued by Circle. That means an existential threat to USDC is an existential threat to DAI and thus Maker. However unlikely that is, it's still additional risk introduced by a centralized system on top of the smart contract risk posed naturally by DeFi.

Yearn: ""The yield engine of DeFi"". Is managing different collateralized debt positions, claiming liquidity incentive rewards and reinvesting them, chasing higher yields and optimizing debt ratios, LP positions too much of a hassle or too expensive? Yearn is a yield optimizers envisioned to address these concerns without spending gas. It invests the asset you deposit and automatically harvests, compounds and if necessary switches strategies if a higher yield is possible and takes a cut of the profits. This happens in the background without the need for user intervention. Convex is another notable competitor whose TVL has skyrocketed recently, they can also be considered one of the dominant yield aggregators on Ethereum. Both have a highly intertwined and symbiotic relationship with Curve and they both create a lot of the demand for CRV due to its staking mechanisn and they also provide a lot of the TVL for Curve. The yields aren't as degen as other yield aggregators on side chains and alternative L1s, but it's a battle tested protocol running on a battle tested network, offering much better yields than CeFi.

Synthetix: Like it says on the tin, synthetics. Synthetic stocks, crypto assets, commodities, minted using the platform's native token as collateral.

Maybe Bancor? as it has decent value proposition in limiting IL exposure.


Remember that a successful protocol's token doesn't necessarily make a good investment. The native tokens of the dApps mentioned above have vastly different tokenomics, revenue models and rights for holders. For example, UNI is purely a governance token. The only way to price it is speculatively and it depends on how much speculative premium the market is willing to pay for governance rights. The token's price performance doesn't necessarily have to correlate with the success of the protocol. But SUSHI, for example, when staked as xSUSHI, entitles holders to part of the revenue generated by Sushi AMM pools and other Sushi products along with the LPs themselves. The token is also distributed as an incentive to liquidity providers. This means that the market automatically prices the token with the revenue / volume generated by the protocol as staking APY increases if Sushiswap volume increases relative to token price. If the trading volume of the DEX goes up, it naturally drags the price of the token up. Assets like CRV have even fancier tokenomics and staking mechanisms which involve different voting escrow periods for staked tokens and differing liquidity reward multipliers for different amounts of CRV staked. You should always keep these in mind when considering native tokens of protocols as investments.


This list is by no means a complete one but understanding how each of these dApps work will give you a basic understanding of DeFi primitives and how newer protocols and L1s ""fit in"". There are also more innovative products that don't fit in under the above protocols. There are insurance protocols, tokenized real world assets, tokenized future yield and self repaying loans and a million other applications people haven't even thought of yet. Most of these applications leverage DeFi composability and are a good example of ""money legos"" that DeFi brings to the table.


If you want to understand the ecosystems of different L1s, go to defillama.com, and sort protocols by TVL while filtering for different L1s. Explore them, try then out and follow the narrative. Follow where the liquidity is flowing.

Read whitepapers, understand the tokenomics. Twitter posts or Telegram groups aren't actual sources but they can lead you in the right direction. Certain Discord ervers do contain a lot of insightful discussions and research. This sub is probably one of the worst sources of ""alpha"". It's fine to shoot the shit but don't actually take advice from Reddit. People who know what they're talking about very rarely make Reddit posts on this sub about it, though certain niche subreddits may be helpful. Discord servers of even small projects are usually decently active and most devs I've spoken to are surprisingly responsive. Talk to the devs and ask questions directly to them if possible and make sure you understand where a particular asset derives its value from. Don't be afraid to dive into the nitty gritty of it and get technical. Is it a pure governance token, does it have cashflow rights, is there something funkier going on? These are important considerations. Audits aren't everything but they're nice to have.

Also, as a side note if you're planning on using DeFi on cheaper EVM compatible chains (because ETH can obviously be prohibitively expensive for smaller holders). I highly recommend Anyswap as a cross chain bridge for stablecoins and ETH. It's a decent way to quickly move your liquidity around without too many steps and too many fees between side chains and ETH L2s. Xpollinate, Celer C bridge, etc. fulfil a similar purpose so you might want to shop around."
Addressing deleveraging spiral?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defiblockchain/comments/q3qy9z/addressing_deleveraging_spiral/,thereforetl,1,2021-10-08 13:09:48,4,/r/defiblockchain/comments/q3qy9z/addressing_deleveraging_spiral/,Question,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01304.pdf

Since Defichain is taking inspiration from MakerDao’s loans, how will we deter deleveraging spirals when correlated collateral (dBTC, dETH, DFI) drastically drop in value? This paper states that there is no stable price region for over collateralized non custodial stable-coins unless the collateral is a submartingale. A submartingale is the process such that something’s expected future value is greater than or equal to the current price. Therefore, deleveraging spirals is a risk when the price of DFI and correlated cryptocurrency collateral is not expected to go up. MakerDao addresses this issue by allowing USDC to be used as collateral. This provides protection against deleveraging spirals, but sacrifices decentralization and introduces exogenous counterparty risk. 

This paper proposes two possible solutions:
1. Introduce uncorrelated assets as collateral like USDC. 
2. Increase speculator demand. People must continue to bid up DFI. 

They also suggest introducing a pool to buffer against deleveraging—this is detailed in the Discussion section of the paper. 

In my opinion Defichain is not at risk for the same exact deleveraging spiral that MakerDao’s DAI experienced in March 2020 because Defichain doesn’t have keeper bots to liquidate and it doesn’t seem like we’ll be able to liquidate for free. 

What is everyone’s opinion how we should address this?"

One of the projects I found was MahaDAO. It’s a project based out of India and it’s on the polygon network. Upon going through their website and other information It seems to be a MakerDOA version but only that instead of DAI stable coin they have a inflation resistant stable coin called ARTH. ARTH’s value is basically 5percent Bitcoin x 80 percent fait x 15 percent some-other asset. Prospects wise it looks good because they have staking, and other returns. And if MakerDAO is any indication of value then MahaDAO could Atleast be 1/4 of makers value. It’s really early stage. They pretty much launched in jan 2021. 

But the Reddit page threw me off. There is just this one guy posting and the posts really look like shilling to me. More digging is needed. 

It’s incredibly hard to find good projects still in the budding phase to invest and make a decent amount of profit. One reason for that is the number of nee coins and tokens popping up.

# What is ERG? A hint at fair tokenomics

    Price at time of writing:  $10,4
    Market cap at time of writing as per CMC:  $335m
    Would-be price as a current top 10 (doge cap of 32b): $1.120,00

Ergois a is a GPU mineable cryptocurrency coin (not token) based on the Proof of Work Autolykos v2 consensus algorithm. Ergo has its own network and blockchain. **Ergo did not hold any ICO in the launch and the genesis block started fairly without any VC funding**. Ergo first went live on Waves and was mineable as the Ergo First Year Token (EFYT).

There were **no pre-mined coins reserved for the Ergo Foundation**. Ergo’s ecosystem is funded through a distribution model that designates  10% of the mining rewards to the Ergo Treasury until the end of 2nd year (of the mainnet launch). From this point onwards, the Treasury allocation will be halved every month for 6 months, afterwhich the Treasury will cease to receive any further allotment from the protocol. At the end of the distribution schedule, the **Treasury funds represent only 4.37% of the total ERG supply**. This model helps to build full decentralization.

The **total coin supply is hard-capped at 97 million ERGs** with an emission schedule of 8 years. This timetable, which is contrary to Bitcoin’s never-ending emission schedule, might seem very brief. However, Bitcoin is programmed to distribute 75% of its supply during the first 8 years, so Ergo’s emission design is not too far-off from Bitcoin’s. Rather than develop a protocol that continually mints coins as rewards for building the blockchain, Ergo has adopted a new and novel incentive for miners in the form of Storage Rent.

The **ERG coin is the base layer currency for building and using smart contracts**. 

Every type of transaction such as NFT minting, smart contract deployment, and swaps will essentially be signed with ERGs. The circulation of coins therefore will be boosted even with other ecosystems choosing to use the Ergo Blockchain. With more DeFi services such as cross-chain DEX and oracle pools, the future sustainability of Ergo tokenomics will be secured.

Let's find out the bull case for erg!

# The Road to Top 10 Cryptocurrency

If you are like me you understand that the move-fast-and-break-things approach that plagues the cryptocurrency ecosystem is detrimental to long term sustainability. The basis for my strong belief in [Ergo](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/ergo) and [Cardano](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/cardano) comes from their approach to code implementation: **research twice, implement once**.

Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardanop, once said he believes Ergo to be a [top 10 cryptocurrency ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9wpPiWuJNk)project. The community surrounding Ergo have been hanging on to that statement ever since. Today we hash out perspectives as to why that is possible and why a multi-billion dollar Ergo might be right around the corner.

## The Ethereum Miners Perspective

It's no surprise that the implications of [EIP-1559](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783) to the [Ethereum](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/ethereum) ecosystem unearthed controversy and disdain within its community. So what is EIP-1559?

An overly simplistic explanation of EIP-1559: its the restructuring of Ethereum's gas-management and monetary system to improve the UX by introducing the BASEFEE (BF) mechanism. The BF mechanism is at the base-layer which removes third-party price suggestions, and is based off the utilization of the Ethereum network.

These BF's do not go to the miners. If you want to pay for a quicker transaction you can tip the miners similar to CashApp or Venmo ‘Instant Transfer’ utility. The BF's are burned and therefore create deflation.

This disincentivizes miners to participate in the ecosystem because they are less profitable which effectively prices out GPU miners for ASIC miners, falling closer and closer to centralization. This will drive a number of miners to projects that will protect its interest on the protocol level and bring that project considerable growth.

Ergo is well positioned to attract these miners with [Autolykos v2](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/autolykos-v-2-details/480), a PoW algorithm built by Ergo that implements progressive memory-hard computation which make it ASIC resistant.

In June when EIP-1559 passes this will provide a home for non-industry miners who have been essentially priced out of Ethereum's mining mechanism. That’s not to say industry-grade miners wont also have a home here as well, because they too will be out of a job once [Ethereum 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/) comes and transitions to PoS. 

What is better than having a strong project to mine with a bright future ahead to run your business on?

# The Consensus Perspective

It is fundamentally true that above all other consensus mechanisms, [Proof-of-Work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work) is the most rigorously well-tested and studied. Its also true that PoW can enable centralization by super-efficient or pooled mining resources, but Ergo has preemptively solved these issues with Autolykos ([learn more in the forum](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/autolykos-v-2-details/480)).

Ergo will also have on-chain voting that can address issues such as [energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/) as network usage grows.

As an aside, this isn't to say that a [Proof-of-Stake](https://www.coindesk.com/proof-of-stake) mechanism is inferior to PoW, or even superior.

For instance, a PoS mechanism is open to [Byzantine attacks](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained) from distributed systems and malicious coordination between validators because coins are inextricably linked to network security.

[Cardano](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/cardano) has solved these issues with [Ouroboros](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/), but there is still the issue of network siphoning when financial products from DeFi protocols begin offering more attractive instruments than the inflation rate from staking rewards.

The point here is mainly that all consensus protocols can be improved upon, and just as Cardano has done with PoS, Ergo is doing with PoW.

It is beneficial to recognize that PoW and PoS is not a zero-sum game. They are both growing on non-linear trajectories rather than having superiority over each other. One could look at Autolykos as a superior PoW model to Bitcoin, just as one could look at Ouroboros as a superior PoS model to PeerCoin.

In the end, it's wise to invest in both trajectories — and we believe Ergo is doing a superior job than most in the PoW space.

## The Scripting Perspective

To understand how transactions are handled under the hood of Ergo we must take a brief peek under the hoods of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## BitcoinScript

Bitcoin uses what is called [BitcoinScript](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/what-is-bitcoin-script/). BitcoinScript is a stack-based scripting language that works in FILO (first-in-last-out) which means when transactions occur the necessary scripts stack on top of each other and execute from top to bottom.

The person who initiated the transaction needs to prove that certain statements in the transaction are true for the transaction to execute. This means validation happens on-chain, *i.e.* by each full node in the network.

BitcoinScript does not allow for the notion of state, which means there is no knowledge of the current global state of transactions, instead they reference previous transactions.

For example, when a user wants to know their wallets account balance, the wallet doesn't have full knowledge of the state of the blockchain. Instead, it follows the linked transactions all the way through the blockchain and adds up all the unspent transaction outputs (UtxO) and displays it to the user.

In essence, it *only* has the state of those linked transactions.

## Solidity

Ethereum uses a smart contract language of its own design called [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/). Solidity is an object-oriented language with a stack-based execution environment that executes on chain. But, unlike Bitcoin, also allows for Turing-completeness.

That means a Solidity smart contract can solve any algorithm or problem but with one caveat, **it gives no guarantees regarding how long it will take or how much memory it will use**.

How do they prevent bad actors from writing malicious programs that eat up network space? Create a pay wall in the form of gas fees. This decision, without thinking far into the future, gives us the really high gas fees we are experiencing now (some reaching as high as a single $ETH, currently valued at $2,380).

I can hear you now, ""*Wait, so you're saying gas fees aren't inextricably linked to validating transactions on a blockchain?""*

Yep, that's what I'm saying — crazy right?

## ErgoScript

Now, what if there was a way to combine first principles from Ethereum and Bitcoin in a way that allowed Turing-complete smart contracts, notion of global state, *and* no gas fees?

Enter, [ErgoScript](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf).

A scripting language that is robust enough to support things like loops, recursion and DoS prevention, ErgoScript is proven to be Turing-complete compatible while also using the UtxO model like Bitcoin.

Now, I say Turing-complete *compatible* because the scripting language is complex enough to allow for programs to be overlaid on top of those scripts in a Turing-complete way.

This means we can now estimate with accuracy the script complexities themselves before execution, eliminating the need for gas fees. Yes, **no gas fees**.

ErgoScript will also allow for the implementation of another novel and intuitive design concept: extended unspent transaction output, or EUtxO. [EUtxO](https://files.zotero.net/eyJleHBpcmVzIjoxNjE4NDIwODg3LCJoYXNoIjoiYTVhYmY4NjdiY2E2YzdkNTNjODkwNWNmZDZhYmM5MjAiLCJjb250ZW50VHlwZSI6ImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uXC9wZGYiLCJjaGFyc2V0IjoiIiwiZmlsZW5hbWUiOiJDaGFrcmF2YXJ0eSBldCBhbC4gLSAyMDIwIC0gVGhlIEV4dGVuZGVkIFVUWE8gTW9kZWwucGRmIn0%3D/da09c4a41d131fca5f59fdf1b5a7e77b1eef2a9c1b00e2cdf99199baa7d09989/Chakravarty%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20The%20Extended%20UTXO%20Model.pdf) provides the solution for BitcoinScript's lack of global state awareness. This means at any point a smart contract or user can access the latest global state of the blockchain without the memory-hardness of Ethereum’s accounting model.

## The DeFi Perspective

The decentralized finance perspective requires some in-depth research into the stablecoin and DEX landscape as a whole, so while this section may be lengthy, bare with me. It is important to build a foundational understanding of the space to better understand Ergo's unique position in DeFi.

We break this section into 2 main pillars:

1. StableCoins &amp; the AgeUSD Protocol
2. Decentralized Exchanges &amp; Automated Market Makers

## StableCoins

Perhaps surprisingly, the introduction of [stablecoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp) into crypto brought a modicum of distrust in investor sentiment, which largely influenced its sidelining during the [2017 ICO boom](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/initial-coin-offering-explained-ethereum-ico).

Speculators and investors alike cycled out of [altcoins](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/altcoins) and into Ethereum, Bitcoin and cash, some never to return again. As [regulations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/12/20/stable-coin-regulation-with-a-focus-on-the-stableact/?sh=6d6794d33e5a) and sentiment shifted in favor toward the big stablecoin protocols like Tether (formerly RealCoin) and USDC, the option to sell your profits into a stablecoin and earn a yield became useful.

It's my prediction that this current bull-run will not see the exodus to cash much like we did in 2017 but a shift to stay within the crypto ecosystem via stablecoins.

As it stands, the current stablecoin environment is broken into 4 pillars:

1. Off-chain-collateralized
2. On-chain-collateralized
3. Un-collateralized
4. Hybrid

To understand the nuances, its helpful to get some real-world examples of each:

## Off-Chain Collateralized

Tether ($USDT) is an example an off-chain collateralized stablecoin as it is pegged to the dollar deposited in central banks.

The un-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin narrative is building momentum as its counterparts have notable flaws. Off-chain fiat collateralized stablecoins are counter-intuitive to the ethos that underpins the crypto industry, yet they currently dominate.

They are also subject to centralization, counter-party risks, and regulatory constraints which was tangibly evident in the latest round of [regulation bouts between the SEC](https://medium.com/coinmonks/tether-settles-with-sec-john-mcafee-indicted-for-crypto-pump-17066483266b) and Tether.

## On-Chain Collateralized

MakerDAO ($DAI) is an example of an on-chain-collateralized stablecoin as it is backed by deposits of other cryptocurrencies.

On-chain-collateralized stablecoins also have major flaws which stem from the volatility of the crypto markets. This volatility can cause events much like [Black Thursday](https://medium.com/@whiterabbit_hq/black-thursday-for-makerdao-8-32-million-was-liquidated-for-0-dai-36b83cac56b6), a massive liquidation event in the MakerDAO protocol due to the black swan liquidity crisis caused by Covid-19.

Absolutely colossal amounts of ETH were liquidated from MakerDAO vaults with ZERO auction-bids (*i.e.* free ETH due to network congestion), oracle price discrepancy, and the sharp Ethereum sell-off. The amount of ETH gamed from MakerDAO from ‘keepers’ who took advantage of the volatility in a non-competitive auction is equal to $130 million dollars with today's current ETH prices.

Uncollateralized stablecoins are typically smart contracts on the blockchain and therefore require an oracle to feed data to the smart contract to govern the algorithms, which leaves them open to manipulation.

## Un-collateralized

NuBits ($NBT) is an example of an un-collateralized stablecoin as its price is stabilized via [algorithms](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stability-elasticity-and-reflexivity-a-deep-dive-into-algorithmic-stablecoins/) that respond to price volatility.

In the interest of brevity, let's simply say these are mainly experimental.

## Hybrid

[AgeUSD protocol](https://github.com/Emurgo/age-usd) is an example of a hybrid stablecoin that is algorithmically stabilized *and* collateralized on-chain (*i.e.* crypto-backed).

But, before we discover how the novel AgeUSD protocol works I would like to preface that AgeUSD is not a solution to all the above problems. But, using sound mathematics instead of dynamic transaction handling, AgeUSD aims to provide a higher assurance alternative than existing counterparts.

With that said, we believe it's a serious contender in the pursuit of true stablecoins in the cryptocurrency space. Because of that, we look deeper into what it has to offer and why its uniquely positioned to work well on the Ergo blockchain.

## AgeUSD Protocol

AgeUSD takes a hybrid approach in a design model that focuses on key concepts from traditional finance and legal compliance. Remember, Ergo aims to be a platform for financial smart contract applications, it is in their best interest to develop their suite of products in a legally compliant way.

AgeUSD’s hybrid model is also the first of its kind with two pillars from which the protocol stands on; the stablecoin itself (SigmaUSD) and the reserve coin (SigmaRSV).

## SigmaUSD

SigmaUSD is the first and only algorithmic stablecoin to run on the EUTxO model.

SigmaUSD distinguishes itself from other crypto-backed stable coins like MakerDAO by not implementing collateralized-debt positions (CDPs). These CDPs leave MarkerDAO users susceptible to untimely forced-liquidations from unstable price thresholds that are vulnerable to blockchain congestion.

So how does AgeUSD work differently?

Let’s say a user wants to purchase [SigmaUSD](https://sigmausd.io/#/) with their ERG token (this will work the same way with [ADA](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/ada) as well, when supported). They would send their ERG to a smart contract and the smart contract would use an oracle to determine the exchange-rate from your ERG to SigmaUSD. As the smart contract is sending out the SigmaUSD stablecoin to users, it is simultaneously building up a reserve of ERG.

How do price fluctuations in ERG affect the reserves in the contract when users who sell their SigmaUSD and get their ERG back?

First, it would be correct to assume that if the price of ERG went *up* after you sent them to the smart contract, you would receive less ERG back when you exchange them back for ERG. You would also be correct to assume that if the price of ERG went *down* after you sent them to the smart contract, you would receive more ERG.

But, wouldn't that mean the reserves would be subject to shortage? Yes, but the novelty of the protocol lies in the introduction of SigmaRSV, an incentivized alternative in which a user on the ERG blockchain can choose variability over stability by providing liquidity to the reserves of the SigmaUSD contract.

## SigmaRSV

A user will be able to purchase SigmaRSV with their ERG token (this will also work the same way with ADA, when supported). By purchasing SigmaRSV the user is sending their ERG to the SigmaRSV smart contract and an oracle determines the exchange-rate from your ERG to SigmaRSV token.

The SigmaRSV smart contract will then link the dollar value of the ERG tokens within the contract to the SigmaUSD smart contract and allow the equivalent SigmaUSD to be minted for users of the SigmaUSD contract.

This creates an interesting dynamic where holders of SigRSV who provide liquidity to the SigmaUSD reserves will benefit *in opposition* to SigmaUSD users when ERG price fluctuates. Put more plainly, when [ERG token](https://thecryptodrip.com/tag/erg) prices rise a SigmaRSV holder benefits, whereas a SigmaUSD holder does not — and vice versa. Another incentive for SigmaRSV holders is that they will receive rewards from transaction fees within the AgeUSD protocol.

## Stability vs. Variability

For a more concrete example, if Alice enters into SigmaUSD with $100 dollars worth of ERG and mints the exchange-rate of SigmaUSD – as close to $1 dollar as possible – and Bob enters into SigmaRSV with $100 dollars worth of ERG and mints the exchange-rate of SigmaRSV and the price of the $ERG token then goes up, the following will happen:

1. Alice, who wants to sell her SigmaUSD for ERG, will use the SigmaUSD she previously minted – hypothetically $100 dollars worth – and purchase the ERG token at a higher price, therefore receiving less ERG.
2. Now there is more ERG in the reserves because Alice could not afford to purchase the same amount of ERG she originally minted SigmaUSD for.
3. The SigmaUSD smart contract holding the ERG that Alice could not afford to buyback is now called by the SigmaRSV contract holding the ERG exchanged for SigmaRSV by Bob when Bob wants to sell his minted SigmaRSV.
4. By diluting the supply of the ERG he deposited to the contract he can purchase more ERG with the same minted SigmaRSV with a net gain. This works in the opposite way if prices drop.

This novel dynamic provides an ecosystem of stability and variability through game-theory, math, and incentives. This disables susceptibility to blockchain congestion which consequently nullifies the ability to force-liquidate liquidity providers (LPs) with zero competition.

The AgeUSD protocol is one of the most long-term sustainable approaches I have come across to date, but only if the ERG token has reached its full market potential and is less prone to market volatility. I suspect this will come simultaneously with the maturation of the crypto market as a whole.

## Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)

The introduction of [automated market makers ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm)(AMM) has brought the use of decentralized exchanges (DEX) to the forefront of the crypto industry and has been the catalyst for the recent [decentralized finance](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) (DeFi) movement.

An AMM is an algorithm that allows participants to partake in trading and swapping cryptocurrencies in a trustless environment. This is done by participants providing liquidity to liquidity pools in a trading pair like ETH/USDT, with algorithms in smart contracts acting as the buyer for exchanges to be made.

This replaces the need for orderbook-based exchanges where a market maker orders buy and sell orders based off price and outside influence.

&amp;#x200B;

An AMM has the advantage of providing liquidity to fragmented markets and illiquid assets as long as there are liquidity providers. The disadvantage is when there aren't liquidity providers, [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) and [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) from arbitragers pose significant threat to both exchange users and liquidity providers.

Also, because most DEX’s like Uniswap, 1inch, and Bancor run on Ethereum (and as we discussed earlier, due to Ethereum’s design approach, are subject to the massive fees that come with it) small traders are priced out. Large traders are also prone to high fees from slippage as well.

Order-book based DEX’s are way too prone to manipulation like [wash trading](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/wash-trading/), order book front-running, and pump-and-dumps because they cannot be regulated like centralized exchanges.

With that being said, order book based DEX’s do thrive if the market is liquid enough because transaction fees are low compared to AMM’s, regardless of the blockchain it is run on.

Both AMM and order book DEX’s suffer from ‘rug pulls’ (when bad actors launch a project for early investors and drain the funds from the smart contract) from [ICO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp)’s and [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-dex-offering)’s.

## ErgoDEX

[ErgoDEX](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-dex) is another testament to the power of the EUtxO model as it will allow both AMM *and* order-book based exchanges using liquidity pools.

This can't be done with the account-model or the barebones UtxO model as there is no notion of state across blocks. This will allow ErgoDEX to utilize the advantages of both models, and because of its design architecture will benefit from very low fees as gas is not intrinsic to computation in Ergo.

ErgoDEX will also support seamless atomic swaps (swapping tokens across blockchains), without the use of [wrapped assets](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-wrapped-tokens), gateways or trust-based bridges.

If that wasn't enough, the DEX will also support buyback orders to reduce exposure and risk for ICO/IDO investors. This approach allows investors to set block-times representing the amount of funds the token issuer can utilize in a given period and allowing investors to buyback their investment if they are unsatisfied.

This is another novel development from Ergo.

## DeFi Summary

All of these facets — stablecoin protocols, AMMs and DEX offerings — position Ergo to be radically equipped to solve many of the current DeFi pains currently plaguing the crypto space.

## The Oracle Perspective

As it stands the current market for oracles has been largely cornered by [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), a cryptocurrency project that blossomed from the 2017 ICO boom. Chainlink captured the first-mover advantage by introducing the ability to bring data outside of the blockchain to be utilized in a variety of ways via a smart contract and sits at a massive valuation of $13.4 billion dollars at the time of writing.

It's important to note that the founder of Ergo, [Alex Cherpunoy](https://thedailychain.com/ergo-with-founder-alex-chepurnoy/), helped develop Chainlink with Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis when the project was still called smartcontract.com.

Before that, Cherpunoy was creating the frameworks for DEX’s and tokenized assets before Vitalik Buterin even came out with the Ethereum [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/5/ethereum-whitepaper). It goes without saying that Cherpunoy is one of the most experienced developers in the entire blockchain industry and is more than capable of understanding the importance of oracles to decentralized finance.

Chainlink set the standard for oracles in blockchain but over time has highlighted many issues within the oracle space. Currently, oracles can be considered private entities that provide data for blockchain users in a trusted manner – which does not satisfy the argument for decentralized design. This framework of trust in data-feeding oracles has led to doubt of data reliability both in terms of accuracy and posting schedule.

## Oracle Pools

The partnership between Ergo and [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/) finds it too important that oracles not rely on centralized sponsorship and instead be designed to bolster public participation. Within the oracle pool framework, unlike existing oracle providers, all data handling happens on-chain. This means that data is not paid for using a separate utility token like Chainlink, but rather the blockchain’s native token which provides simpler economic incentives.

The way this happens is by utilizing the UTXO model in which an oracle pool, which has multiple oracle providers within, will post their data inside of a UTXO to a smart contract that aggregates all the oracle providers data.

The smart contract will average all the data points and produce a UTXO with the final datapoint and post it to the blockchain for anybody to use for the cost of a transaction fee. This is separate than traditional “pay-to-play” oracle provider models. It also opens the door for economic incentive as data providers within an oracle pool have a pledge to the pool that can be taxed if that data provider provides bad data or fails to provide any data. This model allows for so much more flexibility than existing oracle providers by enabling governance, strict posting-schedule via an epoch-based program, and democratized data finality.

This novel mechanism is the gateway for oracle providers to produce cheap off-chain data that will actually enable traditional financial smart contracts to be written in a cost effective way, allowing traditional financial companies to be more profitable.

## Summary: Code Twice, Implement Once

Much like Cardano, Ergo has spent the past few years with their head's down researching and developing the most elaborate and beautiful foundation for a smart contract platform in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

With developers like Robert Kornacki and Alex Cherpunoy at the helm — building a framework that will support a full suite of novel financial smart-contract products for the traditional world, both retail and enterprise alike — Ergo is finally stepping out from their dimly lit coding rooms and into the mainstream.

With the core development having mostly been finished, the cries from loyal Ergo investors for marketing and exposure is now being answered. Now that you know just how revolutionary the technology behind Ergo is, and the problems it solves, prepare yourself for its eventual entrance into the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

## 

## Ergo Ecosystem

**Sigmaverse:** [sigmaverse.io](http://sigmaverse.io/) is the decentralized applications hub of the Ergo Ecosystem.

**Oracle Pools:** Oracles are the messengers of blockchain networks. They connect off-chain and on-chain data and create the backbone of DeFi systems. Ergo has an UTXO based approach to oracles with [oracle pools](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-27-chainlink-oracles-vs-ergo-oracle-pools/) that will be cheaper and easier to access for decentralized information.

**SigUSD:** [Ergo’s algorithmic stable coin](https://sigmausd.io/#/) application is based on the AgeUSD protocol. Smart contracts secure SigUSD’s peg to the US dollar by backing it with SigRSV reserve coins.

**ErgoMixer:** UTXO based systems have strong privacy features and [ErgoMixer](https://github.com/ergoMixer/ergoMixBack) is a tool for people who want to protect their digital anonymity.

**Ergo Auction House:** Ergo’s NFT marketplace can be accessed at [ergoauctions.org](http://ergoauctions.org/). Users can trade visual and audio NFTs easily with a non-custodial wallet.

**ErgoUtils:** Community made multi-purpose tool [ergoutils.org](http://ergoutils.org/) is where users can mint NFTs, create custom tokens and use mixer-hops for privacy needs.

**Zero-Knowledge Treasury:** Ergo’s [zero-knowledge vaults](https://github.com/anon-real/DistributedSigsServer) are for mutual expenditure and multi-signature wallets; it’s a decentralized on-chain version of a collective bank, or an organization.

**ErgoNFTs**: A community made NFT display application where you can [check](https://ergonfts.org/) your own NFTs.

**NIPoPoWs**: Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work provide side-chains with light clients and enable cross-chain computations. Ergo.Meta, which is a cookbook for sidechains, will be soon published by Kushti.

## Wallets that are endorsed by Ergo:

[Ergo Full Node Wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node)

[Yoroi Web Wallet](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)

[Android Wallet](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-07-29-ergo-for-android-released/) (a mobile wallet on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ergoplatform.android))

## Exchanges - where to buy

ERG is currently listed on gate.io, coinex, bitcoin.com, waves.exchange, swop.fi, biki TradeOgre, HotBit, and KuCoin. ErgoDex will be launching very soon and the Ergo team is continuing to work on additional listings with other exchanges.

I recently left the Maker Foundation after it fulfilled its mission and began the last stage of complete dissolution, and following that I posted the Case for Clean Money on the Maker Forum, which is my take on the path the Maker Community should take going forward to stay true to its original values while charging ahead at the forefront of DeFi and bring the wonders of this movement to the mainstream.

You can check out the (very, very long) post here: [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-case-for-clean-money/10684)

You can also listen to this (very, very long) podcast on bankless where I go into deep detail about both the Clean Money case as well as other recent and relevant topics. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1880RYS9f2Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1880RYS9f2Y)

The overarching idea is split into three parts:

1. First of all I believe MakerDAO needs a clear vision that can turn it into a purpose-driven DAO and help the community to set aside their differences and instead just collaborate to produce results. There is no better or more suitable purpose for a world currency, than trying to fix the catastrophic damage the financial system is right now doing to itself. DeFi and especially a decentralized stablecoin is the perfect coordination tool to help humanity try to overcome this self-destructive tendency caused by excessive short term thinking. This is not just a charity case, I believe this is also the most self-interested and profitable path for the Maker community and MKR holders to take, as it will provide the greatest amount of attention and branding amongst regular people in the real world (tesla is a good example of how well this can work in practice), political resilience (as climate is increasingly becoming the number 1 political issue in many countries), but also the massive changes that will happen to the world because of climate change are undeniable, and being able to tap into Climate Alpha which will determine which assets will be valuable in the future, and which ones will become stranded, is critical in order to create a currency that will hold up and even thrive, when the consequences of climate change finally cause the dominoes to begin to fall for real.
2. To really tap into the value and potential of the Clean Money vision, I propose a new set of very aggressive tokenomics upgrades, including issuing a lot of MKR and using it for growth, such as providing profitable yield farming to ETH vault users where the DAO distributes MKR, but gets even more cash income in return that can then power the tokenomics and benefits of holding MKR. The other key aspect is to provide very attractive direct benefits to long term MKR holders through a system called the Sagittarius Engine that will enable MKR holders to lock up their MKR and either use it as collateral for loans at 0%, or some other benefit such as high APR direct cash payments. The goal is to encourage MKR holders to lock up their MKR for the long term, and in doing so push them over the edge to begin to become more vocal and actively involved community members that can help control and be a check on the governance bureaucracy. We can use aggressive tokenomics to target some ambitious goals, such as getting 10% of the entire ETH supply locked as collateral in Maker, and get 50% of the entire MKR supply locked up long term in maker governance and be highly active community members that help regulate and secure the system and its bureaucracy. Overall I believe this will massively increase the value for current MKR holders today, including myself, especially if we combine it convincingly with the Clean Money vision as this will allow for a massive influx of a new generation of community members that are inspired by the vision, and financially locked for the long term through the tokenomics system. I think we can aim to 100x the number of active community participants and voters that are just regular MKR holders and not in core units or getting paid by the protocol in some special way. Only with such high numbers of regular MKR holders working together and with aligned incentives can we achieve the last goal.
3. An overhaul of the Governance processes and mechanisms that builds on top of what already exists, but improves it and makes it more transparent and efficient. I think on this subreddit we often see a lot of frustration with the lack of transparency around the budgets going to the core units - as a regular MKR holders it often feels like it's just a black hole sucking up value with providing any sort of benefit in return. In reality there is a huge amount of value being created, especially now as the Core Units have started to really hit their stride - but there is no denying that it absolutely critical that MKR holders are in charge. Maker Governance needs to be by MKR holders, for MKR holders, and while we need to increase the resources and budgets that are provided to Core Units a lot more, this needs to be done in the context of systematically ensuring that all work that is done is clearly providing a positive ROI, and this is communicated clearly, and transparently up front before any work is done, with professionals following up and helping the community to continuously assess whether the work that is being done is actually providing tangible value, so the community can cut off projects that aren't delivering, and redirect value to the core units that are providing the best possible return.

My goal with coming back here to this subreddit is that I hope it can once again become a vibrant and central place for deep and detailed Maker Governance and community discussions, and help act as a place where regular MKR holders can coordinate to monitor the performance of the governance bureaucracy, and mobilize to take combined action when there are things that can be improved.  


So to get things started I just want to signal that I will be a lot more active here, and then answer any questions you might have about the topics above, or anything else related to maker or some of the ongoing decisions that are happening in Governance right now."

# How MakerDAO can Leverage Decentralized Notifications

MakerDAO is a decentralized protocol that lets users generate Dai against a variety of crypto assets locked in a specialized smart contract called Vault. The project was built with a long-term goal of unleashing the full potential of DeFi by bringing innovative financial tools to the ecosystem.

For Maker, it all started with the vision to one day truly decentralize the protocol. And in July, Rune Christensen, Maker Foundation CEO, announced that MakerDAO had achieved complete decentralization.

To achieve this, the protocol has a two-tier voting system in place. In the first tier, a poll is created on the governance portal to establish a consensus among the community members. The second tier entails a process where an executive poll is created for community members to vote on technical changes proposed to the protocol.

In this context, all the community members need to keep a constant watch on the governance portal or social channels to be informed whenever a new poll is created. Failure to do so might result in missed voting chances and overall less community participation.

By enabling decentralized push notification for the community through EPNS, Maker Governance participants will be able to more easily stay informed of governance-related activities.

# What Does the Collaboration Warrant?

By partnering with the MakerDAO Development and UX (DUX) Core Unit, we aim to build a proper communication medium between the network and users. This will reduce users’ dependency on third-party media and ensure that they receive timely polling and governance updates. This, in turn, will reduce friction and ensure that all users participate in the network governance. Users can subscribe to receive notifications whenever:

* A new poll is created
* A new executive proposal is created
* A poll ends
* An executive proposal ends
* An executive proposal is passed

As MakerDAO continues working towards revolutionizing DeFi, we are pleased to be partnering with them in an effort to improve the network’s communication with its users. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the Maker protocol.

On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty."

“The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” - William Gibson

  


  
Welcome to the 2020’s — the Digital Asset Decade.

  
We’re about to experience a decade of unprecedented financial transformation and wealth creation, driven by powerful new technologies and regulatory reforms the likes of which we haven’t seen since federal securities laws were created as part of the New Deal after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

  
Over the past decade, a shiney new home for the financial capital markets (“markets”) has been imagined, designed, and is getting ready for investors all over the world to move in. The new market is a bold financial innovation and its architects are financial technologists who stand on the shoulders of the internet pioneers who created the free movement of information and the mathematicians who invented cryptography. The new markets’ foundations and structure have been beta tested for the last few years and we’re close to setting a move-in date, sometime in the 20's.

  
The important feature is that all investors will be invited to benefit from this fintech innovation in the decade ahead.

  
Why the change?

  
By most accounts, our legacy financial markets and their stabilizing regulatory architecture have served us well for the past century. Following the crash of 1929, new securities distribution and trading rules of the 1930’s provided necessary investor protections for the investing public. The rules also created something we now know as “public markets”, and we think of “publicly-traded” companies as being mostly exchange traded and with more liquidity than what we historically have called “private markets”.(what’s the difference?). (note: adding to our label confusion, the public sector has traditionally meant “the business of the government”; the private sector has traditionally described all other companies and private citizens; and the private-public partnerships PPPs)

  
But now, after nearly a century of economic and technological development, the periodic structural renovations to these markets have been showing their age. For a variety of good reasons and in the spirit of investor protections, much of the “public” has been limited from participating in the private markets in favour of accredited investors (Regulatory side note: SEC Proposes to Update Accredited Investor Definition to Increase Access to Investments), making the tensions of wealth concentration and relative inequalities between public and private markets more evident and urgent. (see also : The Private-Market Investing Revolution, McKinsey&amp;Company)

  
Today, an innovative combination of technologies makes it possible to drive more liquidity to the “private” markets and unlock what we’ve thought of as less liquid markets. We’re embarking on a decade of financial market transformation that will remove the legacy distinctions between “public” and “private” markets, creating opportunities for new wealth generation for everyone.

  
By 2030, private capital markets will be public once again.

  
“The technology industry is the place where wealth gets originated and then gets spread out but increasingly the Wall Street financiers are coming to Silicon Valley to invest in companies before they get to Wall Street. By the time a company goes public, you can pretty much bet that anybody who had any connections, who had any appetite, who had any capability, got a bite at it. So if you’re buying a tech company when it goes public you are literally last in line. Not to say you can’t make money but the odds are way down because this fruit has been picked over many many many times.” Naval Ravikant

  
Using our legacy terms, “private markets” have not been accessible enough to the middle class public. That’s about to change.

  
Ethereum’s smart contracts made digital assets — also known as crypto-assets due to their cryptographic foundation— possible and easy. Once an Ethereum standard (known as ERC-20) was defined for what a crypto-asset smart contract program should contain, there was no stopping the imagination. These assets were not limited to being a new form of money, as that was too limiting. Not only could anything of value be represented as a smart contract (and these programmable digital assets would become known generically as “tokens”) on a globally available blockchain, but other smart contracts could facilitate the autonomous exchange of these tokens amongst users.

  
With the ERC-20 standard in place, projects around the world sprung up to launch Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”), often with little more than white papers and smart contracts that could autonomously accept a user’s cryptocurrency and exchange it for a project token that might have some future project value.

  
There was no broker or stock exchange involved in ICOs — it was permissionless and direct investing that generated what were often described as protocol tokens of their specfic projects. There also weren’t any investor protections yet “crypto-friendly” jurisdictions opened their arms to ICOs. Although it was clear that most ICO’s would be deemed unregistered (illegal) issuance of financial securities (stocks or bonds that represent rights of ownership or creditorship and are often traded in secondary markets) this signaled the future of global blockchain-enabled investing. (Note: Ethereum launched as a decentralized protocol from Switzerland and its native currency, Ether, has subsequently not been deemed a security.)

  
The Netscape Moment for capital raising and investing had arrived:

  
The public blockchain became a digital asset settlement mechanism and it became obvious that this technology could be the backbone to replace legacy exchanges with an always-on, secure, auditable, next generation trading exchange.

  
Once projects started launching their tradable, liquid project tokens from countries outside of the traditionally regulated securities, it was clear that blockchain technology was on a collision course with legacy financial markets and securities regulators.

  
In fact, securities regulators around the world soon realized that:

  
“Tokenization is the process of digitally representing an asset, or ownership of an asset. A token represents an asset or ownership of an asset. Such assets can be currencies, commodities or securities or properties.” IOSCO 2019 Report

  
2018–2019: Initial Token Offerings and Security Token Offerings

  
Companies with a unique blend of capital markets vision and technology expertise such as Canadian-based TokenFunder realized that there could be a regulatory-compliant opportunity to help private companies leverage digital assets without creating a new platform cryptocurrency. TokenFunder’s team envisioned representing legal financial securities such as stocks and bonds as digital assets, and so worked closely with newly formed innovation-friendly regulatory sandboxes such as the OSC LaunchPad and the Canadian Securities Administrators Regulatory Sandbox.

  
In 2018, with regulatory exemptions, TokenFunder launched Canada’s first initial token offering on a public blockchain. Rather than creating a cryptocurrency, TokenFunder issued a ground-breaking security token with future rights outlined in an Offering Memorandum. All categories of investors were invited to participate.

  
In 2019, TokenFunder subsequently established TokenGX as Canada’s first security token exempt market dealer. Then in the fall of 2019, TokenGX became the first Canadian company approved by the OSC to build a blockchain-powered secondary trading exchange for the security tokens of future private issuers on the platform.

  
It was now clear that new digital asset technologies, launched with appropriate investor protections in mind and regulatory, could make private market securities very efficiently tradable, peer-to-peer.

  
Under the right conditions, private markets could finally be as liquid as legacy public markets.

  
2020’s Outlook: Decentralized Finance Matures

  
Looking forward to how tokenization will impact the markets in the 20's, imagine transposing the original bitcoin vision onto financial securities with a version for capital markets such as:

  
“a purely peer-to-peer version of financial markets would allow securities to be traded directly by one party with another without going through a stock exchange.”

  
The core technologies actually exist today, and early implementations go by the names of 0x, Loopring, Uniswap. They’re called “decentralized exchange” technologies under the umbrella term of “decentralized finance” (DeFI). DeFi has its own early innovators such as MakerDAO, Compound, Argent, and TokenSets, with more being invented monthly.

  
Decentralized exchanges are rapidly evolving and although many are currently focused on unregulated cryptocurrencies, a very small number of companies are pioneering this technology to the regulated capital markets.

  
In Canada, for example, after extensive platform development, TokenGX was approved by the Ontario Securities Commission to operate what will soon be launched as “FreedomX”, a next-generation regulatory-compliant hybrid securities trading platform with the best practices of Know-Your-Client and Know-Your-Product responsibilities of a broker-dealer to issue securities and govern a secondary trading marketplace.

  


  
TokenFunder/TokenGX’s innovative model achieves the radical efficiency, security and scale by combining the non-custodial distribution of the purchased securities directly to an investor’s digital account with a peer-to-peer trading platform to empower all investors to buy, sell and settle securities using smart contracts without any involvement of the platform. Being non-custodial means the platform never has the investors’ keys, so the exchange smart contracts only respond to the investors’ digital signatures to execute their trading instructions. Both platform components respect the KYC process that investors complete during onboarding. The result — a very efficient low cost platform that can scale using the global reach of a public blockchain.

  
Before digital assets, investors used to be forced to sign and store share subscription PDF’s to invest in private market securities, and the infrastructure required various custodians, transfer agents, and centrally managed settlement databases. And, since it made more economic sense for larger investments, this kind of investing used to be limited to wealthy, accredited investors.

  
Now that next generation platforms like FreedomX (powered by [TokenFunder.com](https://TokenFunder.com))  can digitize the financial securities like stocks and bonds into legally binding, tradable tokens, the overall infrastructure cost burden will be greatly reduced and investing in the private markets will be possible for everyone, even with smaller funds.

  
This will be the real dawn of democratized investing.

  
For issuers that use end-to-end platforms such as [TokenFunder.com](https://TokenFunder.com)  to offer their shares and other securities, they’ll be able to access real-time cap-tables and communicate company updates for their investors right on the platform. If issuers wish to distribute dividends their investors, it’s as straightforward as sending the dividends directly to the investors’ digital account, or offer dividend reinvestment plans with new security tokens issued without any intervention. These issuer services will be offered as straightforward subscription services.

  
In the 20’s, this investing model will be applied to all markets and assets classes including alternative investments. Real commercial property such as buildings could be tokenized and be easily owned by millions. Tokenized portions of residential homes could be held in digital asset accounts and subsequently traded when liquidity is desired.

  
It’s easy to imagine that by 2030 any asset of any value will be digitized and legally tradable in global digital asset marketplaces, secured by blockchain technology. The model will have fewer intermediaries and be over 90% more efficient.

  
And finally, beyond capital itself, imagine the ultimate loyalty program in which retailers give ownership in the form of digital assets directly to their customers’ digital asset account as a loyalty benefit. We can expect that Employee Stock Ownership Programs will be a viable template for Customer Share Ownership Programs… designed for rewards and retention.

  
The 20’s will be the Netscape Moment for capital markets, as digital assets empower a new wave of innovation in finance and trade.

  
Conclusion

  
With a digital asset architecture in place, we look ahead at the 2020’s and see some clear signals:

  
Efficient digital asset infrastructure has the potential to finally democratized investing and solve some of the current inequality problems.Peer-to-peer trading of digital assets will unlock liquidity of traditionally less liquid markets.Legacy distinctions between public and private capital markets will become meaningless. In fact, every company will have the opportunity to be “publicly-traded”.The regulatory challenges of moving to digital asset trading are solvable and forward-thinking securities regulators are addressing them. Where liquidity is desired for digital assets, we already have the financial and non-financial information disclosure frameworks in place.

  
Like the introduction of the internet of information before them, digital assets are a once-in-a-generation invention. They’re here and it’s an exciting time to imagine the future of capital formation and financial markets in the 21st century.

Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecentralizedFinance/comments/q913q6/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,economicsdesign,1,2021-10-16 08:28:32,0,/r/DecentralizedFinance/comments/q913q6/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

  
**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."

Songbird is open systems and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. It's super cheap fees (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Use cases: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl is game changer and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty."

The existing uptick in DeFi’s TVL is noted as an incorporating development in the more comprehensive electronic money sector, whose [market cap](https://blockchain.news/tag/market-cap) currently rests at $2.42 trillion at the time of creating.

The introduction of the coronavirus pandemic positioned a substantial concern on the international economic climate.

Live since June, [*Bzzaar*](https://bzz.exchange/), an exchange platform launched as a means to buy and sell BZZ, takes a unique approach to kickstarting a new token economy. Unlike typical buy and sell platforms, Bzzaar doesn’t rely on traditional market makers for users to exchange BZZ but rather makes use of a *bonding curve* to instantaneously complete transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fhdy3ruermu71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb22d77fc4dfedde2a271f17a76007ea94496500

New projects can easily call the contracts to their own interfaces allowing the creation of a front-end modal to hold the exchange. With this, projects that require BZZ can provide their users with an exchange interface that calls the Bzzaar’s contract functions. **The bonding curve belongs to the community and serves to fuel all and any project created on Swarm.**

### What Is A Bonding Curve?

A bonding curve is a mathematical function in the form of y=f(x) that determines the price of a single token, depending on the number of tokens currently in existence, or the market supply. The key difference is that with a traditional exchange platform market makers are required to provide liquidity to the market, whereas a bonding curve takes over the role of providing liquidity, negating the need for market makers.

&gt;ELI5 — Bonding curves are smart contracts that can mint or burn tokens according to a previously determined equation. The equation is a graphable curve that defines the relationship between the token’s price and its supply — where the price of a token increases with supply.

Let’s elaborate on this. On a traditional exchange, market makers use the available pricing data of users wanting to buy and sell tokens, actively adjusting the price so that token purchases and sales can happen instantaneously. Users can set buy and sell orders to ensure that transactions only occur when a token reaches a certain price, and unfortunately, this may never occur.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1. A traditional market maker exchange platform](https://preview.redd.it/qdacj5dirmu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd14014324a1807c7a1c986e1ddc5292911609f)

With the Bzzaar’s bonding curve, new tokens are minted when purchased by users and burned when sold to the exchange. This creates an autonomously fluctuating exchange where the price is actively adjusting. As users buy tokens, the price of the next token increases, and only decreases when users sell tokens back to the bonding curve. Since the bonding curve equation is known, token prices are predictable and are dependent on the market supply at any given moment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2. How a bonding curve determines token prices](https://preview.redd.it/qqypbc4nrmu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b95e39126b2cc4259e80d03a2d5892c2b7b0f108)

### A Summary Of The Benefit Of Bonding Curves

Besides the speed at which purchases and sales take place, a bonding curve has a few other benefits:

* **Resilience to manipulation:** The Token’s value is far more resilient to outside influences attempting to manipulate its price, such as pump and dump schemes. This is because the bonding curve protects users from panic selling by ensuring every token is sold at a predictable price.
* **No third-party market makers:** Since the price of each token is predetermined by the bonding curve, there is no need for any market makers. The bonding curve itself acts as an automated market maker.
* **Immediately reacts to demand:** Since the bonding curve can mint and burn tokens, the price of a token is immediately adjusted to its demand.

**Fair distribution:** Bonding curves have no validators, negating the need for additional tokens to be minted as validator rewards. This leads to no inflation rate or inflation scheduled. Node operators are rewarded from the existing token pool for providing bandwidth and storage to the ecosystem.

### Using a Bonding Curve

Now that we have discussed what a bonding curve is, let’s look at how you, as a user, can interact with the bonding curve. The most basic calculation we can make using the bonding curve is calculating the most cost of one token at the current token supply. All we have to do is substitute the current token supply value in for x (or s) in the equation

However, users will rarely want to purchase a single token, and calculating the individual cost of each token they want to purchase can become tedious. Let’s look at an example where a user wants to buy b amount of tokens when the current token supply is at a;

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3.The area under a curve](https://preview.redd.it/8aa7o8ysrmu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122a6c2ecfe0fc6c178ed6b1a65eaeda3e195dee)

We know that if we add the value of each value for token supply from a to a+b together, we can calculate the area under a curve. This is impractical for large purchases; an easier method is to use calculus. In calculus, the area under a curve is determined by taking the integral of your function.

For example, our function (not the actual price function of bzzaar) takes the form of:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xzabectzrmu71.png?width=103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e45428ad36416325cb80959e223f0598bbbf094

The integral of our function will then be:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/29ac6bt2smu71.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c200454ff3744a22146fd290491e9931053922c2

Where y is the total cost of purchasing b amount of tokens.

The same technique can be used to help users calculate how much they would receive when selling b amount tokens back to the bonding curve:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgtbuxh5smu71.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=212c47e3b52d70dde0a8976567b23682ef44119b

### How Bzzaar’s Bonding Curve Works

The Bzzaar maintains its own mathematical function to determine the price of a single BZZ token. To understand how the bonding curve function works, we must first discuss chunks.

All data uploaded to Swarm is automatically split into chunks and stored across several Bee nodes, where it is hashed. A *chunk* is the canonical unit of storage in Swarm and consists of a maximum of 4 kilobytes of data. In order to upload data, users will need to buy batches of *postage stamps.* Each chunk requires a postage stamp, as each stamp attaches a value of BZZ to the chunk. Stamp batches are created in buckets with a depth of 16. Swarm’s entire address space is divided into 216(65,536) different buckets.

Unlike most other ECR-20 tokens, Swarm uses 16 decimal places. This was done to ensure calculations in the bonding curve contract are gas-efficient while maintaining a human-friendly nominal scale of 1100, and 1 on the atomic scale. As a result, in a situation where every BZZ token is sold to the bonding curve, the price of the very first BZZ token minted will be 0.01 DAI.

Now we can take a closer look at the bonding curve equation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tbykc7v9smu71.png?width=228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49963e279c94fc9c4d663279eea177af1ab7b821

Where *p* is the price of a single BZZ token, *s* is the current supply of BZZ, accurate to 16 decimal places, and *c* is a fixed constant of 6.25×1023.

The integral of p is:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2kdtx33csmu71.png?width=248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856134665c089e997bb4cb54242b2135be86bc00

A large amount of initial collateral was required to activate the bonding curve. Through initial token sales, and minting additional tokens after the fact, **a total of 66,208,125 BZZ tokens was sold to generate a total collateral of US$ 3,364,662.** With the amount of collateral generated and token sold, the launch price of a BZZ on the Bzzaar was 1.92 DAI. To prove the supply of BZZ at 1.92 DAI, we can simply substitute 66,208,125 for s in the bonding curve equation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1nafhj3fsmu71.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ab852e97ab840d531d06e5753b7b3651d5a762

### Maximum Supply

There is a hardcoded theoretical maximum supply of 125 million BZZ tokens. The high polynomial order of the bonding curve makes it highly unlikely that this theoretical maximum will ever be achieved due to the associated costs. To illustrate these costs, we can set a circulating supply amount to a theoretical value of 120 million BZZ, or 96% of the maximum supply.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x0h2xwgismu71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ad2f36229717543ec596069867554e1d9abf7d

This shows us that the 120th million BZZ token minted would cost 687 million DAI.

We can visualise the high polynomial order of taking several values for the maximum supply, and how each value affects the market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

### Bonding Curve Emergency Shutdown

The bonding curve is self-sustaining and does not require any external input to function . However, there are three critical situations in which an emergency shutdown may get triggered:

1. A critical or exploitable bug is discovered in the bonding curve contract;
2. MakerDAO discovers a critical bug or is shut down for any reason; and
3. DAI loses its peg to the USD.

The decision to trigger an emergency currently belongs to the Swarm Foundation.

"MIT Bitcoin core developers and researchers apply for and receive $50,000 grant from The Graph Foundation, a community-governed organization for the The Graph (ticker: GRT), a widely-adopted decentralized indexing protocol",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd5ue3/mit_bitcoin_core_developers_and_researchers_apply/,graph_marine,1,2021-10-22 09:03:53,15,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd5ue3/mit_bitcoin_core_developers_and_researchers_apply/,MARKETS,"**Background:**

The Graph is an incentivized indexing protocol for the entirety of Web 3.0. To describe what this means, let's say you were opening a bookstore. You have two options: you can either stack all of the books randomly on the shelves for customers to search through manually, or you can organize the books in several different ways (alphabetical order, by topic, by author, by genre, etc.)

Before The Graph, Ethereum and other blockchain networks were sort of like the first example - just an unorganized blob of random data. The Graph's protocol enables users from around the world to organize (index) data on blockchains and makes it easier for developers to retrieve such data. Prior to this innovative solution to unorganized ""big data"" on-chain, developers had to organize all on-chain data manually before creating their decentralized applications (dapps). This would take months-years to complete, in addition to significant developer energy/resources. Multicoin Capital, an early investor in many prominent blockchain networks and dapps such as Solana, describes The Graph's ability to scale reads and writes on-chain as [one of the most, if not the most, powerful tools in the blockchain developer stack](https://multicoin.capital/2021/07/30/scaling-reads-and-writes/). Kyle Samani, the founder of Multicoin, says The Graph is [probably the most requested piece of infra(structure) in the Solana ecosystem](https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1433276276714975232?s=20).

Now, using The Graph, on-chain data is significantly easier to access and retrieve, which allows developers to allocate more of their time creating dapps rather than wasting it on building the database that the dapps require to function. This is why there was a ""big boom"" of dapps (mainly DeFi apps) in 2019, right after The Graph launched its protocol. Examples are vast and include Uniswap, Sushiswap, Aave, Pancakeswap, Synthetix, Compound, MakerDAO, USDC, iExec, PoolTogether, Audius, Dodo, Ren, 1Hive, Gnosis, Tether, wBTC, wETH, EIP-721 and EIP-1155 standards (all NFTs and NFT applications), Kleros, Arweave, Kyber, the list goes on (there are more than 22,000 subgraphs).

At this point in time, The Graph is processing over 1 billion queries **per day** across 24 different supported blockchain networks including, but not limited to, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and more. If The Graph were to stop working, the dapps running on these networks would cease functioning. 

**The Graph Foundation Wave 3 Grant &amp; MIT's Bitcoin Core Developer Group**

As the title states, MIT Bitcoin Core Developers applied for and received a $50,000 grant from The Graph Foundation, which is a community-governed organization that helps to maintain and govern the decentralized indexing protocol, [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) (ticker: [GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)).

At this point in time, I am not sure exactly what they intend to use the grant money for. However, there has been much speculation surrounding this topic and I am going to briefly partake in this speculation with this thread. 

&gt;Source 2: [The Graph Foundation allocates over $1.5M in Grants, Ecosystem &amp; Dev Support in Wave 3](https://thegraph.com/blog/wave-three-funding)  
&gt;  
&gt;Source 2: [MIT's Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/bitcoin-security-initiative)

Back in February, 2021, The Graph announced that they ultimately [intend to index Bitcoin's main network](https://thegraph.com/blog/multiblockchain-support). What this means is that they would take all of the unorganized big data on Bitcoin's network and reorganize it into easier-to-read subsections of the Bitcoin network. 

Think about it, if a developer wanted to create a decentralized application using Bitcoin's network (such as a decentralized exchange centered around Bitcoin) right now, it would take months-years to sort through the 10 years worth of data on the Bitcoin network. Plus, Bitcoin doesn't even have smart contract capabilities on its native network (though with The Graph, subgraphs dedicated to Bitcoin could be used to build smart contracts with Bitcoin data, bit I digress). The Graph takes all of this data and makes it organized and easily readable so that any developer who creates a dapp can simply design a subgraph within The Graph's network and build a Bitcoin dapp using this subgraph.

Once The Graph indexes the Bitcoin network, I predict we will see a huge boom in developer interest in Bitcoin dapps and thus in the development of dapps centered around the Bitcoin ecosystem. This will lead to immense innovation using Bitcoin and its native network and overall increased activity in the cryptocurrency space. It also goes to show how powerful the infrastructure of The Graph protocol is.

Ethereum being among the leaders in accommodating this intensifying flow. December 6, 2022Spurred on by the rise of work-from-home and the rising decentralized workspace, 2 major companies; Uber and AirBnB, have begun researching DAO history and partnered with industry think tanks, such as Curve Labs, PrimeDAO, Block Science and Ethereum Foundation to begin exploring the possibilities of migrating their companies to a pure DAO structure.January 13, 202366c49e33cf0f407d0b9033bf317cd4fffc6701b6 has undergone the first-of-a-kind reverse IDO of a publicly traded company by buying back the entire float of it’s equity, tokenizing the debt and issuing utility tokens back to the community of most active users effectively becoming a DAO and delisting itself from a public stock exchange.June 1, 2023Bitcoin hits aa1d41bef04e1f46bf1f098d2ab6b724a4858a81.July 4, 2023Rochdale principles are hardcoded into the neonXDAO smart contracts as founding principles, the new constitutions of the emerging metaverse society.September 17, 2023Altcoin apocalypse ensues as a result of a large uncurated market meltdown caused by a major S&amp;P correction and cascading liquidations spilling from TradFi to crypto and DeFi.

A decentralized lending protocol with the bulk of traffic coming from sub-saharan Africa, DAFAx was forked by the community of ghostDAO, fueled with the gDAO native token giving massive LM rewards in the massively capitalized gDAO for restaking the entirety of the collateral into its new lending contracts. Eventually ghostDAO managed to completely pull liquidity out of DAFAx, slowly wiping out the second DAO’s entire token value.November 5, 2024Marking the massive new lead in the evolution of human organizations, the DAO frontier has taken a massive step forward with a DAO-2-Business (D2B) acquisition of 19419163c8274dba12e48548257c10250e863b69 with subsequent tokenization of its products and services.April 1, 2025Donald Pump, an avatar that began as a joke gets one's own platform to overrule the DAO voting.

What is Songbird SGB Role - smart contracts - NFTs - vote delegation - minting f-assets - trustline - DeFi protocols - governance - rewards,https://www.reddit.com/r/songbird/comments/qdjeau/what_is_songbird_sgb_role_smart_contracts_nfts/,samsimon123,1,2021-10-22 23:30:32,3,/r/songbird/comments/qdjeau/what_is_songbird_sgb_role_smart_contracts_nfts/,,"Flare is direct competitor to Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts, NFTs. Songbird is open systems, and people will build things with them that we haven't thought of yet. But being able to have smart contracts for layer 1's that don't have them, the state connector, the decentralized built-in oracle, an EVM that works much faster than on Ethereum, being able to trade various L1s on a DEX, decentralized governance, all open up a lot of potential. The fees are super cheap (transactions), secure, fast, uses almost no energy. This is the best network for smart contracts. Great for: Paying transaction fees, FTSO vote delegation, Minting F-assets. Use in apps being built on the network like Flare Finance and Trustline. The simple fact that a SGB/Flare wallet will be able to hold anything bep 20, erc 20, xrpl, is a game changer, and you'll be rewarded for bringing on those assets.

The real power in WSGB is that it utilizes a detachable voting function for the FTSO and governance functions of the network. This also means that users can deploy the WSGB token in DeFi protocols or elsewhere while simultaneously voting in governance and earning inflationary rewards in SGB on a weekly basis through FTSO delegations to signal providers.

Matt Rosendin of Trustline recently announced that they will be launching their decentralized stablecoin protocol, Probity, on the Songbird Network sometime in October. Probity has a similar design to MakerDAO in that it takes collateral from suppliers and borrowers to mint and issue stablecoins. On Songbird Network, it would be expected that WSGB will be the collateral of choice. Once live on Flare Network, Probity will feature FLR and FXRP as premium collateral. Additionally, Aurei (AUR), stablecoin of Probity, can be issued on the XRP Ledger with the Flare and Songbird Networks as the decentralized counterparty."
"Ethereum L2 Scaling is Here, You Don't Need to Wait For ETH2",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvm2i/ethereum_l2_scaling_is_here_you_dont_need_to_wait/,SuggestedName90,1,2021-10-23 10:07:19,51,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvm2i/ethereum_l2_scaling_is_here_you_dont_need_to_wait/,REMINDER,"Ethereum Scaling is always a contentious issue, but I believe it's often brought up mainly to discredit Ethereum rather than highlight a problem. At 49 gwei gas right now I wanted to bring up some ideas and mention the various scaling solutions Ethereum has. Check out [https://l2fees.info/](https://l2fees.info/) for information on the exact costs once you bridge over.

True L2s

**Optimistic Rollups**  
Optimistic Rollups are a scaling technology that relies on people disproving transactions rather than proving this. Thanks to this and tx batching as well as some off chain processing transactions become much cheaper and the chain only has to spend time fully processing contested transactions.

  
Arbitrum is the main implementation of Optimistic Rollups, at roughly $15 per coin to move on, and less for ETH, its a great option to move your coins over to. Platforms like Sushiswap, Uniswap, Aave, CREAM, and others have already moved over so if you want to start farming your sick yield farming gains you can hop on over right now and do everything you would want to do on Ethereum Mainnet but cheaper.  


Optimism, believe it not, does Optimistic Rollups. Its already supported by Chainlink, Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound. You can do everything to your hearts desire here with fees that work out to less than Arbitrum\* (fees not comparable as speeds are throttled during beta)  


**ZkSnarks**  
Zksnarks is math. It uses math to scale things, there are like 6 University papers you can read if you are really interested, but I am not going to throw math here that neither of us understand and call it an explanation. Obligatory Zero Knowledge Proof to cover buzzwords  


Zksync is the main implementation of this technology, and while they haven't seen as much adoption as others their fees are dirt cheap, they are battle-tested at this point and proven to be secure. They are bit harder to code for though, so make sure to petition your favorite platforms to move over! ZkSnarks are amazing and deserve more attention.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Commit Chains**  
Chains that are full standalone chains that submit checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet. They don't benefit from Ethereum's security but can also have their own benefits of high throughput and compatbility.  


Polygon, its just Polygon. Pretty much everything has a Polygon deployment from 88mph to Aave to Sushiswap to even native protocols like Quickswap.  


Tl;Dr - Don't wait for ETH2! Make the L2 Jump today and start yield farming and decentralizing finance. Take this post as the kick to get you to actually log into that website, click the ""move to l2"" button, pay $30, and enjoy a whole new world!

Crypto 101. Mi muy personal y subjetivo punto de vista en Crypto: Interpretación e implementación.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MexicoFinanciero/comments/qdwznm/crypto_101_mi_muy_personal_y_subjetivo_punto_de/,adanchalino,1,2021-10-23 11:35:31,28,/r/MexicoFinanciero/comments/qdwznm/crypto_101_mi_muy_personal_y_subjetivo_punto_de/,,"Escribo este artículo por tres razones, 1) la primera y más importante, es que me interesa la retroalimentación en un tema en el que existe una infinidad de individuos con más experiencia en el tema que me podrían hacer ver las premisas erróneas que tengo y poder enriquecer mi criterio 2) escribir me obliga a ordenar mis ideas, entender mejor y a crear una política en base a ese entendimiento y 3) espero ver la evolución del tema y ver que tanto se aleja o se acerca lo que en este punto del tiempo pensaba.

**Removiendo ruido**

En primer lugar, vale la pena dimensionar (sin desestimar), los ruidos que normalmente rodean al sistema tanto de manera positiva como negativa.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Volatilidad:** Si bien los activos digitales tienen una volatilidad superior a la de activos de riesgo tradicionales como acciones, lo cierto es que un comparativo más justo sería con la volatilidad asociada a las valuaciones de empresas de Venture Capital, en donde la gran mayoría de las inversiones terminan con un valor de cero, pero un pequeño porcentaje termina por tener valuaciones que compensan las pérdidas del resto. A pesar de este comportamiento, históricamente ha sido una buena alternativa (aunque limitada a inversionistas de alto nivel) el invertir en VC. Por lo anterior, volatilidad por si sola no es un factor para desestimar el valor que puede tener crypto como inversión.

https://preview.redd.it/q2l2mmq0d4v71.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8939ecae5caa913d7c549d4a4bcc6fadba6c22f0

 *Cerca del 30% de las inversiones terminan con pérdida, un 28% con ganancias muy ligeras, pero un 8% se multiplica por 7 veces, compensando el comportamiento del resto.*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Especulación:** La combinación que surge del desconocimiento de individuos con un background financiero como yo, provoca que terminemos magnificando las características técnicas de programación que no entendemos. Al mismo tiempo, el desconocimiento de los programadores en aspectos financieros/económicos, provoca que magnifiquen o simplifiquen soluciones a problemas del aspecto de gobernanza, política monetaria o de distribución. ¿Qué tan válido es entonces desdeñar un activo porque tiene un grado de especulación en su valor? No mucho. Quienes invierten en el S&amp;P 500 no conocen el proceso de selección, rebalanceo y criterios de inclusión en el índice y no por eso es una mala elección invertir en el. La gran mayoría desconoce cómo funciona el programa de compras de activos de la FED y no por eso dejan de tener dinero fiduciario. *En la mayoría de las inversiones existe un grado de especulación, en cryptos es mayor en este punto, pero eso por sí solo no cambia el valor subyacente de los desarrollos.*
* **Uso para fines criminales:** ¿El bitcoin se usa para transacciones ilegales? Sí, aunque es mínimo ese uso. ¿Es ese el principal medio? No. Dólar y efectivo de cualquier denominación sigue siendo la ruta preferida para transacciones ilegales y eso no le resta valor al dólar. Adicionalmente, quienes tienen los recursos y capacidades de incurrir en esquemas de ilegalidad tienen recursos mucho más convenientes que una tecnología naciente.
* **Abuso de bancos centrales hace más atractivo el crypto:** Parcialmente cierto, sin embargo totalmente erróneo el pensar que bancos centrales han tenido efecto neto negativo en la sociedad. Papel de política monetaria en el último siglo ha sido decisivo para tener recesiones cada vez menos severas y cada vez más espaciadas. Bancos centrales siguen teniendo un papel fundamental en la economía y no pueden ser sustituidos por el sistema crypto, al menos no sin dejarnos en una posición más vulnerable que la actual.
* **Escasez asegura el valor de activos como bitcoin:** No, escasez por si sola no da valor a un activo. Mejor ejemplo de esto es que hay elementos como el plutonio, entre muchos otros, que son más escasos que el oro, y no por eso cumplen con la misma función de reserva de valor. Combinación de factores (que detallaré más adelante), son los que en conjunto deciden si un factor es apto o no para mantener su valor en el tiempo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Diferencia entre activos digitales**

Con el fin de poder asignar a cada uno dentro de la cubeta que les corresponde dentro de un portafolio es necesario primero distinguir las características y diferencias entre los distintos activos digitales que existen actualmente.

* **Activos reserva de valor:** Como su nombre lo dice, su función es la de mantener el poder adquisitivo de manera absoluta y relativa a través del tiempo. Principal exponente en el segmento crypto es bitcoin, mientras que en activos tradicionales es el oro, aunque han existido o existen, otro tipo de activos como el arte, tierra o incluso hasta whisky que han sido utilizados con ese propósito  
¿Qué se requiere para que un activo pueda ser una eficiente reserva de valor?  
Comparemos en este punto al bitcoin vs el oro:  
\- Dificil de confiscar: Bitcoin superior al oro.  
\- Confidencialidad: Bitcoin y oro pueden ser confidenciales.  
\- Fácil de transportar: Bitcoin es más fácil de transportar que el oro.  
\- Fácil de adquirir: Bitcoin y oro son ambos fáciles de adquirir.  
\- Fácil de transferir: Bitcoin es menos complicado de transferir.  
\- Escasez: Ambos tienen una oferta finita.  
\- Volatilidad: Oro es menos volátil que el oro.  
\- Historial: Oro cuenta con mayor historial que bitcoin.  

* **Smart contract toke**ns: su función consiste en proveer la plataforma, así como la certeza y confianza entre dos partes sin necesidad de terceros involucrados. Principales exponentes son Ethereum, ADA, Solana, Polkadot, entre otros. También conocidos como Layer 1 debido a que es encima de estas plataformas donde se construyen las diferentes alternativas de aplicaciones para usuarios.  
¿Qué atributos se busca en este tipo de activos? Rapidez de transacciones, descentralización, costos bajos de transacción Y escalabilidad.
* **Stable coins:** Tienen como propósito proveer los beneficios que tiene una cryptomoneda (confidencialidad, costos de transacción, rapidez, etc), sin la volatilidad asociada a las cryptomonedas tradicionales. A cambio de esto el upside es nulo o está acotado pues su valor depende del valor de las garantías subyacentes que sirven para proveer de estabilidad a las monedas. Principales exponentes son Tether, USDC, MakerDAO, etc.
* **Utility tokens:** Tokens que representan la participación en un protocolo (layer 2) encargado de proveer de alguna función o servicio al sistema crypto, por ejemplo, protocolos encargados de recopilar información del mundo real hacia la blockchain (oráculos) o también protocolos encargados de almacenar la información generada por algún usuario o empresa. Principales: Chainlink, Filecoin, Iota, etc.
* **Exchange tokens:** Tokens que representan la participación en las plataformas en donde los diferentes crypto activos se intercambian unos con otros. Son el equivalente a la bolsa de valores, solo que en lugar de tradear acciones se tradean pares de tokens. Principales: Uniswap, Sushiswap, Serum, etc,
* **NFTs:** Activos digitales irrepetibles (dentro de la blockchain), no fungibles y con la capacidad de generar prueba de propiedad a sus usuarios. Principales: CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Axie, Crypto Kitties.

 **Diferencias entre protocolos**

De igual manera, es necesario conocer los diferentes protocolos de comprobación en el ecosistema, así como el origen de la trinidad imposible en crypto: descentralización, escala y seguridad en donde puedes tener 2 pero siempre sacrificando uno de esos tres atributos.

* **Proof of work:** De los primeros protocolos y bajo el cual opera bitcoin. Consiste en que mineros de la red deben de llegar a un consenso tras haber realizado una comprobación de transacciones del ledger (libro contable) de la blockchain, así como de una prueba matemática que compruebe que han realizado el trabajo (de ahí su nombre). Ventaja de este protocolo es que ofrece descentralización, ya que existen numerosos nodos de mineros realizando la tarea, además de que ofrece seguridad, al ser necesaria la comprobación de más del 51% de los mineros para que una transacción se lleve a cabo.  
Desventaja del protocolo es que es demasiado lento y consume demasiada energía, al ser necesaria la participación de una mayoría para aprobar la transacción.
* **Proof of stake:** Protocolo hacia el cual está por transitar Ethereum. A diferencia de proof of work, en donde todos los mineros realizan la comprobación. En proof of stake cada minero coloca una “garantía”. Posteriormente el protocolo elige un minero que es quien realiza la comprobación. En caso de que el minero actué incorrectamente, su garantía (stake) se le retira, por lo que siempre está incentivado a hacer una comprobación honesta.  
Ventaja de este protocolo consiste en que al ser menos mineros los que realizan la comprobación, esta se hace de una manera más rápida y con un menor consumo de energía, siendo un protocolo más viable para servicios transaccionales.  
Desventaja del protocolo consiste en que seguridad vs proof of work es menor al ser menos comprobadores, además de que la centralización pudiese irse hacia comprobadores con mayor staking disponible para ser elegidos.
* **Proof of History:** Protocolo popularizado por Solana. Guarda similitudes con protocolos anteriores, diferencia radica en que cada transacción va acompañada por un distintivo que varía dependiendo del momento en que se hizo. Al ser el tiempo un elemento inalterable, facilita la revisión de la cadena de transacciones pues el time stamp generado hace imposible que la cadena pueda cambiarse en el tiempo presente sin generar un código distinto al generado en el pasado.  
Ventaja de este protocolo consiste en que es incluso más rápido y barato que el proof of stake, por lo que su aplicación en transferencias de montos más pequeños o de consumo (ejemplo: NFTs) se vuelve mucho más factible.  
Desventaja es que el nivel de complejidad y características necesarias para ser un minero dentro de este protocolo es mucho mayor, por lo que la concentración tiende a acrecentarse en quienes tienen acceso y conocimiento para minar bajo estas características.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potencial de bitcoin**

A través de la historia han existido diferentes maneras de mantener el valor por medio de activos, y lo que es considerado “dinero” evoluciona a través del tiempo. Como mencioné anteriormente, bitcoin guarda similitudes con las del oro, al ser un activo escaso, fácil de transportar y difícil de confiscar (considerando que eres dueño de tu wallet, características que lo hacen especialmente atractivos para ciudadanos de países con restricciones de capital (China) y con políticas monetarias fallidas (Argentina).

Adicionalmente, a pesar de su relativamente corta historia, bitcoin cuenta con la ventaja, ahora adquirida, de haber sobrevivido a una crisis, y de al mismo tiempo haber mostrado sus características diversificadoras dentro de un portafolio tradicional. Es decir, bitcoin dentro de un portafolio ha probado brindar retornos no correlacionados con aquellos de los activos tradicionales.  

https://preview.redd.it/hpzyi21cd4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be24363071e3fbaefb263f20379ea88c964a5822

Habiendo dicho lo anterior, no creo que bitcoin se convierta en una moneda de cambio, ni en un sistema que pueda dar la infraestructura al sistema financiero, ambas algunas de las tesis comúnmente mencionadas por los bitcoin maximalists. La razón de esto es la ya mencionada lentitud en transacciones y volatilidad de corto plazo que la acompañan. Por el otro lado, es altamente probable que termine por ocupar el lugar que el oro tradicionalmente ha ocupado en generaciones anteriores al compartir principales características y ofrecer un elemento de practicidad tecnológica.

Ya que hemos delimitado su uso, es como podemos llegar al menos a una aproximación de los rangos en los que bitcoin pudiese moverse en caso de cumplirse dicha tesis.

Considerando que mercado de oro tiene un valor aproximado de 10.9 trillones de dólares, podemos comenzar a sensibilizar el valor de bitcoin de acuerdo al nivel de participación de mercado que pueda tomar del oro. Por ejemplo, suponiendo que llegase a tomar un 10% de ese mercado el valor total de bitcoin sería de 1 trillón de dólares. Si dividimos ese trillón de dólares en el total de bitcoins que se emitirán (21 millones), llegamos a un valor total de 47 mil dólares por bitcoin. O visto de una manera inversa, si tomamos el precio actual de bitcoin de 62 mil dólares, encontraríamos que su valor total (terminal), sería de 1.3 trillones de dólares, que dividido entre los 10.9 trillones de dólares del valor de oro arrojaría que el precio actual supone que el bitcoin desplazará el 11.9% del oro físico en circulación.

Mi perspectiva: no me sorprendería ver a Bitcoin tomando mucho más del market share del oro debido a cambios en las preferencias generacionales de inversionistas (hoy es más común que un millenial compre bitcoin a que compre monedas de oro), así como por el FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) de los inversionistas institucionales, por lo que, en el largo plazo no me sorprendería verla duplicar de nuevo su valor, con sus ajustes extremos de costumbre. Sin embargo, la época en que bitcoin hizo ricos a unos cuantos ciertamente ya pasó, pues el que un activo duplique o inclusive triplique su valor no hace a nadie rico.

**Smart Contract Platforms: Ethereum**

Contrario a bitcoin, que únicamente funge como reserva de valor, Ethereum ofrece una combinación de reserva de valor (ultra sound money), al mismo tiempo que ofrece el potencial de convertirse en el ecosistema del sistema financiero global por medio del desarrollo del DeFi (descentralized finance). Por otro lado, a diferencia de bitcoin, cuyo valor depende de la credibilidad que el consenso le da como reserva de valor, Ethereum basa su valor en flujos reales que pueden cuantificarse como con cualquier otra empresa tradicional.

Al ser una plataforma que provee de certeza a los contratos en ella depositados, Ethereum colecta las comisiones (gas fees) correspondientes a esta función, siendo así que es más cercana a un banco que a una moneda o commodity. Muestra de esto son los 2 billones de ingresos que ha logrado durante el último año.

https://preview.redd.it/l17qewoid4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e5a3c15530ac6602dc4cbc51d98837f6bb49171

Adicionalmente, tras una mejora impuesta durante el verano pasado (EIP 1559), Ethereum cuenta con una política monetaria de emisión negativa. Es decir, las comisiones cobradas son hasta cierto punto eliminadas de la blockchain, resultando con esto que el número de Ethereums disponibles inclusive pudiese disminuir con el tiempo, y por consecuencia incrementar el valor de los mismos, similar a una recompra de acciones.

Es ahí de donde viene su atributo de “ultra sound money” ya que si a bitcoin se le considera reserva de valor por tener un número fijo y preestablecido de unidades, en el caso de ethereum esta característica se exponencia al tener un número incluso decreciente de monedas.

https://preview.redd.it/35jc8srld4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0168be71d12c8869779c82ca84ea74ef82a984c7

Una vez entendido este concepto es como es posible asignarle un valor a Ethereum y para este punto no pretenderé descubrir el hilo negro, sino basarme en el modelo realizado por Justin Drake respecto a distintos escenarios de quema de Ethereums ([adjunto liga del spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9cGxGY3_t7m4MEIpjKWtRcA2zRajywaxMCZYqbF9eI/edit#gid=0)).

Con esto podemos observar un valor esperado de Ethereum de entre 3 mil dólares, hasta 130 mil dólares sin la prima monetaria o de hasta 2.1 millones considerando la prima monetaria obtenida por el ultra sound money. Considerando que el precio de Ethereum ronda en este momento los 4 mil dólares es que podemos ver como el upside potencial es mucho más atractivo que en bitcoin. Adicionalmente, durante el siguiente año protocolo migrara de proof-of-work a proof-of-stake (explicados anteriormente), por lo que problemas que actualmente enfrenta la red, como lo son los altísimos costos de transacción, debiesen de ser mitigados y por ende su adopción debiese acelerarse aún  más.

*Utilicé ethereum para el ejemplo de Smart Contract Platforms, sin embargo pueden utilizarse mismos criterios, ajustados a las características de cada proyecto, para analizar otras plataformas como Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, entre otras.*

**DAOs (Descentralized Autonomous Organizations)**

Ahora que entendemos el papel de las crypto reservas de valor (Bitcoin), así como el de las plataformas de contratos inteligentes, podemos explorar el concepto que en mi opinión es el verdaderamente revolucionario del sistema: las DAOS, Organizaciones Descentralizadas Autónomas.

Las DAOs son protocolos que representan una organización transparante, controlada por sus miembros, y no influenciada por un sistema de gobernanza centralizado. Este tipo de organizaciones son montadas en las plataformas de contratos inteligentes como Ethereum y proveen una función específica mediante la cual brindan valor al ecosistema, recompensando al mismo tiempo a sus usuarios.

Ejemplo: Uniswap, plataforma de intercambio de compra/venta/intercambio de distintos tokens en el ecosistema. Contrario a una empresa tradicional en la que existen accionistas que son dueños de la misma, en uniswap los dueños son los usuarios de la plataforma, siendo que esta propiedad se da por medio de los tokens de Uniswap (UNI). Similar a las acciones de una empresa, una DAO distribuye Tokens a sus usuarios que representan un derecho sobre la gobernanza del protocolo. Valor de este token proviene del potencial que existe en que en un punto Uniswap decida distribuir las comisiones cobradas por la plataforma a los dueños de los tokens de UNI.

&amp;#x200B;

**¿Qué hace tan revolucionario a un sistema de tokens vs un sistema de acciones?**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Intereses se encuentran alienados desde el día 1:** Al ser los usuarios, los dueños del sistema, no tiene sentido para ellos implementar cambios a favor de la rentabilidad pero con una merma en el servicio, y lo mismo sucede en el caso contrario, no pueden mejorar el servicio al punto en el que el protocolo ya no es rentable pues ellos también se verían afectados.
* **Concentración de la riqueza disminuye significativamente:** En  una empresa tradicional, fundadores o inversionistas iniciales concentran una gran proporción de la riqueza creada por una empresa, es por eso que personajes como Bezos, Zuckerberg o Musk pueden llegar a ser las personas más ricas del mundo. ¿Por qué no pasa esto con la tokenización de las empresas? Un protocolo exitoso es aquel con el mayor grado de descentralización, esto debido a que se evita el problema que existe con las empresas tecnológicas actuales, donde un pequeño grupo decide el rumbo de las mismas. Con la tokenización de las organizaciones usuarios abandonarían en automático un servicio en donde solo una persona o grupo controla el ecosistema, por lo que concentración de riqueza termina por desaparecer.
* **Acceso a proyectos de Venture Capital:** Hasta hace poco, el acceso a empresas tecnológicas nacientes estaba limitado a inversionistas con altas sumas de dinero, con la capacidad de encontrar estas empresas y ejecutar sus inversiones de una manera escalable. Tokenización de las empresas abre la opción para que inversionistas de mucho menor tamaño puedan participar en el potencial ofrecido por empresas de reciente creación.

**¿Cómo es posible analizar el valor de una DAO?**

De la misma manera en que se valua una empresa, considerando los flujos que tiene la empresa, y es aquí donde se muere por completo el argumento de que todas las cryptos son puramente especulación. Al igual que cualquier otra empresa, las DAOs generan ingresos y utilidades que pueden servir de guía para determinar el precio de sus tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iuvy36ord4v71.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b47832468b6d681eef55e1dff405a443f3a080

Es aquí donde podemos separar aquellos proyectos claramente sobrevaluados, de aquellos que ofrecen incluso valuaciones inferiores a los de mercados públicos.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mi Allocation a crypto activos**

A pesar de que no hay un marco teórico probado a través de diferentes ciclos, que pueda dar una guía relativamente confiable respecto al porcentaje correcto a asignar a estos activos, *yo en lo personal tengo un porcentaje de 15% de activos crypto en mi portafolio global.*

Este 15% se deriva de un enfoque tradicional en el que típicamente, un allocation de 5% a commodities como el oro u otros activos alternativos, provee de suficiente valor y diversificación a un portafolio de activos tradicionales. Es de ahí que un 5% de mi portafolio se encuentra en bitcoin.

El 10% adicional de ese 15% se encuentra en tokens de smart contract platforms, así como en DAOs de layer 2, ambas explicadas anteriormente. El 10% proviene del hecho de que ese tipo de activos no son ni monedas, ni commodities, sino empresas como cualquier otra, con ingresos, utilidades y tasas de crecimiento. Por lo que en mi opinión, es razonable considerarlos como inversiones equivalentes a las de Venture Capital o Private Equity, que de igual manera, históricamente, en portafolios de high net worth individuals, han probado brindar valor.

El 10% históricamente ha venido del hecho de que son activos asimétricos, en los que en el peor de los casos su valor puede caer un 50% o hasta un 100%, sin embargo, perder un 10% de tu portafolio realmente no representa gran cosa en el contexto de un mal año en mercados desarrollados como el S&amp;P 500. Por otro lado, en caso de tener un retorno positivo, el potencial a la alza no está topado, siendo así que un 10% se puede convertir en un retorno de 2x o 3x, beneficiando significativamente el perfil de retorno, sin haber puesto en peligro el patrimonio total.

&amp;#x200B;

**¿Qué cryptos tengo en mi portafolio y por qué?**

* Bitcoin: Reserva de valor
* Ethereum: Plataforma ganadora (muy probablemente) de contratos inteligentes en el sistema financiero.
* Solana: No un ethereum killer, pero sí probablemente el protocolo que termine siendo utilizado para transacciones de menor costo y mayor rapidez (NFTs, Videojuegos, consumo básico).
* Uniswap/Serum: Equivalentes a la bolsa de valores (en este caso de tokens), del sistema Ethereum/Solana. Debiesen de ser agnósticas al desarrollo de las distintas DAOs dado que su valor reside en que trading de tokens incremente.
* Chainlink: Oráculo con mayores aplicaciones en la vida práctica, al ser el encargado de proveer de datos del mundo real al sistema crypto.
* UMA: Mejor protocolo para creación de instrumentos derivados en crypto.
* Maple: Único ICO (Initial Coin Offering) en el que he participado. Proyecto ambicioso de convertirse en el banco de empresas dentro del sistema crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**¿Qué podría salir mal?**

Igual que en cualquier otro activo sin un respaldo físico, valor de estos proyectos podrían desaparecer si confianza en ellos desaparece y con ello desaparece su uso. Valor de rescate en todos sería de CERO, dado que solo viven en la red.

Adicionalmente, regulación pudiese ser especialmente dura con DAOs, con el peligro que tienen de ser consideradas como acciones y con esto ser sujetas al mismo nivel de escritunio de una empresa tradicional.

Finalmente, existen retos de carácter tecnológico que mi limitada capacidad tecnológica no termina por dimensionar, como lo es el papel de la computación cuántica en la seguridad de los protocolos, así como los nulos controles de “fat fingers” (errores humanos) que existen en general en el sistema y que en la mayoría de las ocasiones no pueden reestablecerse.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Si me leíste hasta este punto te agradezco y espero no tomes este artículo como guía ni como recomendación de inversión ni mucho menos, sino como un ejemplo (no se si sea bueno o malo) de cómo formé mi opinión en un tema naciente, que si bien es conocido y dominado por muchos, es aún algo nuevo para otros.

What is GARD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoGARD/comments/qeagm6/what_is_gard/,AlgoGARDian,1,2021-10-24 02:26:48,4,/r/AlgoGARD/comments/qeagm6/what_is_gard/,,"GARD is an algorithmic stable token that not only solves the problems created by tokens such as TerraLuna and MakerDao, but also is backed up by a collateralized debt position that will safely pay its borrowers interest instead of charging them.

We have created the first truly decentralized dollar. GARD is an algorithmic stable token that is backed by Algorand's blockchain and uses Algos as collateral. We incentivize reserve providers by paying them network rewards and giving them liquidity from their locked tokens. We incentivize use of GARD because of the almost zero transaction fees, decentralization, and stability. Finally, thanks to the unique tokenomics and structure of lending afforded by GARD's protocol our borrowers are paying themselves and get an extra return on their investment.

Our solution is distinctive in a few key ways: blockchain, collateralized debt position structure, and the collateral. First and foremost by building our product on Algorand we are utilizing the only blockchain to solve the crypto trilemma (scalability, security, and decentralization).  Second, the way we have structured the CDP positions is so that our borrowers are not only incentivized to mint GARD, but also to keep their positions open because they will have more spend per $ they have locked up in the soon to be launched Algorand governance structure. Finally, because our CDP positions will be backed up by Algos and not some token we have made up ourselves, users are less likely to fall victim to events like those that transpired to Mark Cuban's Titan coin."

At the time of writing, there’s $135.4 billion in stablecoins but the top five collectively represent 94.40% of that total. While the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap increased by 2% over the last 30 days, the stablecoin DAI issued by the Makerdao protocol expanded by 22%.



Tether and Circle’s USD Coin Rule the Roost
Stablecoins are very popular these days and it’s safe to say that these dollar-pegged tokens are not going anywhere any time soon. For instance, at the time of writing, there’s around $29.2 billion in global trade volume dedicated to bitcoin (BTC) trades only.

Currently, the stablecoin tether (USDT) commands 61.46% of all the BTC trades according to cryptocompare.com data. Below the U.S. dollar is the stablecoin BUSD, a stablecoin curated on the Binance Smart Chain as BUSD commands 5.29% of all BTC trades today.

BUSD is, in fact, the only stablecoin in the top five that did not see its market cap inflate. The largest stablecoin market cap today is tether (USDT) which commands a valuation of $71 billion at the time of writing, according to market aggregation sites like Coingecko’s “Top Stablecoins by Market Cap.”

Tether’s transparency web page that shows Tether’s current balances says there’s approximately $70,578,488,377 worth of USDT. With close to a $71 billion increase, USDT has grown by 2% during the trailing 30 days.

The second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle and the Centre Consortium, usd coin (USDC), has swelled by 8.9% this month. Presently, USDC has a market valuation of around $32.8 billion which is around 46.19% or close to half the size of USDT’s market cap.

Tether’s global trade volume is much higher than USDC’s at $52,791,455,644 while USDC’s is around $1,936,810,797. USDC is paired with USDT and BUSD and according to cryptocompare.com data, they are the top two trading pairs with USDC.

#The 3rd, 4th, 5th Stablecoin Contenders
While the stablecoin that stems from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, busd (BUSD) is the third-largest cap, it has not increased during the last month. BUSD holds a valuation of about $12.9 billion at the time of writing and $3.4 billion in global trade volume. BUSD is swapped on 98 different exchanges according to today’s data and it’s ranked 18th out of 9,957 crypto assets.

The algorithmic decentralized finance (defi) stablecoin issued by the Makerdao project, dai (DAI), has seen the most growth this past month gaining 22.7%. While the third-largest stablecoin BUSD has a market cap of around $12.9 billion, DAI’s market cap is $7.4 billion today."

So, to make the argument for why Badger is a viable investment, let's have a look at Maker, which has a circulating supply of about 1 million. Badger has 10 million circulating supply and 20 million maximum supply and is worth about $27 per (time of posting). Badger's market cap is several times lower than Maker despite operating on Bitcoin, which is arguably more mainstream than ETH. Overall, this puts Badger in a position for it to have insane growth."

EntroFi Announced Partnership with dForce to Power Real-world Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EntroFi/comments/qga241/entrofi_announced_partnership_with_dforce_to/,EntroFi,1,2021-10-27 00:21:47,0,/r/u_EntroFi/comments/qga241/entrofi_announced_partnership_with_dforce_to/,,"&amp;#x200B;

Following [Uprets](https://www.uprets.io/#/home), Hashingbot and Ninghua Supply Chain Management, we are delighted to announce our first inter-protocol collaboration with dForce, an integrated and interoperable DeFi protocol matrix covering lending (global liquidity pool, yield markets), assets (stablecoin, synthetic asset, etc.), and trading (liquidity aggregator, AMM).

In the auspice of this new partnership, EntroFi will gain access to the USX’s credit line from dForce, and therefore significantly enhances our capabilities to meet various liquidity demands generated by all the recent collaboration with asset originators as well as more SMEs and financial institutions in near future.

Such inter-protocol partnership also allows dForce to use EntroFi as a portal to connect with borrowers in various forms and facilitate easy execution for RWA deals.

DeFi has enjoyed its most robust growth since last summer, with global TVL soared from 13.69 billion USD in November 2020 up to an estimate of 82 billion USD by the end of September this year; however, such tremendous achievement is still dwarfed by size of traditional real-world assets (real estate, stock, gold, bond etc), which is measured in hundreds of trillion USD. Therefore, we believe the key to break the bottleneck of DeFi growth is to extend its offering beyond cryptocurrency and into the broader scope of RWA (real-world assets).

Major DeFi platforms such as MakerDAO are already onboarding RWA originators into their ecosystem, and it is evident that more RWAs will soon be originated onto blockchains through tokenization, enabling SMEs and individuals who have been neglected by traditional financial intermediaries to access capitals with more transparency as well as efficiency, while allowing DeFi users to generate solid returns un-correlated to crypto volatility.

This partnership with dForce marks the first attempt by EntroFi to secure liquidities from a major DeFi platform. As more real-world institutions and corporates seek to incorporate DeFi into their financing strategies, EntroFi will continuously work with other institutional partners to connect RWA loans and borrowers globally.

**About dForce**

dForce is an integrated and interoperable DeFi protocol matrix, featuring pool-based lending (global liquidity pool), native stablecoin (USX and EUX) and synthetic assets (like xTSLA, xAAPL, xAMZN etc), and trading (aggregator and AMM). By October 2021, dForce is among the top 5 protocol operates on Arbitrum in term of TVL.

dForce is backed by several world-class investors including CMBI (China Merchant Bank International), Multicoin Capital, and Huobi Capital. It is the world’s first open finance project powered by a leading commercial bank.

**About EntroFi**

EntroFi is an innovative DeFi lending platform designed to significantly improve the efficiency of financial infrastructure by bridging DeFi capitals directly with loan borrowers who use real world assets or native NFTs as collaterals. In specific, it is a two-way portal that pools and channels DeFi liquidity to SMEs and individuals who have been neglected or marginalized by traditional financial intermediaries, while on the other hand, brings a variety of real-world collateral assets (account receivables, real estates, pledges of equity, manufacturing &amp; logistic equipment) as well as existing native NFTs (Metaverse properties, artifacts etc.) to DeFi protocols by converting them into a new type of financial NFTs.

The stablecoin scare is coming again. And it infuriates me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qgd8c4/the_stablecoin_scare_is_coming_again_and_it/,LukesVeryGood,1,2021-10-27 02:46:52,9,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qgd8c4/the_stablecoin_scare_is_coming_again_and_it/,DISCUSSION,"*The text was written as an answer to a post over at* /r/MakerDAO*. OP asked what security measures maker should take against the pending ""SEC crack down"" on stablecoins. We should all relax and think before we act.*  
*Todays scaremonger is Bloomberg Crypto:* [*https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1452964460918890501*](https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1452964460918890501) 

I feel this is overhyped and the ""crack down"" slang is lurid and missleading.

The fact: Stablecoins, as well as DeFi, is regulatory-wise uncharted territory. This can be a problem for authorities (think money laundring prosecution) as well as customers (i.e. lack of stability due to lack of reserves).

It is not per se illegal to operate in uncharted territory. If something is not clearly prohibited by law, then it's allowed. The legal basis for that in most democracies is ""Economic Freedom"".

Practical example: Henry Ford did nothing illegal when he started manufacturing his cars, even tough there was almost no car regulation in the law at that time.

There are rules that prevent a govt agency to ""crack down"" on businesses out of the blue. ""Crack downs"" are for players that violated laws.

What HAS and IS going to happen before a ""crack down"" is even on the table:

1. Somewhen next week a Treasury Report will outline the alignment of responsibilities between the treasury and the SEC.
2. Then the respective authorities will establish a set of regulations for participants in the crypto market. I.e. how stablecoins have to be backed and how this backing is to be reported. (I guess Tether will have to create a more exact spreadsheet than now :-) )
3. This regulations will be established with a grace period (that's a legal requirement). This grace period might be short in some cases (i.e. reporting) but can be years long for other issues (like raise of reseve requirements).
4. If the grace period expires and a company does not fully fulfill the regulatory, they get an extended grace period and maybe a fine.
5. If a company behaves malicious or does intentionally not follow regulatories THEN a crack down will happen.

By now we're at least a six to 12 month away from the important deadlines in step 4. And no stablecoin issuer has so far objected to being regulated. Furthermore the absence of the SEC only indicated a lack of federal regulation in the US. In reality most stablecoins already operate under some regulation, either by US states or foreign-to-the-US countries.  
For example FINMA in Switzerland put their first crypto regulatories in 2018, so did Singapore. USDT was ""working with"" NY attorney general.

And regarding USDC: Also consider that there is only an absence of CRYPTO regulatories. Circle plans to go public. Doing so they have to follow regulatories involving reporting and transparency. This already does a lot to prevent them from overdeclaring reserves.

There's a chance that Bloomberg Crypto knows something we dont, but then they should bring the news so we can trade it. Otherwise stop being so annoyingly sensational.

**TLDR**: There is no legal basis for a ""crack down"" as there are no regulatories regarding stablecoins. Bloomberg Crypto is maybe baiting, maybe scaring the market in hope it will move."

Maker/MakerDAO protokoll összefoglaló (DeFi),https://www.reddit.com/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qhpnjv/makermakerdao_protokoll_összefoglaló_defi/,pongvin,1,2021-10-28 23:33:06,0,/r/kriptovaluta/comments/qhpnjv/makermakerdao_protokoll_összefoglaló_defi/,👆 Ajánló,"# Bevezetés

A [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/) jelenleg a [második](https://defipulse.com/) legnagyobb DeFi protokoll a teljes lekötött érték alapján, az Aave után. 2014 -ben indult az Ethereum blockchain-en, és azóta az egyik legfontosabb elemét képezi a DeFi ökoszisztémának - néhányan a Maker-t a DeFi központi jegybankjának kezdték el hívni, szerintem nem alaptalanul. Ezt az összefoglalót annak az apropóján írom, hogy kb egy hónapja az egyik nagy francia bank [felvette a kapcsolatot](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/security-tokens-refinancing-mip6-application-for-ofh-tokens/10605) a Maker-el, hogy hitelezzen neki Dai kölcsönt egy letéteményért cserébe. Az eset azért fontos, mert ennek a kimenetele megmutatja a világnak, hogy együtt tud e működni egy tradicionális pénzintézet egy decentralizált autonóm szervezettel (DAO), ami nem egy elismert jogi személy sehol.

# A Maker működése

**A Dai token**

A Maker feladata a **Dai** dollárkövető stablecoin kibocsátása. A Dai egy token, aminek az a speciális tulajdonsága, hogy nagyon szorosan követi az usa dollár árfolyamát: kvázi bármikor, bárhol be lehet váltani 1 Dai-t ≈ 1 USD ekvivalens másik cryptora (vagy igazi dollárra egy exchange-en). A legfontosabb kérdés természetesen, és egyben a protokoll legfontosabb eleme, hogy **miért és mitől** tartja az árfolyamát a Dai: miért nem emelkedett ≈$1.05 felé vagy süllyedt ≈$0.97 alá a Dai sok sok év óta.

A USDC stablecoin dollárkövető magatartását könnyű megérteni: egy Circle nevű tradicionális intézmény vállalja, hogy bármikor be lehet váltani nála 1 USDC-t 1 igazi USD-ért. A Dai mögött viszont nincs intézmény és nincs ilyen ígéret.

**A Dai életciklusa**

Dai-t bárki ""nyomtattathat"" magának egy OCDP (over-collateralized debt position) létrehozása által, amit Vaultnak neveznek. Nagy vonalakban az történik, hogy leköthet az ember valamilyen blockchainen található értéket (például ETH, USDC, WrappedBTC, vagy ez a security token amit a Societe-Generale ajánlott fel a bevezetésben) a Vaultba, és a letétemény **igazi usa dollárban számított** ellenértéke alapján kérhet ""kölcsönt"" Dai formában. A letétemény a collateral, a debt position a Dai kölcsön, a ""over-"" előtag pedig azt jelenti, hogy a letéteménynek mindig többet kell érnie igazi usa dollárban valahány százalékkal, mint ahány *darab* dai lett kölcsönvéve. **Minden** Dai token így születik, és akkor semmisül meg, amikor az ember visszafizeti a kölcsönt, **egy stability fee-nek nevezett kamattal együtt** (felszabadítva ezzel a letétet). A stability fee-ről lesz még szó.

Példa: Tegyük fel hogy 1 ETH most 100 igazi USD-t ér. Ezt az ETH-et leköthetem egy Maker Vaultba, és cserébe maximum 80 darab Dai-t ""nyomtattathatok"" magamnak a Makerrel (vagy kevesebbet). A letét értéke tehát igazi USD-ben számolva mindig több, mint a letét ellen felvett Dai tokenek *számossága*. 

**A dollárkövetés első pillére: árfolyam arbitrage**

Az 1 ETH amit a példában lekötöttem, egészen addig hozzáférhetetlen marad, ameddig vissza nem fizetem a Maker-nek a 80 darab Dai-t amit felvettem (plusz a stability fee kamatot). Az első pillére a Dai dollárkövető magatartásának ebből ered. Mivel a letétemény USD értékéből számítódik az, hogy *hány darab* Dai hozható létre vele és *hány darabot* kell visszafizetni, ezért hogyha változik a Dai USD-ben számolt árfolyama, akkor megéri venni, vagy még kölcsön kérni és eladni Dai-t. **Példa**: Ugyan úgy 1 ETH-et kötöttem le és 80 Dai-t vettem fel ellene, de ma hirtelen 1.5 igazi USD-t ér a Dai. Ez nekem marha jó, mert eladhatom a 80 Dai-t 120 igazi USD-ért, vehetek belőle még 120 USD-nyi ETH-et, amit leköthetek még plusz 96 Dai -ért, amit megint csak eladhatok 144 igazi USD-ért, amiből megint vehetek ETH-et. És így tovább, egészen addig, amíg a Dai nyomtatással le nem nyomtam az árfolyamát - a profitom meg egy rakás ingyen ETH.

Mi történik viszont, hogyha a Dai/USD árfolyama csökken, például 0.50 USD-re? Tegyük fel most egy pillanatra, hogy bízunk abban, hogy a Dai/USD árfolyam valamikor a jövőben vissza fog térni 1Dai≈1USD-re. Ez most egyelőre egy feltételezés, ahhoz hogy biztosabbak legyünk ebben, látnunk kell a többi pillért, de most menjünk így. Ebben az esetben nekem megéri USD-ért vásárolni Dai-t, mert összesen 40 USD-ért vissza tudom fizetni a 80 Dai-t amit felvettem az 1 ETH ért cserébe, **úgy, hogy megmarad a 80 Dai amit eredetileg felvettem.** Tehát ha visszaáll a jövőben az árfolyam 1Dai≈1USD-re, maradt nálam 80 Dai, -40USD (a piacon vásárolt Dai értéke) és *nulla adósság* a Maker felé: tehát össz 40USD-nyi profit. Ezt annyiszor csinálom meg, ahányszor megéri. Mivel minden ciklusban vásárolok Dai-t a piacról, emelem az árfolyamát, szóval egy idő után eléri a 1Dai≈1USD-t.

Ennek a kettő arbitrage lehetőségnek (és a Vault használók által működtetett arbitrage botok működésének) a hatása az elsődleges védvonal, hogy az árfolyam ritkán és kicsit tér el a 1Dai≈1USD-től.

**A dollárkövetés második pillére: Vault liquidation (Vault felszámolási eljárás)**

Mi történik abban az esetben, hogyha a letétemény értéke csökken, és már nem elegendő ahhoz, hogy fedezze az ellene felvett Dai-t? A példában, tegyük fel hogy 1 ETH 100 USD-t ért tegnap, 80 Dai-t fel is vettem rá, viszont mára 90 USD-re csökkent az ETH. Ezen az árfolyamon max 72 Dai-t tudnék felvenni, de 80-at vettem fel tegnap, tehát a letéteményem nem elegendő a kölcsönöm fedezésére a mai nap. A Maker megengedi, hogy a fedezetlen Vaultokat (OCDP-ket) *akárki* kivásárolhatja amikor csak akarja. Valaki meglátja, hogy fedezetlen a Vaultom, mert 80 Dai-val tartozok, de 72 lenne a max. Leegyszerűsítve, ez a valaki kivásárolhat engem úgy, hogy visszafizeti a 80 Dai kölcsönt a protokollnak a nevemben, és cserébe megkapja az 1 ETH-et ami a letétem volt. Neki ez megéri, mert gyakorlatilag 80 Dai-ért kapott 1 ETH-et, holott 1 ETH 90 Dai=90USD-t ér ma. 10 USD-nyi profit neki, -10 USD-nyi veszteség nekem (megmaradt a 80 Dai-m, de elvesztettem 90 USD-nyi ETH -et). A gyakorlatban kicsit bonyolultabb a deficiteljárás, valójában aukcióra bocsáttatik a fedezet és nem feltétlen az egész fedezetet veszti el a Vault tulajdonosa, de nagy vonalakban így megy. Ezeket a deficites Vaultokat vadászó embereket/botokat Keeper-eknek nevezi a Maker lingo, és az ő tevékenységük miatt a Maker protokoll összességében mindig túlfedezett, tehát mindig több értékű letétemény van a vaultokban mint amennyi Dai van forgalomban összesen. 

A Keeper-ek hozzájárulnak a Dai árfolyamának a stabilizálásához, mert valahonnan meg kell szerezniük a Dai-t, hogy kivásárolhassák a letéteményeket. Az első pillérben felvázolt 2 arbitrage lehetőség alapján eldöntik, hogy nyomtatnak e maguk, vagy inkább a piacon vásárolnak, vagy tökmindegy.

**A dollárkövetés harmadik pillére: Dai Savigs Rate (DRS)**

Van egy modulja a Maker-nek, amibe le lehet kötni Dai tokeneket, ahol kamatoznak. Fontos hangsúlyozni, hogy ez a modul kizárólag ennyit csinál, az ide lekötött Dai-t nem veheti kölcsön más, csak ülnek benne a tokenek és kamatoznak. Például beletehetek 100 Dai-t, és ha most épp 3% az éves kamat, egy év múlva kb 103 Dai-t tudok majd kivenni onnan. Előtte is kivehetem bármikor, vagy tehetek még be, másodpercenként íródik jóvá a kamat.

Vegyük észre, hogy a DRS egy *költség* a protokollnak, hiszen a kamatnak valahonnan jönnie kell (mert ugye mindenki többet vehet ki mint amennyit betett). Az extra Dai amit így kivehetnek az emberek nem a semmiből születik, hanem abból jön, amennyi extra kamatot kell visszafizetniük a Vault tulajdonosoknak az OCDP használatáért: a már említett **stability fee** egy része megy ide (de sose nagyobb mint a stability fee).

Ez a modul felfogható egy jegybanki alapkamat rendszernek, mert hasonló hatásokat ér el. A MakerDAO közösség határozza meg a mindenkori DRS alapkamatot, MKR Governance Tokenekkel szavazás alapján (erről lesz még szó a negyedik pillérben).

Az DRS alapkamat emelése vagy csökkentése befolyásolja a Dai kívánatosságát: minél nagyobb a DRS, annál jobban megéri Dai-t szerezni és lekötni a DRS-be. Minél alacsonyabb, annál kevésbé kívánatos Dai-t tartogatni DRS-ben, szóval érdemesebb elhasználni (e.g. eladni). Hogyha a a Dai árfolyama 1 USD alá esik, akkor a DRS megnövelésével kívánatosabb lesz Dai-t tartani a DRS-ben, ami Dai vásárláshoz vezet, emelve az árfolyamot (nyomtatni nem érdemes azért hogy lekösse az ember a DRS-be, hiszen a stability fee mindig nagyobb mint a DRS%). Ha 1 USD felé emelkedik a Dai, akkor a DRS % csökkentésével több Dai fog visszakerülni forgalomba ahogy kiveszik az emberek, csökkentve az árfolyamát.

**A dollárkövetés negyedik pillére: MKR Governance Token és a végső vásárló (buyer of last resort)**

A MKR tokennek elsődleges szerepe a Maker protokoll kormányzásával összefüggő szavazások lehetővé tétele. Akinek van MKR tokenje, szavazhat protokoll módosításokra vagy fejlesztésekre. A decentralizált kormányzásba nem mennék bele részletesen, csak abba, hogy miért éri meg helyesen kormányoznia a protokollt a MKR tokennel rendelkezőknek, és hogy kapcsolódik ez a Dai stabilitásához.  

Előfordulhat olyan eset, amikor túl hirtelen túl sokat esnek a letétemények, és a Keeper-eknek nem éri már meg teljesen felszámolni a deficites Vaultokat. Például: 1 ETH tegnap 100 USD volt és 80 Dai-t vettem fel ellene, de ma 50 USD-re esett az ETH. Az önkéntes Keeper nem fogja elvállalni, hogy veszteségesen kivásároljon engem, hiszem 80 Dai-t kéne befizetnie ahhoz hogy megkapja az 50 USD-nyi ETH-et, ez 30 USD veszteséget jelentene neki. A Keepernek viszont van lehetősége részben kivásárolni engem: 45 Dai-t befizet és megkapja cserébe az 1 ETH-et. Ebben az esetben a Maker rendszerben -35 Dai deficit keletkezett: a Keeper kivásárolta az OCDP-t, viszont csak 45 Dai folyt be, holott 80 volt az adósság.

A Dai deficitet sürgősen nulláznia kell a protokollnak, különben veszélyben van a Dai árfolyama (több Dai van forgalomban, mint amennyi lehetne). A deficit nullázásához a protokoll automatikusan elárverez új MKR-t 35 Dai-ért. Kvázi azt jelenti ki a protokoll publikusan, hogy kap az első jelentkező 1 új MKR-t 35 Dai-ért. Ha nem veszi meg senki, emeli 2 MKR-re és így tovább, ameddig nincs vásárló. A 35 Dai a vásárláskor megsemmisül (hogy fedezze a protokoll deficitet), a vásárló pedig gazdagabb lett 2 MKR tokennel amivel szavazhat.

# Végszó

A számok amiket használtam a posztban nem feltétlen valódiak, de a példa kedvéért egyszerűek, hogy szemléltessék a mechanizmusokat.

A MakerDAO kormányzásáról és a MKR token tulajdonosokról, valamint az aukciókról sok infot kihagytam, a System Surplus rendszert pedig nem is említettem. A protokoll maga szerintem egyetemi kurzus nagyságú, hogyha az egészet részletesen át akarja látni az ember. Vélhetően továbbra is a DeFi egyik meghatározó komponense marad."

&gt; (1)  CryptoPunks are NOT bought and sold on the Opensea [market]. The CryptoPunks contract (anno 2017) predates the ethereum token standards #721/1155 and therefore is NOT compatible with the Opensea [market].
&gt; CryptoPunks are bought and sold exclusively

&gt; This is why wrapped crypto punks exist. 
&gt; Note. Larva labs site has no [extra] fee [ontop of the standard ""gas"" transaction fee] 
&gt;
&gt; (2) Contract functions can make many calls

&gt; The contract took a 500+ million loan in $DAI

Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Assets within decentralized finance, namely crypto, are by far the best-performing investment class today. However, you can also lose all of your money if you’re not careful.

It’s not uncommon for a project to generate hype, only to collapse weeks later. That’s why it’s especially important for retail DeFi investors to 1. have a framework to analyze projects, and 2. apply this framework before jumping in. 

DeFi's decentralised nature lets anybody participate. It’s surprising how little technical expertise or cash is needed to bootstrap a project or token. The results can be catastrophic for investors who decide to invest without doing due diligence.

Luckily, the flipside of decentralization is that data is transparent and readily available. The data does not lie, so this is where an intelligent investor should first look.

When investigating a project, you can’t go wrong by starting with 3 metrics and 5 charts. 

* Total locked value

Chart 1: TVL Growth

Chart 2: TVL Distribution

* Market cap

Chart 3: MC/FDV Ratio

Chart 4: MC/TVL Ratio

* Token price &amp; allocation

Chart 5: Token Price Movement

&amp;#x200B;

[Monthly Total Number of DeFi ProtocolsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/mhrokaw1p5x71.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd045aa000d098653340b3f56e2a8423f95a2631)

**Total Value Locked (TVL)**

## Make sure the project has a stable TVL growth

TVL refers to the total value of assets deposited by users and locked into a protocol. More assets in a project locked means users have more confidence providing liquidity and collateral for the protocol’s economic activities. This both signal’s the market’s confidence in the project.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 10 Protocols TVL &amp; Market Cap ComparisonData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/u6bkrn95p5x71.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6091009b3d44e0a0e7a2bcfe6f654b054c14506)

As you can see, the top 10 protocols are of both huge values above $5 billion and stable TVL growth month-by-month. That indicates a project is continuing to maintain its vitality and strength.

On the other hand, when looking at weaker, less reputable projects, the picture is different. Huge TVL changes per day, with an unsustainable upward trend, usually followed by a significant drop the day after the rise.

&amp;#x200B;

[Unstable TVL ProjectsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/booakrc6p5x71.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=605867d5218e4d182116ecd838dc8ca98702492d)

## Pick projects whose TVLs are “middle-of-the-pack”

As is clear from the scatter chart below, projects are proliferating like crazy with an extremely uneven TVL distribution. There are currently over 500 DeFi projects, of which 33%have TVLs below $5 million.

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL Distribution of Protocols \(Excluding Top 10 TVL Protocols\)Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/xfmu7we7p5x71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16415aa054237ca657935a04abcbafb8edf60833)

This is one of the easiest ways to separate projects into 3 categories:

* Already “priced in” or overleveraged/overvalued 
* Completely new, unproven and risky
* Projects with potential

How should you balance risk with reward?

To be on the safe side and to prevent the risk of too small projects running away with their money, individual investors should try to select projects in the middle of the TVL range and above (around $20 million) when deciding who to invest in.

Those in the $1 million to $10 million range are suitable for seed rounds by investment institutions. Individual investors should avoid these because their future positioning and strategic direction is not clear.

While TVL projects in the $10 to 20 million range have found a suitable growth strategy and investors have access to data on this segment, in terms of stability, there is a risk of stunted growth in these projects and a high risk of weak growth or decline if growth is not sufficient.

TVL projects in the $20 million to $50 million range have, to some extent, found a clear fit in terms of product mechanics and growth, with community and technical support gradually becoming more sophisticated, and are a good choice if you want to achieve higher returns than the top protocols.

If your risk tolerance is low and your need for return is not too high, you can choose projects from the top protocols to invest in based on your preferred DeFi project category (e.g. DEX for providing liquidity, lending for lending, etc.)

Market Cap (MC) 

Market cap is the most accurate overall reflection of a project’s market value. 

This metric is calculated similarly to stocks in the traditional equity market, namely by multiplying the price of the token by the number of tokens in circulation and available for trading.

As the number of tokens is affected by circulation and supply and demand, the price of the token can change quickly. On the other hand, market cap tends to increase or decrease within a 20% range, with no sharp increases followed by precipitous crashes.

This stable quality makes market cap a good underlying indicator to evaluate projects and identify potential and worthwhile investments. 

## Avoid low MC/FDV ratios when looking for long-term holds

Fully diluted valuation (FDV) refers to the maximum supply of tokens multiplied by token price. In other words, it is equal to the market cap when all tokens have been released. 

If the MC/FDV ratio of a project's tokens is low, it means that a large number of tokens have not yet been released. This happens when 1) the protocol is newly live; 2) the total supply of the token is extremely large.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top Protocols Token MC\/FDV RatioData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/qs79wa49p5x71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b681d8f3b723826b0caa65d0376104c88c238067)

Investors should consider FDV carefully, focusing on the length of time the project has been online and the token supply schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

[Low Ratio of  MC\/FDV Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/r6j60y8ap5x71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e802665e6a75725f5fa25a19288ec724438c61)

Some examples of projects with low ratios are:

* Fruit : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.002%
* StakedZEN : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.077%
* Hanu Yokia : MC/FDV Ratio is 0.17%

The MC/FDV ratio allows investors to assess whether a token price is overheated.That’s because a low ratio indicates that the supply will eventually be higher than the actual demand once project owners release more tokens.  With the demand increasing rapidly, the price will likely drop as the market adjusts. 

Look at the chart below to see how top-ranked projects looked from a MC/FDV perspective. 

Projects with an MC/FDV ratio higher than 60% are better for long-term holding with price security almost guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Price of Top ProtocolsData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/9x9qam9bp5x71.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd0ede6627c8bb8f2c124dd9b47feef387d9991)

On the other hand, high MC/FDV ratio projects aren’t without drawbacks. They usually have higher entry prices. Though this isn’t always the case, analyzing the data will allow you to make better investments based on your goals. 

Curve (CRV), for example, has an MC/FDV of 11.86%. Lido, another lending project, has a lower MC/FDV at 5.54% *AND* a higher token price. So, when comparing the two, we can see that those looking for long-term DeFi lending projects to invest in should consider Curve over Lido. 

## Keep an eye out for projects with a low MC/TVL ratio

&amp;#x200B;

The current MC/TVL ratios of the top 10 TVL projects are almost without exception less than 1. This means that these projects are undervalued and worth investing in. Here’s why:

From an economic perspective, the higher the TVL of a project, the higher the MC should be because a high TVL indicates that investors have a high degree of confidence in the project’s economic utility. 

In other words, when investors lock in their tokens it means that they are utilizing the project rather than speculating. More utilization relative to speculation is usually a good sign. 

Therefore, investors should take a gook look at the MC/TVL ratio. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the valuation may be too high and the investability is low, while a ratio less than 1 indicates that the project is undervalued and the returns are primed to increase. 

Remember to always compare projects within the same categories for valid comparisons, and especially compare lesser known projects’ ratios from those of the top protocols.

Stable token price and reasonable token allocation mechanism

## Choose projects whose tokens are stable

Many people do DeFi investing backwards. 

They start by looking at token prices, then do research on the underlying project to justify their (often FOMO-driven) investment. 

Instead, you should have already investigated suitable projects using the metrics and indicators explained above. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 5 Protocols Token Price ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/of17hxeep5x71.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eff6e7c8c6cf4971369a081db972144a7be96b1)

After you’ve created a shortlist of projects you are interested in, screened for solid fundamentals, you can then look at the token prices. 

In crypto, “stable” is a relative term. 

At Footprint, we recommend being wary of price jumps and drops within 20%. Normally, the extreme change of price indicates an unhealthy market reaction to some news that might just be a pump.

If the token price remains relatively stable, the liquidity of the token is relatively stable also. Therefore, the possibility of damage to the project caused by a large number of individual investors selling tokens is reduced.

As with other metrics, this rule is best applied when comparing your different options on a visualization chart, as above. 

The data indicates that InstaDApp and MakerDAO are more resistant to the negative effects of a sell-off than Curve, for example.

## Summary: 5 Steps to Assess The Investability of a DeFi Project 

When looking for the next project to invest in, start with the fundamentals. Use data to compare projects within the DeFi projects you feel spanly about in your thesis. 

The takeaways:

* Stable TVL growth
* Mid-range TVL ranking or above, approximately $20M or higher
* MC/FDV ratio higher than 5%
* MC/TVL ratio less than 1
* Stable token price with monthly fluctuations under +/- 20%

For the above metrics, readers can access them directly in this featured [Footprint dashboard, entitled “How to Discover Valuable Project”](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/97bd7a34-8221-4eab-afe9-23b9a00567ec#name=How%20to%20Discover%20Valuable%20Projects%20). 

Furthermore, the tokenconomics and the team structure of a protocol are also key reasons to consider when investing.  If the percentage of tokens held by the team or foundation is too high, then there is a bigger chance that the project is a money grab.

This can easily lead to a situation where a core group of people can release tokens quickly in an attempt to “cash out”, leading to a serious dilution of the token price and an increased possibility of the tokens being sold off.  

DeFi, as a new investment market, has created more investment possibilities than traditional finance, with many worthwhile projects that are quite slept on.

However, opportunity and risk goes hand-in-hand. 

It’s important to remember that the DeFi market is inherently unpredictable, and that even the above indicators are no guarantees for long-term viability.

Oct, 2021, simon@footprint.network

Data Source：[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/008802de-e388-43d1-99fa-cf85928fbbdc/liquity-dashboard?days=past3months~&amp;name=liquity#secret=500CC586E554189EFFA21705990A5DEC)

For crypto investors, crypto loans are an effective and popular way to leverage the market if you’re going long on a DeFi project or token. 

However, while investors can find plenty of low-interest loans with various collateral options on established platforms such as Aave and Compound, there is a proliferation of new projects that claim to use innovative tools to provide better terms than these large protocols. 

Liquity is one such project. It claims to offer incredibly favorable loan terms for users, collateralized with ETH. The main purported advantages are:

* 0% interest
* Minimum collateral ratio of 110%. 
* Directly redeemable
* Liquidation loss of less than 10%
* Additional revenue through native token staking and deposit

With these claims, is Liquity too good to be true, or a truly innovative protocol with span fundamentals?

Let’s step back from the hype and examine the data. This article will help investors looking into the five claims above using analysis conducted with the Footprint platform.

**What is Liquity**

Aave and Compound, which allow users to **\[do x\]**, are currently market leaders in lending. But for those who want to do **\[y\]**, Liquity is a rapidly growing option. In March, the project got $6 million in Series A funding from **\[whom\]** and now has a TVL of about ETH400,000, or about $1.6 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

[ETH TVL（since May  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/3xa4ff79shx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=778972970402087ca6ed08dccf6e232464947bb6)

Liquity is primarily used as a lending pool where you can use ETH as collateral to receive its native stablecoin, LUSD. 

But, it also offers two other methods to help users earn additional revenue. 

1. You can deposit LUSD into a Stability Pool to get a percentage of users’ liquidated ETH from that pool in the form of Liquity’s token, LQTY. 
2. You can stake LQTY and receive about 15% when users borrow or redeem their loans. 

## Claim 1: 0% interest rate

That Liquity supports ETH only as collateral for borrowing and offers interest-free loans is claimed to be more capital efficient than other lending protocols. 

Firstly, Liquidity does in fact offer a 0% loan *in terms of interest rate*. 

However, this can be misleading as borrowers need to look at the combined borrowing rate, which is the sum of interest rates and borrowing fees.

In traditional finance, the interest rate is what the lender charges you as the price of the loan while the borrowing fee is set by, and goes partially to, the brokerage. This is similar in the world of DeFi lending, where the borrowing fee goes to the liquidity providers.

In Liquity,  the Borrowers are required to pay a so-called borrowing fee instead of interest rate. Such rate fluctuates between 0.5% - 5%, determined by the recent redeemed time and amount length and fixed cost amount.

Therefore, Liquity encourages borrowers to borrow for the long term, and does not make as much sense for short-term loans. 

## Claim 2: Minimum collateral ratio of 110%

Borrowers on Liquity must open a Trove, which is basically the protocol’s version of a Vault or CDP. 

You deposit a certain amount of collateral (in ETH) and can then withdraw LUSD based on that. The collateral rate must be higher than 110% and will be liquidated when it drops below 110%. 

As a quick explainer, here’s an example:

* You want to borrow 2 ETH, because you think the price will go up from the current hypothetical price of $4,000/ETH. 
* You need to deposit 2.2 ETH (valued at $8,800 in total) to get a loan of 2 ETH (valued at $8,000)
* Loans are paid in a USD-pegged stablecoin, so you’ll get 8,800 LUSD.
* If borrowing at exactly 110% collateral, your deposit worth $8,800 will be liquidated as soon as the price of ETH drops at all—i.e.below $4,000/ETH—and you will be left with just the loan valued at $8,000
* The extra buffer of 10%, or $800, is called the liquidation reserve

As you can imagine, the lower the minimum collateral rate, the more you can safely borrow based on the capital you have. While most lending platforms have minimum collateral rates of 150%**,** how can Liquity set theirs so low?

Firstly, both the borrowing rate and liquidation reserve are counted in the collateral. 

So, is the total borrowing amount is 2210 LUSD, the official collateral ratio will be 110% , but the actual borrowing amount is 2000 LUSD, and the collateral ratio becomes 121% (0.6710\*3622.92/2000\*100%) according to the actual availability.

Since the liquidation reserve is a fixed amount and will be paid back to the borrower upon repayment if liquidation does not occur, the liquidation reserve is not considered an expense when it is not liquidated. The borrower can reduce the actual collateral ratio that is driven up by the borrowing reserve by increasing the borrowing amount.

&amp;#x200B;

[Data source：https:\/\/eth.liquity.fi\/](https://preview.redd.it/ly82nwvashx71.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2198858f1f25b6b558c5dbb077d8a013d89897)

Secondly, Liquity will have a recovery mode, which will be activated when the total collateral ratio (TCR) of the system falls below 150% and all users with a collateral ratio below 150% will be liquidated, so there is an official reminder when borrowing that it is recommended to keep the collateral ratio above 150% to avoid being liquidated in the recovery mode.

Again, the user can also redeem LUSD for ETH at any time—an action known as redemption. In this situation, the system will start redeeming from the Trove with the lowest collateral ratio at that time, reducing the borrower's Trove by both collateral and debt, and while the user will not incur a net loss from the redemption, you will lose part of your ETH exposure. Therefore, in order to avoid redemption, you need to maintain a higher collateral ratio relative to others.

Therefore, although the minimum collateral ratio is 110% at the time of borrowing, it is safer to maintain a collateral ratio of at least 150% to ensure that the Trove is not liquidated or redeemed against. The data from Footprint Analytics shows that Liquity's TCR quickly returned to over 300% even after the liquidation and recovery mode during the May crash, and currently the TCR remains at around 300%. It can be seen that although the minimum collateral ratio can be 110%, the user will still choose to accept a higher collateral rate to ensure the security of the collateral, which requires the user to make a trade-off between a 300% collateral ratio and a higher capital utilization rate.

&amp;#x200B;

[TCR（since Apr  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/sdovik9cshx71.png?width=1148&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51892f25f45c8dd8e9cd799d15016f317f004aa1)

However, although the TCR is higher, the 110% minimum collateral rate has a correspondingly lower loss on being liquidated compared to other protocols with higher collateral rates, which is also explained in detail below.

## Claim 3: Directly redeemable

Users can redeem the collateral with LUSD at any time at its face value, as also mentioned above, but since redemptions are made at a fee of 0.5%-5%, again this fee will be adjusted depending on the time of the most recent redemption and the amount redeemed. Only when the amount of LUSD is less than $1, the user can redeem LUSD to take advantage of it, and the user can exchange LUSD with a price less than $1 for ETH with a value of $1.Therefore, it is up to the user to determine whether there is more room for arbitrage or more fees to be paid based on the prevailing LUSD price, however, according to Footprint Analytics, due to what Liquity founder Robert Lauko calls ""hard anchoring"" and ""soft anchor"" mechanisms, LUSD's price fluctuates between $0.99 and $1.02 on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

[LUSD Price（since Jul  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/ltfyvtjdshx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94b78f7136674a42c7c4bc32e06750957a137e17)

From the perspective of the redeemed, although they did not suffer a net loss at the point of redemption, most of the users of collateralized ETH loans are ETH believers and most believe that ETH is going to rise in the long run, and when the ETH in their Trove is reduced, it actually reduces the likelihood that their assets will increase in value later as ETH rises.

Thus the act of redemption, for those who want to arbitrage from it, only makes sense when the LUSD is less than $1 and the arbitrage gain is greater than the redemption fee; for the redeemed, the act of redemption is also not very popular. 

However, Liquity offers one more way to arbitrage through this mechanism, which also allows the price of LUSD to stabilize around $1 and keeps the overall total collateral rate at a high level by raising the Trove's CR which has the lowest collateral rate.

## Claim 4: Liquidation loss of less than 10%

When the collateral ratio is less than 110%, Liquity will have paid off the debt by liquidating the collateral and the borrower will have lost the collateral ETH and the liquidation will result in a net loss of 9.09% (= 100% \* 10/110) of the dollar value of the borrower's collateral.

However, do not forget that there is also a liquidation reserve of 200 LUSD at the time of borrowing, which will be available to the initiator of the liquidation in the event of liquidation.The liquidation reserve, although not required to be paid by the user at the time of borrowing, will be calculated in the debt and will be included in the calculation of the collateral rate of the Trove. Therefore, taking the amount deposited in the Trove above as an example, when the collateral rate drops below 110% due to price fluctuations and liquidation occurs, the value of the collateral being liquidated at that time is not 110% of the 2000 LUSD in the hands of the borrower in this case, but 110% of the total debt of 2210 LUSD.At this point, the borrower lost all the ETH and only 2000 LUSD is left. According to the price of ETH when it was liquidated, the actual loss rate of the borrower is 17.73% 

((0.671\*3622.92-2000)/(0.671\*3622.92)\*100%). 

Of course the actual loss rate calculated varies for different borrowing amounts, and higher borrowing amounts will reduce the loss rate pulled up by the liquidation reserve.

While the liquidation reserve factor may not make the loss rate of being liquidated as small as envisioned, Liquity's mechanism is a significant improvement over the 150% collateral ratio required by MakerDao, and provides borrowers with 40% more safety margin in the event of liquidation due to price fluctuations.

## Claim: Earn additional revenue with a LUSD deposit or LQTY stake

Liquity not only offers lending to borrow LUSD, but also offers a Stability Pool of LUSD to improve capital utilization and a pool to stake LQTY for revenue. LUSD deposited into the Stability Pool can earn ETH from liquidated users based on their share of the pool, as well as LQTY, the token that rewards Liquity; LQTY obtained from the Stability Pool can then be staked again to earn fees when users borrow and redeem.

The Stability Pool will gain ETH and LQTY, the gain of ETH is related to the case of being liquidated, and the LUSD deposited in the pool will be burnt at the same time as gaining ETH. Since the collateral ratio is 110% at the time of liquidation, the user will receive ETH corresponding to 110% of the value of USD while 1 LUSD is burnt, and the user will make 10% profit from it.If at this point the ETH continues to fall bringing the ETH that has just gained $1.1 in value down below $1, the user will suffer a floating loss.To prevent this possibility, B.Protocol provides Liquity's Stability Pool provider to auto-convert ETH back to LUSD and deposit it back into the Stability Pool, locking in liquidation profits for users and saving gas fee. However, if the user is a long-term bullish ETH believer, they may believe that the asset will eventually appreciate in value in the future.

However as a stablecoin it is more important to look at its use cases, the 600+ million LUSD currently minted is over 75% of the total in Liquity's Stability Pool, with less than 200 million flowing externally. Users who borrowed in Liquity go around and around still investing in Liquity, the use case of the whole system looks like a Russian Dolls and its sustainability is doubtful.

&amp;#x200B;

[Total Supply of LUSD（since Apr  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/wen3doteshx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff348f04c9727304b46b1ce068ce7e4d8ee0d7a7)

But Robert Lauko, founder of Liquity, responded on July 2 that the LUSD in the Stability Pool was a rational choice by users in light of the large number of LQTY incentives, and that subsequent LQTY token incentives would decline and users would change their behavior accordingly.

Another reward gained by the Stability Pool is LQTY. Since it is not a governance token, the only use case for LQTY is to capture the borrowing and redemption fees of the protocol, and LQTY can only gain more revenue when more borrowings and redemptions occur, so instead it is more beneficial to increase the value of LQTY when the whole system is less stable. As you can see the daily ETH and LUSD gained from staking LQTY is not that much at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gain from Staking LQTY（since Apr  2021）Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/qztulbtfshx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaf388cedd224888bb32dc20be6c2f8ad4128a5e)

Borrowing and redemptions increased in mid-May due to the volatility of the token price, and LQTY's ability to capture revenue had a rapid increase during this period. However, starting in June the total supply of LUSD also showed a decline in borrowing and redemptions by users, and LQTY's ability to capture both LUSD and ETH declined significantly.

As the incentive for LQTY tokens fades, the value of LQTY may be worth hoping for if LUSD can expand its use cases more externally to attract more users to borrow, and Liquid's TVL continues to trend upward.

## Conclusion

Digging into Liquity's claimed advantages, it’s clear that the innovations of lower collateral rate and automatic liquidation mechanism are the key components to help Liquity remain robust under the severe shocks of ""519"".

The above innovations also differentiates Liquity from its competitor MakerDao. Footprint Analytics will also analyze Liquity vs. MarkerDao comparatively in a subsequent article. Moreover, an increase of market share of LUSD since September indicates the probability of LUSD might become a widely used decentralized stablecoin.

Following a volatile September, the crypto market rebounded to an all-time high in October, with DeFi's TVL exceeding $250 billion and BTC pushing past $66K. 

&amp;#x200B;

[DeFi TVL ChangeData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/o4fh9zlm0ix71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ad782377729cdede902dc82523df3cfdd5d723f)

But with all eyes on rising token prices, it was easy to miss some trends and announcements that look likely to impact the market in Q4 significantly. 

* DeFi will be getting more regulated as countries announce sweeping cryptocurrency policies
* Bitcoin ETFs attract global attention, creating positive outlook as institutional investors buy in
* Lending market lacks clear leader as Curve and MakerDAO vie for top spot
* Numerous new public chains see big growth shortly after launching

Read how these developments and others will affect the crypto market in Footprint's October Monthly Report.

**Bitcoin futures ETF triggers new high for BTC**

With Grayscale announcing a series of plans to convert bitcoin funds into spot ETFs and digital asset investment firm Valkyrie listing its bitcoin futures ETF on NASDAQ, the price of BTC climbed from $48,000 to around $60,000. On Oct.20, BTC even reached a record high of $66,000. 

Investors now have very span support for the thesis that institutions will gradually purchase crypto assets. This means we can imagine a world where banks make massive whale purchases of BTC and other tokens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two aspects bolsters the DeFi TVL's growth in October :

**Lending market sees neck and neck competition among dominant platforms**

[The TVL ranking](https://www.footprint.network/topic/Chain/Blockchain) from Footprint Data shows that Aave and MakerDAO once surpassed [Curve](https://www.footprint.network/topic/Projects/Curve) in the middle of the month to become the projects with the highest DeFi TVL, but quickly fell back behind.

As of Oct. 31, Curve was still ranked number one on the network with $19.2 billion TVL. Curve's TVL grew by 34% for the month of October and its token price reached $4.7, the highest in almost a year. MakerDAO also had a 37.68% TVL growth rate.

The data indicates that the lending market is highly competitive—with picking a favorite for market leader nigh impossible. In other words, now is not the time to put all your eggs in one basket in your DeFi lending play.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Small but numerous chains eat away at Ethereum’s monopoly**

Since its inception, Ethereum held a near monopoly in the public chain space until Binance came onto the scene in February 2021, followed by Terra and Polygon. 

Data from the past month indicate a clear trend towards further fragmentation rather than consolidation. 

Footprint Data shows there are 11 public chains with a TVL growth of more than 100% in the past 30 days. Among them, Tron's growth rate was 1119%, bridging its TVL to $7.6 billion, making it the seventh chain. Other public chains such as Fantom, Arbitrum and Avalanche grew by more than 100%.

The result is that Ethereum’s market share went from 73% in August to 65% in October—and 8% drop in just 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

[Change of Market Share by Public ChainData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/f91tem0v0ix71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfe5c43fbbc8f4288f3556eb959b07dbb5b6fd4e)

# New kids on the crypto block in October

Newly launched chains beat expectations in October.  

The TVL of Secret grew 222% as tightening regulations around public chains make blockchain users refocus on privacy. PriFi—as it’s now called—will soon become the preferred choice for crypto, and Secret, the first Chain with privacy protection, will explode. (At least, so goes the reasoning of the chain’s supporters.) 

Another chain that shouldn’t be ignored is NEAR. While its 86% growth is slow compared to the month’s other breakouts, the chain’s team recently announced a huge $800 million ecosystem development fund to support NEAR-based development projects, institutions and individuals. Aurora, a NEAR-based solution to scale Ethereum dApp projects, also completed a $12 million funding round in October. 

Other public chains such as Sifchain, Harmony, and Celo each had over 200% growth in October and are also noteworthy. Although the new public chains are still nowhere near as popular as the Etherchain, market share continues to divide as they present new use cases and solve problems developers and users face with Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

With the introduction of national policies around crypto in the US, China, Australia and others in September, the market briefly became volatile but a record-breaking October demonstrated we’re still riding the bull for now. 

On a more long-term trajectory, the token price drop and regulations were followed by institutional support and buy-in for blockchain. While controversial amongst blockchain enthusiasts, this has created a perception of reduced market risk among established financial players. Is this the news that banks and investment firms, tired of seeing their returns blown out of the water by crypto traders, were waiting on as their signal to jump in?

By Sid Coelho-Prabhu

  


  
Cryptocurrency’s promise is to make money and payments universally accessible– to anyone, no matter where they are in the world.

  
The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Open Finance movement takes that promise a step further. Imagine a global, open alternative to every financial service you use today — savings, loans, trading, insurance and more — accessible to anyone in the world with a smartphone and internet connection.

  


  
This is now possible on smart contract blockchains, like Ethereum. “Smart contracts” are programs running on the blockchain that can execute automatically when certain conditions are met. These smart contracts enable developers to build far more sophisticated functionality than simply sending and receiving cryptocurrency. These programs are what we now call decentralized apps, or dapps.

  
You can think of a dapp as an app that is built on decentralized technology, rather than being built and controlled by a single, centralized entity or company. (Get used to this word, dapp, you’ll be seeing it a lot from here on out.)

  
While some of these concepts might sound futuristic–automated loans negotiated directly between two strangers in different parts of the world, without a bank in the middle– many of these dapps are already live today. There are DeFi dapps that allow you to create stablecoins (cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US dollar), lend out money and earn interest on your crypto, take out a loan, exchange one asset for another, go long or short assets, and implement automated, advanced investment strategies.

  
What differentiates these DeFi dapps from their traditional bank or Wall Street counterparts?

  
At their core, the operations of these businesses are not managed by an institution and its employees — instead the rules are written in code (or smart contract, as mentioned above). Once the smart contract is deployed to the blockchain, DeFi dapps can run themselves with little to no human intervention (although in practice developers often do maintain the dapps with upgrades or bug fixes).The code is transparent on the blockchain for anyone to audit. This builds a different kind of trust with users, because anyone has the opportunity to understand the contract’s functionality or find bugs. All transaction activity is also public for anyone to view. While this may raise privacy questions, transactions are pseudonymous by default, i.e. not tied directly to your real-life identity.Dapps are designed to be global from day one — Whether you’re in Texas or Tanzania, you have access to the same DeFi services and networks. Of course, local regulations may apply but, technically speaking, most DeFi apps are available to anyone with an internet connection.“Permissionless” to create, “permissionless” to participate — anyone can create DeFi apps, and anyone can use them. Unlike finance today, there are no gatekeepers or accounts with lengthy forms. Users interact directly with the smart contracts from their crypto wallets.Flexible user experience — don’t like the interface to a certain dapp? No problem — you can use a third party interface, or build your own. Smart contracts are like an open API that anyone can build an app for.Interoperable — new DeFi applications can be built or composed by combining other DeFi products like Lego pieces — e.g. stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and prediction markets can be combined to form entirely new products.

  
DeFi is now one of the fastest growing sectors in crypto. Industry observers measure traction with a unique new metric — “ETH locked in DeFi”. At the time of writing, users have deposited over $600 million worth of crypto into these smart contracts.

  
Intrigued? Let’s take a closer look at just a few of the popular DeFi dapps out there that you can try today. You’ll need a cryptocurrency wallet with a built-in dapp browser (like Coinbase Wallet) to connect to these dapps. You can also use most of these dapps on desktop by selecting the Coinbase Wallet option and scanning a QR code.

  


  
It’s still early days for dapps, so DeFi users should do their research on new products and services. Like any computer code, smart contracts can be vulnerable to both unintended programming mistakes and malicious hacks.

  
Stablecoin and Decentralized Reserve Bank: MakerDAO

  
Maker is a stablecoin project where each stablecoin (called DAI) is pegged to the US Dollar and is backed by collateral in the form of crypto. Stablecoins offer the programmability of crypto without the downside of volatility that you see with “traditional” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

  
You can try creating your own DAI stablecoin on the Maker Oasis dapp. Maker is more than just a stablecoin project, though–it aspires to be a decentralized reserve bank. People who hold a separate but related token, MKR, can vote on important decisions like the Stability Fee (similar to how the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee votes on the Fed Funds rate).

  
Another stablecoin with a different architecture is USD Coin (USDC), where every USDC token is backed by one US dollar held in an audited bank account.

  
Borrow and Lend: Compound

  
Compound is a blockchain-based borrowing and lending dapp — you can lend your crypto out and earn interest on it. Or maybe you need some money to pay the rent or buy groceries, but your funds are tied up in your crypto investments? You can deposit your crypto to the Compound smart contract as collateral, and borrow against it. The Compound contract automatically matches borrowers and lenders, and adjusts interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand.

  
Other popular borrow/lend dapps are Aave and dYdX. Aggregators like LoanScan track borrow/lend interest rates across the various dapps, so you can shop around for the best rates.

  
Automated Token Exchange: Uniswap

  
Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange run entirely on smart contracts, letting you trade popular tokens directly from your wallet. This is different from an exchange like Coinbase, which stores your crypto for you and holds your private keys for safekeeping. Uniswap uses an innovative mechanism known as Automated Market Making to automatically settle trades near the market price. In addition to trading, any user can become a liquidity provider, by supplying crypto to the Uniswap contract and earning a share of the exchange fees. This is called “pooling”.

  
Other popular Decentralized Exchange platforms (DEXes) include 0x, AirSwap, Bancor, Kyber, IDEX, Paradex and Radar Relay. All have slightly different architectures.

  
Prediction Markets: Augur

  
Augur is a decentralized prediction market protocol. With Augur, you can vote on the outcome of events, except you put ‘skin in the game’ by attaching a value to your vote. Prediction market platforms like Augur and Guesser are nascent, but offer a view into a future where users can make better predictions by tapping into the wisdom of the crowd.

  
Synthetic Assets: Synthetix

  
Synthetix is a platform that lets users create and exchange synthetic versions of assets like gold, silver, cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies like the Euro. The synthetic assets are backed by excess collateral locked into the Synthetix contracts.

  
No-loss savings games: PoolTogether

  
The composability of DeFi lends itself to infinite new possibilities. PoolTogether is a no-loss game where participants deposit the DAI stablecoin into a common pot. At the end of each month, one lucky participant wins all the interest earned, and everyone gets their initial deposits back.

  
So what’s next for DeFi?

  
Money and finance have been around in one form or the other since the dawn of human civilization. Crypto is just the latest digital avatar. In upcoming years, we might see every financial service that we use in today’s fiat system being rebuilt for the crypto ecosystem. We’ve already seen asset issuance and exchange, borrowing, lending, custody, and derivatives built for crypto. What’s next?

  
The first generation of DeFi dapps rely heavily on collateral as a safeguard. That is, you need to already own crypto and provide it as collateral in order to borrow more crypto. More traditional unsecured borrowing and lending will need to rely on an identity system, so that borrowers can build up credit and increase their borrowing power, much like today’s SSN and FICO scores. Unlike today’s identity and credit systems however, a decentralized identity will have to be both universal and privacy-preserving.

  
We’re also seeing innovation in the insurance space. Many of today’s DeFi loans are overcollateralized (meaning that loans seem inherently safe because of the generous cushion of assets held in reserve). But the black swan for DeFi is smart contract vulnerabilities. If a hacker finds and exploits a bug in the open source code for a dapp, millions of dollars could be drained in an instant. Teams like Nexus Mutual are building decentralized insurance that would make users whole in the event of smart contract hacks.

  
Another trend we’re seeing is better user experience. The first generation of dapps was built by blockchain enthusiasts for blockchain enthusiasts. These dapps did a great job of demonstrating exciting new DeFi possibilities, but the usability left something to be desired. The latest iterations of DeFi apps are prioritizing design and ease of use in order to take open finance to a wider audience.

  
In the future, we expect that crypto wallets will be the portal to all your digital asset activity, just like an internet browser today is your portal to the world’s news and information. Imagine a dashboard that shows you not just what assets you own, but how much you have locked up in different open finance protocols–loans, pools, and insurance contracts.

  
Across the DeFi ecosystem, we’re also seeing a move towards decentralizing governance and decision-making. Despite the word “decentralized” in DeFi, many projects today have master keys for the developers to shut down or disable dapps. This was done to allow for easy upgrades and provide an emergency shutoff valve in case of buggy code. However, as the code becomes more battle-tested, we expect developers will give up these backdoor switches. The DeFi community is experimenting with ways to allow stakeholders to vote on decisions, including through the use of blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

  
Something magical is happening in the open financial system — crypto is bringing money online, and we’re seeing a quantum leap in what’s possible when it comes to the functionality of money. It’s a rare opportunity to see an entirely new industry blossom from scratch. The DeFi space will at first play catch up with today’s financial services industry. But over time, it’s hard to even fathom what innovations will come about when the power to build financial services is democratized to anyone who can write code.

 This week, we are starting with a crazy sale in the NFT market, and then talk about Bitcoin, DeFi and Coinbase’s direct listing.

  
Beeple Crashes MakersPlace By Selling NFT Art for $1

  
NFT artist Beeple crashed the crypto art marketplace MakersPlace on 28th Feb.

  


  
At $1 a piece, and limited to only 105 pieces on the blockchain, Beeple’s latest drop was feverishly anticipated.

  
Unfortunately, the traffic the immensely popular digital artist brought to MakersPlace completely crashed the website, leading to “504 Gateway Time-out” notifications for anyone hoping to snap up the limited edition. Most of the 105 editions remain unsold.

  
Knowing that the crash was unfair on fans who’d gone onto the website at the right time, Beeple will sell the remaining editions of The 5000 Day Selects via a raffle. All collectors who showed up on time with a registered and verified MakersPlace account will be considered for the raffle.

  


  
MakersPlace’s volume didn’t go up much on 28th Feb due to the crash. And the popularity of this sale was completely reflected by the active users, which increased sharply on that day and broke ATH 2K, of course exceeding the website’s capacity. Users continued to rush to the platform, wishing they would be picked for the later raffle.

  
JP Morgan Favors Bitcoin?

  
Strategists at Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan have suggested that a 1% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against fluctuations in traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.

  
According to Bloomberg, JP Morgan strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho stated in a note to clients: “In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.”

  
Although Bitcoin has slid a bit these days, it is up 60% since the beginning of this year. A long list of major investment institutions has entered the market in 2021, including Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, Tesla, and MicroStrategy.

  
All About DeFi

  
1inch Expands to Binance Smart Chain

  
1inch, the DEX aggregator, is now live on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), hedging its bets on Ethereum’s ability to handle more transaction volume.

  
1inch users will now get access to PancakeSwap (CAKE), BakerySwap (BAKE), Venus (XVS), BurgerSwap (BURGER), and other BSC-based DEXs and lending protocols. This can help users avoiding the high gas fee on Ethereum.

  
(The black dot line represents 1INCH token price)

  
1INCH token price increased by 6.7% in the past 24 hours. It shows a similar trend as its users and transactions.

  
You can search Binance Smart Chain on [dapp.com](https://dapp.com)  to check all the DeFi, DEX, and many other products. Next week, we will list Binance Smart Chain and support tracking all the dapps and tokens live on the blockchain. You can monitor the projects’ TVL, volume, users, etc, as well as all the tokens on BSC for your trading analytics including active wallet address, holders, value locked, etc.

  
To celebrate the listing, new campaigns are also on the way. Stay tuned for good news next week!

  
Grayscale Adding 23 Cryptocurrencies?

  
Digital asset manager Grayscale is considering 23 cryptocurrencies for new investment products, revealing the shortlist of cryptocurrencies that it’s choosing from in a press release.

  
The list of 23 cryptocurrencies includes several high market cap coins, some DeFi coins and a few VC-backed projects.

  
The most well-known projects are Polkadot and the blockchain platform EOS. VC-backed products include decentralized file storage platform Filecoin and Bitcoin-based smart contract platform Stacks. It also includes Chainlink, an oracle network that underpins many decentralized apps.

  
DeFi coins include lending platform Aave, synthetic asset platform Synthetix, stablecoin provider MakerDAO and yield farming platform [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance).

  


  
Aave

  


  
MakerDAO

  
(The black dot lines represent token prices)

  
Aave and MakerDAO have had great on-chain performance in the past 7 days. Their active users, transactions and volume all increased. Aave’s 7d volume increased by 86.41% and MakerDAO’s 7d volume increased by 69.35%.

  


  
[Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)

  
(The peak volume on 5th Feb is due to the Yearn Finance hack)

  
Synthetix

  
(The black dot lines represent token prices)

  
However, [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)  and Synthetix seem to have total difference data performance. Both projects’ active users, transactions and volume decreased. [Yearn.Finance](https://Yearn.Finance)’s  7d volume decreased by 37.89% after the hack on 5th Feb. While Synthetix’s 7d volume decreased by 33.46%.

  
It’s important to track a DeFi or DEX’s on-chain data, because the token price possibly correlates to its performance.

  
Coinbase Going Public, Its Stock Keeps Rising Ahead of Listing

  
Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly-traded company through a direct listing, not an initial public offering.

  
Early reports suggest the company will be worth around $104 billion. That figure has led Bloomberg and Axios, among others, to note that the cryptocurrency giant’s public listing will be the most valuable of any U.S. tech company since Facebook.

  
Coinbase shares to be debut on the Nasdaq in the coming weeks, FTX allows you to trade Coinbase’s stock shares before listing by issuing a pre-listing futures contract market.

  
Since Coinbase posted its S-1 regulatory filing, pre-listing shares on FTX are going up in price. The shares, under the representation of CBSE tokens, now trades at about $402 in FTX. When it was originally issued last December, it was worth just $239. The price went up by 68.2%. Before you trade Coinbase stocks, don’t forget to get a $30 fee voucher here.

  
Besides Coinbase, you can trade over 40 tokenization stocks on FTX.

  


  
Apart from FTX, you can trade stocks and earn interest from stocks in the crypto world by staking real stock shares in Mirror Protocol, an innovative synthetic + mining DeFi protocol, for a rather high APY. So far, the pools in Mirror Protocol support many leading global companies’ stocks including Tesla, Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, Apple, etc. (This DeFi Protocol Becomes Whales’ Next Target?)

 Oct, 2021, bella@footprint.network

Crypto lending has become one of DeFi's most promising use applications, ushering in an influx of dozens of platforms, tools, apps and participants all claiming to revolutionize how tokens are loaned and borrowed. 

According to Footprint, the number of platforms in the DeFi lending category grew by 263% to 69 since December 2020, setting a record TVL of $48.44 billion, accounting for 21.04% of all DeFi platforms and networks' entire TVL. 

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL of Different CategoriesData source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/98d8thpk2qx71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e39b83f4fe0c7ca743b23e727f9bad2095a323b)

The most important lending platforms to have emerged are Aave, MakerDAO and Compound—they dominate the category in terms of TVL. However, while **Compound** used to be the span favorite, the 519 Crypto Market Crash reshuffled the leaderboard and Aave took the lead.

As indicated in the chart below, MakerDAO and Compound have performed poorly in recent months. 

Therefore, many people are wondering whether Aave is on top because it’s a particularly span platform or because its competitors temporarily fell behind. The answer determines your assessment of Aave locking in your tokens in the long term, and also who to watch for insights about the future of crypto lending.

When we look at the data, it becomes clear that Aave has several span advantages that indicate it will continue to be a market leader in DeFi lending. Namely, it is highly secure, innovative, and has recently launched Aave Pro, which gives it an enormous head start as traditional finance starts to buy into crypto. 

**Project Background**

Aave, formerly known as ETHLend, was launched on Ethereum in November 2017. The platform's initial mode of operation was similar to that of P2P~~—~~with the online platform matching borrowers and lenders through smart contracts in a peer-to-peer fashion. But the development model was soon adjusted after market reaction was subdued.

In 2019, the project completed a brand upgrade and was renamed to Aave (or “ghost” in Finnish), and went live in January 2020. This version provides liquidity by establishing a pool of funds and focuses on solving the problem of inefficient aggregation of lending needs. Users deposit collateral assets and then borrow assets within the collateral rate without a need for matching. 

In the succeeding months, the platform achieved the following milestones:

* July 2020: received $4.5 million from ParaFi and $3 million in strategic funding with participation from Framework Ventures and Three Arrows Capital. It also released its economic proposal, Aavenomics, which included the conversion of the original token Lend to AAVE and the issuance of an additional 3 million tokens, a security module, lending incentive, among others.
* October 2020: secured $25 million in funding led by Blockchain Capital and Standard Crypto, in addition to receiving approval from the U.S. SEC to register as an Ether Trust.
* February 2021: completed its V2 upgrade then launched the AMM marketplace the following month, allowing liquidity providers to pledge LP tokens from Uniswap and Balancer for loans
* April 2021: offered token incentives to borrowers and lenders through its liquidity mining programme
* May 2021: deployed and launched the Polygon chain
* July 2021: launched a new product for institutional clients Aave Pro
* October 2021: deployed and launched Avalanche.

**Economic model**

&amp;#x200B;

[Aave Economic Overview Data source: Aave Docs](https://preview.redd.it/op142pep2qx71.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323aae55486571260a7f9ce3a5805c31bfa9c83a)

Aave's economic model, which went live in July 2020, has three main uses for the token AAVE, namely community governance, safety module building and ecosystem rewards.

* Community Governance: Users holding the platform token AAVE can participate in community governance, such as participating in voting on the protection of the platform ecosystem, updates to the safety module mechanism, new feature iterations, etc. One AAVE token is equivlanet to one vote.
* Safety Module Construction: Users can pledge their token AAVE holdings into a security pool, which is used to protect against risk events such as contract breach risk, liquidity risk (liquidation risk arising from insufficient collateral coverage), and prophecy machine risk (caused by network congestion or market crash and where the prophecy machine cannot update the price or the price is provided incorrectly).
* Ecosystem Rewards: Token rewards given to borrowers and lenders, equivalent to liquidity mining.

Aave has put a lot of effort and innovation into security, not only by incorporating a safety module as part of the ecology and thus providing a safety cushion for risky events, but also by rewarding those who find security vulnerabilities. These proactive initiatives continue to support Aave's breakthrough development.

**Flash Loan**

&amp;#x200B;

[Flash Loan Borrowed Amount Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/tej99lvq2qx71.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cba31688ccddc70894aa7f68f273fb987fc461)

Aave also has a first-of-its-kind advantage over other lending platforms through Flash Loan. The product has a certain threshold for users and is suitable for developers with some programming skills. It is characterised by the ease with which users can obtain loans without the need to pledge any assets. They would have to simply return the borrowed funds within the same block (about 15 seconds). If they are unable to repay the loan in the same block, the transaction is revoked without any impact on the user. But, if the loan is successful, they are charged a 0.09% fee.

As of this writing, Flash Loan has surpassed $9.8 billion in cumulative lending volume and is expected to surpass $10 billion by the end of October. Although the entire crypto industry is in a recovery phase after the 519 Crypto Market Crash and Flash Loan's transaction volume has declined, there is no denying the explosive growth of the product, building a span momentum to support Aave to overtake Compound and MakerDAO.

**Asset classes and interest rates**

&amp;#x200B;

[Aave’s Deposit APY and Borrow APY Data source: Aave  website](https://preview.redd.it/hzp2c94s2qx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c6fef32120110661620031bfc4ace40c7e40e40)

The V1 and V2 versions support 31 types of assets in single token pledges, mainstream cryptocurrencies and emerging cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,the AMM version supports LP token pledges for Uniswap and Balancer, with 16 types of assets. This differentiated strategy satisfies the lending needs of multiple groups, attracts more users to participate and retain, and also accelerates the expansion and influence of the platform, laying the foundation for achieving a bend in the road.

The strength of the asset range has allowed Aave to expand its pool of funds and has given it more scope to create unique interest rate advantages. First, the overall borrow APY is lower than other platforms (capital utilisation in the same dimension), with liquidity subsidy for depositors and borrowers (although this is not an Aave initiative). Second, it is a pioneering interest rate swap that allows users to choose between a variable borrow APY or stable strategy borrow APY. If they choose a higher rate, they can switch to a lower rate strategy, giving them access to lower cost funding in a more volatile and decentralised market.

**Aave Pro**

The success of Aave's V2 trial of the credit delegation model where loans can be obtained without collateral paved the launch of the Aave Pro project, which integrates DeFi with traditional finance and provides a new gateway to DeFi for offline investment institutions. 

It caters to individual investors who have very limited funds compared to institutional investors. In addition to this, DeFi has experienced explosive growth for over a year, but has not lasted as long as before.

The OTC funds are more often pooled in the hands of institutional investors. As an electronic money institution licensed by the FCA in the UK, Aave can ensure the safety of funds in a more compliant and secure dimension to allow institutional investors to participate and promote the good development of the whole ecosystem.

Aave Pro is different from the original V1, V2 and even AMM. For one, Aave Pro is only developed for OTC institutional investors, with only four assets launched - USDC, BTC, ETH and AAVE. Second, Aave Pro is a private pool, which is completely separate from the Aave protocol pool, so that the risks are completed independently. 

Third, participating investment institutions need to pass the KYC verification of Fireblocks, assess the credit rating through KYC information, and adopt different collateral rates according to different credit ratings, which greatly reduces the security of funds.

**Summary**

Aave took the lead in lending because of its team instead of coincidence. Not only processing a tightened control over security and compliance, Aave team also continually sought out breakthroughs and innovation in DeFi lending.  With the launch of Aave Pro in particular, Aave has gradually opened a gap with the top lending platforms, and is set to usher in a new round of development for DeFi in a new direction.

Decentralized Notification and Partnership,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin_critique/comments/qou870/decentralized_notification_and_partnership/,obiesolid,1,2021-11-08 02:12:04,0,/r/altcoin_critique/comments/qou870/decentralized_notification_and_partnership/,,"The invention of Dex, Cex, Defi and NFT into the crypto space is something worth mentioning, crypto enthusiasts have been boggled with the many news and rumours going around about the next coin to pump, possibly a rumour from Elon Musk. The need to be alert and buy such a hyped coin on time is necessary, information is power here, and early access to update is money, profit and possible X100.  

That is where a notification inside a wallet address comes in, a stitch in time that saves mine, not only a notification but a customed notification coming through Json payload specified to individual preferences. This decentralized notification protocol is called EPNS.  The EPNS protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain with the prospect of including other blockchains. A user( wallet owners) interact with the EPNS protocol through creating a channel or subscribing to it, users who create a channel do that with a fee, this is shared among subscribers. EPNS also reward those who interact on its chain, thereby gaining users retention while providing an update to projects and coins.


EPNS has been in various partnerships in recent times, the $PUSH token recently listed on Kucoin with PUSH/USDT and PUSH/BTC pairs put EPNS on the crypto market map. The EPNS protocols also partner with Proof Of Humanity protocol to enable more decentralized features of Web 3.0. This partnership aims to boost an ecosystem of how humans interact with their community through a governed trust by verifying and establishing a governance system built on trust. This collaboration is set to bring a monumental element to the web3 stack.  PoH and EPNS aimed to bring identity certification to the blockchain and foster users experience on Web3.0.

Proof Of Human (PoH) verification comes in different categories, Submission, Challenge, Vouching and Registered, in making verification faster on PoH, EPNS is making notification come in during this process thereby hastening the process. This enables PoH users to have a real-time update on how their verification is going, removal or acceptance of the verification process while giving the users opportunity to know the reason their verification was declined. EPNS notification is becoming a must-have for any blockchain project that aims to carry along its users on its network. Incoming is Airdrops on-time notification and Universal basic Income and new certificate to verified users on PoH.


In bringing the full prospect of DeFi to all in the crypto space, MakerDao came up with a decentralized way of generating its coin called Dai against locked assets. This has a long term effect of keeping token value intact and also enabling decentralization in another dimension. MakerDao protocol when it comes to governance need utmost update among its voters, in doing this MakerDao is partnering with EPNS to bring its PUSH notification onboard, thereby making governance through voting come at a faster rate by speeding up the network proposal. Effective communication and increased participation in project governance with voting come with the effect of EPNS notification. In achieving a full state of decentralization, the MakerDao voting protocol comes into two tiers, the first tier is created to initiate consensus among community members, while the second tier is for executive poll voting in the governance for technical changes proposed on the platform. In keeping an eye on this voting, EPNS helps to keep all members of the community on alert on the progress of voting. Aside from boosting the total community-driven ecosystem, MakerDao and EPNS collaboration bring about less dependency on social media for new projects.

EPNS has come to stay as the best notification system, capable of being integrated across multiple networks, chains and protocols. The list is endless of its advantage in the educational sector, medical and engineering fields. The limitless power of the blockchain makes EPNS a go-to in keeping crypto users on par with news, updates around them."

Epic Cash (EPIC): Why is this project so massively undervalued?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/qpryng/epic_cash_epic_why_is_this_project_so_massively/,timcostello,1,2021-11-09 08:58:55,8,/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/qpryng/epic_cash_epic_why_is_this_project_so_massively/,,"**Please note this is NOT financial advice. I am not advising you in any way, this is simply opinion. Do not place trades based on what is written here. Please do your own research.**

With that being said, I did buy $3,000 worth of it after what happened to me over that last couple of months.

I stumbled on this project and I am wondering **WHY** and **HOW** this is still so undervalued. I added it to my CoinGecko watchlist seemingly by accident in August 2021, and every so often I would see it at $0.30, or $0.45. It being on 1 exchange I thought that might be why, but I have seen other coins on 1 or 2 exchanges with a billion market cap! Thinking nothing of it (***since I have 79 different coins in my “under $1” watchlist***) I never really looked deep into it. Until. It went to $3.75! Now this random coin had my attention, after accidentally adding it to one of my watchlists. Why did I leave this random coin in my watchlist? Maybe since the watchlist was an “under $1” and none of the ones I had been watching ever go above $1. 

Still at its ATH, it was at most a 40M market cap!!! It is currently at 32M! The telegram community seems to be quite small with only 1500 members. There is a small subreddit, youtube, and facebook following as well. With that being said, they went from $0.30 to $3 with relatively nothing. If I had invested what I did; back then? I would have had 10,000 shares!!! Instead I have around 8X less than that. Forward looking only, let's look at the potential of this project. For example sake, let's just play around with the market cap.

***With a market cap of 130 Million&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would = $10***

***With a market cap of 1.3 Billion&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would= $100***

Every so often a project goes under the radar and eventually makes its way to the Top 100; silently. This could be one of those projects. Epic Cash started 2 years ago (September 2, 2019) with a Fair Launch; not many projects can claim this. It is a Grassroots type movement in the sense that it gains 1 person at a time, slowly accumulating a strong movement.  It does not pay for listings, influencers, or marketing. That is why it is on **ONE** exchange currently, Vitex DEX. The current market cap is around 35M, with a circulating supply of 13.1M, giving it a current share price of $2.50.

Anyway, I ended up researching the project and would like to compile some of the interesting things about it. 

1.  **Privacy** features and **Size** of blockchain. Both of which have what is called MimbleWimble to thank. MimbleWimble sounds hilarious, and I still do not fully understand it. What I do know is, it does not require the storage of data that other blockchains do, therefore making it lightweight (around 1.97GB at time of writing this, [explorer.epic.tech](https://explorer.epic.tech/)) AND!! It has a very interesting origin story, similar to Bitcoin!

Link to MimbleWimble Origin Story:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zeydt/mimblewimbles\_story/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zeydt/mimblewimbles_story/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

2. **Epicenter**. The entire ecosystem Epic developers and community are trying to create. Similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stable coin, Epicenter is their version.  With EPIC being the store of value (like ETH in the ETH/MKR/DAI system) So, EPIC/ECR/EUSD is EpicenterDAO’s version of ETH/MKR/DAI. ECR is like MKR and EUSD is the stable coin like Dai. For more information go here:

[https://epicenter.epic.tech/what-is-epicenter/](https://epicenter.epic.tech/what-is-epicenter/)

[https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract)

3. **MINING!** It just went through a halving event on October 30th 2021. Maybe that’s why it spiked a little? Regardless, it can be mined through a normal desktop computer (Macbook's are harder from what I have learned). Just like BTC back in the day. There are 3 more halving events from now until 2028 when the supply of Epic matches the supply of Bitcoin, known as the Singularity event in the Epic Cash White Paper. ([https://epic.tech/whitepaper](https://epic.tech/whitepaper)/) 

(Compared to BTC block time of 10 minutes and block reward of 6.25 BTC) 

Epic Coins Mined Per Day: 5,760 EPIC

Block Reward: 4 EPIC

Block Time: 60 seconds

I'm not a miner but if you are reading this and you have extra hardware or looking for a new coin to mine I’d suggest this. When it goes from 5,760 EPIC per day to 2880 in two years, who knows what the price of 1 EPIC will be. 

4. **Community!** Ever since I found out about Telegram for crypto groups, they have **NOT** been all that constructive. However, the Epic Cash Telegram (@epiccash) is actually fun, not toxic, and full of very smart people, some of  whom mined BTC and XMR in the early days. If you have ever heard of Kadena, they call themselves the Kadenians, in Epic Cash they are the Freemans. Max Freeman the founder of Epic is easily contactable in Telegram and will happily answer your questions. He also has been recently attending Youtube live streams in order to educate people about crypto and Epic. Just search “Max Freeman Epic Cash” on Youtube and start diving into the knowledge!

***Defining Characteristics of Epic Cash (some written by me and others compiled through Epic community Telegram and Official Website*** [***epic.tech***](https://epic.tech/)***):***

* **Scarce** \- Circulating supply of 13.1 million coins. Max supply 21M
* **Open Source -** No patent or company controlling the tech. 
* **Censorship Resistant** \- No one can interfere with EPIC transactions.
* **Fair Launch** \- No ICO(Initial Coin Offering), No premine, No Venture Capital, No Corporations, No government affiliations. (**WOW!!**)
* **Mineable (3 algorithms)** \- Mine with CPU (RandomX), GPU (ProgPoW), and ASIC.
* **Fungibility** \- 1 Epic = 1 Epic. No Tainted Coins. 
* **Speed** \- “While Bitcoin requires six 10-minute blocks to achieve complete transaction confirmation, Epic transactions occur within a single block confirmation as soon as a 1-minute block has been mined. This makes Epic Cash transactions smooth, continuous, and executed much faster than in previous generations of blockchain technology.”
* **Universally Accessible** \- Anyone, anywhere can participate regardless of their location, identity documentation, or ability to afford the price of entry. EPIC is truly money for everyone, today. 
* **Scalability** \- Currently 1.9 GB, estimated to be 25GB with BTC throughput. 📷
* **Private Banking** \- This is a big one. Epic is part of the Epicenter Ecosystem, with ECR as the governance token, and EUSD as the stablecoin, Epic holders have the ability to control their own wealth independently without intrusion. Check out this link below to learn more. (similar to MakerDAO and Dai if familiar with this)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68) 

* **Team Wallets** \- There are NO Team Wallets for Epic Cash! Everyone had to buy their coins on the open market.
* **Coin Lockup** \- Not applicable to Epic Cash as there are no team tokens. This is 100% Proof of Work!
* **Privacy** \- “*The Epic Cash blockchain safeguards the anonymity of Epic holders and users by protecting the details of transactions from third parties, and is designed to be both untraceable and invisible to surveillance through Dandelion++ Protocol.”*(Epic Cash website) 
* **Proof of Work -** “A decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody gaming the system” (Investopedia)
* **Egalitarian -** *Relating to or believing in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.* I admit I had to look this word up.

3. **MINING!** It just went through a halving event on October 30th 2021. Maybe that’s why it spiked a little? Regardless, it can be mined through a normal desktop computer (Macbooks are harder from what I have learned). Just like BTC back in the day. There are 3 more halving events from now until 2028 when the supply of Epic matches the supply of Bitcoin, known as the Singularity event in the Epic Cash White Paper. ([https://epic.tech/whitepaper](https://epic.tech/whitepaper)/) 

(Compared to BTC block time of 10 minutes and block reward of 6.25 BTC) 

Epic Coins Mined Per Day: 5,760 EPIC

Block Reward: 4 EPIC

Block Time: 60 seconds

I'm not a miner but if you are reading this and you have extra hardware or looking for a new coin to mine I’d suggest this. When it goes from 5,760 EPIC per day to 2880 in two years, who knows what the price of 1 EPIC will be. 

4. **Community!** Ever since I found out about Telegram for crypto groups, they have **NOT** been all that constructive. However, the Epic Cash Teleram (@epiccash) is actually fun, not toxic, and full of very smart people, some of  whom mined BTC and XMR in the early days. If you have ever heard of Kadena, they call themselves the Kadenians, in Epic Cash they are the Freemans. Max Freeman the founder of Epic is easily contactable in Telegram and will happily answer your questions. He also has been recently attending Youtube live streams in order to educate people about crypto and Epic. Just search “Max Freeman Epic Cash” on Youtube and start diving into the knowledge!

***Defining Characteristics of Epic Cash (some written by me and others compiled through Epic community Telegram and Official Website*** [***epic.tech***](https://epic.tech/)***):***

* **Scarce** \- Circulating supply of 13.1 million coins. Max supply 21M
* **Open Source -** No patent or company controlling the tech. 
* **Censorship Resistant** \- No one can interfere with EPIC transactions.
* **Fair Launch** \- No ICO(Initial Coin Offering), No premine, No Venture Capital, No Corporations, No government affiliations. (**WOW!!**)
* **Mineable (3 algos)** \- Mine with CPU (RandomX), GPU (ProgPoW), and Asic miner.
* **Fungibility** \- 1 Epic = 1 Epic. No Tainted Coins. 
* **Speed** \- “While Bitcoin requires six 10-minute blocks to achieve complete transaction confirmation, Epic transactions occur within a single block confirmation as soon as a 1-minute block has been mined. This makes Epic Cash transactions smooth, continuous, and executed much faster than in previous generations of blockchain technology.”
* **Universally Accessible** \- Anyone, anywhere can participate regardless of their location, identity documentation, or ability to afford the price of entry. EPIC is truly money for everyone, today. 
* **Scalability** \- Currently 1.9 GB, estimated to be 25GB with BTC throughput. 📷
* **Private Banking** \- This is a big one. Epic is part of the Epicenter Ecosystem, with ECR as the governance token, and EUSD as the stablecoin, Epic holders have the ability to control their own wealth independently without intrusion.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqDdPZMy68) 

* **Team Wallets** \- There are NO Team Wallets for Epic Cash! Everyone had to buy their coins on the open market.
* **Coin Lockup** \- Not applicable to Epic Cash as there are no team tokens. This is 100% Proof of Work!
* **Privacy** \- “*The Epic Cash blockchain safeguards the anonymity of Epic holders and users by protecting the details of transactions from third parties, and is designed to be both untraceable and invisible to surveillance through Dandelion++ Protocol.”*(Epic Cash website) 
* **Proof of Work -** “A decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody gaming the system” (Investopedia)
* **Egalitarian -** *Relating to or believing in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.* I admit I had to look this word up.

Mimblewimble Gem ($EPIC) Epic Cash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mimblewimble/comments/qpuu5b/mimblewimble_gem_epic_epic_cash/,timcostello,1,2021-11-09 11:35:26,1,/r/Mimblewimble/comments/qpuu5b/mimblewimble_gem_epic_epic_cash/,,"Please note this is NOT financial advice. I am not advising you in any way, this is simply opinion. Do not place trades based on what is written here. Please do your own research.

With that being said, I did buy $3,000 worth of it after what happened to me over that last couple of months.

I stumbled on this project and I am wondering WHY and HOW this is still so undervalued. I added it to my CoinGecko watchlist seemingly by accident in August 2021, and every so often I would see it at $0.30, or $0.45. It being on 1 exchange I thought that might be why, but I have seen other coins on 1 or 2 exchanges with a billion market cap! Thinking nothing of it (since I have 79 different coins in my “under $1” watchlist) I never really looked deep into it. Until. It went to $3.75! Now this random coin had my attention, after accidentally adding it to one of my watchlists. Why did I leave this random coin in my watchlist? Maybe since the watchlist was an “under $1” and none of the ones I had been watching ever go above $1. 

Still at its ATH, it was at most a 40M market cap!!! It is currently at 32M! The telegram community seems to be quite small with only 1500 members. There is a small subreddit,youtube, and facebook following as well. With that being said, they went from $0.30 to $3 with relatively nothing. If I had invested what I did; back then? I would have had 10,000 shares!!! Instead I have around 8X less than that. Forward looking only, let's look at the potential of this project. For example sake, let's just play around with the market cap.

With a market cap of 130 Million&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would = $10
With a market cap of 1.3 Billion&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would= $100

Every so often a project goes under the radar and eventually makes its way to the Top 100; silently. This could be one of those projects. Epic Cash started 2 years ago (September 2, 2019) with a Fair Launch; not many projects can claim this. It is a Grassroots type movement in the sense that it gains 1 person at a time, slowly accumulating a strong movement.  It does not pay for listings, influencers, or marketing. That is why it is on ONE exchange currently, Vitex DEX. The current market cap is around 35M, with a circulating supply of 13.1M, giving it a current share price of $2.50.

Anyway, I ended up researching the project and would like to compile some of the interesting things about it. 

1.  Privacy features and Size of blockchain. Both of which have what is called MimbleWimble to thank. MimbleWimble sounds hilarious, and I still do not fully understand it. What I do know is, it does not require the storage of data that other blockchains do, therefore making it lightweight (around 1.97GB at time of writing this, explorer.epic.tech) AND!! It has a very interesting origin story, similar to Bitcoin!

2. Epicenter. The entire ecosystem Epic developers and community are trying to create. Similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stable coin, Epicenter is their version.  With EPIC being the store of value (like ETH in the ETH/MKR/DAI system) So, EPIC/ECR/EUSD is EpicenterDAO’s version of ETH/MKR/DAI. ECR is like MKR and EUSD is the stable coin like Dai.

Epic Cash ($EPIC) financial liberty,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/qpuw8s/epic_cash_epic_financial_liberty/,timcostello,1,2021-11-09 11:38:50,0,/r/financialindependence/comments/qpuw8s/epic_cash_epic_financial_liberty/,,"Please note this is NOT financial advice. I am not advising you in any way, this is simply opinion. Do not place trades based on what is written here. Please do your own research.

With that being said, I did buy $3,000 worth of it after what happened to me over that last couple of months.

I stumbled on this project and I am wondering WHY and HOW this is still so undervalued. I added it to my CoinGecko watchlist seemingly by accident in August 2021, and every so often I would see it at $0.30, or $0.45. It being on 1 exchange I thought that might be why, but I have seen other coins on 1 or 2 exchanges with a billion market cap! Thinking nothing of it (since I have 79 different coins in my “under $1” watchlist) I never really looked deep into it. Until. It went to $3.75! Now this random coin had my attention, after accidentally adding it to one of my watchlists. Why did I leave this random coin in my watchlist? Maybe since the watchlist was an “under $1” and none of the ones I had been watching ever go above $1. 

Still at its ATH, it was at most a 40M market cap!!! It is currently at 32M! The telegram community seems to be quite small with only 1500 members. There is a small subreddit,youtube, and facebook following as well. With that being said, they went from $0.30 to $3 with relatively nothing. If I had invested what I did; back then? I would have had 10,000 shares!!! Instead I have around 8X less than that. Forward looking only, let's look at the potential of this project. For example sake, let's just play around with the market cap.

With a market cap of 130 Million&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would = $10
With a market cap of 1.3 Billion&gt; Epic Cash Share Price would= $100

Every so often a project goes under the radar and eventually makes its way to the Top 100; silently. This could be one of those projects. Epic Cash started 2 years ago (September 2, 2019) with a Fair Launch; not many projects can claim this. It is a Grassroots type movement in the sense that it gains 1 person at a time, slowly accumulating a strong movement.  It does not pay for listings, influencers, or marketing. That is why it is on ONE exchange currently, Vitex DEX. The current market cap is around 35M, with a circulating supply of 13.1M, giving it a current share price of $2.50.

Anyway, I ended up researching the project and would like to compile some of the interesting things about it. 

1.  Privacy features and Size of blockchain. Both of which have what is called MimbleWimble to thank. MimbleWimble sounds hilarious, and I still do not fully understand it. What I do know is, it does not require the storage of data that other blockchains do, therefore making it lightweight (around 1.97GB at time of writing this, explorer.epic.tech) AND!! It has a very interesting origin story, similar to Bitcoin!

Link to Mimblewimble Origin Story:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zeydt/mimblewimbles_story/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

2. Epicenter. The entire ecosystem Epic developers and community are trying to create. Similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stable coin, Epicenter is their version.  With EPIC being the store of value (like ETH in the ETH/MKR/DAI system) So, EPIC/ECR/EUSD is EpicenterDAO’s version of ETH/MKR/DAI. ECR is like MKR and EUSD is the stable coin like Dai. For more information go here:

https://epicenter.epic.tech/what-is-epicenter/

https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper#abstract

3. MINING! It just went through a halving event on October 30th 2021. Maybe that’s why it spiked a little? Regardless, it can be mined through a normal desktop computer (Macbooks are harder from what I have learned). Just like BTC back in the day. There are 3 more halving events from now until 2028 when the supply of Epic matches the supply of Bitcoin, known as the Singularity event in the Epic Cash White Paper. (https://epic.tech/whitepaper/) 

(Compared to BTC block time of 10 minutes and block reward of 6.25 BTC) 

Epic Coins Mined Per Day: 5,760 EPIC
Block Reward: 4 EPIC
Block Time: 60 seconds

I'm not a miner but if you are reading this and you have extra hardware or looking for a new coin to mine I’d suggest this. When it goes from 5,760 EPIC per day to 2880 in two years, who knows what the price of 1 EPIC will be. 

4. Community! Ever since I found out about Telegram for crypto groups, they have NOT been all that constructive. However, the Epic Cash Teleram (@epiccash) is actually fun, not toxic, and full of very smart people, some of  whom mined BTC and XMR in the early days. If you have ever heard of Kadena, they call themselves the Kadenians, in Epic Cash they are the Freemans. Max Freeman the founder of Epic is easily contactable in Telegram and will happily answer your questions. He also has been recently attending Youtube live streams in order to educate people about crypto and Epic. Just search “Max Freeman Epic Cash” on Youtube and start diving into the knowledge!


Defining Characteristics of Epic Cash (some written by me and others compiled through Epic community Telegram and Official Website epic.tech):

Scarce - Circulating supply of 13.1 million coins. Max supply 21M
Open Source - No patent or company controlling the tech. 
Censorship Resistant - No one can interfere with EPIC transactions.
Fair Launch - No ICO(Initial Coin Offering), No premine, No Venture Capital, No Corporations, No government affiliations. (WOW!!)
Mineable (3 algos) - Mine with CPU (RandomX), GPU (ProgPoW), and Asic miner.
Fungibility - 1 Epic = 1 Epic. No Tainted Coins. 
Speed - “While Bitcoin requires six 10-minute blocks to achieve complete transaction confirmation, Epic transactions occur within a single block confirmation as soon as a 1-minute block has been mined. This makes Epic Cash transactions smooth, continuous, and executed much faster than in previous generations of blockchain technology.”
Universally Accessible - Anyone, anywhere can participate regardless of their location, identity documentation, or ability to afford the price of entry. EPIC is truly money for everyone, today. 
Scalability - Currently 1.9 GB, estimated to be 25GB with BTC throughput. 










Private Banking - This is a big one. Epic is part of the Epicenter Ecosystem, with ECR as the governance token, and EUSD as the stablecoin, Epic holders have the ability to control their own wealth independently without intrusion.

I got my idea from MakerDAO and Synthetix with the collateralized debt positions, and used it in my Synthetic Gastoken idea. Unlike MakerDAO and Synthetix using off-chain oracles, I use Solidity's `block.basefee` as my oracle. Unlike regular gastokens, you can't burn it to release gas. Instead, you must sell your synthetic gastokens for Ethereum, which is used to pay the basefee.

I'm asking because it sort of sounds like a chicken and egg scenario, Keepers in the early days seemed like they needed to lock a bunch of eth to be able to make sure they have enough DAI on the ready to participate in collateral auctions.

Did it just start off this way, where DAI was always used for liquidations/collateral auctions, and that DAI was only extracted from a Keeper locking in their ETH onto a vault?"
The Mystery behind Stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qr0zai/the_mystery_behind_stablecoins/,HaloJames100,1,2021-11-11 02:37:02,4,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qr0zai/the_mystery_behind_stablecoins/,DISCUSSION,"STABLECOINS AND THE MYSTERY BEHIND THEM

If you’ve been around the crypto scene for a while then chances are, you’ve come across the word “stablecoin” several times and no, they do not have anything to do with horses or real stables. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency which attaches its value to a different class of asset to keep its price stable. This asset class could be gold, metals, or fiat currency. 


Now, everybody loves top-of-the-class cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, bitcoin, and the rest of them. The ability to make payments without third parties is all the rave and while it may seem like there’s nothing unattractive about cryptocurrency, there is; and it's a major wrinkle in the scheme of things for crypto. What is this? Unpredictability. The price of cryptocurrencies, in general, has a history of volatility and unpredictability, which puts the average crypto owner on edge by just watching the market.

Think about investing all one's savings into a particular coin and wake up to find the price has taken an overnight plunge all because someone like Elon Musk made an ambiguous tweet. Quite the bummer right? 

In comparison, the price of stablecoins is parallel to that of the asset class they're linked to. This includes gold, U.S dollars, and so on. However, this does not disprove the fact that the value of currencies such as dollars also reduces when certain factors come into play. The difference here is that with cryptocurrencies, the changes are more drastic.

Instead of exposing investments to these vulnerabilities, stablecoins manage the prospect of price volatility by embedding the value of Cryptocurrencies in fairly consistent assets.


How does the whole caboodle work?
Stablecoins usually have a backup party that facilitates a sort of reserve for assets regulating that stablecoin to be stored. By this, we mean that one million euros or U.S dollars in your conventional bank can be equivalent to one million units of stablecoin to be backed by one million euro/dollar worth of fiat currency. Do you get it now? I'm sure you do.

This fiat currency stored away in the reserves simply functions as collateral for the stablecoin. Cashing out on tokens, therefore, means the same amount would be deducted from the fiat currency reserve.

We will now go into a brief analysis of stablecoin collaterals. The same way stablecoins come in variety is the same way stablecoin assets are diversified.
Precious metals: think of all the great stuff when it comes to metal commodities: silver, gold, etc. These are the type of metals considered valuable enough to be collateral for stablecoins.

Fiat: As you probably guessed, fiat currency is one of the most popular of all the stablecoin collateral. Other fiat currencies steadily becoming more popular are the Turkish lira and BiLira.

Other investments: Here, we have Tether's USDT which used to be backed 1 unit of USDT per dollar until recently when its collateral mix changed. 
Interestingly, Tether stated in 2021 that half the company reserves are in rated A-2  commercial paper. Note that A-2 is the second-best grade available for a corporate borrower from credit rating agencies. 
On the other hand, Circle's USDC lists verified investments that are yet to be categorized with accounts at insured federal banks.

 Cryptocurrencies: these include all the regular cryptocurrencies you know such as bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on.
Stablecoins are not less popular than other coins in the crypto space and as a matter of fact, they possess a host of very common coins which we will now look at to help you identify them as you navigate and interact on Crypto platforms.  


USD Coin
USD Coin was launched in 2018 and is jointly administered by Coinbase and Circle using the Centre Consortium.
USD Coin like Tether used to be linked to the U.S dollars before it switched to a more varied mix of collateral assets. Before this, it had a circulating supply of over $26 million. Circle predicts that it would hit $190 billion by 2023.
Circle has recently sealed a funding round worth $440 million with big industry names such as Fidelity Management and Research Company, FTX, and Digital Currency Group.
The company recently announced its plan to go public using a SPAC merger deal with Concord Acquisition Corp worth $4.5 billion.

Diem
A unique detail of Diem stablecoin is that it was birthed by Facebook and it has had an unprecedented impact under its former name, Libra even before it was launched.
The dying trend has even sent powerful governments such as China making efforts to create and explore digital currencies as inspired by crypto due to the size and influence of Facebook.
The initial plan for Diem was for this stablecoin to be backed by a cornucopia of currencies. This plan has since been diverted from developing different stablecoins backed individually by a separate coin.
In January 2021, the Diem dollar was launched.

Tether
One of the oldest and most popular stablecoins, USDT was launched in 2014 and holds the highest value in the market. With Tether USDT, money can be moved efficiently between exchanges every time cryptocurrency prices change on two exchanges.

Dai
On the Ethereum blockchain, Dai is a stablecoin that runs on MakerDAO. This stablecoin was created in 2015 and is linked to the U.S dollar while being backed by Ether.

Feel like you're going to burst from all this info? There's more! And while it may seem like stablecoins are faultless, this is sadly not the case. When it comes to coins, 

Do stablecoins have any drawbacks? Yes, they do, but these drawbacks are not the same as that of other cryptocurrencies. One such risk is counterparty risk which does not assure one of the entities possesses the collateral they claimed to have. 

Do stablecoins have a 1-1 backing? These questions remain unanswered. With stablecoins, reserves can be insufficient for redeeming every unit of stablecoins.
The nature of cryptocurrency is such that it can replace third-party companies entrusted with user funds. Because of this auspice, third parties can control transactions. What stablecoins contribute to this game is the additional capacity to control transactions.

Now that you have ""stable"" knowledge of stablecoins, it's up to you to decide whether you'll be getting onto the bandwagon or not. And if you do, you'll know what you're getting into!"
RAMP DEFI 2.0 OPTIMIZE YOUR YIELDS!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qrif6n/ramp_defi_20_optimize_your_yields/,GemHunterSince2014,1,2021-11-11 18:31:37,2,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qrif6n/ramp_defi_20_optimize_your_yields/,STAKING,"Greetings Cryptopians!

If you have not heard about RAMP DEFI i will try to cover as much as possible in this post so that all readers have a better understanding of what it is and how to optimize the platform for higher yields.

RAMP DEFI is a DeFi project focusing on **unlocking value** from your **staked capital** to be used as you wish.

It currently operates on **BSC**, **Polygon** and **Ethereum** ( more chains to be integrated soon i.e **Polkadot** &amp; **Solana** )

In this example i am drawing out i have some CAKE tokens that i am currently holding. I can stake my CAKE with an APY of **40,779**% ( **my staking rewards are being paid out every hour** ) and now i am entitled to take out a loan on my staked capital and use it as collateral if i wish to do so with RAMP DEFI´s own stable coin **rUSD.** 

I cannot take a loan that exceeds **70%** of my staked value, and doing so is regarded VERY HIGH RISK so i do not recommend on taking a loan that exceeds **30%** of your value. That is to keep your liquidation price relatively low. So i am taking a loan ( called minting ) on my CAKE for a interest rate of **2%**.

I can now use my **rUSD** as i please i can swap it to **BUSD** for example if i wish to, or any other token ( **there is a swap function on the site** ) the possibilities are endless since the borrowing APY is lower than your staking APY your actual loan pays of itself!!

&amp;#x200B;

But in this case I am going to provide liquidity on the rUSD-BUSD pool on pancakeswap then stake my LP token on the RAMP platform and enjoy the current APY of **30.427%**!

So to put it simple. I am borrowing money on my staked capital for an interest rate of **2%** and putting that money to work in another vault for **30%** APY. 

So if you are a holder like me and you wish to unlock some capital from your assets this is the BEST way to do it right now hands down.

&amp;#x200B;

**RAMP is still under development and some of the things in the pipeline is the following:**

\- *RAMP DEFI 2.0 to be released soon*

*- Liquidation protection function under development*

*- Automated loan repay function under development (* ***your interest can be used to pay of your loan*** *)*

*- Insurance via Nexus Mutual in discussion (* ***BIG*** *)*

*- ETH minter under development*

*- rUSD borrowing program (****60M incentive program****)*

*- rUSD stability program (****60M incentive program****)*

*- Solana chain under development*

*- Dot chain under development*

*- New single and LP vaults*

*- Significant exchange listing discussions  (* ***HINT COINB...*** *)*

&amp;#x200B;

**All the deployed contracts have been audited by several auditing firms and have never been compromised.**

&amp;#x200B;

The team is **NOT** anon and have experience from working on/with **Binance**, **Microsoft**, **BNP Paribas** etc.

I am 100% positive that RAMP DEFI will succeed over time and become one of the TOP DeFi projects the coming years after looking back on how much they have done and how much stuff they have in the pipeline. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently sitting on a marketcap of 107 million only!

Comparing it to some of our competitors like AAVE, MAKERDAO and Abracadabra.Money

That is sitting well over 1 billion in marketcap we have very bright times ahead of us!

I recommend you all to DYOR as always. Do not invest blindly into anything that people throw at you!

"Crypto is not a scam, or a ponzi-scheme. Shitcoins, rugpulls and scams do exist within crypto, as do they in nearly every other market, but do your own research and you'll see that crypto is not just about getting rich. There's real technology behind it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/qs6amz/crypto_is_not_a_scam_or_a_ponzischeme_shitcoins/,Dan6erbond,1,2021-11-12 15:46:48,87,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/qs6amz/crypto_is_not_a_scam_or_a_ponzischeme_shitcoins/,,"Okay, so this thread is going to be full of technical facts, and it will be my attempt to educate some people in the mainstream space why they shouldn't *completely* dismiss crypto as a scam, or a ponzi-scheme.

I firmly believe that the technology behind crypto, and many popular projects have already built infrastructure and systems that have significant value, the same way the internet has value or gaming items do. You may or may not believe that the entire world can change its ways and move to crypto, but at the very least after this you hopefully will agree that crypto has its place in creating a more open alternative to some systems.

Since I'm invested in crypto myself, I want to make it very clear that if I mention any specific crypto projects, it isn't financial advice, nor are positive or negative mentions a reason to invest in them. Do your own research if you do want to invest into crypto, but any coins or tokens that get mentioned will simply be in this thread with the purpose of providing an example.

My goal here is to educate on the premise of how blockchains and crypto work, so that people understand, besides the millions of scams that do exist, there are great projects working on great things, and maybe some of you might be inclined to try out some projects without even expecting any gains!

**So first of all, what are blockchains?**

Blockchains are simply distributed ledgers and computing systems. Now those are two fancy words that essentially mean they are systems, spread across the globe, running on many computers and servers, that track data, as well as allow their users to perform any tasks defined within their specifications. This can be as simple as adding two numbers, or handling a *smart contract* that only pays out insurance money if certain requirements are met. We'll get back to these later.

The benefit of having all the data, and code, running on a distributed system, is that everything is transparent. This doesn't always mean that I can read how much of a certain crypto got sent or received from each wallet, but the code can verify that you're allowed to perform certain transactions, and this is done by multiple people to ensure that trust doesn't need to really exist, since a large portion of people running and validating the network need to agree. This makes blockchains trustless.

**How does crypto play into this?**

Cryptocurrencies are coins or tokens built on top of blockchains. It's very important to understand the difference between a cryptocoin, and a cryptotoken. 

Each blockchain needs a way to incentivize those distributed computers and servers I mentioned. Since they're running the computational tasks, and storing all the data on the ledger, they get paid in a cryptocoin. For the Bitcoin network this is BTC, for Ethereum it's ETH, etc. Those fees are usually paid when a transaction is ran on the network, so i.e. if I send from my wallet to yours some ETH, then a transaction fee must be paid and a part of which gets paid to the miners that enabled this transaction to go through, the rest of the transaction fee is destroyed, making ETH deflationary in this case.

There's a lot more that can go into the economics of a cryptocoin, or token. Some of it I might bring up later. In any case, now to the tokens.

Tokens are representations of real-world assets, or completely digital assets, built on top of a blockchain. As they aren't used to pay transaction fees, and aren't built natively on the blockchain they reside on, we call them tokens instead of coins. This could even be something like a house deed, or the ownership certificate of a vehicle, etc. These tokens don't even need to only exist on one blockchain. They can be coded to exist on multiple, such as Solana, Ethereum and Cardano.

Now, not all blockchains make it possible to create a token on their network. Each blockchain has its own approach, often giving the creator of a token a reason to pick one or the other blockchain for their project. 

**How can tokens help us?**

Well, a big use-case I see in blockchain technology right now is the use of tokens, which is why it's getting a dedicated section. As I mentioned, tokens are just assets, either representing something in the real-world, or entirely digital. I can tokenize my house deed, as I mentioned, or generate a bunch of even tickets with the right blockchain. Then sell the whole thing digitally, in a trustless and low-fee manner compared to traditional centralized systems.

Those are just some examples I wanted to quickly mention on how tokens can actually have real-world use. On top of that, think about the games we play. LoL accounts, among others, can be sold for thousands of dollars because of the items they possess. Now, some might call it a bubble, or simply dumb, but it shows, that we humans are capable of attributing arbitrary value, to the oddest of things. The same can be seen in certain artwork (IMO, but those buying the art probably see it in a very different light) and playing cards for soccer/football or Pokémon. 

All those, more playful, systems, can be tokenized and gamified on blockchain as well. I can write a smart contract that generates a very specific set of cards, which are used in a PvP game, and the better a card's attributes are, the higher likelihood it has in winning a tournament. That's a very basic, and general example of what I'm trying to explain, but hopefully it makes sense.

**What are smart contracts?**

Smart contracts are what really make blockchains as capable as they are today, IMHO. A very straightforward explanation is that a smart contract is some code, that only does something when certain parameters are met. That's why it's called a smart contract, because it only executes its main task, after the contract is signed so to speak. Depending on the blockchain you're working on, smart contracts will have different capabilities, but there are some crazy use-cases for them that I bet some of you will find interesting.

This is where we get a bit more technical. To really understand how great a smart contract can be, you need to know that this code gets deployed on a blockchain by whoever created it, and gets a wallet address of its own just like you or I would on which it can accept transactions or even send them. This means smart contracts can interact with the crptocoins and tokens I mentioned earlier. A smart contract can also keep track of data, kind of like an Excel sheet on the blockchain, that is fully transparent and open. It's trustless, like I said, because you can view the code before interacting with it, to ensure that it truly will do what its creator claims it should. 

Because smart contracts have the capabilities I mentioned above, they can be used to validate the authenticity of certain assets. As I mentioned above, those gaming cards would be created by a smart contract, and since the smart contract only does exactly what it's told to do, people can verify that the card is real, by checking if its original creator was the smart contract that runs the game. 

On top of that, smart contracts can be used for more than just games. They can be used for voting, open and publicly ran insurances, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), liquidity and swapping protocols, lending protocols, etc.

All those get even more technical. A decentralized autonomous organization, is exactly what it sounds like. A company that doesn't have a CEO, or anyone running its operations. Everything that happens in that company is executed via code. If the smart contract is supposed to change, to e.g. support new features or use-cases, then people would first have to vote on it. The voting systems are always different as well, but a popular example is MakerDAO, which created its own token that people can hold to get voting rights. So essentially anyone can make business decisions by holding the token. This is a popular approach in crypto governance in general.

Liquidity, swapping and lending protocols have to do with DeFi. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, and is a whole new world of taking over the tasks from traditional banks, and putting them on the blockchain. Instead of earning interest through the middleman, who takes a cut, you add your liquidity to a liquidity pool on the blockchain, and make far higher returns. This can even be done with stablecoins, which are essentially coins or tokens pegged to a fiat currency value, so you don't have to worry about the volatility of crypto.

Swapping protocols allow people to trade between currencies without a middleman as well. Instead of a centralized exchange buying millions of crypto so that they have the liquidity when you want to buy it, a DEX (decentralized exchange) will use smart contracts to have the community pool this liquidity, and anyone that adds liquidity, just like with the above mentioned lending protocols, makes a good amount of fees for the risk and effort. I must add that the risk is usually extremely low with well-established DEXes.

I could go on about crypto all day. But the last two things I want to mention, is that crypto really could help some third-world countries, but even first-world countries in a meaningful way. The Cardano developers have been partnering with African nations to introduce better ways in tracking education data, voting turnouts, etc. using blockchain. These systems will be somewhat closed, as they probably will be ran by the government, but they will be leveraging the same blockchain technology we see here in the public system.

On top of that, there are blockchain projects working on early implementations of UBI. If we can ensure that everyone only signs up to said blockchain once, then we can pay out a certain basic income rate which is something some first-world countries direly need in this time of automation. 

**Touching on the Metaverse.**

I just want to make a quick note on the Metaverse, as recently it has been a controversial topic with Facebook's rebranding and the parabolic price action of related cryptocurrencies. I think it's interesting, and again, just like traditional games are able to put certain value on items, the Metaverse wants to build a decentralized digital world. So whether you like it or not is up to you, but it's kind of like playing VRChat on steroids. Along with the financial incentives, people are just going to do what they can to get in early. So maybe it's something for you!

That's all for my explanation on cryptocurrencies. I've written a previous thread going over some of the [myths about blockchain technology and crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pjjevn/crypto_isnt_just_a_trading_game_or_a_gamble_and/), if you guys are interested. My approach has always been to try and educate people. I don't want to change your minds, if everything I wrote here still has you convinced that crypto isn't for you, that's okay. But I hope everyone makes an informed decision, instead of following influencers and politicians, since they always have a stake, that will go against most of us here."
Markets Roundup: Ethereum Burn Rate Surges as DeFi Tokens Post Mixed Performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qsf747/markets_roundup_ethereum_burn_rate_surges_as_defi/,TheDefiantNews,1,2021-11-13 00:41:37,1,/r/defi/comments/qsf747/markets_roundup_ethereum_burn_rate_surges_as_defi/,,"*A weekly recap of DeFi market action from* [*Sam Haig*](https://twitter.com/samuel_haig)

DeFi assets saw a mixed performance this week, with roughly half of the sector’s leading protocols suffering drawdowns by both TVL and token. Still, sector-wide TVL and market cap have continued trending into previously uncharted territory.

##### Market Cap Moves

According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi), the combined capitalization of DeFi tokens has continued to press into new all-time highs this past week, currently sitting at a record of $173.7B equal to 16% more than  the previous high from early May.

Terra (LUNA) remains at the top of the rankings with a nearly $22.9B market cap, followed by Chainlink (LINK) with $15.5B, and Uniswap (UNI) with $12.8B.

##### Top Gainers

*Two top DeFi tokens gained by more than triple digits this week, while a further seven tokens posted significant gains of between 25% and 50%.*

Keep3r (KP3R) + 217.4%

Loopring (LRC) + 175.3%

Lido DAO (LDO) + 50.1%

Liquity (LQTY) + 48.2%

Frax Share (FXS) + 47.6%

##### Biggest Losers

*More than half of the sector’s top 100 tokens by market cap suffered drawdowns for the week.* 

Popsicle Finance (ICE) – 40.7%

Spell Token (SPELL) – 28.8%

Ampleforth (AMPL) – 28.8%

Trader Joe (JOE) – 25.9%

KeeperDAO (ROOK) – 23%

##### TVL

According to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/), the total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector also posted new highs this week, tagging $275B for the first time on Nov. 9 before retracing to $268B.

More than two-thirds of DeFi capital is locked on the Ethereum network, which posted a record TVL of $182B on Nov.10 before retreating  to $179.5B.

Binance Smart Chain’s TVL saw modest growth this week, representing $21B in locked capital. However, BSC’s TVL is still down 35% compared to its May high of $32.4B, suggesting that rival EVM-compatible networks have amassed some of the liquidity previously on Binance Smart Chain.

Solana ranks third with $14.1B after posting a record high of $15.2B on Nov. 9, followed by Terra with $10.8B down from $11.5B, and Avalanche at a new high of $10B. Fantom also ranks sixth with $5.3B after hitting a new high of $6.1B, while Polygon ranks seventh with $5B — down more than 50% from its June record of $10.5B. 

All other networks host a combined DeFi TVL of $22.3B.

Curve currently ranks as the single-largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $20.7B across seven different networks, followed by MakerDAO with $19.5B on just Ethereum, and Aave with $16.1B across three chains.

Nearly half of the 100-largest protocols saw capital outflows for the week.

##### Burn Rate

Ethereum’s burn rate has increased by nearly nine times over the past fortnight, with 88,641 Ether (roughly $407.7M) having been destroyed in the past seven days according to [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money/).

Uniswap v2 was the largest burn source destroying 13,672 ETH ($62.9M), followed by wallet transfers with 9,596.5 ETH burned ($44.1M), and Tether with 5,636 ETH ($25.9M).

Uniswap v3 also ranked fourth by burn rate with 4,377 ETH ($20.1M), closely followed by OpenSea with 4,017 ETH ($18.5M), and Ethereum Name Service with 2,691 ETH ($12.4M).

##### Layer 2 Growth

According to [L2beat](https://l2beat.com/), Leading layer-two Arbitrum saw its TVL largely trend sideways at $2.7B this week, tagging a new high of $2.8B on Nov. 9.

Second-layer derivatives protocol dYdX ranks as the second-largest L2 by DeFI TVL with $967M despite a 4% drawdown, while rollups network Optimism ranks third with $325M after posting a record of $341M this past week.

##### Fees

Leading DEX Uniswap’s fee generation [surged](https://cryptofees.info/) this week, with the protocol driving $9.1 million worth of fees each day on average. Compared to just two weeks ago, Uniswap’s fees have nearly doubled.

Aave was the second-ranked DeFi dApp by fees with a daily average of $2 million, followed by SushiSwap with $1.8 million. By contrast, the entire Bitcoin network drove roughly $1 million in fees each day."

Layer 2’s are currently a hot topic in DeFi, and the PE team has created a way to transfer and mint Dai on L2s as well as other L1 blockchains.

Users can currently transfer Dai between Arbitrum, Optimism, and the Ethereum mainnet. In the coming months, new L2s will be added and minting will become available on networks that have deployed multi-collateral Dai.

Another reason why L2s are going to explode and revolutionize Ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qt1irj/another_reason_why_l2s_are_going_to_explode_and/,busterrulezzz,1,2021-11-13 21:43:00,389,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qt1irj/another_reason_why_l2s_are_going_to_explode_and/,DISCUSSION,"It seems like there's not a day going by without a top post complaining about high gas fees on Ethereum. I totally agree with the core critic : retail investors are being priced out of the network. Nobody - except whales - can afford to pay 200$ for a simple swap.

But those days will soon be over.

A lot of people already know about Layer-2, the ""execution"" layer of Ethereum. They have names like Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync. But most of the times, when I mention those services, people are still not satisfied. UX isn't great, bridging to L2 costs money, and there are no liquidity on a lot of pairs there.

That's about to change!

This week, MakerDAO introduced Maker Wormhole, a solution that will let users **bridge DAI between mainnet and L2 instantly** and with ridiculously low fees (a fraction of a penny). The official launch is scheduled for Q1 2022, and it should work first on Arbitrum/Optimism, and then be deployed on other L2s. Even better, this Wormhole doesn't require any liquidity at all! DAI will be burnt and minted on each side of the transaction by an oracle.

This will have a huge implication for all Ethereum L2s : no more waiting times for withdrawing, frictionless transfers of capital between layers, and extremely low fees to get started on L2s. And this is just one of the many exciting projects that are in the works for the Ethereum ecosystem. Those are not distant vaporware ; it's happening right now, before our eyes. And I think a lot of people around here still don't realize how close we are to this revolution.

Footprint: How Aave overtook Compound,https://www.reddit.com/r/Footprint_Analytics/comments/qua5td/footprint_how_aave_overtook_compound/,FootprintAnalytics,1,2021-11-15 14:38:15,0,/r/Footprint_Analytics/comments/qua5td/footprint_how_aave_overtook_compound/,,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vkzs1mz9fpz71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeda2f45799522db93d4bb8231be5469dfcd4c3d

 

Oct, 2021,vincy@footprint.network

Data Source：[Footprint Analytics](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/9819c526-4bc6-4b58-9f30-70ee2401994a/aave-vs-compound-dashboard)

Despite its platform being launched in just 2020, Aave (AAVE) outgrew its established competitor Compound (COMP) and multiplied its market cap eightfold within half a year. In an industry with plenty of fast ascents and precipitous falls, many wondered whether the platform had the staying power to remain a central institution in DeFi lending . 

Nearly 2 years later, Aave is still going span, especially in relation to its one-time close rival. 

This article will take a closer look at the two platform’s strengths and weaknesses and explain why Aave was able to overtake Compound.

**Aave and Compound TVL Compared**

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics： TVL \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/f8h8p1ijfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e386bfc1aaac1af81fdf4debd7d4ebeab12c9eb)

As of Oct. 20, the DeFi market has surpassed $200 billion in total locked-in value (TVL) at $241.575 billion, with Aave’s TVL gaining the largest share at $18.89 billion. This is followed by lending protocols Curve ($18.01 billion), MakerDAO ($16.4 billion) and Compound ($12 billion).

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Latest changes to the ranking of the top 10 TVL platforms](https://preview.redd.it/21c2ormkfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e549794d93469f3b1ecde9ecfe7db9213f8181d0)

In the lending space, Aave's TVL has been way ahead of Compound in the last six months. This can be attributed to its model, which is similar to traditional finance, and ability to operate in Financial Conduct Authority-encrypted assets.

**Comparison of Market Cap**

As of Oct. 20, Aave continues to dwarf Compound in the DeFi lending and borrowing industry with a market cap of over US$4 billion versus the latter’s $1.97 billion. 

There are two other metrics that indicate Aave’s span position in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave VS Compound Market Cap \(since January 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qw2ryvrlfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9b83cd712b4ec7e0fa662fedb20e3bcd508f6a)

First, its circulating supply of 82% is higher than Compound’s 61%, indicating less inflationary pressure. 

Second, Aave has not had any major security incidents, indicating better security mechanisms likely favoured by depositors. 

**Aave’s deposit volumes dominate**

Aave's deposit volume of approximately $21 billion has remained higher than Compound's estimated $18 billion. Compound previously went live with subsidised lending and mining (disguisedly raised deposit returns and lowered lending rates to compete with Aave). Today, Aave has turned to lending and mining, coupled with Polygon's deposit and lending subsidies. Compound's rate advantage has largely disappeared as a side-effect of Aave's ecosystem bargaining power.

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave VS Compound Deposited Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/cvm50yumfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3905bf49ce749fca4785daefd1400a1a01dad643)

The Aave team continues to focus on innovation while being highly risk-aware, and adjusts the direction of the product in a timely manner when issues arise, making the platform more secure.

**Can Aave users lend out more assets than Compound?**

Data for the previous month shows that Aave's borrowing balance has levelled off above $8.2 billion per day, which is still higher than Compound’s borrowing balance of $5-7 billion, with little overall volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Aave vs Compound Borrowed Balance \(since September 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/galyhuynfpz71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b3d7e77bdc38d4b1511927b2aef32bd4c705db)

Aave supports a wider variety of tokens, allowing users to lend out more assets and have more liquidity available. Some of Aave's rate agreements are also considered more innovative and have some advantages over Compound, such as unsecured flash loans, rate swaps and line of credit mandates. But on the downside, it comes with relatively high lending rates and loan fees.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Footprint Analytics：Aave's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/7zmxrlxofpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f2ac0af00f9ad43ef9485bf6b65715a40967d1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Footprint Analytics：Compound's latest asset liquidity distribution](https://preview.redd.it/jek2itypfpz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e505296989245dd7a1eb2a9e34e5da801f12932a)

Aave and Compound support a variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as DAI, USDC and USDT, and non-stablecoins such as WBTC and UNI. With Aave, users mainly pledge ETH to lend USDC, DAI and USDT.  With Compound, users pledge ETH to lend DAI and USDC. While the supply of DAI and USDC is about the same, the former has more demand than the latter.

It is also worth noting that  Aave is one of the few licensed projects and is freely convertible in the United Kingdom.

**Differences in liquidation**

There are currently two traditional liquidation methods: the auction format of MakerDao and the liquidation method of Aave and Compound, which operate on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Compound sets a liquidation line of 75% as well as a borrowing rate that triggers liquidation when 100% is reached. However, only 50% of its assets will be liquidated. 

Aave, on the other hand, has a 5% safety cushion, mitigates risk, especially for new users.

Note: While the two liquidation methods have some efficiency issues, Liquity is a more innovative liquidation mechanism that differs from the traditional methods of MakerDao, Aave and Compound, as discussed in the article [Footprint: Can Liquity's mechanism really catch up from behind?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyTQi_HplDLXmXx7E9s-EEsqu32HrJxdCbCK66COCKM/edit#heading=h.lgi4s1f3dx3m) 

**Conclusion**

In summary, Aave continues its dominance over Compound, mainly due to  the following points:

* Aave has been more aggressive in innovation and business expansion, having more types of tokens released on its platform and gaining relative traction on unsecured flash lending, automated market makers, line of credit mandates, and with the traditional finance industry.
* On 19 October 2021, Aave TVL hit an all-time high that was made possible by the team behind the company whose focus is on safety, risk management and product strategy.
* Aave has progressed much  faster in terms of compliance to mitigate risk.

No topic makes crypto investors more nervous than stablecoins.

While stablecoins have opened the world of  DeFi lending and yield farming, they also threaten to bring it all down due to questionable asset reserves and opaque operations. 

At least, that’s the narrative with the world’s largest stablecoin, Tether. But are all stablecoins in the same boat?

Most people, even seasoned DeFi investors, are unaware how stablecoins work under the surface. Fewer understand the unique mechanisms behind every stablecoin. 

In this article, we’ll look at two mid-sized stablecoins to see how they go about the same goal—creating a stable, usable USD peg—in very different ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Market Cap of Stablecoin（Since Aug,2020） Data source:Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/vx6gg2tj1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45cfa087f26cf9472bbacb36632a0a4cd16ee337)

Launched in 2018, MakerDao created a stablecoin by locking up ETH to mint DAI. As a first-generation decentralised stablecoin, DAI still occupies the first seat among decentralized stablecoins due to its first-mover advantage, despite having suffered bad debts in March 2020.

A question on the centralization of stablecoins was widely raised that most stablecoins are centralized stablecoins formed with fiat collateral.  This became the initial motivation for Liquity to create LUSD in 2021.

According to Footprint, MakerDao’s TVL is about 7.6 times that of Liquity, while DAI's market cap is nearly 12 times that of LUSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

[TVL of MakerDao VS Liquity（Since 2021）  Data source: Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/61lpxwwk1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36a58dc8109a816c4bae8c94fd9652c3ab6de12)

But Liquity, as a latecomer to the over-collateralized stablecoin market, has had to learn from its predecessor. Its team engineered many of its mechanisms to address the pain points users of MarkerDao have. 

Note: For a more in-depth background of Liquity, read Footprint’s report, [*Can Liquity's mechanism really catch up from behind?*](https://www.footprint.network/news/articles/61834cbe42270900104d590e/footprint-can-liquitys-mechanism-really-catch-up-from-behind) 

This article will compare Liquity’s and MakerDao’s lending process, use cases, token patterns, and liquidation mechanisms.

**Comparison 1：The Lending Process**

**Collateral**

Before users can lend, they need to lock up their assets. Compared to Liquity, which can only lock up ETH, MakerDao allows multiple collaterals and supports centralized stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, TUSD, and tokens such as LINK, YFI, COMP, and Uniswap's LP token.

Liquity regards LUSD as a decentralized stablecoin, with ETH as collateral, to be truly decentralized. On the other hand, USDT is a centralized institution, but the resulting stablecoin produced is still centralized.

MakerDao had also supported only ETH as collateral until March 2020, but the plunge in ETH token price in the same month accelerated MakerDao's decision to support multiple collateral decisions online, opening up USDC to allow DAI to restore liquidity.

Multiple collaterals are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can diversify the protocol risk and adjust the supply and demand of DAI through stablecoins such as USDT. On the other hand, stablecoins with USDT as collateral also have numerous risks, such as being sued by the SEC for having inadequate reserve supervision. At the same time, the rise and fall of other tokens are also highly correlated with ETH.

It is impossible to say whether MakerDao or Liquity is more secure, but in terms of user choice, MakerDao has more diversified options.

**Fee and Minimum Collateral Ratio**

MakerDao receives a stability fee at the time of lending, which varies depending on the asset and different minimum collateral ratios (MCR).

For example, ETH has three pools with MCR from low to high of 130%, 145%, and 170%, corresponding to a stability fee of 5%, 2%, and 0.5%, respectively. Except for some stablecoins and LP Token, which have lower MCR, the pools of other tokens have MCR above 130%. The higher the collateral ratio (CR), will lower the capital utilization ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

[Data source：https:\/\/oasis.app\/](https://preview.redd.it/dqmroxon1xz71.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592cd784e648feb4acadb79700985b9d59747778)

For users at Liquity, the MCR is only 110%, with no increasing borrowing rate over time. While Liquity still has a borrowing fee between 0.5% and 5%, this one-time fee does not increase over time. This feature makes Liquity users more inclined to use their borrowings for the long term and not rush to pay them back, making Liquity's TVL relatively stable. And as users with LUSD will also hold it for a long time, it induces a rise in the supply of the USD-pegged stablecoin.

MakerDao users looking into increasing daily repayable fees must find higher interest rate investment options to cover the stability fees or need to pay back DAI as soon as possible to put the constant interest accrual on the debt on a halt.

**Comparison 2：The Use of Stablecoins**

The stablecoins minted by MakerDao and Liquity through collateral are DAI and LUSD, respectively, and there is a clear difference between the two in terms of usage.

MakerDao supports allowing DAI holders to earn DAI Savings Rate (DSR) on their DAI holdings by depositing them into a savings account. When the DSR rises, it stimulates more holders to deposit DAI, which influences an increase in DAI demand.

MakerDao governs the supply and demand of DAI through stability fees and DSR. Still, these adjustments are based on the judgment of MakerDAO members, and it comes back to the question of whether MakerDao is decentralized enough.

Liquity provides a stability pool for LUSD holders, allowing users to deposit LUSD into the pool to earn collateral ETH and LQTY rewards for others being liquidated. The amount of revenue depends on how many people will be liquidated. The more unstable the market is, the more the price of ETH drops rapidly, increasing the revenue of the stability pool.

&amp;#x200B;

[Liquity’s Core Model    Picture source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/8rbgndxo1xz71.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef2c6972a1ded553210e5d548c05ecab1c2e19f6)

From an external use case perspective, numerous protocols currently support DAI. And over 60% of LUSD holders are always in Liquity's stability pool and do not move outside of Liquity itself. While the percentage of LUSD in Curve, SushiSwap, and OlympusDao is growing, it is still lower in value than DAI.

**Comparison 3：The Token Pattern**

The tokens of MakerDao and Liquity are distributed as MKR and LQTY, with the main differences being their issuance and usage.

In terms of token issuance, there is no fixed amount of MKR supply, and it largely depends on the overall MarkerDao debt situation. In the event of a $5.3 million shortfall in MakerDao's collateral ETH when the global cryptocurrency market crashed in March 2020, MakerDao replenished DAI by issuing and auctioning newly minted MKR, thereby covering the bad debt incurred by burning DAI. Conversely, when the surplus of the protocol exceeds a certain threshold, the MKR will be burnt.

LQTY is not involved in the liquidation, and its supply is only 100 million. It is mainly derived from rewards for depositing LUSD in its stability pool, and users can stake their LQTY to share other users’ borrowing and redemption fees. LQTY is mainly used to motivate users to deposit their lent LUSD in its stability pool to improve the liquidation mechanism, which explains why over 60% of LUSD is still in Liquity's system.

&amp;#x200B;

[Circulating Supply（Since Sep 2021）   Data source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/l1p3fcxp1xz71.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad3c589fc1e62b36db4c29772e9f36913be4defe)

In terms of token usage, MKR is a governance token that uses MKR to vote on protocol parameters (e.g., stability fees, debt caps, MCR) and other essential ecosystem elements (e.g., funding working groups, grantmaking, etc.) However,  early and large investors hold most MKRs, which puts MakerDao in a centralized spiral.

LQTY is not a governance token, and its use case is only to help holders capture revenue, so the difference between the two token prices can be seen by as much as 400 times. The circulating supply of the token LQTY steadily increases until it is fully released, while the circulating supply of MKR will remain largely stable along with the market.

**Comparison 4：The Liquidation Mechanism**

The liquidation mechanism is the core of the stability of any lending system, and there are clear differences between MakerDao's and Liquity's liquidation mechanisms.

MakerDao, which has undergone the ordeal caused by the plunge of ETH in March 2020, has refined its liquidation mechanism by switching from the original English auction model to a Dutch auction with initial asking prices ranging from high to low. 

However, it is still an auction model with a six-hour time limit. MakerDao needs to have enough users holding DAI to participate in the event of liquidation. However, it has already strengthened the regulation of DAI circulation by introducing a stablecoin collateral and issuing MRK.

When a user falls below the MCR, anyone can initiate a liquidation operation on Liquity. The platform rewards the originator with a liquidation reserve of 200 LUSD deposited by the borrower at the time of borrowing plus 0.5% of the liquidated collateral to cover the gas fees. The LUSD used for liquidation comes from Liquity's stability pool, and, in return, holders of the stability pool will receive a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral ETH.

This model is profitable for both the liquidation originator and the liquidators holding LUSD in the stability pool, and liquidation occurs without waiting six hours, which will be executed as soon as the 110% collateral ratio is reached.

Even if significant assets need to be liquidated when the LUSD in the stability pool is depleted, a secondary liquidation mechanism called ""reallocation"" will occur. For a borrower who needs to be liquidated, the system will redistribute the debt and collateral from his Trove to other borrowers’ Troves. At which point, the higher the CR, the more debt and collateral the borrower will receive as additional net gain, even if his CR has been reduced.

In addition, Liquity has set up a *Recovery Mode* to ensure that it has sufficient collateral to cover its risks. When the system’s total collateral rate (TCR) falls below 150%, liquidation of all Troves with less than 150% CR will be liquidated. The *Recovery Mode* is a deterrent to users with low CR, keeping Liquity's TCR currently at around 280%.

**Conclusion**

Footprint's comparison of the differences between the two protocols is summarised in the table below：

[MakerDao VS Liquity   Picture source： Footprint Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/2q4tpc7s1xz71.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fccb2796d95b609207e805b17ad186119bc9cbbf)

Liquity can be said to be standing on the shoulders of giants, setting up mechanisms that target MakerDao's pain points everywhere. But it is not conclusive that Liquity's mechanism can beat MakerDao since both are the product of continuous optimization according to the market at different times. As the earliest stablecoin lending protocol, MakerDao has already established a firm foothold in the market through its first-mover advantage.

MakerDao and DAI still hold a massive advantage over Liquity in terms of size. Recently, MakerDao has also been expanding its use cases, proposing to make DAI a clean money and developing use cases to solve real problems in the real world.

As a front-runner in decentralized stablecoins, MakerDao has been criticized for its involvement in centralization, but its forward-looking and more ambitious strategic perspective is an advantage. However, Liquity will need to continue building a solid foundation in expanding the use cases for LUSD or develop more differentiation in the stablecoin segment, such as its strategy for long-term borrowing.

When is DeFi 2.0 starting on tezos?,https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/qvl8ed/when_is_defi_20_starting_on_tezos/,greeneye44,1,2021-11-17 07:28:25,1,/r/tezos/comments/qvl8ed/when_is_defi_20_starting_on_tezos/,DeFi ,"Tezos is catching up with 5 years of ethereum development (MakerDAO DAI, Uniswap etc) but now we have 6 DEX that all have the same issues of distributing their token to bring liquidity (except quipuswap that has not opened farms yet)  


Finematics did a great video of DeFi 2.0 with protocols such as Tokamak or OlympusDAO.   
I am not an expert and I haven't used them to understand how it improves protocol sustainability (vs users just moving funds to chase the best yield), but it does seem interesting!!

Which protocols actually distributes their fees?,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/qvvfrf/which_protocols_actually_distributes_their_fees/,karthur26,1,2021-11-17 17:20:18,6,/r/defi/comments/qvvfrf/which_protocols_actually_distributes_their_fees/,,"Hi everyone, I'm trying to research into different protocols and which ones actually share their profits with holders?

Here's what I've found, please correct me if I'm representing anything wrong:

* **Ethereum**: fees from the blocks are burned, sometimes more but usually less than the block rewards. https://watchtheburn.com/
* **Uniswap**: 0.3% trading fees in v2 go to the reserves for LPs, and v3 has swap and pool fees, of which none goes to token holders. https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/fees
* **Sushiswap**: 0.3% fee where 0.25% goes to LP and 0.05% goes to a pool that buys SUSHI and gives it to xSUSHI holders (SUSHI stakers) https://help.sushidocs.com/products/sushiswap-exchange https://analytics.sushi.com/bar (they note that xSUSHI holders are getting ~10% APY)
* **Pancakeswap**: 0.25% trading fee, 0.17% of which to LP, 0.03% to treasury, and 0.05% buys CAKE and burned.
* **MakerDao**: they charge a ""stability fee"" ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% APY and then this fee goes to burn MKR tokens https://makerdao.world/en/learn/vaults/stability-fees/
* **Curve Finance**: 0.04% fees on pools, half goes to LP and half goes to veCRV holders (CRV stakers). https://curve.fi/rootfaq


My thesis is that tokens that distribute profits (in the form of buyback or burning) will attract more investors and also long term price sustainability. Burning the tokens would benefit all holders, whereas buy/distribute would only benefit the recipients (ie xSUSHI).  The buy and burn can also be countered by huge mints that cause supply inflation and therefore dilutes the token value.

Overall, this is pretty gloomy imo of tokens that would actually generate meaningful value and distribute.  Any others I should be looking at?"

Tezos  is really looking to be a blockchain to be used rather than a L1 token  to hold. It is also used by the european central bank experiments,  voting platform in some cities, STO (security token offering), NFTs so  could be the backend of mainstream adoption IMO.

The post is specifically about Tezos DeFi It's being built as we speak but we can already identify projects on mainnet like

• app.youves.com/ or kolibri.finance/ similar to makerDAO (input collateral &amp; borrow a algo stablecoin),

• app.crunchy.network/ that is DeFi as a service, everyone can add a farm paying CRUNCH token, also a launchpad

• The DEXs: 5 of them quipuswap.com/, plentydefi.com/, or spicyswap.xyz/#/app are the most famous ones

Now  whats interesting in the analysis, I have compared the Fully Diluted  Market Cap of the top DEX of each chain and normalised it by the L1 FDMC  (since the more money in a blockchain token, the more money invested in  the ecosystem too)

I will be using coinmarketcap data for this

• UNISWAP (25B) and ETH (556B) -&gt; ratio 4.5%

• CAKE (4.5B) and ETH (103B) -&gt; ratio 4.4%

• JOE (1.3B) and AVAX (63B) -&gt; ratio 2.1%

• SRM (72B) and SOL (121B) -&gt; ratio 60% ?!

• SPIRIT (272m) and FTM (8.5B) -&gt; ratio 3%

• QUICK (400m) and MATIC (17.4B) -&gt; ratio 2.3%

Now let's look at tezos.... (no data on CMC since the quipuswap API is not fully operational yet)

• QUIPU (28m) and TEZOS (5.3B) -&gt; ratio 0.49%

•  PLENTY (46m) and TEZOS (5.3B) -&gt; ratio 0.87% See the huge difference  with the other chains! And Plenty offers &gt;100 APR% for single  staking

If  you have insights on why only tezos DeFi would behave this way compared  to other chains, let me know please! Maybe because of the lack of  visibility due to CMC not listing the tokens yet?"

**17th November 2021, Mahe, Victoria, Seychelles — Cardano and Avalanche-powered DeFi ecosystem** [**ADA Finance**](https://adafinance.io/) **has been announced as the winner of the highly anticipated “Best DeFi project of the Year” award at the 2021 AIBC Summit in Malta.**

The win took place on November 16th, in unison with the addition of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who has joined the project as an investor. These big announcements have synchronized perfectly for ADA Finance, with the project’s IDO just one month away in mid-December, 2021.

**Best DeFi Project of the Year**

Cross-Dual-Chain DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has beaten some serious industry contenders to take the highly coveted prize of the “Best DeFi Project of The Year” award at Europe’s premier event for blockchain, AI, and emerging tech, AIBC Summit, Malta.

ADA Finance is the first Cardano-based project to win the award, beating other highly revered projects, including community-focused DeFi token Safemoon, and PoW/DPoS hybrid consensus ABEYFoundation. 

These recent achievements have put the spotlight on ADA Finance, with the project now joining the ranks of the awards previous winners, MakerDAO, and AI-powered DeFi portfolio project SingularityDAO. 

**Roger Ver &amp; Other Big Names Join the Party**

The success of ADA Finance has caught the attention of Bitcoin investor and blockchain advocate Roger Ver. Known widely as “Crypto Jesus”, Ver was an early investor in Bitcoin back in 2011, and the previous CEO of Bitcoin.com.

Known for his past involvement in successful blockchain projects, Ver has invested in Ripple,  (XRP) Kraken, Shapeshift, and Bitpay. More recently Ver has shifted his focus to the DeFi market with a sizable investment in decentralized oracle service provider XFai. 

The project has also landed an A-list Influencer line-up alongside Ver, including YouTube sensation Carl “The Moon” and other notable names Crypto Banter, and MMCrypto. With a star-studded line-up bullish on the already successful project, all focus is now on the platform’s ADAFI token IDO in mid-December.

ADA Finance has chosen to take the innovative route of [releasing its code on a public repository](https://github.com/ADA-Finance/cardano-staking-smart-contract), becoming the first ever project built on Cardano to do so. The code is released under the GNU General Public License. This means that anyone can fork the code, as long as they also make their own staking code public. 

ADA Finance is initiating this movement for the entire Cardano ecosystem, hoping that more projects will follow. This pioneering move speaks to the heart of the Cardano philosophy, and promotes openness and trust across both Cardno and the greater blockchain industry, with trust, fairness and potential for massive growth just some of the resulting benefits. 

In addition, ADA Finance has recently announced an Academy Program with Bitdegree to help create awareness for Cardano blockchain development, and help to foster further involvement from the wider coding community. The program will also help to build a strong, sustainable ecosystem and grow talented, fully certified smart contract developers as Cardano grows as a layer one project. 

With the “Best DeFi Project of the year” award as a springboard, a highly innovative blockchain, Academy Program, industry support, pioneering Cardano philosophy, and upcoming IDO, ADA Finance looks to be a contender for the hottest DeFi project going into 2022, and beyond.

How the fuck are these two things vastly different projects. Feel like a moron but also curious how legally they've not sued eachother into oblivion for very clear confusion on the part of consumers conflating the two. Google and youtube search recommendations pre-fill alot of my questions trying to compare the two but no results come up comparing them, so clearly I'm not the only one. And typing either one in CMC gives the same results. 

Should I sell my DAO and get MKR like I originally wanted? Is anyone here even vested into DAO?

Maker Delegate GFX Labs Would Like Your Vote!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qxhjok/maker_delegate_gfx_labs_would_like_your_vote/,PaperImperium,1,2021-11-19 22:38:08,13,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qxhjok/maker_delegate_gfx_labs_would_like_your_vote/,,"Many of you know me as PaperImperium, one of the original slate of delegates at MakerDAO. I have now transitioned to help build the GFX Labs governance team, which means starting over with a new delegation contract. [I am here to ask for your delegated MKR votes!](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet)

Please feel free to ask any questions in the comments, but here are three common ones to get us started:

**Why did you switch to work for GFX Labs instead of remaining a solo delegate?**  
One of the continuing problems at Maker is that votes are increasingly complex and nuanced. Delegates have consistently not had access to expertise on a number of topics. One of the most glaring is that Maker has no legal expertise in-house to guide delegates. Without any formal legal advice on contentious topics such as the recent vote to integrate Deco Protocol into Maker, delegates were forced to seek out informal opinions from a variety of sources -- former SEC attorneys, crypto-specific counsel intimately familiar with Maker, and general personal attorneys. Being part of GFX Labs ensures that I and my colleagues who cover other protocols for GFX have access to professional legal, economic, and technical expertise to avoid potentially catastrophic mistakes when delegates are left to Google their way to whether something presents legal, economic, or technical risk to Maker. I firmly believe over time most delegates on large protocols will be part of teams that can provision professional resources -- GFX Labs and Gauntlet are likely the first two of many.

**What is your stance on burning?**  
The buy-and-burn mechanic is core to Maker's value proposition. While it is normally good policy to avoid buybacks when a business is in a growth stage, Maker has the unique quality of being able to source capital extremely cheaply without the need for dilution. Because of its unique position of being systemically important to the DeFi ecosystem, Maker does have a responsibility to maintain adequate reserves in the Surplus Buffer to cover at least a year of (rapidly growing) contributor expenses and cover any bad debt that may be liquidated at a loss. However, having at least a small burn ongoing at all times not only offsets the (rapidly growing) obligations to vest MKR alongside (rapidly growing) contributor salary expenses, but it also ensures there is a healthy ecosystem of keepers to sell MKR to burn at reasonable prices. 

**What can you do to add value to Maker?**  
For those unfamiliar with me, I regularly interface with US and international regulators, lawmakers, and traditional finance actors. This includes but is not limited to education efforts with our harshest critics like Senator Warren's advisors, providing industry understanding to regulators such as the CFPB, and negotiating a central role for Maker in financing the government-issued, tokenized bonds.\* With the addition of my personal relationships to the resources and expertise in governance services already in GFX Labs, I fully expect that there is much more value to deliver than passively voting on polls.

\*This agreement is subject to approval by Powell, Legarde, and host central banks. Decision whether or not to green light this program is expected by the end of December 2021.

**I encourage you to delegate a portion of your MKR to GFX Labs' delegate contract to best provide an advocate for a Maker that can grow and flourish for years to come.

MAKERDAO - deposit assets,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qy5bjr/makerdao_deposit_assets/,stavrosioannou,1,2021-11-20 21:11:56,2,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qy5bjr/makerdao_deposit_assets/,," Can someone explain how the below works? 

**'This means that, for the first time in an enterprise of this scale, anyone can deposit assets such as real estate, trade invoices and other tangible assets in a pool to receive funding. These assets are used as collateral for a loan paid in the project’s stablecoin, DAI.'**

I mean what is the process to deposit assets in a pool ? Is this done through NFT's ? How is the value of a real world asset determined?

Is there any video / article referring to this?

"Is there an easy, illustrative guide on MakerDAO?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qzivx4/is_there_an_easy_illustrative_guide_on_makerdao/,Orageux101,1,2021-11-22 18:55:12,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qzivx4/is_there_an_easy_illustrative_guide_on_makerdao/,,"Hey guys,

I have a bunch of questions about MakerDAO that I haven't really had success answering from the docs and was hoping someone here may have made a nicer, more friendly guide.

1) What happens when the value of collateral decreases? Both when it decreases but is still over collateralised (100% &lt; x &lt; 150%) and when it becomes under collateralised (x &lt; 100%)

2) At what point does a Keeper step in and sell the vault to prevent further loss?

3) How does MakerDAO prevent bad actors? Say ETH tanks and the vault is now under collateralised. If the actor never comes back and makes away - what happens?"

A quick question from a beginner: I saw that you need a debt of at least 40000 DAI in your MakerDAO CDP to be able to activate CDP automation in DeFi Saver. 

But what if it pays back some of your DAI to increase your ratio and you go below 40000 DAI? Will you then lose CDP automation?

Thanks for helping me out!"
DeFi: A comprehensive guide to decentralized finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r09uii/defi_a_comprehensive_guide_to_decentralized/,KofiOlut,1,2021-11-23 17:52:21,11,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r09uii/defi_a_comprehensive_guide_to_decentralized/,GENERAL-NEWS,"After Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, a robust industry blossomed, stemming from the asset, its concept and its underlying technology. The crypto and blockchain space boasts different niches in which projects and companies develop solutions for various use cases. 

One such niche is the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which was created as an alternative to traditional financial services. More specifically, DeFi is comprised of smart contracts, which in turn power decentralized applications (DApps) and protocols. Many of the initial DeFi applications were built on Ethereum, and the majority of the ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) remains concentrated there. 

At its core, Bitcoin (BTC) carries qualities touted as pillars of decentralization. DeFi, however, expands on those qualities, adding additional capabilities.

## What is DeFi?

A subcategory within the broader crypto space, DeFi offers many of the services of the mainstream financial world in a fashion controlled by the masses instead of a central entity or entities. 

Lending may have started it all, but DeFi applications now have a number of use cases, giving participants access to saving, investing, trading, market-making and more. Decentralized finance’s ultimate goal is to challenge, and eventually replace, traditional financial services providers. DeFi often harnesses open-source code, giving anyone the opportunity to build on preexisting applications in a permissionless, composable manner. 

“Finance” is easy to understand, but what is “decentralization?” In short, decentralization means that no chief body controls something. To an extent, banks and other financial institutions have power over your funds. These entities can freeze your assets, and you are at the mercy of their hours of operation and cash reserves.

The decentralization aspect of DeFi is not only a dispersal of power but also a dispersal of risk. For example, if a company holds all of its customer data in one spot, a hacker needs only to access that particular site for a vast amount of data. In contrast, storing that data across several locations or removing that single point of failure could improve security.

## DeFi vs. traditional finance

For this comparison, commercial banks will be used as an example. In the traditional world, you may use financial institutions to store your money, borrow capital, earn interest, send transactions, etc. Commercial banks carry a lengthy, proven history of performance. Commercial banks can provide insurance and have security measures in place to ward off and protect against theft. 

On the other hand, such establishments hold and control your assets to a degree. You are limited by banking hours for particular actions, and transactions can be cumbersome, requiring settlement times on the back end. Additionally, commercial banks require specific customer details and identifying documents for participation.

DeFi is a segment that comprises financial products and services that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection and operates without the involvement of banks or any other third-party firms. The decentralized financial market doesn’t sleep, and therefore, transactions take place 24/7 in near real-time, while no intermediary has the power to stop them. You can store your crypto on computers, in hardware wallets and elsewhere, and gain access at any time.

Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies hold these characteristics due to the underlying technology that backs these assets. Thanks to DeFi’s dependence on blockchain technology, transactions are completed faster, cheaper and — in some cases — more securely than they would with human intervention. Decentralized finance seeks to use crypto technologies to solve a plethora of issues that exist in the traditional financial markets.

https://preview.redd.it/ap3mp2umhb181.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b194edf1a1c463e0ffa7101cdab5ac77f0cb51a

Overall, DeFi gives participants the opportunity to access borrowing and lending markets, take long and short positions on cryptocurrencies, earn returns through yield farming, and more. Decentralized finance has the potential to be a game changer for the 2 billion unbanked people in the world, in particular, who don’t have access to traditional financial services for one reason or another. 

DeFi solutions are built on various blockchains, with the ecosystems composed of participants interacting in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion, facilitated via distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, which keep the systems in check. Such results are not bound by geographic borders and do not require identifying documentation for participation. 

The framework for this financial system functions according to programmed rules. Instead of using an intermediary such as a bank to borrow capital, you would send amounts of a specific cryptocurrency to a secure digital location — a smart contract — as collateral for your loan, receiving a different asset in return. Your collateral assets would then sit locked up until you send back the loan amount.

Though you may or may not interact in a straightforward P2P manner when using DeFi solutions, the spirit of the process is P2P, in that third parties are replaced with technology not ruled by a central authority.

## What makes up DeFi?

DeFi boomed in 2020, bringing an influx of projects into the cryptosphere and popularizing a new financial movement. Since Bitcoin essentially holds many DeFi characteristics, no firm start date exists for the inception of the DeFi sector, other than Bitcoin’s launch in 2009. 

Following 2017, however, a number of ecosystems — such as Compound Finance and MakerDAO — gained prevalence, popularizing additional financial capabilities for crypto and DeFi. In 2020, the DeFi niche really took off as additional platforms surfaced, in line with folks harnessing DeFi solutions for strategies such as yield farming.  

### Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) 

DEXs allow users to trade digital assets in a noncustodial way without the need for an intermediary or third-party service provider. Although they comprise only one element of the DeFi sector, DEXs have been a part of the overall crypto industry for years. They offer participants the ability to buy and sell digital currency without creating an account on an exchange. 

DEXs let you hold assets away from a centralized platform while still allowing for trading at will from your wallets via transactions that involve blockchains. Automated market makers, a type of DEX, became prevalent in 2020 and use smart contracts and liquidity pools to facilitate the purchase and sale of crypto assets.

DEXs are typically built on top of distinct blockchains, making their compatibility specific to the technology on which they are developed. DEXs built on Ethereum’s blockchain, for example, facilitate the trading of assets built on Ethereum, such as ERC-20 tokens. 

Using DEXs requires having compatible wallets. In general, self-custody crypto wallets let you control your assets, and some of them are compatible with DEXs. However, this type of asset storage puts more responsibility on you for the security of your funds. Additionally, certain DEXs may have fewer features and higher associated financial fees than centralized exchanges.

DEXs have come a long way in terms of liquidity and accumulating a regular user base, which continues to grow. As DEXs become more scalable — that is, faster and more efficient — their trading volumes are expected to increase even more.

### Aggregators and wallets

Aggregators are the interfaces by which users interact with the DeFi market. In the most basic sense, they are decentralized asset management platforms that automatically move users’ crypto assets between various yield-farming platforms to generate the highest returns.

Wallets are locations for holding and transacting digital assets. Wallets can store multiple different assets, or just a single asset, and can come in an array of forms, including software, hardware and exchange wallets. Self-hosted wallets — wallets for which you manage your own private keys — can be a key component of DeFi, helping facilitate various DeFi platform uses, depending on the wallet. Exchange-based wallets, in contrast, govern your private keys for you, giving you less control, but also less security responsibility.

### Decentralized marketplaces

Decentralized marketplaces represent a core use case for blockchain technology. They put the “peer” in peer-to-peer networks in that they allow users to transact with one another in a trustless way — that is, without the need for an intermediary. The smart contract platform Ethereum is the top blockchain facilitating decentralized marketplaces, but many others exist that allow users to trade or exchange specific assets, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

### Oracles/prediction markets 

Oracles deliver real-world off-chain data to the blockchain via a third-party provider. Oracles have paved the way for the prediction markets on DeFi crypto platforms, where users can place bets on the outcome of an event, ranging from elections to price movements, for which the payouts are made via a smart contract-governed automated process.

### Layer one

Layer one represents the blockchain that the developers choose to build on. It is where the DeFi applications and protocols are deployed. As discussed, Ethereum is the main layer-one solution in decentralized finance, but there are rivals, including Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Tezos, Solana and Cosmos. These solutions will inevitably interact with one another as the DeFi space matures. 

Having DeFi sector solutions run on different blockchains has a number of potential benefits. Blockchains may be forced to improve speed and lower fees, based on the performance of competing blockchains, creating a competitive environment that potentially results in improved functionality. The existence of different layer-one blockchains also leaves more room for development and traffic, instead of everyone trying to pile onto a single layer-one option.

## Use cases 

To help answer the question “What is DeFi?” it helps to explore its use cases. Whether you want to lend or borrow, trade on DEXs, stake your digital assets, or something else — even game — there are new ways to satisfy those needs. Below is a list of some of the key use cases for decentralized finance.

### Lending platforms 

Lending and borrowing have become some of the most popular activities in DeFi. Lending protocols allow users to borrow funds while using their own cryptocurrency as collateral. Decentralized finance has seen massive amounts of capital flow through its ecosystem, with lending solutions commanding billions of dollars in total value locked, or TVL — the amount of capital held locked in any solution at a given time.

### Payments and stablecoins

In order for DeFi to qualify as a financial system, comprising transactions and contracts, there must be a stable unit of account, or asset. Participants must be able to expect that the bottom will not fall out in the value of the asset they are using. This is where stablecoins come in. 

Stablecoins bring stability to the activities that are common in the DeFi market, such as lending and borrowing. Considering that stablecoins are generally pegged to a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar or euro, they don’t exhibit nearly as much volatility as cryptocurrencies and therefore are desirable for commerce and trading.

### Margin and leverage 

The margin and leverage components take the decentralized finance market to the next level, allowing users to borrow cryptocurrencies on margin using other cryptocurrencies as collateral. In addition, smart contracts can be programmed to include leverage to potentially ramp up the user’s returns. The use of these DeFi components also increases the risk exposure for the user, especially considering that the system is based on algorithms and there is no human component if there is a problem.  

## DeFi-native activities 

Liquidity pools are a necessary tool for many decentralized exchanges to facilitate trading. They provide trading liquidity for buyers and sellers, who pay a fee for their transactions. To become part of a pool, liquidity providers can send specific funds to a smart contract and receive pool tokens in return, earning passive profit based on the fees traders pay when they interact with that pool. Pool tokens are the key to getting your deposited funds back.

Sometimes known as liquidity mining, yield farming is another activity in the DeFi space, involving searching for profit via various DeFi projects through participating in liquidity pools. While there are intricacies to yield farming, there is one key reason that market participants are flocking to this phenomenon: It allows you to use your crypto holdings to earn even more crypto.

By yield farming, users lend out their crypto to other users and earn interest that is paid in crypto — usually “governance tokens” that give liquidity providers a say in the operation of the protocol. It is a way for investors to put their crypto to work to enhance returns and is a key innovation in the DeFi market. Yield farming has been dubbed the “Wild West” of DeFi, with market participants hunting down the best strategies that they then often keep close to the vest so as not to tip their hand to other traders and lose the magic.

## DeFi risks?

For all its promise, the decentralized finance space remains a nascent market that is still experiencing some growing pains.

DeFi has yet to reach wide-scale adoption, and in order for it to do so, blockchains must become more scalable. Blockchain infrastructure remains in its early form, much of which is clunky to use for developers and market participants alike. When using some platforms, transactions move at a snail’s pace, and this will continue to be the case until scalability improves, which is the idea behind the development of Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2. Fiat on-ramps to DeFi platforms can also be painfully slow, which threatens to hold back user adoption.

DeFi has grown significantly. Given its youth and innovation, the legal details around DeFi have likely not yet fully materialized. Governments across the globe may aim to fit DeFi into their current regulatory guidelines, or they may construct new laws pertaining to the sector. Conversely, DeFi and its users may already be subject to specific regulations.

In terms of adoption, it is uncertain how exactly things will pan out in the future. One potential outcome might include traditional finance adopting aspects of DeFi while retaining elements of centralization rather than DeFi completely replacing mainstream financial options. Any entirely decentralized solutions, however, may continue to operate outside of mainstream finance."

Cardano and Avalanche-powered DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has been announced as the winner of the highly anticipated “Best DeFi project of the Year” award at the 2021 AIBC Summit in Malta. 

The win took place on November 16, in unison with the addition of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who has joined the project as an investor. These big announcements have synchronized perfectly for ADA Finance, with the project’s IDO just one month away in mid-December, 2021.

Best DeFi project of the year
-----------------------------

Cross-Dual-Chain DeFi ecosystem ADA Finance has beaten some serious industry contenders to take the highly coveted prize of the “Best DeFi Project of The Year” award at Europe’s premier event for blockchain, AI, and emerging tech, AIBC Summit, Malta.

ADA Finance is the first Cardano-based project to win the award, beating other highly revered projects, including community-focused DeFi token Safemoon, and PoW/DPoS hybrid consensus ABEYFoundation. 

These recent achievements have put the spotlight on ADA Finance, with the project now joining the ranks of the awards previous winners, MakerDAO, and AI-powered DeFi portfolio project SingularityDAO. 

Roger Ver and other big names join the party
--------------------------------------------

The success of ADA Finance has caught the attention of Bitcoin investors and blockchain advocate Roger Ver. Known widely as “Crypto Jesus”, Ver was an early investor in Bitcoin back in 2011, and the previous CEO of Bitcoin.com.

Known for his past involvement in successful blockchain projects, Ver has invested in Ripple, (XRP) Kraken, Shapeshift, and Bitpay. More recently Ver has shifted his focus to the DeFi market with a sizable investment in decentralized oracle service provider XFai. 

The project has also landed an A-list Influencer line-up alongside Ver, including YouTube sensation Carl “The Moon” and other notable names Crypto Banter, and MMCrypto. With a star-studded line-up bullish on the already successful project, all focus is now on the platform’s ADAFI token IDO in mid-December. 

First publicly released code on Cardano
---------------------------------------

ADA Finance has chosen to take the innovative route of releasing its code on a public repository, becoming the first-ever project built on Cardano to do so. The code is released under the GNU General Public License. This means that anyone can fork the code, as long as they also make their own staking code public. 

ADA Finance is initiating this movement for the entire Cardano ecosystem, hoping that more projects will follow. This pioneering move speaks to the heart of the Cardano philosophy, and promotes openness and trust across both Cardano and the greater blockchain industry, with trust, fairness, and potential for massive growth just some of the resulting benefits. 

In addition, ADA Finance has recently announced an Academy Program with Bitdegree to help create awareness for Cardano blockchain development, and help to foster further involvement from the wider coding community. The program will also help to build a strong, sustainable ecosystem and grow talented, fully certified smart contract developers as Cardano grows as a layer one project. 

With the “Best DeFi Project of the year” award as a springboard, a highly innovative blockchain, Academy Program, industry support, pioneering Cardano philosophy, and upcoming IDO, ADA Finance looks to be a contender for the hottest DeFi project going into 2022, and beyond.

How do the rewards for wstETH collateralized in MakerDAO work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/LidoFinance/comments/r126y0/how_do_the_rewards_for_wsteth_collateralized_in/,makdagu,1,2021-11-24 18:29:56,3,/r/LidoFinance/comments/r126y0/how_do_the_rewards_for_wsteth_collateralized_in/,,I understand that stETH rebases because of the staking rewards and wstETH is a fixed version so it can be locked up. If wstETH does not rebase then how does one receive the staking rewards when it's locked into a vault?

Can't combine types of collateral?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2e60m/cant_combine_types_of_collateral/,After-Cell,1,2021-11-26 11:52:51,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2e60m/cant_combine_types_of_collateral/,,"Just to confirm, reading this article ([https://decrypt.co/23027/makerdao-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-was-fixed](https://decrypt.co/23027/makerdao-what-went-wrong-and-how-it-was-fixed)), it's only possible to stable DAI by linking either to a particular coin? It's not a basket of currencies? 

I guess diversifying across types of collateral could be emulated by splitting a fund across different coins... but that would raise risk. 

Can anyone confirm this for me?"

Request For Input: Where To Notify Users When Collateral Is Offboarded?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2sjob/request_for_input_where_to_notify_users_when/,PaperImperium,1,2021-11-27 01:38:03,18,/r/MakerDAO/comments/r2sjob/request_for_input_where_to_notify_users_when/,,"Hello, MakerDAO community. Over the last few weeks, quite a few smaller collateral types (AAVE, COMP, BAL, ZRX, LRC, various UNI LP tokens, etc) have been off boarded due to failure to justify their oracle costs.

Unfortunately, I have heard *several times* from vault users who were liquidated without even understanding why. This represents a poor user experience, obviously, and potentially exposes users to unexpected taxable events or even losses if a leveraged position is forcefully liquidated.

While offboarding small, unprofitable, thinly used vault types is still the correct business decision, I support taking every reasonable step to mitigate vault users from being unexpectedly left with unsupported vault smart contracts.

**My question to you: What channels do you use that would alert you to a change like this (aside from the MakerDAO Forum and this subreddit)?** Feel free to include communication channels that are both affiliated and unaffiliated with MakerDAO.

Thank you."

A Dao.

Dao’s are pretty easy to understand.

The Dao is an organizational structure. Everybody within the Dao has a voting right. No centralism, no egoist decision making. If you and your partners decide to set up a Dao, everyone who has the permission can decide how to spend the 500.000€ that the investor gave to you crazy madackers.

Why do I think it is worth talking about DAO´s?  
Corporate structures are deeply embedded in our culture. Different countries have different ways of working. This is normal. But now, we have an international way of decision making. Why is that something new? You could just do a whatsapp group and decide your stuff in there no?

You could, but every decision is in the end simply written in a group. Someone then has to activate whatever was decided on and can still think: Fuckit this is better for me.

Why do I think DAO´s will change corporate structures?

One thing I learned in my life is:  
Synergies are more than Energies.  
We can achieve more together. Value is the most important aspect of an organization. The Value is what a company's success and attractiveness are measured on. AND WE CAN SIMPLY MAXIMIZE VALUE BY MINIMIZING EGOISTIC THINKING.  
Companies are transforming and they are re-structuring/digitalizing nearly all of their processes. The new way to **digitalize and restructure** companies **organizations** will give a huge advantage to the ones that understand how to use DAO´s to maximize the outcome of value in their organization. Just like: MakerDao

This is a content post. If you want a light-weighted post with memes check out this Thread: [https://twitter.com/managingwizard/status/1465071685573480456](https://twitter.com/managingwizard/status/1465071685573480456)

How does a DAO set-up work?

1. And most important: Choose the rules.

A Dao is based on the smart contract it operates. Therefore, you will need to decide on how to vote. What to vote for. What decisions will the DAO take? Investment Clubs can choose if and how much to invest into the new crazy toothbrush project. Most of the investment clubs setting up a Dao would choose shares This means: the people you choose to be part of the DAO will be the people deciding the DAO.

(Smart contracts are used to create automation of processes on the blockchain. This means, they are the way to use the blockchain and its benefits. Basically a smart contract enables the building of apps on the blockchain. Ethereum were the first ones to come up with smart contracts. You can create automated transactions or else/if functions. This is used for insurance for example: Ryskex, a blockchain backed insurance company. More expensive. But 100% safe. A code takes care that in the case something happens - something else that was pre coded will happen. This is what a smart contract is.)

2. Once you set up the rules of the DAO, you will need to enable the people to vote. Whatever it is you decided on to use the DAO for, that is where you need to start getting the people involved. The developers of the First DAO believed they could eliminate human error or manipulation of investor funds by ensuring that the decision making is completely decentralized. And even though this is true, it is only decentralized to the point where people who are part of the decision chain can vote. So how does a vote work?

Benefits of DAOs

Despite potential security concerns, DAOs offer a number of benefits to consumers and users, including:

* Transparency. Users on a DAO can clearly see the code that governs the network as well as any transactions that take place on the blockchain. This provides users with a high level of transparency when compared to a centralized network.
* More efficient organization. Instead of using a central trusted third party to execute operations on the network, DAOs use predefined code and conditions to automatically carry out these contracts. This eliminates many of the costs and security risks that come with relying on a third party.
* An autonomous structure. DAOs offer investors a unique opportunity to submit proposals and ideas for [improving the organization](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/21/02/ac19557809/dao-maker-reinventing-community-through-innovation). Thanks to the autonomous structure of the DAO, any investor can submit a proposal, regardless of their stake in the network. Submitting proposals also costs money, which improves the quality of proposals submitted by ensuring that users making the submission have a stake in their submission.

Of course there also risks to the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

The DAO exposed many risks associated with the structure of these organizations. Some of the largest risks include:

* Security risks. A DAO’s code is clearly visible and difficult to edit once the system is in operation. This makes it easier for hackers to exploit bugs and loopholes in the code, which was one of the factors that contributed to The DAO’s massive hack in 2016.
* Lack of governmental precedence. As a developing technology, there is no government precedence concerning DAO operation, and the legal status of this type of tech is still unclear. This presents future risks to developers hoping to implement a DAO.

Dao´s are a new way of operating and will create great opportunities for companies restructuring/digitalizing in this new Era. What are your thoughts on Dao´s?

Only people who will not trust the idea of sharing decision making will not profit from DAO´s.  
Our organization called Degen-House is looking to restructure as a Dao. Join our Discord if you want to meet researchooooooors and get some info on the Defi-world and DAO´s of course. We are a research center, so only join if you will contribute information and want to grow with us.

I am currently discovering and actually using DeFi (really happy about it). I HODL'd throughout the beginning of the year, mainly BTC and ETH.  


But I am now lending out stablecoins (USDT, USDC, and would love to lend out DAI but need to figure out MakerDao for that), some ETH tokens on AAVE (Matic network). Of course, I see WBTC on Balancer and Yearn with appealing APY/APRs and then I wonder: ""What are the pros and cons of wrapping my BTC and lending that out?"" and after that the question: ""How would I wrap it best and easiest?""  


These are the questions I have and I am hoping Reddit brings users with experience in this matter instead of articles to help me out here.   


Kind regards,

10 Cryptocurrencies Expected to have Top Market Capitalizations in 2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoneyNews/comments/r4wsk8/10_cryptocurrencies_expected_to_have_top_market/,hamzartail123,1,2021-11-29 22:17:39,0,/r/CryptoMoneyNews/comments/r4wsk8/10_cryptocurrencies_expected_to_have_top_market/,,"The market for digital currency (also known as cryptocurrency) is now growing at a rapid pace. When talking about Defi, it is altogether a different arena that has also witnessed huge growth and demand over the years. In early September 2021, Defi pulse reported about US$97.779 billion for its Defi protocols but at the time of writing Defi, protocols are locked in at US$88.4 billion. This article lists the 10 cryptocurrencies that are expected to have a top market capitalization in 2022.

1.Bitcoin

Created in 2009 by someone under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) has become a household name all over the world. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transaction distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Bitcoin promises lower fees than traditional payment methods and is operated by a decentralized system as it’s not backed by a government or any commodity.

2.Ethereum

Ethereum is currently in the second position after Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. ETH also has the great potential to outgrow Bitcoin in the coming years. It is also dominating all financial transactions and payments in all sectors. It is also expected to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022. Most of the investors are looking towards ETH for obtaining good results in the coming days. It is the best cryptocurrency known for empowering thousands of decentralized applications to ensure there is a fairer financial system.

3.Cardano

Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. Some of the investors predict that Cardano has the potential to become the next Bitcoin that deals with smart contracts. It is less harmful to the environment than bitcoin and Ethereum.  Many investors who choose to acquire Cardano in 2022 will do so in the belief that it would overtake Ethereum as the leading blockchain for defi and NFTss. This is one of the top cryptocurrencies expected to have a top market capitalization in 2022.

4.Solana

Solana is one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy to gain from the digital wallets of crypto investors. It is the best cryptocurrency that is known for its effective, censorship-resistant blockchain, and fast for global adoption. It is likely to witness a spike in the coming years. In 2021 Solana piqued the interest of investors. Its token increased by more than 300% in September alone propelling it to the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of just over 56 billion dollars. It is predicted that its price could rise to 46%.

5.BinanceCoin

Binance Coin is used worldwide for discounted trading fees and payments for various services making the transactions seamless. Cryptocurrency investors can likely obtain good benefits from this one of the cryptocurrencies to buy in 2022 that leads in the crypto market. Binance is the world’s number one cryptocurrency platform where Binance Coin is used to pay fees on this exchange platform.

6.Polkadot

Polkadot is commonly known as DOT which is a blockchain network of theParahchain variety. It has several connected blockchains within its functions allowing all to work together. Polkadot is very much similar to Ethereum in allowing the developers to create smart contracts and build apps. And so it becomes the other best cryptocurrency with a high market capitalization in 2022.

7.Aave

Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto. Aave was originally known as ETHLend when it launched in November 2017, but the rebranding toAave happened in September 2018. AAVE provides holders with discounted fees on the platform, and it also serves as a governance token giving owners a say in the future development of the protocol. This is another crypto coin expected to have a top market cap in 2022.

8.Dogecoin

As a meme coin, dogecoin stirred quite a fuss in the market in 2021. The image of the Shiba Inu dog as the DOGE avatar has attracted a lot of investors as it is quite adorable. DOGE has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation and sharing of quality content.

9.Maker

Maker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol respectively a decentralized organization and a software platform, both based on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stable coin. The Maker ecosystem is one of the earliest projects on the decentralized finance (Defi) scene: the industry that seeks to build decentralized financial products on top of smart-contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum.

10.Shiba inu

Shiba Inu (SHIBUSD) is an Ethereum-based altcoin (a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) that features the Shiba Inu—a Japanese breed of hunting dog—as its mascot. Shiba Inu is widely considered to be an alternative to Dogecoin; in fact, proponents of Shiba Inu tout it as ""the Dogecoin killer."""

What is Ethereum? A guide for beginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6v5ts/what_is_ethereum_a_guide_for_beginners/,Ooftmoontime,1,2021-12-02 09:30:09,59,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6v5ts/what_is_ethereum_a_guide_for_beginners/,TECHNOLOGY,"I wanted to create this post as we often get told that BTC and ETH are safe investments. However, I believe that if you put your money into something you should understand the underlying technology behind this asset. This is some research on the Ethereum network and it's native ETH token aimed at giving beginners a primer. I'm uploading this to ascertain my own degree of knowledge so if anyone sees any issues or over-simplifications please let me know! I hope to do this with other popular networks. A lot of this information was gathered from reading various articles on the web. Special mention for the section on Layer 2 scaling solutions - most of this information was gained from watching the Finematics Youtube channel. 

**Ethereum Network** 

* Decentralised, open source blockchain with smart contract functionality 
* Can be through of as 3 layers built on top of each other:

1. Ethereum blockchain layer 
2. Smart contracts which use the programming language Solidity 
   1. For example this could include: Mark and Bob send 5 Eth to Jack, if this occurs then automatically send 2 Eth from Jack to Alice 
   2. Smart contracts may also be leveraged to create new tokens 
   3. An issue with smart contracts is that since the code is visible to all, bugs are obvious and are not quickly fixed. This has been exploited once before in the 2016 attack on DAO 
3. dApps, DeFi, etc. which Ethereum users can interact with 

* It currently runs using a PoW blockchain which is slow and has resulted in high transaction fees – this is currently being remedied with the Ethereum 2.0 update which will transition to a PoS system
* Each node within the Ethereum network communicates with a small number of nodes within the network known as its peers
   * When a node wants to include a new transaction in the blockchain it sends the transaction to its peers and this is then propagated throughout the network 
   * Certain nodes (miners) maintain a list of all new transactions and use them to create new blocks, which are then sent to the network 
   * As the network is non-hierarchical a node can receive competing blocks, which may form competing chains 
   * The network achieves consensus by following the “longest-chain rule” – stating that the chain with the most blocks at any given time is the canonical chain 
* *Ethereum Virtual Machine* = Runtime environment for transactions executed in Ethereum, enabling network Conesus 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hqrncwfg61381.png?width=1921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf43889c635392b552f14bb6b528bee94d873ba

**Ethereum 2.0** 

* This is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network set to be released by \~2022 
* The main purpose is to increase transaction throughput for the network from its current \~15 transactions/second to up to \~10,000/second 
* It aims to achieve this via *SHARDING* – the process of splitting work into multiple blockchains and then having them all share a common PoS blockchain. This means that any malicious tampering with any singular chain which would require tampering with the common consensus from the main chain (too difficult) 
* It will be launched in 3 phases:

1. Phase 0/Beacon Chain = Launched on 1/12/2020 with creation of the Beacon Chain, a PoS blockchain that will act as the central coordination and consensus hub of Eth 2.0 
2. Phase 1/The merge = Merge of the Beacon chain with the current Eth network, transitioning the consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS 
3. Phase 2/Shard chains = Implementation of shard chains with Eth 1.0 set to become one of the shards of Eth 2.0, with a total of 64 blockchains 

&amp;#x200B;

**Gas** 

* This is a unit of account within the EVM which is used in the calculation of a transaction fee (the amount of ETH that must be sent to pay the miner who includes the transaction on the blockchain) 
* The higher the gas price the more incentive the miner has to include the transaction in their block 
* Gas prices are denominated in Gwei (1 Gwei = 10-9 ETH) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Applications** 

* ERC-20 token Standard 
   * This allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain 
   * It utilises smart contracts and provides functionality such as transferring tokens between nodes
   * Fees to send ERC-20 tokens must be paid with Ether 
* NFTs 
* DeFI
   * Offers traditional financial instruments in a decentralised way, free from any one centralised authority 
   * These can be accessed via web-based extensions such as MetaMask, allowing the user to directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain 
   * Examples include MakerDao, Compound, Uniswap 

&amp;#x200B;

**Layer 1 vs Layer 2 scaling** 

* Layer 1 vs Layer 2 Scaling 
   * Layer 1 represents the base consensus layer of the algorithm, and Layer 2 solutions don’t require any changes in the consensus layer, but by anchoring to Layer 1 they leverage its security 
   * Layer 1 of Ethereum can process \~15 transactions/second, layer 2 solutions could expand this to 2000-4000 tx/second 
   * The benefits of layer 2 solutions is that they greatly improve transaction speed and transaction throughout whilst reducing gas fees \\

&amp;#x200B;

* Channels 
   * These allow participants to exchange multiple transactions off-chain whilst submitting only two transactions to the base layer 
   * The most popular type = state channels (and their subtype payment channels) 
   * There are 2 problems with channels - 1) they don’t offer open participation, 2) channels are application-specific and cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts 
   * The main project leveraging state channels on Ethereum is Raiden 

&amp;#x200B;

* Plasma 
   * This is a framework for building scalable applications on Ethereum 
   * It leverages the use of smart contracts and Markle trees to enable the creation of unlimited numbers of child chains (copies of the parent Ethereum blockchain) 
   * This offloading of transactions increases throughput + speed 
   * An issue with this - 1) people have to wait a long time to withdraw their funds from Layer 2, 2\_ cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts 
   * OMG network have their own version of Plasma known as MoreViable Plasma
   * Polygon is another example of a platform using their own version of Plasma 

&amp;#x200B;

* Sidechains 
   * These are Ethereum-compatible, independent blockchains with their own consensus mechanisms and security 
   * Interoperability is possible by using the EVM, meaning that contracts deployed to the Ethereum base layer can be directly deployed to the side chain 
   * An example is xDai 

&amp;#x200B;

* Rollups 
   * These provide scaling by bundling/“rolling up” side chain transactions into a single transactions and generating a cryptographic proof 
   * This proof is known as SNARK (Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) 
   * Only the SNARK is submitted to the base layer 
   * Rollups allow all transaction + execution states to be handled in the maintain, whilst the Ethereal maintain stores the transaction data 
   * 2 types - Zk rollups &amp; Optimistic Rollups 
   * Zk rollups are faster and more efficient, but do not provide an easy way for existing smart contracts to migrate to Layer 2. The 2 major Zk rollups = Loopring + Diversifi 
   * Optimistic Rollups run an EVM-compatible virtual machine (OVM) which facilitates the execution of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum base chain. Major one = Optimism"

**Discussion**

With 20+ years’ experience as [integration specialists](http://spo.de/#service) and a number of high-profile clients under their belts\[1\], [Marten Jung](https://de.linkedin.com/in/martenjung)\[2\] and [Stefan Schmidt](https://de.linkedin.com/in/stefschmidt)\[3\] launched Unibright and its accompanying token. The UBT token was released in early 2018 by Unibright IT GmbH as one of the first fully regulated ICO’s in Germany. The initial idea and [whitepaper](https://unibright.io/download/unibright_whitepaper.pdf)\[4\] revolved around no code templates for common enterprise use cases, such as Multi Party Approval, Batch Tracing, and Asset Lifecycle, through the powerful Unibright Framework and it’s visual workflow creator and management tools. The template approach was seen as a key way to cut business costs and implementation times - *build once, sell many* \- and has led to Unibright being compared to a “[Wordpress for Blockchain](https://twitter.com/Sjaaaakster/status/1247075501723746307?s=20)”\[5\]. The generic word “blockchain” is not incidental. While the Unibright token is erc20, the project is blockchain agnostic. The “no code” visual approach removes the requirement for expert developers and allows anyone to design custom workflows using the Unibright native templates. Perhaps the most underappreciated aspect of the framework is the “Smart Connectors” that connect existing off chain data and enterprise software to the blockchain. Obvious candidates are [SAP](https://store.sap.com/en/product/display-0000059272_live_v1/UB%20Framework)\[6\], [MS Dynamics, Salesforce, Email, Excel, even other blockchains](https://docs.provide.services/framework/)\[7\]. 

The first “product ready” version of the framework was released in [early 2019](https://medium.com/unibrightio/the-unibright-framework-is-product-ready-we-are-leaving-beta-status-4064a8dab280)\[8\], along with a [public demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF2Ex-sePV4)\[9\]\[10\] for anyone to trial and see just how easy it is to use. Work has continued since that initial release, and the focus is now on expanding the utility of the UBT token. UBT recently underwent a “soft” retronym rebrand to “[Universal Business Token](https://docs.provide.services/framework/ubt-token)”\[11\] – a reference to it being the only token a business client would ever need. In 2019 Unibright revealed they were working on a security tokenization template, called ‘[Freequity](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-tokenization-a8562f7ac83e)’\[12\], which includes components for security, token definition, issuance, exchange and liquidity, derivatives, portfolios, big data, custodian services, and integrations with existing software. These components are all available without code, are regulatory compliant, and are implemented with an intuitive, visual approach. 

The Unibright team has authored several [blog posts](https://unibrightio.medium.com/)\[13\], including a [demo of AMM liquidity pools for security tokens](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-defi-freequity-trading-component-demo-4dec674b132c)\[14\]\[15\]\[16\], a video [walkthrough of the Freequity platform](https://medium.com/unibrightio/token-issuing-setting-up-liquidity-pools-simulation-and-trading-with-unibright-freequity-5d451b6cb636) \[17\]\[18\] (with everything from compliance to issuance and trading), [Coinbase Custody](https://medium.com/unibrightio/ubt-confirmed-for-coinbase-custody-deepening-partnership-with-provide-to-enable-the-universal-129b8f0bf75e)\[19\], and most recently, integrating their [Freequity components with Hedera Hashgraph’s “Hedera Token Service” (HTS)](https://hedera.com/blog/unibright-integrates-hedera-token-service-to-scale-asset-tokenization)\[20\]\[21\].

In 2020, Unibright joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, heading the [“EMINENT” Taskforce](https://entethalliance.org/eea-mainnet-working-group-forms-task-force-eminent-ethereum-mainnet-integration-for-enterprises/)\[22\] with Chainlink and Anyblock Analytics. Unibright also joined the [Baseline Protocol as a founding member](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/)\[23\], and member of the [Technical Steering Committee](https://medium.com/unibrightio/baseline-repo-public-unibright-on-the-tsc-baselining-explained-84a3bc4c2e58)\[24\]\[25\], alongside other companies such as AMD, EY, ChainLink, Core Convergence, ConsenSys, Duke University, Envision Blockchain, MakerDAO, Microsoft, Neocova, Splunk, Provide, and W3BCLOUD. Baseline Protocol is an open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to execute secure and private business processes at low cost via a public Mainnet. Through this work on the Baseline Protocol, Unibright has formed close working relationships with a number of other key players. Among the most notable is Provide.services. Marten and Stefan joined the Provide team, and Provide committed to integrating the UBT token as the only payment token for their techstack, effectively merging the two companies. Thereafter, notable client projects commenced, including[ Coke One North America](https://medium.com/unibrightio/baselining-the-north-america-coca-cola-bottling-supply-chain-f87539220269)\[26\], [Fraunhaufer IPK](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-fraunhofer-ipk-collaborate-on-baselining-additive-manufacturing-7469c36143a3)\[27\] and [Between.rs](https://youtu.be/R0OohGiBNGc)\[28\]. The year concluded with Unibright and Provide presenting initial work and use cases for these clients at the [“Baseline-as-a-service Demoday” event](https://provide.services/baseline-as-a-service-demoday)\[29\]\[30\]. During this event,[ CONA expressed praise for the rate of progress](https://youtu.be/C5iFSZh1nfM)\[31\], and that they intended to go live with their solution from Unibright and Provide in early 2021.

The [“Baseline-as-a-Service” product offering is now named “Shuttle”](https://provide.services/news/provide-adds-no-code-workflow-designer-to-shuttle-for-baselining-your-business-processes)\[32\]\[33\], and the first live version is live. Kyle from Provide gave an [update on the CONA project](https://youtu.be/WNK9Nx61-RI) \[34\] and highlight key metrics such as $100m in savings had been made, and $650m of tokenized invoices were predicted for the project over the next 12-18 months. More live demos and clients are set to follow in the coming months, the first which was [ServiceNow](https://youtu.be/nUq8lXVmNOc)\[35\].

One of the most interesting conversations to come out of this work was whether[ Ethereum, or any other existing public mainnet is suitable for enterprise clients](https://youtu.be/s2Quwz7FLd8)\[36\]. In February 2021 the [“Baseledger” whitepaper](https://medium.com/unibrightio/baseledger-the-blockchain-for-baselining-powered-by-ubt-db44d2a02289) was released\[37\]\[38\]\[39\]\[40\] – a blockchain built with one purpose: Baselining! Most importantly, for the UBT token holders, was that Baseledger would use UBT as it’s native token, and also introduce a staking mechanism. Other notable points from the whitepaper included that it will use Tendermint; UBT will remain an ERC20 token, it will have incredibly high TPS, fixed transaction costs, cross-chain utility, with a strong focus on business processes rather than DeFi. For example, CONA could use Baseledger for baselining, but could then release their tokenized invoices on Ethereum, Hedera or Polkadot. Rather uniquely, it will be GDPR compliant. GDPR compliance proved to be one of the more uncomfortable issues for clients interested in baselining, as the compliance officers at large corporations are overcautious of putting data on blockchains. 

Baseledger is one of the biggest topics on 2021 for Unibright and Provide, but not their singular focus. The teams are continuing to onboard real, paying, clients – which is their number one priority!

**Tokenomics**

Unibright’s native token, UBT (ERC20), tokenomics can be split into two parts: UBT is required to participate in the Baseledger network, and UBT is required to access both Unibright’s and Provide’s services.

Unibright launched as in “input” utility token – UBT can be used to pay for various services provided on the platform, for example discounted blockchain consultancy workshops. Additionally, tokens can be locked for usage within the Unibright framework to cover transaction costs. In 2020, Provide also adopted the UBT token as a payment token, and introduced[ “Provide Payments”](https://providepayments.com/)\[41\]. Provide Payments introduced “[Universal Blockchain Token](https://provide.services/ubt-token-model)”\[42\] into the crypto vernacular, reflecting a way for UBT to be used as the base currency for all transaction costs an enterprise blockchain solution may incur. For example, Ethereum and Chainlink may be required to run their solution. The client purchases an amount of UBT each month with Fiat through Provide, which is then used to cover their costs in various other tokens. Hence the client only needs to hold/use UBT, and everything else happens behind the scenes.

With the release of Baseledger, the tokenomics loop is now complete, as UBT acts as both an “Input” and “Output” token. Previously the token model required holders to either use their UBT or hold it. Baseledger now allows all token holders to participate in the Baseledger Network – either as node operators or proxy stakers. Clients that use Baseledger will pay a flat fee per transaction in fiat, which is then converted into UBT on the open markets, and distributed to node operators and proxy stakers through a proof of stake consensus mechanism, as a reward for securing the network. This staking mechanism does not involve the creation of new tokens or inflation.

It is worth noting that the Unibright team does not hold any tokens, nor do they rely on the selling of tokens to remain in operation. Of the 150M tokens created, the team initially held 9m. These tokens have now all been distributed and it can be considered that the token supply is now completely distributed. At present, there are approximately 20,000 UBT wallets listed on Etherscan; the biggest individual wallet holds 1.13% of the supply for example.

UBT is a utility token, and the team works closely with lawyers and regulators to ensure compliance with everything currently being done, or planned for the future. Their ICO was among the first in Germany, which is highly regulated by BaFin, and Unibright also completed a [REG D](https://sec.report/Document/0001741355-18-000001/)\[43\] form for the SEC regarding the ICO. UBT has been listed on both [IDEX for US users](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-idex-ubt-added-to-us-audience-85c26997052f)\[44\] and Coinbase Custody, which gives a strong indication that UBT is compliant with all relevant Regulations. 

**Community and Communication**

Unibright communication and its community are present on Telegram, Twitter, Reddit and Medium - all links can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unibright)\[45\]. Team members of both Provide and Unibright regularly feature on “The Baseline” Youtube show, as well as TSC meetings. The team also speaks at events and takes part in interviews and AMA’s for the community. Good examples of this would be the recent [AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OqiCwd2Vs) \[46\] held with Patrick Lowry, CEO of Cryptology AG, and Rachel Wolfson of Cointelegraph, and then also the two part interview with [Hashoshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IItj47F6cZ4)\[47\] and [Cryptofiend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYqsFn5CVkE)\[48\].

Engagement by the community on twitter is often highlighted as a strength, and all social platforms have seen considerable growth over the last 12-18 months. Community members also have a very active “unofficial” telegram, a community information website, [unitrooper.com](http://www.unitrooper.com/), and also a blog that keeps a record of all the most important things said by the team on telegram.

**Available Audits**

The Unibright token is listed on various exchanges, such as IDEX US, Bittrex Global and Coinbase Custody, all of which have high standards and checking of smart contracts that involve the token. It would therefore be reasonable to assume that these exchanges checked before supporting the UBT token.

The Ultimate Stablecoin of them all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7val3/the_ultimate_stablecoin_of_them_all/,DaddySkates,1,2021-12-03 17:27:13,27,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r7val3/the_ultimate_stablecoin_of_them_all/,ANALYSIS,"# DAI: A Systematically Sustainable Stablecoin

Some who aren't yet familiar with the concept of stablecoins may ask themselves..what exactly that magical coin that is going up even in bear market? I have your attention now right?

Stablecoins are a group of cryptocurrencies where the price is pegged to (usually) a FIAT money such as dollar, yen, euro;  a cryptocurrency, or simply to exchange-traded commodities. These are cryptocurrencies that try to minimize the volatility in crypto market.  Stable coins provides us secure transactions, instant transfers without borders, low fees and quick settlements.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about DAI stablecoin?**

DAI is a stable coin that is issued by MakerDAO. It's an Ethereum-based protocol, which maintains an exact ratio of one-to-one with the USD. DAI as a stable coin is used for lending or borrowing crypto without any need for 3rd party making it a permissionless, transparent system with minimal restrictions.

&amp;#x200B;

**What makes DAI so special when we already have so many stablecoins?**

We have Tether, USDC, PAX, BUSD and others that are already providing all that stablecoins need.

DAI  keeps price in check with advanced smart contract system that is fully automated. If When price of DAI starts going too far from USD, Maker (abbrevated MKR) tokens are burned or created in order to stabilize the price of DAI.

The system manages the price of without the need of 3rd party which could pose as potential fraudulent activity on chain or simply middleman taking its cut. If the system works as intended and DAI keeps the constant value to US dollar, the holders of MAKER coins get benefits because the total supply of MKR is burned and through that the value increases with supply and demand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you just create DAI?**

Not as one would think. DAI isn't printed like FIAT in unlimited quantities but is instead created when a user takes a loan on Maker DAO. When that loan is paid the DAI is burned.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, you convinced me but I need some TLDR PROs because I don't want to read this wall of text!**

Alright. To sum it up why DAI is one of the best stablecoins out there:

* \- The marketing from MakerDAO is starting to really get insane momentum and they are branding the DAI as the worlds first unbiased currency.
* \- DAI doesn't need real US dollar in order to back it. It works on completely different level and unlike Tether it's a much more reliable and secure way to run a stablecoin.
* \- DAI competitors USDT and USDC are controlled by the governing companies, which makes it hard to define such cryptocurrencies as decentralised. DAI is independent.
* \- You can't print DAI like you can print FIAT. Issuing DAI is governed by smart contracts which are immutable. Noone has ability to interfere with DAI.
* \- DAI isn't backed by FIAT but instead it's macked by cryptocurrency.
* \- Interaction between DAI and smartcontracts gives it a good support in DeFi. There are already over 400 DeFi apps that integrated DAI.
* \- Another very important point is that they have a really kickass logo

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And here is a really interesting fact for you... did you know is that DAI actually ""started"" here on Reddit with eDollar? Pretty cool huh?

Recap of ETHLisbon 2021 Interviews by Stephen Tse &amp; Li Jiang,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HarmonyCommunityDAO/comments/r8ttvu/recap_of_ethlisbon_2021_interviews_by_stephen_tse/,HarmonyCommunityDAO,1,2021-12-05 00:57:05,0,/r/u_HarmonyCommunityDAO/comments/r8ttvu/recap_of_ethlisbon_2021_interviews_by_stephen_tse/,,"**Good Morning Harmony Protocol Community,**

*Below is a brief summary of ETHLisbon videos where Our Founder* [***@stse***](https://talk.harmony.one/u/stse) *and COO* [***@lij***](https://talk.harmony.one/u/lij) *interview web 3 developers and builders, to include Chief officers and creatives regarding social, geographic or developmental issues. The intention of this post is to increase awareness of other protocols or products which are solving today’s issues.*

*These are individual clips from the Harmony Protocol Youtube channel during their time at ETHLisbon, please like and subscribe to that channel. Also please share, retweet, upvote and like.*

If you would like to contact the Harmony ONE Community DAO, you can reach us via Harmony Protocol discord server or [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/OneCommunityDAO?s=20) where we host weekly twitter spaces for the Harmony ONE community to speak, ask and learn!

*Much love to the videographer and editor of all videos, great touches with the Lo-fi tunes and sweet graphics during shot transitions!*

Motivation - [To the ONEs who build- A love Letter in Lisbon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT3uvnNhZnE)

**“There’s a revolution happening right NOW, if you WANT to live in a world you LOVE then BUILD IT!”**

**- To start this thread up, an interview with Near Protocol**

[Alex of Near Protocol by Stephen Tse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQNqyEpTY-o)

**Stephen opened up by asking Alex about his start at Near Protocol**

* Near Launched in 2018 - is also a Sharded Chain
* Alex background in database design &amp; architecture - engineering
* Alex mentioned how the database ecosystem is more mature with strong engineers
* Database tech already built and the innovation behind it comes out just once a year, not such a thrilling space to be, people who may like writing papers instead of solving issues may find the space to be suitable
* Alex said AI space was over-hyped, that the blockchain space is healthier and with more ambitious people
* Also stated that the blockchain development sector is heavily unexplored and how bridges in 2019 were awful in stark contrast to today, where they are throughout the blockchain space

**Alex began talking further about DAOs**

* DAO tooling called Sputnik on Near Protocol which if the DAO is focused in or around NFT, music or education it would be easier to onboard and simple to use web wallet
* Integration with payment and invoice systems for the DAOs to pay people
* Alex mentioned he would like the DAOs to be the next wave, although Metaverse seems to be ready to carry the torch as DAOs have so much more to grow
* Problems with today DAOs is lack of self organization and difficult to get participation
* Theres a shortage of tooling for DAOs in order for it to be successful wave such as the summer of Defi, and the recent emergence of NFTs

**Closing comments by Alex - If you are young get involved in cryptography, take on math, ""this is where the money will be""**

**-Next video is Gabriella Chang from Ethic Hub**

[Gabriella interview by Stephen Tse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kykgIye1iaU)

*Gabriella (Chief Success Officer) opened up the conversation going into her background as a developer in Mexico, where she saw first-hand the issues the coffee producers were facing. At that time Gabriella and those with Ethic Hub decided to tackle the issues with the traditional financial system which tends to leave out ¼ of the population which includes small farmers.*

***The solution they came up with was Ethic Hub***

* Although most farmers are organized, due to geographic location there is many that lack financial tools
* Many farmers only have one hectare of land and although most have profitable activity, they still are living within poverty

**Stephen asked “why is this financial instrument important, and it’s not just simple as crowdfunding?” - such as Gofundme**

***Maria responded with the following points***

* Through the platform they provide a transnational decentralized crowd-lending services backed by crowd collateral
* Provides lending to farmers to be able to access resources with the financial instrument having fixed lending rate at 8% APY
* Farmers unite forming an organization through a representative who provides the tools for them to access the resources which Ethic Hub provides
* What the platform plans to do is connect DeFi farmers to traditional farmers
* 50% of total supply locked, the platform is over-collateralized
* 2017 Ethic Hub launched at the exact moment of the bear market, which for everyone in that space especially builders a difficult time, gave the team a strong foundation to build on

*She also mentioned that farmers who live in poverty provide 80% of the total supply of coffee beans*

*Ethnic Hub soon plans to expand throughout other regions within South America and intends to launch a pilot into cacao. It also plans to offer the tools to farmers in Honduras and Brazil.*

***Gabriella finished by saying “Be aware of the technology that is around us which could be utilized to do new things, not the same things faster”.***

**- The following summary is from Harsh Rajat of Ethereum Push Notificiation Service**

[Harsh Sajat interview by Stephen](https://youtu.be/0hAsyfTHBmQ)

*Building communication between blockchains with on and off chain notifications to drive governance participation*

**User Opt-in protocol for notifications to applications such as Gitcoin, Aave, Polygon**

* Any Dapp or smart contract can provide on or off chain notification in a platform-agnostic way
* Notifications can arrive through multiple crypto supported wallets such as Metamask, Trust Wallet including Solana
* Pilot co-lab, with the following- MakerDAO, Uniswap, TrueFi, Alpha Homora, Gitcoin and Aave

***Harsh Sajat mentioned that he believes Harmony will be joining the co-lab program and that Harmony team knows them well***

**Stephen Tse asked about Harsh Sajat background , when Stephen met him Harsh won a hackathon at ETHGlobal 2020 and now is involved with EPNS**

* began as a Web 2 dev back when it was iOS 3, minimal tools available
* Nightmare to program at that time, no middleware, no API
* At that point in time Apple Launched notifications, notifications were coming through email and it was really slow (constantly checking for updates)
* Harsh had really understood the infrastructure with the difficulties he faced by remaining resilient and he persevered

**Stephen mentioned, he is looking forward to the use case tools for DAOs and asked Harsh to go into detail of what could they provide for DAOs**

* Working with Snapshot, Aragon and Boardroom offering alerts to their users
* Notifications transform to video or call to action, which would be similar to WhatsApp or Twitter alert
* People will see the proposal and have a simple yes or no interaction, no need to go to snapshot site to cast vote

*Harsh closed off by saying he knows EPNS will provide an increase in governance and community engagement with these simple tools, there would be no more hoops or hurdles of jumping through wallets to get to a snapshot. Harsh Rajat believes the tools created at EPNS will be friendly enough to onboard users giving them a text like notification so even the newest user can be involved.*

**Harsh Rajat loves Harmony** **📷**

**- Next Manuel Alzuru from DoinGud**

[Interview by Stephen Tse](https://youtu.be/pil5cvwxwDY)

*Manuel started developing as child by porting products from the United States to Venezuela. He went into detail about his time in Venezuela during the civil unrest they had with inflation, and his involvement on the ground led him to trouble, which is what made him move to Spain.*

**The concept of DoinGud is as simple as doing good deeds**

* Creators tokenize assets and stream money to 17 sustainable development goals: climate change or equality while different project tackle those issues
* People can participate in governance and be involved with social causes
* NFT as a social movement, instead of group of people creating value, it just requires ONE person to see the need and value
* ETHBarcelona is upcoming which Manuel feels that the Spanish community will provide a great experience combining tech, art and activism

**Later Stephen mentioned how he would like Harmony to be deeply involved with ETHBarcelona**

*Manuel resides in Spain and Stephen noted how the impact of the Spanish and Latino community is vast throughout the world, Manuel agreed and used Latin music as a reference also the fact that Spanish is the 2nd most spoken language.*

**Stephen asked how we can increase exposure in the Spanish community and how we could help**

*Manuel’s response was not to force people to adopt technology as in El Salvador to its citizens which could be counter intuitive to growing adoption.*

**Manuel final comment when Stephen said he would be a driving force for the Spanish community ""Lets F\*ing GO!""**

**- Lastly interview with Anthony Beaumont from Encode club**

[Interview by Li Jiang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNHLGMZiA4&amp;t=37s)

***Encode is a Web2 to Web3 education community company***

* Hackathons, coding camps, bootcamp accelerators, Encode supported during ETHLisbon
* 100x subscriber increase in a year
* Everyone is hiring, Anthony says and states its both good and bad, but feels certain innovation will continue to grow

*When Anthony mentioned scaling 100x, Li asked if that could actually happen, Anthony responded saying “ believes they can, although the only bottleneck with scaling is that the people are interviewed personally”, roughly just 1/3 are accepted.*

**Li asked Anthony why are people joining now?**

*Anthony mentioned developers have an upside in the market naturally due to Supply and Demand and how having only 6 months experience is about 7% of all experience. Right now there is a fairly low risk opportunity, to the people who are on fence enticed to join he believes crypto has a way to attract people whether by luck or judgement. Anthony stated that the bull market may be the reason for growth of participation, although he personally says anyone joining the space now is unlikely to make short term money.*

**Li asked Anthony how are ideas evolving in the development space between Web2 and Web3 devs**

*Anthony replied that everyone has the same evolution although, the smarter people usually move through the space faster into DeFi and NFT, where the traditional thinker from web 2 would think of bringing an application from Web2 and apply it to crypto such as tracking a supply chain or creating a piggy bank of sort.*

***The Key principal of Encode***

* Makes it easy for Developers to do their job , Encode lays the foundation by making it simple and stress free
* Encode teaches specific blockchain applications
* The best people move fast doing multiple hackathon, hard to keep up with those hackers who excel
* Anthony says for anyone new development to take a leverage bet and get into the space
* Security and gas optimization are the key elements in coding after being taught the basics and that Encode Camp is focused on teaching these things in order to a high quality

**Closing comments by Anthony after being asked what would happen a year from now,**

*He felt skeptical of DAOs since basic infrastructure is lacking and that the current process is inadequate through discord, snapshot and gnosis safe. He states the place of disruption for a hacker would be to build tools in the DAO space. And as for NFT and game developers make the game first then come back to the token.*

**- To start this thread up, an interview with Near Protocol**

[Alex of Near Protocol by Stephen Tse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQNqyEpTY-o)

**Stephen opened up by asking Alex about his start at Near Protocol**

* Near Launched in 2018 - is also a Sharded Chain
* Alex background in database design &amp; architecture - engineering
* Alex mentioned how the database ecosystem is more mature with strong engineers
* Database tech already built and the innovation behind it comes out just once a year, not such a thrilling space to be, people who may like writing papers instead of solving issues may find the space to be suitable
* Alex said AI space was over-hyped, that the blockchain space is healthier and with more ambitious people
* Also stated that the blockchain development sector is heavily unexplored and how bridges in 2019 were awful in stark contrast to today, where they are throughout the blockchain space

**Alex began talking further about DAOs**

* DAO tooling called Sputnik on Near Protocol which if the DAO is focused in or around NFT, music or education it would be easier to onboard and simple to use web wallet
* Integration with payment and invoice systems for the DAOs to pay people
* Alex mentioned he would like the DAOs to be the next wave, although Metaverse seems to be ready to carry the torch as DAOs have so much more to grow
* Problems with today DAOs is lack of self organization and difficult to get participation
* Theres a shortage of tooling for DAOs in order for it to be successful wave such as the summer of Defi, and the recent emergence of NFTs

**Closing comments by Alex - If you are young get involved in cryptography, take on math, ""this is where the money will be""**

**-Next video is Gabriella Chang from Ethic Hub**

[Gabriella interview by Stephen Tse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kykgIye1iaU)

*Gabriella (Chief Success Officer) opened up the conversation going into her background as a developer in Mexico, where she saw first-hand the issues the coffee producers were facing. At that time Gabriella and those with Ethic Hub decided to tackle the issues with the traditional financial system which tends to leave out ¼ of the population which includes small farmers.*

***The solution they came up with was Ethic Hub***

* Although most farmers are organized, due to geographic location there is many that lack financial tools
* Many farmers only have one hectare of land and although most have profitable activity, they still are living within poverty

**Stephen asked “why is this financial instrument important, and it’s not just simple as crowdfunding?” - such as Gofundme**

***Maria responded with the following points***

* Through the platform they provide a transnational decentralized crowd-lending services backed by crowd collateral
* Provides lending to farmers to be able to access resources with the financial instrument having fixed lending rate at 8% APY
* Farmers unite forming an organization through a representative who provides the tools for them to access the resources which Ethic Hub provides
* What the platform plans to do is connect DeFi farmers to traditional farmers
* 50% of total supply locked, the platform is over-collateralized
* 2017 Ethic Hub launched at the exact moment of the bear market, which for everyone in that space especially builders a difficult time, gave the team a strong foundation to build on

*She also mentioned that farmers who live in poverty provide 80% of the total supply of coffee beans*

*Ethnic Hub soon plans to expand throughout other regions within South America and intends to launch a pilot into cacao. It also plans to offer the tools to farmers in Honduras and Brazil.*

***Gabriella finished by saying “Be aware of the technology that is around us which could be utilized to do new things, not the same things faster”.***

**- The following summary is from Harsh Rajat of Ethereum Push Notificiation Service**

[Harsh Sajat interview by Stephen](https://youtu.be/0hAsyfTHBmQ)

*Building communication between blockchains with on and off chain notifications to drive governance participation*

**User Opt-in protocol for notifications to applications such as Gitcoin, Aave, Polygon**

* Any Dapp or smart contract can provide on or off chain notification in a platform-agnostic way
* Notifications can arrive through multiple crypto supported wallets such as Metamask, Trust Wallet including Solana
* Pilot co-lab, with the following- MakerDAO, Uniswap, TrueFi, Alpha Homora, Gitcoin and Aave

***Harsh Sajat mentioned that he believes Harmony will be joining the co-lab program and that Harmony team knows them well***

**Stephen Tse asked about Harsh Sajat background , when Stephen met him Harsh won a hackathon at ETHGlobal 2020 and now is involved with EPNS**

* began as a Web 2 dev back when it was iOS 3, minimal tools available
* Nightmare to program at that time, no middleware, no API
* At that point in time Apple Launched notifications, notifications were coming through email and it was really slow (constantly checking for updates)
* Harsh had really understood the infrastructure with the difficulties he faced by remaining resilient and he persevered

**Stephen mentioned, he is looking forward to the use case tools for DAOs and asked Harsh to go into detail of what could they provide for DAOs**

* Working with Snapshot, Aragon and Boardroom offering alerts to their users
* Notifications transform to video or call to action, which would be similar to WhatsApp or Twitter alert
* People will see the proposal and have a simple yes or no interaction, no need to go to snapshot site to cast vote

*Harsh closed off by saying he knows EPNS will provide an increase in governance and community engagement with these simple tools, there would be no more hoops or hurdles of jumping through wallets to get to a snapshot. Harsh Rajat believes the tools created at EPNS will be friendly enough to onboard users giving them a text like notification so even the newest user can be involved.*

**Harsh Rajat loves Harmony** **📷**

**- Next Manuel Alzuru from DoinGud**

[Interview by Stephen Tse](https://youtu.be/pil5cvwxwDY)

*Manuel started developing as child by porting products from the United States to Venezuela. He went into detail about his time in Venezuela during the civil unrest they had with inflation, and his involvement on the ground led him to trouble, which is what made him move to Spain.*

**The concept of DoinGud is as simple as doing good deeds**

* Creators tokenize assets and stream money to 17 sustainable development goals: climate change or equality while different project tackle those issues
* People can participate in governance and be involved with social causes
* NFT as a social movement, instead of group of people creating value, it just requires ONE person to see the need and value
* ETHBarcelona is upcoming which Manuel feels that the Spanish community will provide a great experience combining tech, art and activism

**Later Stephen mentioned how he would like Harmony to be deeply involved with ETHBarcelona**

*Manuel resides in Spain and Stephen noted how the impact of the Spanish and Latino community is vast throughout the world, Manuel agreed and used Latin music as a reference also the fact that Spanish is the 2nd most spoken language.*

**Stephen asked how we can increase exposure in the Spanish community and how we could help**

*Manuel’s response was not to force people to adopt technology as in El Salvador to its citizens which could be counter intuitive to growing adoption.*

**Manuel final comment when Stephen said he would be a driving force for the Spanish community ""Lets F\*ing GO!""**

**- Lastly interview with Anthony Beaumont from Encode club**

[Interview by Li Jiang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtNHLGMZiA4&amp;t=37s)

***Encode is a Web2 to Web3 education community company***

* Hackathons, coding camps, bootcamp accelerators, Encode supported during ETHLisbon
* 100x subscriber increase in a year
* Everyone is hiring, Anthony says and states its both good and bad, but feels certain innovation will continue to grow

*When Anthony mentioned scaling 100x, Li asked if that could actually happen, Anthony responded saying “ believes they can, although the only bottleneck with scaling is that the people are interviewed personally”, roughly just 1/3 are accepted.*

**Li asked Anthony why are people joining now?**

*Anthony mentioned developers have an upside in the market naturally due to Supply and Demand and how having only 6 months experience is about 7% of all experience. Right now there is a fairly low risk opportunity, to the people who are on fence enticed to join he believes crypto has a way to attract people whether by luck or judgement. Anthony stated that the bull market may be the reason for growth of participation, although he personally says anyone joining the space now is unlikely to make short term money.*

**Li asked Anthony how are ideas evolving in the development space between Web2 and Web3 devs**

*Anthony replied that everyone has the same evolution although, the smarter people usually move through the space faster into DeFi and NFT, where the traditional thinker from web 2 would think of bringing an application from Web2 and apply it to crypto such as tracking a supply chain or creating a piggy bank of sort.*

***The Key principal of Encode***

* Makes it easy for Developers to do their job , Encode lays the foundation by making it simple and stress free
* Encode teaches specific blockchain applications
* The best people move fast doing multiple hackathon, hard to keep up with those hackers who excel
* Anthony says for anyone new development to take a leverage bet and get into the space
* Security and gas optimization are the key elements in coding after being taught the basics and that Encode Camp is focused on teaching these things in order to a high quality

**Closing comments by Anthony after being asked what would happen a year from now,**

*He felt skeptical of DAOs since basic infrastructure is lacking and that the current process is inadequate through discord, snapshot and gnosis safe. He states the place of disruption for a hacker would be to build tools in the DAO space. And as for NFT and game developers make the game first then come back to the token.*

اقتصاد دو توکنی در بازار ارز دیجیتال چیست؟,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Financial-market2021/comments/r9e9tr/اقتصاد_دو_توکنی_در_بازار_ارز_دیجیتال_چیست/,Financial-market2021,1,2021-12-05 20:00:03,0,/r/u_Financial-market2021/comments/r9e9tr/اقتصاد_دو_توکنی_در_بازار_ارز_دیجیتال_چیست/,," 

مدل [**اقتصاد دو توکنی**](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/training/dual-token-economy)، زمانی اتفاق می افتد که یک پروژه بلاک چین، دو توکن صادر می کند که یکی از این توکن ها برای جذب سرمایه به کار می رود و توکن دیگر به عنوان ابزاری است که در پروژه استفاده می شود. ایده اصلی ایجاد توکن ها، برای انطباق با تنظیم کننده ها و تقسیم اکوسیستم پروژه به دو توکن برای قابلیت استفاده بهتر است. در اصل اقتصاد دو توکنی در پروژه های ارز دیجیتال به منظور افزایش کارایی بهتر کاربران ارز دیجیتال فراهم شده است. برای آشنایی با این نوع پروژه ها و روش کار آن ها، تا انتهای مقاله با ما همراه باشید. 

## کاربرد اقتصاد دو توکنی در بازار ارز دیجیتال

📷

در اقتصاد دو توکنی، یکی از دو توکن ها به عنوان برقراری امنیت، جهت افزایش سرمایه گذاری در پروژه کریپتو مورد استفاده قرار می گیرد. توکن این کار را با رعایت دقیق مقررات مشخص شده برای [ارزهای دیجیتال](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency)، انجام می دهد. توکن دیگر در شبکه برای انجام برخی از فعالیت ها مورد استفاده قرار می گیرد که ممکن است برخی از این فعالیت ها از پروژه ای به پروژه دیگر متغیر باشد.

سازمان کمیسیون بورس و اوراق بهادار ایالات متحده، دلیل اصلی ایجاد مدل **اقتصاد دو توکنی** را این می داند، که ترجیح پروژه ارزهای دیجیتال این است که از اقتصاد دو توکنی استفاده کنند. تا کنون، SEC برخلاف اوراق بهادار، سهام یا اوراق قرضه که جایگاه مشخصی در چارچوب SEC دارند، به وضوح دارایی های رمزنگاری شده را طبقه بندی نکرده است.  

با این حال، چارچوب برای تجزیه و تحلیل «قرارداد سرمایه‌گذاری دارایی‌های دیجیتال»، راهی را برای پروژه‌های [بلاک چین](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/blockchain/blockchain) فراهم کرده است تا توکن‌های خود را به عنوان روشی برای برقراری امنیت ثبت کرده و شرایط خاصی را برای آن‌ها تعیین کنند تا مطابق با مقررات کار کنند.

برای اینکه پروژه به عنوان یک بستر امن در نظر گرفته شود، باید مطمئن شد که توکن های آن سود واقعی را به دارندگان آن ارائه می دهند و علاوه بر آن، پروژه نیز کاملاً [غیرمتمرکز](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/expressions/dapp) است. اگر همه این شرایط برآورده شود، این توکن توسط SEC یک توکن امنیتی در نظر گرفته می شود. از دیگر مزایای اتخاذ مدل اقتصاد دوتوکنی، این است که انگیزه های بیشتری را به دارندگان توکن و سرمایه گذاران بالقوه نسبت به پروژه های دیگر در صنعت ارائه می دهد. با دو توکن، یک پروژه رمزنگاری می‌تواند ساختار انگیزشی، ویژگی‌ها، ارتقاء و عملکردهای بهتری را به کاربران نهایی ارائه دهد.

## مزایای مدل اقتصادی دو توکنی 

بارزترین مزیت مدل اقتصاد دو توکنی، انطباق قانونی با مقررات SEC است. با صدور یک توکن امنیتی که حقوق مالکیت روی پلتفرم را تضمین می کند، بنیانگذاران پروژه هر گونه ریسک نظارتی را به حداقل می رسانند. مزیت دیگر، افزایش اعتماد و علاقه به پروژه از سوی سرمایه گذاران محتاط تر است. بسیاری از پروژه های بلاک چین و [ICO](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/training/initial-coin-offering) ها، هنوز در هاله ای از بی ثباتی هستند. صدور توکن های امنیتی منطبق با SEC کلیدی برای ارائه تصویری پایدارتر و مطابق با قوانین است. برای پروژه‌های مدل اقتصادی دو توکنی،  با تکیه بر حفظ نرخ ثابت برای [استیبل کوین](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency/stable-coin) خود، مانند [DAI](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency/dai) در Maker، استفاده از یک توکن تراکنشی دوم که نوسانات پلتفرم را جذب می‌کند، مزیت بزرگ دیگری است.

## معایب مدل اقتصادی دو توکنی 

📷

در حالی که مدل اقتصادی دو توکنی، مزایایی به همراه دارد، چندین معایب بالقوه نیز دارد. اولاً، این مدل ممکن است برای سرمایه‌گذارانی که به مکانیزم‌های بلاک چین یا پلتفرم جدید آشنایی کافی ندارند، گیج‌کننده باشد. از دیگر معایب این مدل اقتصاد دو توکنی، این است که شرایط رشد این دو نوع توکن به گونه ای است که با هم برابر نیست. شرایط کسانی که توکن های امنیتی دارند و کسانی که توکن های کاربردی دارند، اغلب متفاوت هستند، بنابراین اهداف و انگیزه های آنها نیز ممکن است متفاوت باشد.

در سپتامبر 2020، یک مشکل تضاد منافع در [Maker](https://alirezamehrabi.com/crypto/currencies/mkr) رخ داد. پس از اینکه دارندگان DAI حدود 2,500,000 دلار از خزانه های خود در سیستم را از دست دادند، کاربران پلتفرم تصمیم گرفتند در طول رای حکومتی به آنها غرامت نپردازند. از آنجایی که MKR، نه DAI، نشانه حاکمیتی است، تنها دارندگان MKR در نحوه برخورد با وجوه از دست رفته می توانند نظر دهند. 

## آینده پروژه های اقتصاد دو توکنی

اگرچه پروژه‌های دو توکنی، اقلیتی از همه استارت‌آپ‌های جدید بلاک چین را تشکیل می‌دهند، به دلیل افزایش نظارت دولت ایالات متحده بر روی ICO، تعداد پروژه‌ها احتمالاً افزایش می‌یابد. این مدل همچنین برای پروژه های استیبل کوین مناسب است. در حالی که یک توکن ابزاری برای فعال کردن [تراکنش‌های](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/expressions/transaction) رایج استفاده می‌شود و ممکن است بر اساس تقاضای کاربر نوسان داشته باشد، توکن دوم می‌تواند یک استیبل کوین با نرخ ثابت باشد. انتظار می رود پروژه های استیبل کوین با پتانسیل استفاده گسترده تر در پرداخت های دیجیتال، رشد کنند. این همچنین می تواند به معنای افزایش پلتفرم های **اقتصاد دو توکنی** باشد.

## معرفی چند پروژه در اقتصاد دو توکنی 

یک مثال عالی [Axie Infinity](https://alirezamehrabi.com/crypto/game/axs) است، یک پروژه بازی [NFT](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/training/what-is-an-nft-token) بوده که دو توکن، SLP و AXS را ارائه می‌دهد. هر دو توکن به عنوان مشوقی به کاربران برای انجام بازی ارائه می‌شوند. در این مورد، ”Small Love Potion"" یا SLP یک توکن کاربردی با عرضه نامحدود است که می تواند توسط بازیکنان Axie Infinity برای انجام وظایف درون بازی مانند پرداخت هزینه ارتقای Axies (شخصیت های بازی) و خرید استفاده شود. در همین حال، AXS یک توکن حاکمیتی [ERC-20](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/training/erc20) برای جهان Axie با حداکثر عرضه 27 میلیون است. AXS ارزشی را برای اکوسیستم Axie Infinity فراهم می‌کند که در آن بازیکنان می‌توانند توکن را مستقیماً از صرافی‌های رمزنگاری بخرند و دارندگان توکن‌های AXS می‌توانند در فعالیت‌های حاکمیتی درون بازی شرکت کنند و توکن‌های خود را در پلتفرم به اشتراک بگذارند تا پاداش‌های غیرفعال به دست آورند. به غیر از Axie Infinity، بسیاری از پروژه های دیگر مانند VeChainThor، [MakerDAO](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/expressions/makerdao)، Anchor و Filmio بر روی مکانیزم اقتصاد دو توکنی کار می کنند. در ادامه به معرفی روش کار این ارزهای دیجیتال می پردازیم.

## پلتفرم میکردائو، پروژه ای از اقتصاد دو توکنی

📷

استفاده MakerDAO از MKR و DAI احتمالاً شناخته شده ترین نمونه از یک سیستم **اقتصاد دو توکنی** است. فروش توکن MKR در مقایسه با سایر فروش های توکن در طی گسترش ارزهای دیجیتال در سال 2017، نسبتاً بی سر و صدا و زود انجام شد اما توکن برای طراحی سیستم ضروری بود. MakerDAO از MKR به عنوان یک [توکن](https://alirezamehrabi.com/cryptocurrency/expressions/what-is-token) حاکمیتی و مکانیزم ثبات قیمت برای استیبل کوین DAI استفاده کرد. اگر DAI در یک دلار باقی بماند، توکن‌های MKR از بین می‌روند و دارندگان MKR از عرضه MKR کمتری بهره می‌برند. اگر DAI بیش از یک دلار نوسان کند، توکن‌های MKR ایجاد می‌شوند و دارندگان MKR باید با افزایش عرضه MKR مقابله کنند. دارندگان MKR همچنین می توانند در مورد تغییرات پلتفرم مانند معرفی انواع وثیقه های جدید رای دهند.

## پلتفرم انکر

پروژه انکر، نوعی از اقتصاد دو توکنی است که برای ایجاد یک استیبل کوین استفاده می کند. ارزش توکن پایدار آن‌ها به واحد اندازه‌گیری پولی(MMU) وابسته است که به عنوان یک شاخص مالی باثبات عمل می‌کند که رشد بلندمدت اقتصاد جهانی را منعکس می‌کند. برخلاف DAI که از دلار آمریکا به عنوان مبنای خود استفاده می کند، Anchor از MMU به عنوان مبنای خود استفاده می کند. در سیستم Anchor، Anchor Tokens (ANCT) به عنوان ارز اصلی یا استیبل کوین نسخه DAI آنها عمل می کند. Dock Tokens (DOCT) توکن‌هایی هستند که ارز را تثبیت می‌کنند. 

## فیلمیو، پروژه ای از اقتصاد دو توکنی 

فیلمیو، یک پلتفرم برای تامین مالی پروژه های رسانه ای بوده که دارای دو توکن است. توکن‌های FILM، توکن‌های امنیتی هستند که فقط برای سرمایه‌گذاران معتبر در دسترس هستند. دارندگان FILM حق دریافت درآمد حاصل از پروژه های مختلف Filmio را دارند که به روشی مشابه مالکیت سهام در شرکت های خاصی سود سهام پرداخت می کند. توکن‌های FAN توکن‌هایی هستند که به عنوان پاداش برای شرکت در شبکه استفاده می‌شوند. این توکن های کاربردی را می توان برای رای دادن به پروژه ها و تعامل با سایر کاربران در اکوسیستم Filmio استفاده کرد.

## وی چین تور(VechainThor)

📷

[وی چین](https://alirezamehrabi.com/crypto/infrastructure/vet)، نوعی از مدل اقتصاد دو توکنی است که به منظور ایجاد یک اکوسیستم کسب و کار عاری از اعتماد و توزیع شده ایجاد شده است تا روند شفاف تری از اطلاعات و همکاری کارآمد و موثر را ایجاد کند. از طریق این فناوری امکان رهگیری هر کالایی در زنجیره تامین وجود دارد و می توان با استفاده از آن صحت و کیفیت کالا را تایید کرد. این پلتفرم جدید از دو توکن به نام وی چین(VET) و وی تور(VTHO) استفاده می کند. مدل اقتصاد دو توکنی وی چین، مشابه با بلاک چین [نئو](https://alirezamehrabi.com/crypto/infrastructure/neo) است. از توکن وی تور(VTHO)، برای پرداخت هزینه تراکنش ها استفاده می شود. توکن ویچین(VET) نوعی پول هوشمند است که برای انتقال ارزش بین حساب در یک بلاک چین استفاده می شود. میزان کارایی که این توکن دارد، کاملا وابسته به میزان دارایی از توکن ویچین مربوط است. 

## پولکادات(Polkadot)

مدل دیگری از **اقتصاد دو توکنی**، [پولکادات](https://alirezamehrabi.com/crypto/smart-contract-platform/polkadot) است که نسخه بروزتری از این توکن وجود دارد و آن هم، ارز دیجیتال [کوساما](https://alirezamehrabi.com/crypto/infrastructure/ksm) است. از ارز دیجیتال کوساما می توان برای تست اطمینان از ویژگی های جدیدی که بر روی این پلتفرم راه اندازی شود. در واقع با تست ویژگی ها بر روی کوساما، بر روی پولکادات پیاده سازی می شوند. همچنین از این طریق کاربران این امکان را خواهند داشت تا امکانات جدید را بررسی کرده و در صورت تایید به پولکادات انتقال می یابد. کوساما به قناری شبکه پولکادات معروف است و علت آن کارکرد مشابه با قناری هایی است که در معدن کاری استفاده می شوند."

I spent 5 hours researching what a DAO is so you didn’t have to.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ragxwq/i_spent_5_hours_researching_what_a_dao_is_so_you/,Jxntb733,1,2021-12-07 04:31:53,885,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ragxwq/i_spent_5_hours_researching_what_a_dao_is_so_you/,TECHNOLOGY,"**What is a DAO?**  Standing for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a DAO is an internet-native blockchain-derived investor-directed venture capital fund organization managed by all members. At its core they have an objective to provide a decentralized business model for all future enterprises. Mark Cuban called them “the ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism.”

One important aspect is that all code is open-source. This is done with the aim to eliminate human error, manipulation, and third parties, by having an automated crowdsourced process of decision-making. Unlike a company, DAOs have democratized organizations allowing all members to vote for any implemented change. The DA organization is represented by transparent computational rules, secured on the digital ledger across the internet, hardened against forgery by timestamping, and disseminated as a distributed database. The DAO is controlled by the members; no managers or basses are needed. 

&gt;Bitcoin in essence is the first fully functional DAO with programmed rules and functional autonomy through consensual protocol; the miners and nodes signal voting through support.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**DAOs need four things really;**   
&gt;  
&gt;A set of rules,  
&gt;  
&gt;A funding token,  
&gt;  
&gt;Voting right provisions,  
&gt;  
&gt;A clear structure &amp; roadmap

  

|**DAOs**|**A traditional corporation**|
|:-|:-|
|Flat hierarchy.|Hierarchical.|
|Voting required for any changes.  |Changes demanded from sole party, voting   may be offered.|
|Voting outcome implemented automatically.|Tallied internally and outcome handled   manually.|
|Services handled automatically in a decentralized manner. |Human handling, centrally controlled automation, prone to error and manipulation. |
|All activity transparent and public.|Activity private.|

**Creation of a DAO:** 

* Step one; create a smart contract that once launched the rules can only be changed by coded governance system.
* Step two; sources of funding must be determined and governance must be engaged, typically funded via token sale that come with voting rights.
* Step three; deploy smart contract on the blockchain from which point onward stallholders will decide future organization. The dev(s) have no more influence than any other stakeholder.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can I join a DAO?:**  Just invest in their token, and boom, you’ve joined. The smart contract token you just bought establishes the DAO’s rules, most likely you have to stake the token or another in the DAO to get voting rights and influence operations. This is typically done by deciding on and creating governance proposals. The fact that you need to stake to create proposals is to prevent spam proposals, and only (typically) proposals will pass if a majority of stakeholders approve (different percentage majority per DAO; specified in the smart contract).

**What’s the point? Where is the need?**  Are we all not internet native, or soon will be? DAOs are internet-native organizations with technological advantages compared to traditional companies. They have and establish a higher level of trust then say, the classical corporate hierarchy. Only the open source code needs to be trusted which is transparent thus auditable and verifiable at any time. This solves the economic principle-agent-dilemma where there may be a conflict of priorities between a group and those making the decisions for the group. The answer is community governance where incentives are aligned. There are charity DAOs, ones for NFT investments, for funding projects by Black women and non-binary artists, for funding women and non-binary crypto founders, some are exclusive social clubs, and others are for-profit business applications. I’ve even seen freelance DAO networks of contractor.

&gt;**Examples of DAOs:**  Aragon, MakerDAO (MKR), DAOstack, DASH, JennyDAO, Jelurida, SharkDAO, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, Proof Of Humanity, Opolis, BanklessDAO, MolochDAO, 

**Downsides of DAOs:** No organization is perfect, decentralized or autonomous or not. This is extremely new technology that continues to attract criticisms over legality, security, and structural issues. As a DAO can be distributed across multiple jurisdictions, there is no legal framework. One may have heard about ‘The DAO’ crashing, as back in 2016. ‘The DAO’ was launched on Ethereum and raised $150 million in ETH (largest crowdfunding effort at the time) but a few days later developers expressed concern about a bug that would allow malicious actors to drain funds, and while a proposal was set forth to fix it an attacker took $60 million worth of ETH. At the time, 14% of all circulating ETH was invested in ‘The DAO’. Chaos ensued and a hardfork was implemented on ETH. Those who disagreed moved to support an earlier version of the ETH network, which became known as Ethereum Classic, or ETC. Point being if any gaps in the contract framework aren’t closed before launch, it can lead to potential theft and money loss. *There is no such thing as a fully D &amp; A organization.*  Depending on governance, there are only various levels of decentralization. While the network may have independent but equal network actors, the smart contract rules themselves will always be a centralized loss of direct autonomy; architecturally and geographically decentralized yes but logically centralized on the protocol. Upgrading of code is often delegated to experts who understand techno-legal intricacies of code and are therefore a point of centralization.

**Future of DAOs:**  Despite the potential for DAOs to revolutionize the industry, and be a disruptive force to corporate structuring as a whole, they face security and legality issues.  As we all know the SEC claims some blockchain based companies might have made illegal offers of unregistered securities. There is also a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies from new investors, not to mention the technical competence one needs to understand the computational infrastructure and consensus mechanisms within the smart contract to feel good about investing in it. It’s not all bad though, Wyoming just became the first state to recognize DAOs as legal entities. DeepDAO says there are about 181 DAOs, with an ecosystem’s total assets under management (AUM) of $13.4 billion. 

Somewhere, in some business boardroom, people are trying to figure out how to integrate self-driving cars into DAOs of autonomous taxi drivers. You order an Uber and it comes, no company, just code."

What can you do when your government is f*$!ing you up? Form a DAO,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rb8c0m/what_can_you_do_when_your_government_is_fing_you/,a_softy_potato,7,2021-12-08 04:13:38,28,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rb8c0m/what_can_you_do_when_your_government_is_fing_you/,DISCUSSION,"This is still a new concept to many, so hear me out. 

A few years back a failed experiment called ""The DAO"" launched, it basically costed many people a lot of money because of the security breach.

Everything went quiet for a bit, then the new DAOs started popping up with:
. security protocols that are tied to ETH, making them pretty unhackable
. impeccable voting system that can truly make a difference
. unlimited liquidity

As a person living in the shittiest, most corrupt country you can ever imagine, participating in a DAO was literally a life changing experience for me. My vote was on the chain, permanent, without any politician being able to dismiss it or alter it in any way possible.

So what do you do when your government is a piece of shit? Form a DAO, can't form a DAO? participate in the current ones.

MakerDAO, BitDAO, and New Order DAO are some of the best that come to mind. What makes them stand out to me is their willingness to go out and improve what's around them, not just waste time and money to just focus on internal things within the DAO.

Get yourself some juicy governance tokens, participate in a DAO, make some profit for yourself by ensuring you vote on what you see is a great investment for the DAO, while actually improving the world around you. 

Peace out."

# Announcing the Launch of Alpaca’s Auto-Farming Stablecoin — AUSD!

[Huacayachief](https://huacayachief.medium.com/?source=post_page-----7dfff37ea695-----------------------------------)

&amp;#x200B;

  


[Dear alpacas,](https://preview.redd.it/3twfu3svrc481.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc5cd496eff2ca6958f3acdf73944edf241a061b)

Many of you have been waiting for this, and we now have a launch date for AUSD. We’re proud and excited to announce that AUSD will go live on the **14th of December at approximately 10 AM UTC!**

AUSD will unlock even higher profit potential for capital within Alpaca Finance and greatly increase the flexibility and use cases for your funds. There is currently no lending platform or stablecoin that has this level of composability and capital efficiency, which will firmly position Alpaca Finance as a DeFi 2.0 pioneer.

In this article, we’ll go into the details of AUSD’s features, the launch plan, and the various ways you’ll be able to earn more yields with this new stablecoin product.

# 🎁The Benefits of AUSD

AUSD (Alpaca USD) is an **auto-farming stablecoin** that earns passive yields for you in the background. While most platforms that allow you to mint stablecoins force you to borrow while paying interest (MakerDAO, Liquity) or at best borrow while foregoing earning lending APR on your collateral (Venus), Alpaca will allow you to **borrow AUSD while earning yields on your collateral!**

What’s more is AUSD’s mechanics are robust, secure, and transparent. AUSD is **overcollateralized**, **decentralized**, and reinforced with **multi-layered pegging mechanisms** so that it does the one thing stablecoins are supposed to do — remain stable at $1.

AUSD is a fork of the battle-tested MakerDAO, with many improvements. Some of the key features are:

**Farmable Collateral Module:**  
When borrowing stablecoins on other platforms, users typically have to choose between staking their assets to earn yields or staking their assets as collateral to borrow against. With AUSD, you will no longer have to make this tradeoff! Because you will be using [ibTokens](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/tokenomics/ibtokens) as your collateral, you will continue earning lending APR in at Alpaca(10–15% in the case of BUSD, BNB, USDT), as well as Staking APR, which at the moment earns extra ALPACA rewards but can also compose with other protocols. This means that in the future, your collateral will potentially be able to earn additional yields for you on external platforms.

Because the Lending APR alone is much higher than the stability fee for AUSD(2% for most collateral types), the loans are effectively better than interest-free, they are yield-bearing auto-farming loans.

**Efficient Pegging:**  
Being overcollateralized is not enough to maintain a stablecoin peg. In the case of MakerDAO, they can also adjust borrowing interest on DAI up and down for the collateral assets. In a situation where DAI’s price goes above $1, Maker can lower borrowing interest, incentivizing users to mint new DAI which creates selling pressure to bring DAI’s price back down to the $1 peg. In the case where DAI goes below $1, Maker can increase borrowing interest, incentivizing users to buy back DAI to close their borrowing positions because they have become more expensive, which creates buying pressure to bring the price back up to $1. AUSD also has this mechanism.

Moreover, AUSD will have an internal Stable Swap Module, similar to Maker’s Price Stability Module (PSM), which will allow users to buy and sell AUSD for BUSD at a rate of 1:1 with low fees. This will facilitate arbitrageurs in maintaining the peg at $1.

**Robust and Gentle Liquidation:**   
AUSD will use gentle liquidation, meaning if an AUSD borrowing position would face liquidation, only a small portion of the position would be liquidated until it was brought back to health. The max liquidation size will be limited to the Close Factor parameter, currently set to 25% of a position’s Debt Value. This gentle liquidation model results in **lower associated costs and liquidation risk** for AUSD borrowers, while still preventing the risk of bad debt.

AUSD will also use a robust atomic liquidation model. This has advantages over Maker DAO’s Dutch auction model, because AUSD’s model is simpler and better optimized for preventing bad debt.

**Insurance Plan:**  
While we’ve made sure to set up the protocol structure and parameters to be very conservative, we will also have a backstop in place to handle the unlikely event of bad debt. When we launch our governance vault within the next 1–2 months, we will also launch an Insurance Plan. In this plan, in the case of a loss event such as bad debt, 50% of the Protocol APR going to the governance vault will be set aside as remuneration for this event, until the loss is covered. This way, the risk of bad debt will not only be minimized but also have coverage.

[AUSD’s code is completely open sourced and can be reviewed in our Github repository here: https:\/\/github.com\/alpaca-finance\/alpaca-stablecoin](https://preview.redd.it/51l2chjyrc481.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1e533a577e8512040afeec4d8bf05f1870eeff0)

# ⏰Launch Sequence

AUSD will be fully backed by top digital assets such as BNB, BUSD, BTCB, USDT, and TUSD, with robust risk management parameters. Still, to make sure that the launch is as safe as possible for our users, we will first start with only **one collateral pool (ibBUSD)** and **limit the maximum amount of AUSD that can be initially borrowed to 30Mn.** For absolute safety, we will closely monitor the activity, as we add more collateral pools &amp; increase the debt ceiling over the next few weeks.

## Phase I (December 14th)

* AUSD Module
* Farmable Collateral with ALPACA Staking Pools
* ibBUSD Collateral Pool
* Stability Fee Module
* Flash Liquidation
* Staking Pool for AUSD-BUSD LP (ALPACA rewards)

## Phase II (Week of December 27th)

* Stable Swap Module
* Flash Mint Module
* Additional collateral pools

## Phase III (Week of Jan 3rd)

* Additional collateral pools

&gt;*Note: Timeline provided for Phase II &amp; III is tentative and may be subject to change as the rollout progresses*

# 🙋How You Can participate

There are multiple ways you can participate and benefit from AUSD.

[Liquidity Provider:](https://preview.redd.it/0co0uvj0sc481.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc8b15b54c49fc1866c66bc74e2bd2209f0bb64)

We will incentivize AUSD holders as liquidity providers for the AUSD-BUSD pool with ALPACA rewards, targetting a **double-digit APY.** So you’ll be able to easily earn extra yields by providing liquidity in this stablecoin-stablecoin pool on the [Stake page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake).

## AUSD Position Owner:

You’ll be able to easily deposit your ibTokens (or underlying tokens such as BUSD) and borrow AUSD to further your profits by levering up your lending positions.

For example, you could execute the following steps:

1. Deposit BUSD into [Alpaca Finance Lending](https://app.alpacafinance.org/lend) and receive ibBUSD tokens.
2. On the AUSD page, borrow AUSD using your ibBUSD as collateral. A standard LTV with relative safety would be around 85%, meaning you could borrow 85 AUSD for every 100 BUSD collateral (max LTV aka debt ratio is 90% for BUSD)
3. Sell AUSD into BUSD
4. Deposit BUSD back into [Alpaca Finance Lending](https://app.alpacafinance.org/lend) and receive ibBUSD tokens
5. Repeat step 2

You can get up to **\~6x leverage on single-asset BUSD** by cycling through the steps above, earning up to **60% APR** on your BUSD in aggregate, based on the current rate(10%).

## Arbitrageur:

If the price of AUSD temporarily moved below/above $1, you could participate in arbitrage to profit from the price movements. We have modules in place to support and facilitate this arbitrage. More details in our [Docs](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/ausd/ausd-price-stability-module).

# 📃Benefits to ALPACA Holders and Key Parameters

AUSD will introduce multiple new revenue streams for ALPACA holders. These include:

* **Stability Fee: 2% APR** (for most collateral assets) will be the Stability Fee on each AUSD debt position. 50% of these fees will go towards buyback &amp; burn of ALPACA (and Protocol APR for ALPACA depositors once the governance vault is deployed) while the remainder will go towards the development fund.
* **Liquidation Bounty: 5%** (4% (out of 5%) of the liquidation value will go to additional weekly buyback &amp; burn of ALPACA. 1% will go to the liquidator as a reward for closing positions when their Safety Buffers reach 0.)
* **Auto-Farming Performance Fee: 9%** of the rewards earned from farming AUSD positions’ collateralized assets in Alpaca Staking (and external protocol deployment in the future). 5% will go towards the weekly buyback &amp; burn of ALPACA (and Protocol APR for ALPACA depositors once the governance vault is deployed) while the remaining 4% will go towards the development fund.
* **Close Factor:** **25%** (Max percent of the Debt Value of an AUSD position that could be liquidated in a single transaction when the position is subject to liquidation. This reduces the associated costs and liquidation risk for AUSD borrowers, while still preventing the risk of bad debt.)
* **Debt Floor: 500 AUSD** (This is the minimum amount of AUSD that can be borrowed when opening a position.)

## ibBUSD collateral Pool

* Collateral Factor: 90% (max LTV)
* Stability Fee: 2.0%

&gt;*These parameters might be changed from time to time in the future to maintain the health of AUSD’s ecosystem. Please refer to our Docs for the latest values.*

## AUSD-BUSD LP pool rewards

We will initially allocate **0.35 ALPACA/block** (\~70,500 ALPACA /week) as rewards to PCS AUSD-BUSD liquidity providers. You’ll be able to stake your LP tokens on the [Stake Page](https://app.alpacafinance.org/stake) as usual. We will periodically review and adjust the rewards allocation as appropriate.

# 🔐The Safest Transportation Vehicle: An Alpaca

As always, security of all funds within Alpaca Finance is our highest priority. That’s why we’ve made sure all the AUSD smart contracts have **passed three audits** from professional security firms. As a result, you can rest assured, your assets will be safe in AUSD.

PeckShield Audit Report: [here](https://github.com/alpaca-finance/alpaca-stablecoin/blob/main/audits/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Alpaca-USD-v1.0.pdf)

Inspex Audit Report: [here](https://app.inspex.co/library/alpaca-finance#?scope=alpaca-finance-alpacastablecoin)

SlowMist Audit Report: [here](https://github.com/alpaca-finance/alpaca-stablecoin/blob/main/audits/SlowMist_Audit_Report_-_AlpacaStablecoin.pdf)

We know you’re all excited about this new product that can allow you to safely increase your profits. Yet, don’t forget that the initial hard cap on AUSD will be limited to 30Mn, which will be first come first served. So don’t blink and don’t go into a food coma from too eating too much grass, young alpacas.

Just remember this winning game plan:

1. Stay furry
2. Stay conscious
3. Stay profitable

$SPELL in short: Provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto &amp; borrow decentralized stable coin 'magic internet money' $MIM (peg 1$). Collateralize debt &amp; leverage yield positions. #DeFi 3.0 multi-chain protocol. Already $4.9B TVL.

With the protocol of $SPELL you can provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto assets such as cvx3pool, cvxtricrypto2, yvcrvSTETH &amp; more. It's possible to borrow 'magic internet money' $MIM which is a stable coin pegged to 1$ &amp; tradeable, usable like any other coin

$SPELL differentiates itself from other lending projects by offering very low &amp; stable interest rates as well as an 1-click leverage capability. 'Leveraged yielding positions' borrow $MIM, reinvest them automatically, use the invest as collateral &amp; borrow $MIM again.. in loops

$SPELL is always eager to release new supported tokens. Among others, those tokens are supported: $AGLD, $ALCX, $cvx3pool, $cvxrenCRV, $cvxtricrypto2, $FTM, $FTT, $SHIB, $UST, $xSUSHI, $SPELL, $yvcrvIB, $xJOE, $yvcrvSTETH, $yvWETH, $wMEMO (staked $TIME) and $AVAX

Up until now, over 3.7B $MIM were borrowed &amp; are in circulation. Even during recent market dumps, the peg ($1) of $MIM was very strong. On all available chains, liquidity pools with $MIM are set up, often with very high TVLs (e.g. on SpookySwap, Traderjoe, Sushiswap)

Protocol revenues are increasing overall, with $3.5M this week and $2.4M and $5.5M the weeks before. With increasing revenues, rewards for staked $SPELL holders are rising as well.

You can stake $SPELL at [https://abracadabra.money/spell-stake](https://abracadabra.money/spell-stake) on the #Ethereum network (currently approx. 24% APR).

Do not mistake $SPELL for any other ordinary token or #meme. It's a cross chain MakerDao, offers a fully decentralized stablecoin, intertwined with major #DeFi protocols: This is a unique project of an agile team that builds the next key #DeFi 3.0 lego. 1 SPELL is only $0.018"

I think it’s time to do a quick overview of Alpaca Finance’s upcoming stablecoin AUSD…. 

First off, what is AUSD? AUSD is an overcollateralized crypto asset-backed stablecoin. Essentially, It is a fork of MakerDAO with many improvements.   


How will AUSD benefit users on Alpaca? In short, Alpaca users will be able to benefit from greater capital efficiency. 

aUSD will allow lenders on Alpaca Finance to collateralize their deposits to mint what are effectively interest-free loans of AUSD. This will earn them additional lending yields and pay off their loans in the background.

For most lending protocols, users have to choose between staking their assets to earn yields or staking their assets as collateral to borrow against. With AUSD, users will no longer have to make these tradeoffs

This has required a huge amount of work by the team and will be a game-changer for Alpaca Finance users

AUSD will be fully backed by top digital assets such as BNB, BUSD, BTCB, USDT, and TUSD. We will first start with only one collateral pool (ibBUSD) and limit the maximum amount of AUSD that can be initially borrowed to 30MnAUSD will be fully backed by top digital assets such as BNB, BUSD, BTCB, USDT, and TUSD.

Crypto 101: What is a Governance Token?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecentralizedFinance/comments/rdo4l2/crypto_101_what_is_a_governance_token/,economicsdesign,1,2021-12-11 09:25:37,0,/r/DecentralizedFinance/comments/rdo4l2/crypto_101_what_is_a_governance_token/,,"  

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed.

 

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers."
Multicollateral loans?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/rdpsgu/multicollateral_loans/,Delta3Angle,1,2021-12-11 10:52:42,4,/r/CelsiusNetwork/comments/rdpsgu/multicollateral_loans/,,"Back when gas fees were cheap I kept almost all of my assets in a MakerDAO vault. Basically it let me store all of my assets in a safe place, generate a tiny bit of interest, but more importantly take out a line of credit on my assets.

On the consumer side Celsius is a centralized version of this which is why I've been keeping my assets in their custody. Unfortunately it seems we can only take out loans against a single asset so I've had to consolidate my assets in order to retain most of my ability to leverage my assets. I would like to see the ability to take out multicollateral loans in the future, is this something Celsius is considering adding?"

I fucking LOVED CAKE and will always be grateful that it introduced me to DeFi.  
I’ve noticed that a lot of people don’t understand the fundamentals of WHY Cake keeps going down.  
So my goal is to provide my perspective and help some of you become better investors.  I will not be shilling any projects. 

# Why Cake had a Meteoric Rise:

Cake started at $.61 on January 1st and hit an all-time high in April at $42.59. Fucking insane.   
A few things contributed to this:  
Shitcoins such as Safemoon were skyrocketing. And Binance Smart Chain became a go-to platform for them.   
Cake also become the #1 DEX in the world by users. Cake was the alternative for retail investors get into DeFi without the ridiculous ETH fees.   
And PCS had an interesting roadmap. They were going to be an all in one solution for BCS with games, NFT’s, lending, etc. 

The future looked bright for PancakeSwap. 

# Why Cake’s Price Has Tanked since April. 

/1 **Binance Smart Chain is no longer hot.** BSC came at a perfect time. People wanted an alternative to the ridiculous ETH gas fees. Finally people could use BSC and Cake to use DeFi.  
But since earlier this year, we’ve seen the rise of different L1 solutions. AVAX, Harmony One, Solana, and FTM have exploded in usage and popularity. Matic and Layer 2 solutions are keeping ETH in the game for retail investors. 

People don’t like BSC. It has developed a reputation for rug pull central. BSC no longer has a competitive advantage anymore.  

**/2 Cake is Inflationary and Doesn’t have Any Utility.** 

This is the biggest issue. 

PancakeSwap prints Cake. Yes there are “burns” each week, but it’s still inflationary.   
They can’t just stop printing cake. Printing cake is what gives those APY’s. No APY’s means no more stakers. 

Because the price of CAKE has been dropping, staking Cake is a risky proposition. You can get 73% APY, but how much is that worth if Cake’s price keeps dropping?   
So how do we curb inflation?   
You either increase the amount of users to Cake, or you create more use cases for Cake.   
Increasing the amount of users is hard. They’re already the most used DEX in the world. And now you have all the other chains siphoning users.   
PCS has tried creating more use cases. Lottery and predictions are decent, but it’s not enough to stop the inflation monster.   
I honestly believed they had a shot with the NFT marketplace. OpenSeas could use a solid competitor and PCS had the distribution and audience to be a worthy alternative.   
**But there are several problems:**  
They’re not executing fast enough.   
I’ve realized that the PCS team aren’t the best at execution. How many times have predictions and lottery gone down? How long has it taken them to roll out the NFT marketplace?   
The PanCakeSquad NFT collection pissed off a lot of users when bots sniped everything. 

The nail in the coffin is when the NFT marketplace uses BNB instead of Cake. Paying for NFT’s with Cake would’ve given Cake actual value and utility. 

I have seen some people argue that it should be in BNB. Just like how OpenSeas prices everything in ETH. And all the BNB fees are used to buyback Cake. 

I disagree. Keep it simple. If you want utility for Cake, then have NFT’s be priced in Cake.

That’s when I realized…PanCakeSwap exists to serve CZ and the Binance Smart Chain. 

If PCS was an independent entity, then going multichain would’ve been a no brainer months ago. But they can’t do that because they exists to serve the Binance Smart Chain. 

**/3 The Rise of OHM Forks.**   
This is something that people have underestimated.  
People liked staking with Cake because it gave some amazing APY’s. First, the APY have come down drastically. When I first entered, it was around 300% APY which was mind blowing. Now autocake is around 73%.   
Here’s the problem with 73% APY - it looks like nothing compared to 73,000% APY.   
And 73% APY doesn’t look appealing when the Cake price is gone from $20 to $11 in the past two months. It’s risky. 

I’m not here to debate if these ponzis are a good investment or not. But we can’t argue that they are gaining in popularity and grabbing users away from PanCakeSwap. 

In defense of PCS, **ALL** DeFi 1.0 projects are tanking. Look at UniSwap, SushiSwap, MakerDao, etc. People are pouring their money into newer, and more innovative projects.

I don’t see a way for Cake’s value to increase at this point. They **HAVE** to keep printing more cake, but the token itself doesn’t have value. 

I hate that I have to write this post. 

One piece of investment advice: don't be married to your bags. If you want to keep investing in Cake, then great. 

But make sure you're able to articulate why it's still a good investment, and you're not holding on to it because of emotions. Zero-based decision-making means if you had to start your portfolio from scratch today, would you still buy Cake?  
Even though I’m no longer invested in Cake, I hope they prove me wrong. I’m cheering for you guys."

It's The Future of Governance (DAO),https://www.reddit.com/r/DecentralizedFinance/comments/rfvkge/its_the_future_of_governance_dao/,economicsdesign,1,2021-12-14 09:23:24,0,/r/DecentralizedFinance/comments/rfvkge/its_the_future_of_governance_dao/,,"   

We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

The centralised way of decision making and governance is inefficient. DAO is a new way of organisation and making decisions, instead of relying on the central authority. Everyone gets to be part of the decision making process. #equality

# General Conclusion

As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing. One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

# 1. Solution to Decentralised Governance

However, there are many **short-falls to centralised governance**. Inefficient execution, incentive misalignment, smaller voices for the minority.

So what is the solution? **Decentralised** and **autonomy** in decision making, with **automation** in execution by machines, when possible.

That is DAO — decentralised autonomous organisations.

&gt;Note: Whilst we mainly talk about blockchain, DAO can exist on both blockchain and non-blockchain technological stack. It can also work in any digital ecosystem, platform or ledger.

A DAO is mainly a new way of governance and decision making. It could also combine with automated execution via smart contracts.

# 2. Importance of DAO

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can vary — how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*: I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide which autonomous organisation will succeed.

# 3. Economics of DAO

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**: decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this coordination. *Example:* [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**: like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**. It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**.

Highest interest rate on DAI stablecoin? 15 platforms compared!,https://www.reddit.com/r/extracrypto/comments/rg7jrp/highest_interest_rate_on_dai_stablecoin_15/,CookieDelivery,1,2021-12-14 21:31:28,0,/r/extracrypto/comments/rg7jrp/highest_interest_rate_on_dai_stablecoin_15/,,"Want to hold the DAI stablecoin to collect interest? DAI is a decentralized stablecoin issued by MakerDAO. It's backed 1 DAI to 1 USD using crypto as collateral - including other stablecoins like USDC. 

Like with other stablecoins and crypto, you can earn interest on holding DAI on multiple platforms. You'll definitely make more than on any savings account! Also, it's a good way to balance out your crypto portfolio, or to park money in if you take profits on your crypto investments.

I researched 40+ platforms, and was able to find 15 that'll pay interest on USDC. Here's the breakdown of their rates, as of today (December 14, 2021):

Interest rates in APY, with one exception (see notes).

As much as I like DAI, there's clearly less adoption: fewer platforms support it, and the rates are generally lower than the [interest rates for USDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/extracrypto/comments/rfjqjb/highest_usdc_interest_rate_20_platforms_compared/).

Blockchain.com rewards (again) has the highest base rate, which makes it a good choice.

Improving DeFi with the State of the Art,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_iBNBFinance/comments/rijqkf/improving_defi_with_the_state_of_the_art/,iBNBFinance,1,2021-12-17 23:22:48,0,/r/u_iBNBFinance/comments/rijqkf/improving_defi_with_the_state_of_the_art/,,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qnezvrx8e4681.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=017af200f00a2c62f03d2607e5ef4f01941a7877

DeFi has grown into a giant snowball in the past few years rolling down the hill of alternative finance towards the land of traditional finance. With every move it makes, DeFi tends to answer the unanswered questions of CeFi, trying to create a fairer playing field for the average investors.

Common practices like under-collateralized loans, unfair borrowing conditions, institutional investors only (read rich-only) investing slots are becoming a thing of the past as DeFi expands.

Although, there are still problems like liquidity pool hacks, smart contract loopholes, and good ol’ rug pulls in DeFi, having a strong cooperative community across the whole space makes it way easier to overcome these problems and safeguard investors’ funds.

In this article, we’ll have a close look at the state of the art in the DeFi space and where does iBNB Grand fit into this intricately designed world of finance.

**The Beginning Days of DeFi**

Before diving into where DeFi is now, it’s important to know where it all started. To have a better understanding of the speed of development the space is going through.

It all started with the birth of Ethereum, a modified version of the Bitcoin blockchain to host Dapps on top of it. It was at that moment in the history of web3 that a blockchain became more than a really advanced cashbook.

As Ethereum was introduced, ideas of creating a peer-to-peer lending system started popping out. The platform that actually laid the building blocks of DeFi was Maker or MakerDAO.

**Maker DAO — The Concept of DeFi**

The creator of Maker presented a platform where users can come onboard to directly lend and borrow money, eliminating the third party — banks.

However, the problem with a peer-to-peer lending/borrowing system was to find the appropriate person on the other side who is prepared to lend to you on your terms and vice versa.

Let’s say you want to borrow 30 ETH on a 5% interest for 6 months, using the P2P lending model, it’ll be a time-consuming method to match you with someone who agrees on those terms.

As a result, the user-to-contract protocol came into existence replacing the peer-to-peer model of DeFi. In short, liquidity pools came into existence.

A liquidity pool, as you know, is a pool of assets where the money you want to borrow already exists and you can just borrow it against sizeable collateral. Similarly, you can invest in the pool as a liquidity provider (LP), in return for your investment, you’ll earn interests and rewards.

We’ll go into the details of the liquidity pool as the article progresses.

Borrowing from Maker, or any other DeFi platform requires you to over-collateralize the loan to ensure that LPs don’t lose money and the pool remains healthy. In Maker, the borrower has to collateralize 150% of the borrowed amount. For every 100 ETH put in the pool, the person can borrow 66% of its total value in DAI.

\[DAI is the native token for transactions in the Maker ecosystem. It’s soft pegged to the USD backed by the Maker liquidity pool. That means, the value of 1 DAI always remains close to $1.\]

Being backed by a pool of multi-collateral assets makes DAI (one of) the most trusted trustless stable coin.

If the value of the collateralized assets dips lower than 150% of the borrowed amount, Maker automatically liquidates the position of the user to cover the losses and imposes a penalty to discourage such incidents from happening.

If at any point, the value of the currency fluctuates heavily, Maker encourages the borrowers to pay the principal loan amount in DAI and the accrued interest in MKR, the governance token of MakerDAO. Once the DAI gets into the pool, it gets burnt to decrease the supply.

Now coming to the DAO part of MakerDAO, Maker has a DAO in place that makes these decisions through consensus. Anyone holding the MKR token has the right to vote on issues.

These are the primary aspects of MakerDAO and DeFi as a whole, with slightly different rules and regulations.

**AAVE — Flash Loans and Collateral Swap**

AAVE was launched at the time of the ICO-mania of 2017–18 and is on the top 3 of DeFi platforms.

AAVE introduced a few brand new features and improved a couple of existing options in the DeFi space. The most revolutionary and groundbreaking was Flash Loans.

The concept of a Flash Loan is slightly complicated as it consists of multiple technical aspects of the Ethereum blockchain.

A Flash Loan lets a user borrow a massive amount without any collateral. But the user has to repay the amount on the same transaction within the standard Ethereum block time of 13 seconds. That’s where the name Flash Loan comes from.

Basically, you’re taking out a loan, using the money, and then returning it to the lender within a few seconds. So what exactly is happening here?

Given the special requirement of the loan, it can only be used in a few specific scenarios.

1. Arbitrage

2. Collateral Swap

3. Self Liquidation

Arbitrage is the action of exploiting the price difference of an asset in two different exchanges to make a profit. For instance, if the price of BNB is $550.00 at exchange A and $550.50 at exchange B, buying 1 BNB from A and selling at B will result in a $0.5 profit.

If the same action gets repeated with $10 million worth of margin, the profit will be astronomically high. And that’s where a Flash Loan comes into action.

Collateral swap is another useful action that can be performed with Flash Loans. As the name says, it is used to swap collaterals inside the liquidity pool.

Say you have 100 ETH as collateral in the liquidity pool but you want to swap it with BAT tokens. In this case, you’ll have to take out a flash loan of DAI and repay your loan, then swap your ETH for BAT, and then take a put the BAT tokens in the liquidity pool to borrow DAI.

The third action that Flash Loans perform is self-liquidation. This issue arises when your collateralized asset (ETH, for example) loses value and comes close to the minimum valuation limit. At this level, you don’t want to put more of the same asset in the pool, so you take out a DAI flash loan and to repay your borrowed amount and withdraw the ETH. Once you have withdrawn, swap your ETH for DAI to repay the flash loan and keep the rest.

**Compound and cTokens**

Compound is another popular DeFi platform with $5 billion in total value locked. It more or less uses the same system with a few exceptions.

Compound’s most interesting revelation to the world is cTokens. cTokens are used as a token of certification to liquidity providers. Depending on your lending token, the cTokens are assigned directly at a standard exchange rate. For ETH, it will cETH, for DAI, it’ll cDAI, and the exchange rate of cTokens against the actual token depends on the market price.

The exchange rate of DAI to cDAI at the time of writing is 44.95 cDAI.

So if you lend 1000 DAI to the Compound Protocol, the protocol will transfer 44950 cDAI to your wallet. You can redeem your cTokens by withdrawing your actual tokens, or you can redeem a portion of it.

The longer you hold the cTokens, the more it appreciates in value.

Projects like Uniswap, Curve Finance, Bancor are doing great in the space going on an explosive trajectory.

**How iBNB is Improving the DeFi Space.**

iBNB entered the DeFi space with a different mindset. All the things that I mentioned so far speak for the massive progress DeFi has seen from its inception 5 years ago. Although it has done a great job so far, it is still lacking in a few places. The goal of iBNB is to fix these problems with innovative scalable solutions, and iBNB has been doing a pretty impressive job at it.

**Dynamic Transaction Protocol**

The most significant aspect of iBNB is the Dynamic Transaction Protocol (DTP). As the name suggests, it’s a tax protocol that automatically adjusts the transaction fees depending on the health of the liquidity pool to keep the fluctuations low. As per the iBNB whitepaper, “The distribution between liquidity and dividend pool is continuously adjusted in order to maximize rewards while ensuring healthy liquidity.”

For instance, in general, a 10% transaction fee is sent to the dividend pool to be divided between the investors. But in case of low liquidity, the system implements the rejuvenation state. At this state, to mitigate the diminishing condition of the liquidity pool, a percent of the transaction fees gets redirected to the pool. This cycle continues till the liquidity pool gets back in its healthy state.

Also, in times of excess liquidity (&gt;15% of iBNB market capitalization), the excess gets redirected to the dividend pool as additional rewarding factors to investors.

**Anti-Dump Mechanism**

The whole Crypto space including DeFi suffers from pump-and-dump scams resulting in catastrophic price fluctuations in the market. In an attempt to inspire healthy practice, iBNB has deployed an anti-dump mechanism that discourages token holders to sell a large portion of their funds by charging a higher transaction fee.

Within a 24-hour standpoint, if an investor sells more than 0.01% of the total supply sold within that period, an additional 2% fee gets deducted from the transaction. If the sold token amounts to anywhere between 0.01% — 0.029%, the fee goes to 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3fi7d0tie4681.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=182c3c47bd8ae9777a48eda2c0b1c399fb97a9b9

Amount of fees deducted on various degrees of transactions.

**iBNB Bank and Debit Card**

The iBNB Bank is the first DeFi bank that facilitates the management and growth of investors’ finance. It is a central system for receiving, smart distribution, and utility of large volumes of BNBs that is collected from project transaction fees and exchanges.

The bank acts on multiple levels to keep the iBNB ecosystem functioning by allocating funds to different internal projects, clearing dividends to investors, and funding research and development.

The iBNB Debit Card is the resulting subsidiary of the iBNB bank. Like the bank, it’s going to be the first DeFi Debit card that lets investors collect their rewards and spend them directly on activities like shopping, travelling, etc.

Most importantly, the iBNB Bank has the infrastructure in place to continue evolving to the frontiers of DeFi innovation. It means that with collaboration and insights from experts and the community itself, the latest State of the Art DeFi innovations is implemented by the research and development team of iBNB.

**nBNB Partner Projects**

As of today, there is one project as partner on the nBNB Network.

**BabySafeMoon**

BabySafeMoon is a deflationary token with a core tax protocol in place. With every transaction, the tax rate is adjustable and the amount of tax deducted caters to different purposes.

For example, a 15% tax is deducted on a $100 transaction, the $15 will be divided into multiple areas like reflection, development, nBNB bridge, etc.

The Dynamic Transaction Protocol (DTP V2) is also deployed in this scenario to adjust the tax rate. So if the Liquidity Pool is unstable and needs more supply, the tax will get higher automatically. On the other hand, if the LP remains healthy, the tax deduction will remain the same.

**The near Future**

In a special early freebie shared with you here first, the nBNB Network is scheduled to onboard 6 projects in the upcoming time to come. With transaction fees coming into the iBNB Bank, and the iBNB Bank issuing special collectables for iBNB investors to gamify the investment experience with bonuses, the near future is looking very promising for iBNB.

**Conclusion**

As Defi progresses, the idea of the State of the Art will change too, affecting the finance sector in much larger ways. It has taken DeFi less than 5 years to reach a place where investors consider it as a viable investment option with much larger profit margins. So much so that the total value locked in the space has crossed $200 billion.

iBNB promises a better and more integrated future for DeFi by creating a network of projects and infrastructure that has the potential to revolutionize the field. As the pioneer, iBNB is charting the course and as more projects join the nBNB network, newer and better technologies will be implemented to improve the investors’ experience.

Goldcoin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rjo9lc/goldcoin/,IntergalacticCiv,1,2021-12-19 11:56:49,0,/r/ethereum/comments/rjo9lc/goldcoin/,,"With attempts by governments to ""regulate"" fiat-backed stablecoins, it's probably the right time for a clone of DAI that is backed by gold instead of fiat.

Gold is a tangible and physical asset (unlike the dollars in Circle's bank accounts that could be seized/deleted at any time), which makes it easier to build a decentralized stablecoin system backed by it.

The ethereal nature of the dollar - it's just numbers in a database run by a centralized authority - is the most underrated obstacle to building a stablecoin that stays true to crypto principles. To hold dollars in any meaningful amount it is necessary to partner with old-school backs, who have been ""regulated"" so much they're basically quasi-nationalized.

Since gold is relatively permissionless (worse than BTC or ETH, better than fiat), even small-scale gold holders can issue stablecoins with market caps in the low millions. Moreover, this can be done in absolutely any national jurisdiction, unlike dollar-backed stablecoins that require US or US-friendly financial jurisdictions.

Just like MakerDAO, JewelerDAO/&lt;insert name&gt; will evaluate the reliability of different stablecoin issuers and create an index of the best ones, along with all the other monetary policy functions.

(In theory, this can be done with any commodity, but since gold has the highest economic value per unit volume it is the easiest to do on a small-scale by far, which is good for decentralization. Also, there are so many firms around the world that are competent at being custodians of gold, which can't be said for most other commodities)"

Lets dive into Centrifuge project.

&amp;#x200B;

**Project Introduction:**

Centrifuge works like a bridge that brings real-world assets like invoices, real estate, and royalties to DeFi. Borrowers can finance their real-world assets without banks or other intermediaries, and providing liquidity is open to everyone, investors receive a return plus CFG rewards. By opening these doors to small and medium enterprises, which have historically faced financial issues, Centrifuge are enabling them to access financing securely, transparently and efficiently. DeFi is a growing financial system without any barriers of entry. Centrifuge wants to bring this benefit to all borrowers that until now had no access to DeFi liquidity. 

**Key Features And Highlights:**

Centrifuge is built with a two-layer approach: There is the Centrifuge peer-to-peer network for private, secure data exchange. Then there are the contracts deployed on Ethereum that represent business identities, document hashes from our precise proofs, and most importantly the “Business NFTs” to represent documents and make them financeable via MakerDAO, Compound, or others. Centrifuge also launched Tinlake recently, which allows the tokenization and pooling of those NFTs in an easy, standardized way.

**Tinlake:** 

Tinlake is an open, smart-contract based marketplace of asset pools bringing together Asset Originators and Investors which seek to utilize the full potential of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Ultimately, Tinlake will become a fully decentralized financing protocol that interoperates with different blockchains and plugs into a variety of funding sources.

**HOW TINLAKE WORKS:**

Imagine you hold assets, like car loans, trade invoices, or music streaming royalties — legal documents that entitle you to cash at some point. As an “asset originator,” you can use Tinlake to turn these assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with all of the necessary legal documentation attached, create an asset pool (called “securitization” in traditional finance), and then issue two kinds of ERC20 tokens, explains Vogelsang. Centrifuge calls them Tin tokens and Drop tokens.

The process is akin to issuing a “junior tranche” and a “senior tranche” of securities — a common approach in traditional finance. The junior tranche (Tin) is riskier — if losses occur, holders of this token are first in line to cover them — but can pay a higher return. The senior tranche (Drop) is more stable and less risky. 

Asset originators will hold some amount of Tin tokens themselves — to have some “skin in the game,” says Vogelsang. Other Tin investors will probably be sophisticated traders who understand the particular real-world asset class well and want to have leveraged exposure, he says. "
Why Cardano? Ardana’s Blockchain of Choice,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hangrkelbsh/comments/rl8hf8/why_cardano_ardanas_blockchain_of_choice/,Hangrkelbsh,1,2021-12-21 14:42:59,0,/r/u_Hangrkelbsh/comments/rl8hf8/why_cardano_ardanas_blockchain_of_choice/,,"&amp;#x200B;

 Ardana is a stablecoin ecosystem, consisting of a liquidity pool, a DEX (decentralized exchange), and asset-backed stablecoins, built on the Cardano blockchain. The project looks to develop a DeFi ecosystem that can deliver on the promise to give everyone access to DeFi. Cardano’s mainnet saw significant growth recently, with several new projects already launched or in the process of being onboarded on its blockchain.

The team behind Ardana is helping Cardano better prepare its ecosystem and infrastructure to handle free-flowing capital and allow it to easily attract cash flow, continuing towards its goal of a robust and open DeFi ecosystem. After years of development, Cardano has become one of the leading blockchain projects and largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Its focus was centered around real-world applications, but it has since widened this area of focus to include DeFi.

Before we can understand why Ardana has chosen Cardano as its blockchain of choice, let us gain a better understanding of both projects.

### An Introduction to Ardana

Ardana is an asset-backed stablecoin protocol and DEX built on the Cardano blockchain. It offers access to on-chain Cardano-native assets coupled with seamless transactions and swaps between them. The Ardana ecosystem consists of two main products: its stablecoins (comparable to MakerDAO) and Danaswap, a DEX that operates similarly to Curve Finance.

Danaswap enables seamless, high-speed swaps between stablecoins and other assets through multi-asset liquidity pools, in addition to reward-based mechanisms to enable DeFi at its fullest.

### What is Cardano?

Cardano is an open-source, decentralized blockchain project that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions. It uses a layered architecture, facilitates smart contracts, and offers better scalability than competitors, like Ethereum. The platform’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, can be leveraged by users on Cardano to conduct transactions and validate on its Proof of Stake (PoS) network.

The Cardano blockchain is made up of third-generation technology that significantly improves the underlying problems (i.e. scalability, energy consumption) faced by first and second-generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Cardano has all its protocols peer-reviewed, allowing it to easily and quickly tackle any potential issues. On top of this, the project is backed by several organizations, working in tandem with them to develop the platform. The main organizations working on the Cardano blockchain are Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation.

### Why Did Ardana Choose to Build on Cardano?

Since its founding, Cardano has grown in leaps and bounds, becoming one of the leading blockchain projects globally. This rapid growth is easy to see in comparison to its competition, as ADA is currently the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The success of Carcano is easily traced back to its Founder, Ethereum Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson, who identified the need for a scalable blockchain and smart contract solution. Hoskinson teamed up with Jeremy Wood, who shared similar views of the market’s needs.

From that point forward, Cardano was born.

Development began in 2015, with the project focused on building solutions to improve the blockchain. The first public iteration of the project was released in 2017, starting with the Byron phase, followed by Shelly, which introduced staking and better decentralization. The Goguen era saw Cardano add a smart contract ability, enhancing its blockchains’ overall use cases and functionality for dApps (decentralized applications) and protocols.

#### The Technology Behind Cardano

Cardano’s protocols are peer-reviewed before they’re added for use on the platform. The project utilizes two programming languages named Haskell and Plutus. As previously mentioned, rather than using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which consumes a significant amount of electricity to verify transactions, Cardano uses a PoS consensus mechanism. This allows it to utilize significantly less power and fuel a much more sustainable ecosystem.

#### Ouroboros

Cardano’s PoS consensus mechanism is significantly different from that of Bitcoin’s PoW consensus mechanism. BTC requires specialized rigs to solve for the next block, but also lacks any features that could prevent potential monopolies over mining operations.

Ouroboros is Cardano’s PoS mechanism that uses a system of time periods, also known as “epochs.” Each epoch lasts for five days, with each one containing 21,600 smaller units called “slots.” One slot is equal to 20 seconds. Stake pools are assigned randomly to each slot, and slot leaders are selected through a lottery system. To ensure fairness, Cardano selects slot leaders using the following method:

* The user must have a 2% stake in Cardano
* The higher the stake, the better the chances of being selected as a slot leader
* If slot leaders fail to create a block during their slot, they are replaced and must wait until re-election

Ouroboros allows ADA holders to stake their coins in pools that other users operate. Alternatively, token holders can also become stake pool operators themselves. Any rewards generated for adding new blocks to the blockchain are shared between the pool operators and stakers at the end of every epoch.

### Cardano: The Best Fit for Ardana

With Cardano well on the way to creating an ecosystem to address the issues of older blockchains, it’s now focused on developing cheaper, quicker, and more scalable solutions for blockchain-based transactions. According to Ardana’s team, this makes Cardano’s ecosystem perfect for the Ardana protocol.

Cardano is set to become a top ecosystem in the DeFi space, blurring the lines between DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance). The team at Ardana set out to create a DeFi hub on Cardano to enable the protocol to experience the same level of growth seen on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon (Matic). To enhance stability, the team at Ardana also introduced a stablecoin and a stable-asset exchange.

Ardana’s team reached out to Cardano to build the infrastructure required for their project. Cardano also required a significant liquidity floor, along with a suitable stablecoin suite; this was achieved by offering lending through Ardana vaults, which enabled minting for its various stablecoins. Ardana’s team also had the vision to bring foreign exchange to the decentralized world, opening this up to more users. They needed to ensure that the price to swap between different currencies was close enough to the actual price for foreign exchange, though. This led to the creation of Danaswap, a stablecoin DEX built on the protocol.

### Closing Thoughts

Ardana’s DeFi ecosystem has the ability to fully unleash Cardano’s potential, allowing it to become one of the most prominent players in the DeFi space. The benefits are mutual, as Ardana’s association with Cardano means it is backed by one of the largest and most trusted blockchain protocols. Ardana’s ecosystem on Cardano will truly take Cardano’s functionality to a whole new level.

[V2 Protocol](https://preview.redd.it/zc52i9nnd2881.jpg?width=2225&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5adeced0f19976e068f935e76e01ec81237b1e20)

Uniswap has 2 versions (v1 and v2). It is obvious that Uniswap v2 is an upgrade over v1, however, being a decentralized exchange, v1 is still active (V1 and v2 are running at the same time!). We take a detailed look at what benefits does v2 bring in, and why the complete weightage will slowly shift towards v2.

In my previous article on Uniswap, I provided a detailed guide on how to use the Decentralized Exchange. Uniswap brings with it many benefits when compared to other Centralized Exchanges. It has triggered the growth of an entire Ethereum De-Fi ecosystem.

Uniswap V1 was a Proof of Concept. The success of v1 led to the development of v2.

v2 encompasses multiple new features which include:

· ERC20 / ERC20 Pairs ( [Read my reddit on ERC20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gerradfletcher/comments/rpkjqi/what_is_an_erc20_token/) )

· Flash Swaps

· Core/Helper Architecture

· Technical Improvements

· Path to Sustainability

· Testnet and Launch Details

The launch of Uniswap V2 introduces new features and a more resilient oracle system, but like in many other DeFi platforms, liquidity remains an issue. The second iteration of the Ethereum decentralized exchange Uniswap V2 exchange was launched on May 18, which follows a March 23 announcement that placed its launch in Q2 2020.

A blog post written by the Uniswap team details the steps taken to transition to the new platform.

Uniswap V1 will continue to exist as it cannot be shutdown like, for example, the old version of MakerDAO. Nevertheless, the team has set up an interface to migrate liquidity from V1 to V2.

The platform relies on users committing capital in liquidity pools, whose size defines the slippage amount during trades. Bigger size pools can thus accommodate larger trading amounts.

The Uniswap interface was updated for V2, and allows users to choose which version of the platform they wish to use. The interface also lets the user know which platform provides better liquidity and price, with V1 still being a better alternative for Ethereum to Dai trades, as Cointelegraph found out. It is expected that the reverse will be true as liquidity providers migrate to the new platform.

The team has also released an updated statistics platform to see liquidity and volume in real time.

Security improvements and flash swaps

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the new platform has three key improvements to usability and security. It now allows direct token-to-token swaps, which are particularly useful in stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades like USD Coin (USDC) to Dai (DAI). While these were possible before, they used Ether (ETH) as the intermediate step, which meant additional fees and slippage.

Uniswap V2 seeks to be a better price oracle for other decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, as the earlier design was abused in instances like the bZx hack.

It has also introduced a feature named flash swaps, which is similar to the flash loan provided by platforms like dYdX. The users can lend unlimited money from a liquidity pool, but they must return it within the same block, or the transaction is rendered invalid.

The flash loan is mostly useful for performing price arbitrage between different DeFi platforms, though Uniswap’s design can also be used to quickly enter leveraged positions on platforms like Maker or Compound.

The price of decentralization

Unlike some other decentralized exchanges, Uniswap’s liquidity pool model does not require finding counterparties for a trade, which can allow higher trading volumes compared to order book-based exchanges. Nevertheless, using Uniswap can get expensive.

The current liquidity provider fee amounts to the equivalent of $1.27 for a trade of 1 ETH into 211 DAI — approximately 0.6%.

Furthermore, the platform suffers from significant bid/ask spread. As of press time, buying ETH requires an estimated 213.3 DAI, while selling it only nets 211 DAI — a higher loss than just the trading fee. Buying and immediately selling 1 ETH would thus net a loss of more than 1%.

These are estimates, as the price can slip even more — especially for larger trades. While the majority of these problems are a result of low liquidity at launch, Uniswap V1 and even other exchange platforms like Kyber also suffer from similar spread issues.

The 1inch.exchange platform, which announced the support of Uniswap V2 as it launched, uses smart contracts to split a trade between multiple exchanges. This can help reduce the overall trading losses when entering the DeFi ecosystem."
The rise of the DAOs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpl41b/the_rise_of_the_daos/,aelaos1,1,2021-12-27 19:00:59,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpl41b/the_rise_of_the_daos/,ANALYSIS,"  

There are a lot of hypes in crypto world right now, NFTs and Metaverses and Gaming being the top dogs. I wan to talk about something else here that is overlooked for now but will rise hard I predict in the upcoming year. The DAO.

#### History

The first DAO was called The DAO and ended miserably. It was hacked (probably from an insider) due to a bug and it started the most contentious and divisive spat in crypto. The hard fork of 2016 where ETC was born. You can read more about this incident [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-response-to-the-dao-hack). But the thing is that the idea was exciting and many people rushed. Apparently it was early. Not that hacks are infrequent right now but still there is more knowledge and expertise on the subject. Vitalik found DAOs to be one of the first and most important uses of the blockchain (and I humbly agree). Now what \*is\* a DAO?

#### What is a DAO

I like the Feynman way that said you should describe everything as you were talking to a single child (the famous ELI5 acronym) and I will try to do that.

&gt;A DAO is a group of people that want to do something and instead of court and laws they use software to govern their endeavour. 

Quite simple isn't it? It can be companies running for profit, investment funds that onboard everyone that send money to the smart contract, it can be non-profit NGOs that want transparency and it can be even silly stuff like K-POP fans that want to vote on the next event date. In one word: groups. The DAO and the underlying technology (blockchain) facilitates all.

#### Interesting projects

There are not many plays in this field. That makes me excited because there can be clear winners. I will be talking only about platforms to build DAOs and not specific DAOs you can join because they will be infinite and each idea will come and go but the technology will stay.

[**Aragon** ](https://aragon.org/)is one of the oldest projects on **Ethereum**. It's a platform to build DAOs and the team is from Spain (obviously with this name!). It's the most mature platform right now and it will enable many communities to form and manage everything from where the funds go to voting to governance using it. L1 transactions are expensive as we know so it needs to be in L2. If they don't accomplish a smooth transition it will be hard to be the winner.

[**Metis**](https://www.metis.io/) is building a Layer 2 on top of Ethereum using rollup technology (the latest and coolest of all) to facilitate the use of DAOs and DACs as they call them (c is for company). Interesting project that just launched.

[**DAOstack** ](https://daostack.io/)is an operating system for DAOs. It's open source and openly governed (no central team) and it is more community focused. It's based on xDai(see below). The market cap of this one is really low for now.

[**STAKE (xDai)**](https://www.staketoken.net/)  is an [Ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) sidechain but uses a different consensus algorithm: Proof of Stake ([PoS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) and Proof of Stake DAO (POSDAO).xDAI is a Layer 2 scaling solution and is compatible with Ethereum. It is designed to be more efficient than Ethereum, with higher transaction throughput (70 transactions/second) and has a much lower transaction fee.

#### Why now?

Here in Loft Financial we have correctly predicted both the rise of NFTs and the rise of the Metaverse (proven by our articles and their dates). This is the new theme for the next year. Why? Because we monitor the news and the important people and the trends. NFTs blew up when Silicon Valley entrepreneurs started talking about them. Now they are talking about DAOs on their Twitter. They are usually early. It's their job, they are VCs and visionaries. Also another project blew up that showed the world what a DAO can do (crazy things!). It was called the [Constitution DAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/). Check it out. Although it failed in its objective it was a milestone much like when the first Crypto Punk NFT was sold for a crazy price and woke everyone up.

With that said, some of the tasks (for example number 4) are pretty tough for me to even begin with, as from what I understand Uniswap V3 offers much better capital efficiency than V2 from the get-go, so I'm not sure what type of model would make it so that V2 would allow for a higher capital efficiency.

Anyway, I'm sharing the tasks below, and any help is appreciated.

campaign?

as possible in your explanation and definitions.

**Task 4**

**At present, encrypted assets are attacking the real world at the speed of light, aiming to complete the seamless connection between the virtual world and the real world.** **The rapid explosion of DeFi and NFT is undoubtedly empowering the encryption world, so that the traditional fields can more intuitively feel the power of the encryption world.** **At this point in time, whoever can take the lead in the increasingly fierce competition between DeFi and NFT, and gain a firm foothold will be the first to find the right outlet and gain a firm foothold.**

**And Binance, which has always been regarded as the ""head force"" in the exchange industry, naturally will not miss the opportunity, and it has also launched the Binance smart chain BSC, aiming to grab the market share of DeFi and NFT more quickly. .** **So, can the smart chain BSC become the breakthrough place for Binance in the BSC field?** **Today, World Chain Investment Research will do a comprehensive analysis for you on this issue.**

***What is the smart chain BSC?***

To understand ""BSC"", you need to know what ""BC"" is. **BC is the abbreviation of Binance Chain, also known as Binance Chain.** Binance Chain was launched in April 2019 and is the first public chain in the Binance Double Public Chain Project. In addition to the basic functions of token issuance, usage and exchange, Binance Chain also has high throughput, low latency and other features. These core advantages can be comparable to centralized systems, and are even better than Binance Dex (Binance Dex) Provide sufficient guarantee in terms of transaction speed and good experience. You know, Binance Dex inherits the professional financial product modules of Binance's centralized exchange, and **will also try to use the advantages and concepts of decentralized transactions to solve the false currency increase in centralized exchanges. Pain points such as asset opacity** . In this process, Binance Chain also played a vital role.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/swifhvc38g881.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698e599ddf72f07bbfd9f9f3518965b5d70662c2)

After understanding Binance Chain BC, we return to the smart chain BSC. **BSC was launched on September 1, 2020, and can be regarded as a blockchain parallel to Binance Chain.** **For now, BSC mainly serves the Binance DeFi ecosystem, and at the same time, it is also committed to making Binance's dual public chain model more complete.**

In terms of consensus algorithm, BSC has made certain innovations. **It adopts the PoSA (Proof of Stake Authority) consensus algorithm, combines the functions of the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) and proof-of-authority (PoA) mechanism, and is built on 21 verification nodes On the network, blocks are produced in seconds, which will undoubtedly establish a high-speed infrastructure for the DeFi protocol** .

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pyht7eh68g881.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ede995e1e83087aedc82e49790c1a2a25edf98b9)

The core of the smart chain lies in the word ""smart"" (in BSC, S=Smart), which is mainly embodied in the related functions of smart contracts. BSC supports smart contract writing functions and is compatible with the existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and all applications and tools under its ecosystem. Therefore, developers can easily implement the migration and deployment of the Ethereum DApp, saving development effort. As a parallel chain that can interact with BC, BSC natively supports cross-chain communication and transactions. Moreover, on BSC, in addition to the native token BNB, it is also possible to use the token standard of BEP-20 and benchmark against ERC20.

***On the smart chain BSC, what are the ace projects worth paying attention to?***

BSC has assembled multiple track projects including trading, banking, machine gun pool, swap, stablecoin, insurance, and oracle, and has shown good performance on each track. Among them, the daily trading volume of PancakeSwap, the leading project of the trading track, is 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, even more than the Ethereum-based DEX leader uniswap; the machine gun pool track leader Autofarm has a lock-up volume of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, far exceeding the Ethereum-based machine gun pool star YFI; The lock-up volume of the leading bank track venus is almost the same as the AAVE of the Ethereum series.

Next, we will introduce a few star projects on BSC that are quite worthy of attention.

**A typical representative of decentralized exchanges: PancakeSwap.**

**Objectively speaking, PancakeSwap is currently the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on the BSC smart chain, with a lock-up amount of up to 3.3 billion U.S. dollars.**

**In terms of transactions** , PancakeSwap uses the currently popular **AMM transaction mechanism** , similar to Uniswap. **In terms of liquidity mining (Farms)** , users can provide liquidity in PancakeSwap to obtain handling fees and mining income. The handling fee is 0.2%. Mining can earn an annualized rate of return of about 100%, supporting more than 50 Many trading pairs are based on BNB. **In terms of mining (Pools)** , Pools can be understood as pledged mining, that is, mining is carried out by pledge of a single currency, thereby supporting many new coins of Binance, and the annualized rate of return can reach 60%-100%. **In terms of IFO** , PancakeSwap provides a new stock listing model similar to stocks. IFO represents the listing of new coins and can start crowdfunding on PancakeSwap.

**The token issued by the PancakeSwap exchange is CAKE. The current circulation is about 120 million, but the total issuance is unlimited, and the circulating market value is close to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.** The price of CAKE has risen astonishingly. It has risen 66 times in 3 months. It is known as the biggest dark horse in the smart chain BSC.

**The leader in the field of lending platforms: Venus.**

**Venus is a lending protocol based on the Binance Smart Chain, and its role is similar to MakerDAO in the Ethereum ecosystem.** Venus aims to introduce a lending system based on decentralized finance into Binance Smart Chain. Venus is not only committed to providing users with a faster and lower-cost trading experience, but also striving to provide users with more opportunities and possibilities to access high-liquid asset classes. In addition, users can also use the collateral provided to the market to mortgage and synthesize excess mortgage positions.

At present, the Venus ecosystem has two types of tokens, namely **XVS and VAI** . XVS is the platform's native BEP-20 governance token, which is mainly used to participate in platform governance, such as voting for product upgrades, adding new collateral types, and adjusting platform parameters. **VAI is a synthetic stable currency asset of the Venus platform, its value is anchored at $1, and the total issuance of XVS is 30 million.** Among them, 79% is used for ecological mining, and the remaining 21% is allocated to Binance Launchpool and Binance Smart Chain ecology. XVS was launched on Binance in early October 2020. The initial price was only less than US$2, but it has been advancing all the way since then, and the highest price once rushed to US$98.

**However, on May 18 this year, Venus' XVS experienced a ""crisis of trust"" for a while.** At 10 o'clock in the evening on May 18, the price of XVS suddenly stretched sharply and doubled in the next two and a half hours, reaching a maximum of $144. When the XVS price was at its highest point, some users pledged 2 million XVS and lent 4,100 Bitcoins and 9,600 Ethereum. After the price of XVS fell, the pledged assets were liquidated. Such a move caused XVS to suffer a sell-off, leading to a sharp drop, and even a chain reaction. After all, the plunging pledge was far less than the value of the lent Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to relevant statistics, this behavior caused a deficit of up to 77 million U.S. dollars to Venus, which is about 490 million yuan. This incident was mocked by the industry as ""air for big pie"", and it also made everyone question Venus's current high price and high pledge rate. Therefore, when you choose Venus to invest, you must also take into account its existing credit risk.

**Seed player in the revenue aggregator: Autofarm.**

Autofarm is a DeFi aggregation mining protocol based on Binance Smart Chain, which is similar to Yearn in the Ethereum ecosystem. Autofarm can not only help users automatically switch high-yield mining pools, but also reinvest interest to increase the mining profitability.

**AUTO tokens were officially excavated on December 15, 2020, and mining will end in October 2021, with a total circulation of 80,000.** **Among them, 88% is used for mining and 12% is allocated to the team.** **AUTO tokens have the advantages of no private placement and no pre-mining.** Because of this, once they are launched, they have been widely praised by the community and have a yearn effect. It is worth mentioning that in just one week after the Autofarm platform was launched, the lock-up volume has skyrocketed by 10 times, and the lock-up volume is as high as US$1.4 billion. I believe that under such favorable conditions, the price of AUTO will also rise. Autofarm supports single currency mining and liquidity mining. The USDT stablecoin mining income has been stable for a long time above 40%, and the liquidity mining annualized rate of return is about 100%-500%, and the overall rate of return is good. However, it should be noted that Autofarm charges users a 0.5% management fee, and it is recommended that participating users calculate the rate of return in advance.

Autofarm has a good reputation in the industry, and many people even joked that although Autofarm is not the ""pro son"" of Binance, its excellent product design and outstanding performance are not inferior to the ""pro son"" of Binance. Venus XVS. More importantly, **Autofarm's ambitions are not limited to the Binance Smart Chain. It is currently connected to the Huobi Ecological Chain. It is more likely to be extended to other public chains such as Polkadot in the future** . It has a **promising future** .

***Smart chain BSC builds a top public chain ecology, what other tracks are worth looking forward to?***

Objectively speaking, BSC's current performance is very impressive, and it has been established only a year ago, but it has achieved many impressive results. This is inseparable from the rapid development of the DeFi and NFT markets in the past year. So, from now to the future, which tracks will BSC focus on?

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dql3c8wd8g881.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91c8624d8e7541b891fa36847e3708302661152a)

**First of all, we must continue to give full play to our advantages in the DeFi field.**

The original purpose of BSC was to build a DeFi ecological environment. Therefore, DeFi is the most important and core track for BSC. We have reason to believe that BSC will continue to advance in the future, deploying DeFi from multiple dimensions such as currency listing, investment, and chain ecology.

Judging from the beginning of this year, BSC's performance in DeFi ecology is quite eye-catching. **BSC head applications represented by PancakeSwap, Venus, and Autofarm have attracted more than one billion U.S. dollars in lock-up amount** . Among them, the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap has firmly occupied the leading position of the DEX sector. Even if you look at the entire DeFi rankings, Pancake and Autofarm are fully qualified to be among the first echelon of DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uzy5hj5g8g881.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3b289070c9a2acdbe91f7b17b18331432972764)

In the DeFi track, BSC is undoubtedly the most powerful competitor of Ethereum. BSC has the head in many fields such as DEX, lending, asset management, DeFi infrastructure and development tools, decentralized insurance, and ecological tools. The project must also have the strength to compete with Ethereum.

**Second, we must focus on the NFT field.**

As we all know, 2021 is the first year of NFT development. In this year, the NFT market has experienced a blowout development, with explosive development in the fields of encryption art, NFT games and ""NFT+DeFi"". BSC wants to continue to work hard in 2021 and stay ahead, and it must not miss this important track.

At present, many NFT projects have noticed the advantages of BSC and regard it as an important bridgehead. BSC has also built a unique and self-adaptive ecosystem at the moment, focusing on the development model of ""NFT+DeFi"". **It is reported that in the near future, 6 NFT games, including BunnyPark, Faraland, MOBOX, Crypto Blades, My DeFi Pet, and X World Games, will become star projects on BSC.**

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xm4m6kci8g881.png?width=299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69f15f22b254467edb95e71ea19756654afb48e0)

**The third point is that the smart chain BSC will focus on the GameFi field in the future.**

Speaking of the most interesting and attractive areas on the market, there must be a GameFi. The popularity of GameFi began with Axie Infinity, which is a global chain game. This game is very magical, and it quickly achieved the circle-breaking effect, making a wave of chain travel craze set off on a global scale. BSC smelled this wave of business opportunities early and started the layout in time. Currently, there are not a few popular GameFi games on BSC.

**For example, on BSC, the ""handling"" Crypto Blades in the GameFi field performed well, and even surpassed Axie Infinity once to dominate the GameFi track daily active list.**

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/phi3po3k8g881.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3422306542208e21091a27f8e3fdb4bfca4aaf52)

Such achievements make us look forward to the future performance of BSC in the GameFi field. I believe that with the support of Binance Smart Chain in terms of traffic support and ecological construction, more and more high-quality games will be born.

***Regarding the smart chain BSC, what aspects are worth thinking about?***

At present, the three major exchanges (Huobi's Heco; Okex's OKChain) are all working hard to develop their own public chains. If you make a comprehensive comparison, you will find that Binance **BSC still has the best results** among the three. .

So, the question is, why does the smart chain BSC have an outstanding performance?

The reason is that, **first of all, BSC has received strong support from Binance Exchange because it “relies on a big tree to enjoy the coolness”** . Ecological development cannot be completed overnight, and a large amount of capital and resource support needs to be invested in it. The development of multiple protocols on BSC is precisely supported by the incubation fund provided by Binance Exchange. Only one year after BSC went live, Binance has provided approximately US$100 million in project support funds to support projects that they believe can bring benefits to the Binance ecology. I believe that in the future, Binance, which sees benefits, will continue to invest in support. fund.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/r9ytu42m8g881.png?width=441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=967a9969ff7711664253d8abcfa7aaf3b3fafd04)

**Secondly, this also benefits from the foil of peers.** For a long time, Ethereum's fees and network problems have been criticized, which undoubtedly provides opportunities for sidechain platforms such as BSC. As far as the current state of Ethereum is concerned, no matter how the bull market explodes and the users no matter how enthusiastic it is, it will not be able to completely consume and take over these potential benefits. This will naturally give the BSC, which is ready to go early, a chance and taste the sweetness. . BSC is currently fully compatible with Ethereum, and the so-called migration is nothing more than a redeployment of the contract, which has a very low threshold for developers. On the other hand, transaction costs can save a lot. In this way, it is easy for everyone to find their own place on BSC.

**The last point is also complementary to the aforementioned sharp drop in transaction fees. The mining revenue of DeFi projects on BSC is usually very high, which is quite attractive for users.** While the cost is being reduced, the profit is increasing by a large margin. This is undoubtedly a huge temptation that is irresistible.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fjhn63xn8g881.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533f9e4c5f64cb75196e905cb90c09a67a9b6650)

Of course, BSC is not without its shortcomings. BSC was born out of Ethereum and updated on Ethereum, which means that many inherent vulnerabilities, flaws and smart contract limitations in the Ethereum ecosystem cannot be completely circumvented by BSC. Whether such hidden dangers will be attacked by hackers in the future is still unknown. In addition, behind BSC is Binance, which shows that BSC is always a highly centralized project. Whether it can have a decentralized DeFi concept and recognize ""peaceful coexistence"" in the future also needs to wait and see.

Therefore, we still need to remind investors that although the smart chain BSC is quite high-quality and the future ecological development prospects are very bright, we still need to respect the risks and avoid large losses."

**At the moment when DeFi and NFT are attracting attention, the three major exchanges have also begun to exert their strength and have entered the public chain field to compete.** **Among them, OKChain, which stands out as a ""public chain rookie"", has naturally become the backbone of it, and has attracted the attention of the industry with its unique vision and strong layout.**

**OKChain was born as a dark horse, and its performance is quite amazing. From a long-term perspective, can OKChain maintain its core competitiveness in the future, strategizing in cross-chain mechanisms, tokens, ecological roles and other aspects?** **Today, World Chain Investment Research will conduct a comprehensive analysis for everyone.**

***What is OKChain?***

**OKChain is a set of open source blockchain application public chains developed by OKEx Exchange. With the goal of establishing a safe and efficient DeFi infrastructure, it is committed to creating community-based operations, transparent transaction rules, and decentralized transactions in which user assets are controlled by themselves. Platform (DEX).**

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a9mgzre95l881.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94a1d2b9ebf3e4f9e936b53e86507e2bfe0080ec)

OKChain is an open public chain ecology, and its advantages are very obvious. Anyone can run to become an OKChain super node. At the same time, they can also issue their own digital assets on OKChain, create their own digital asset trading pairs, and trade them.

**OKChain is built based on Cosmos' Tendermint mechanism and Cosmos SDK.** The so-called Cosmos is to propose a kind of inter-blockchain communication protocol IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol). It is a network composed of many independent, parallel running blockchains. Each blockchain is connected through nodes. Its emergence is dedicated to the realization of the interconnection and interconnection of the blockchain field. On this basis, combined with the **instant determinism of** the Tendermint consensus algorithm , the value transmission between blockchains is greatly realized. In the near future, it will also support a heterogeneous cross-chain approach to solve the multi-directional circulation of value.

**Tendermint contains two main technical components: a blockchain consensus engine Tendermint Core and a general application program interface ABCI.** Tendermint Core is responsible for data transmission between nodes and Byzantine consensus. The consensus algorithm that combines BFT and DPoS can achieve the final certainty of block generation. ABCI is a blockchain application program interface and a protocol that supports the implementation of transaction processing in any programming language.

&amp;#x200B;

The OKChain team is a team with ideas, vision and vision. **They have worked hard for 3 years, and strive to build OKChain into a truly decentralized, borderless trading ecosystem that can be used efficiently by everyone.** At least from the current point of view, they have not forgotten their original intentions and are walking steadily on this road.

***What are the core advantages of OKChain?***

The battle of the public chain is like a war without gunpowder. Although there is no shadow of swords and swords, it is full of cruelty and ruthlessness. If you do not have core advantages and strong strength, it is difficult to gain a foothold in this highly competitive field.

So, what features and advantages does OKChain have?

**First of all, OKChain's architecture selection is quite successful.**

As mentioned earlier, OKChain is built based on Cosmos' Tendermint mechanism and Cosmos SDK. **In this way, it will be very convenient to connect to the Cosmos-based public chain in the future.** At the same time, OKChain also analyzed specific issues and redesigned OKChain governance and election modules according to the unique needs of DEX on OKChain to support diversified business logic.

In addition, OKChain also chose the ""divide and conquer"" cross-chain solution, using the instant determinism of the Dops consensus algorithm to achieve value and data transmission between multiple heterogeneous chains. In this network, relay chains and parachains play a pivotal role. For the virtual user datagram protocol (UDP) or transmission control protocol (TCP) of the blockchain, the relay chain of the OKChain network and each parallel chain can communicate through the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, and the area can be realized by using OKChain. The interoperability between blockchains enables assets on the chain to be transferred from one partition to other partitions safely and quickly.

**You know, cross-chain technology is the key link in the blockchain world to realize asset and data interaction, and it is the technical foundation of DeFi.** To achieve cross-chain, it is necessary to realize asset circulation, information exchange and application collaboration between different blockchain platforms. It is similar to a bridge between different public chains, realizing data transmission between different blockchain networks, and greatly reducing transmission costs. **OKChain simply and effectively realizes the value interconnection, user interconnection and scenario application interconnection of the blockchain through the cross-chain module.** In terms of the cross-chain architecture, OKChain adopts the principle of ""combining overall universality with specific uniqueness"". From this point of view, OKChain is undoubtedly a potential and valuable internet network.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4pxnm9od5l881.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e62d326488e4082503ef58ccff98f7a099148dba)

**Secondly, OKChain has low-cost data expansion capabilities.**

In terms of data expansion, OKChain boldly innovated, splitting the data into 3 layers, **namely block data, runtime data and off-chain data** . This operation not only satisfies the advantages of the existing system docking costs, improves the system consensus speed, and expands the data dimension on the chain, but also solves the drawbacks of the traditional public chain solution that ""data on the chain can only be realized in the block"" , So as to solve the problem of data redundancy and low efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9grksdmf5l881.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1798282c01d0a3f2d7e7ea2338452f7789342376)

In this way, OKChain successfully layered the huge data on the blockchain, stripped off the redundant part, and only transmitted a small part of the hash. In this way, when a large amount of data needs to reach a consensus, it can effectively reduce the amount of data and retain the advantages of the block chain, which is irreversible and tamper-proof.

**In addition, OKChain puts forward the universal concept of ""Everyone develops DEX"".**

Blockchain application development is more complicated, let alone newcomers and novices, it is not very friendly to many senior developers. OKChain is keenly aware of this problem, and promptly put forward the universal concept of **""everyone develops DEX""** . Through the hierarchical design of the public chain and the sub-module design of the application layer, developers do not need to design the entire public chain, but only need to implement the core. The business function can be. In this way, the concept of ""everyone can develop DEX based on OKChain"" becomes possible.

If we carefully analyze the single-chain architecture in the OKChain ecosystem, we will find that it consists of three parts: the application layer, the consensus layer, and the network layer. Based on Tendermint, OKChain packs the consensus layer and the network layer into a common engine. Common bottom layer, in this way, developers don't have to pay attention to these two common bottom layers. Instead, they can save time and focus on developing the application layer.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img j7tmdack5l881...*

Why is OKChain's approach a pioneering work? Because for operators (ie, B-side + C-side), OKChain can help them realize the core value of DEX trading platforms and trading pairs based on the public chain ecology, so as to encourage each individual to participate, exert their strength, and realize digital Greater decentralization of assets.

**Finally, OKChain is unique in that OKChain has a completely independent OKT fuel.**

It is worth mentioning that OKChain currently has launched the OKT token, which is native to the public chain. The OKT token is **completely independent of the OKEx and OKB holders' systems, and the two are not related to each other** .

The reason for this must be a long-term consideration. The rights and interests of platform coins are often highly related to the interests of exchanges. If the exchange tokens are directly used for the issuance of public chain platforms or reward nodes, it will greatly affect the relevant value. The direct issuance of public chain basic tokens can take into account the relationship between the two at the same time, and it is also more conducive to the construction and development of the public chain ecology.

OKChain adopts the concept of on-chain governance, and realizes on-chain governance through proposals. This method can fully reflect the concept of decentralization. OKT holders can participate in OKChain's governance by initiating proposals, collateralizing proposals, and voting on proposals (OKT needs to be delegated).

***What projects on OKChain are worth paying attention to?***

***KSwap***

Speaking of the more important projects in the OKChain DEX field, it is none other than KSwap. KSwap, or KSwap Finance, **is a decentralized trading product established based on OkexChain and based on the concept of automatic market making in a capital pool. It is responsible for supporting liquid mining and transaction mining mechanisms** . KSwap is committed to providing users with token exchange, liquidity, transaction mining and other services in the OKChain ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nyv9hqom5l881.png?width=305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af94c43b33a24e9d5de9168f413d94dcc2ea1ab2)

**Currently, KSwap has issued KST, with a total issuance of 1 billion.** Among them, 80% is used for mining rewards; 10% is used for team incentives (this part of team incentives will be linearly unlocked in 36 months after the mainnet is launched); 5% is used for marketing, operations, airdrops and other activities (this Part of it will be linearly unlocked in 12 months after the mainnet is launched, and the specific address and usage details will be announced to the community); the saved 5% will be used for early institutional investors. In addition, transaction fees will be used to repurchase KST and distribute dividends to ecosystem contributors. Users can obtain liquidity certificates by providing liquidity and pledge them to the corresponding incentive pool to obtain token rewards provided by KST or other project parties. The amount of reward depends on the number of tokens pledged by the user in the incentive pool. Accounted for.

***Lemond***

**Lemond belongs to the field of lending and is one of OKChain's earlier projects, and it can also be called OKChain's main ecological project.**

If we count the past and present of Lemond, we will find that it is still ""a bit historical."" Lemond was listed on the Gate Exchange earlier, but it didn't want to perform very well, so he came back. The reason is largely because it hurried to the office before it was ready.

After the launch of OKChain, Lemond's overall performance is quite good. If you compare the entire lending field vertically, MakerDao has the highest lock-up amount on Ethereum, with a total lock-up capital of US$690 million. **From the perspective of lock-up funds, Lemond's lock-up amount is only lower than MakerDao** .

Lemond can be regarded as a more controversial project. Some people think that Lemond has a ""dark history"" and believe that it was launched on Gate early, and it may have been laundered by private equity. **But to be fair, as an early project of OKChain, it still has advantages. It can not only help users capture value, but also help them find the right time and follow the project to reap the early dividends of growth.**

***Dematrix***

If there is anything special about Dematrix, it must be that **it is committed to completing the iteration of smart contracts on OKChain** .

In the 1.0 period, Dematrix was a derivative revenue aggregation platform built on OKChain Testnet. Dematrix's branded mining pools provide liquid mining returns for customers with multiple income preferences. On this basis, Dematrix also launched version 2.0. The upgraded version will become a comprehensive platform that supports NFT asset origination, exhibition exchange, auction, mining, lending and games. In addition, Dematrix will also make strategic deployments to build flagship front-ends including blind boxes, mining pools, NFT20, NFTFi and decentralized auction markets, thereby greatly strengthening the connection between digital assets and the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ewrjf06p5l881.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3563106568ec87221c4415511804893246bcddd8)

According to official disclosures, Dematrix has now completed a million-dollar institutional round of financing, including Tricer Top Foundation, WeBounty, on-chain capital, Aquaria, BlockLofty Ventures, Coldlab, Bit9 Capital, TokenHODL, R8 Capital, 7 O'clock Capital in Many capital institutions in China have already invested in it. **Dematrix issued the token dmx with a total of 200 million.** It is expected that 25% will be unlocked after going online, and 15% will be unlocked on subsequent monthly lines. The unlocking will be completed in 5 months. Dematrix has now officially landed on Cherryswap on August 10th, Beijing time, and is open to transactions for global users. Interested friends can pay more attention to the business opportunities and bonuses.

***Orange***

In OKChain, there are not only lemons (Lemond) but also oranges (Orange), which can be described as a ""fruit meeting"".

Orange is the main project of OKChain NFT ecology. Orange provides users with a full-chain NFT operation system. Any user can upload and create his own unique NFT work on the Orange platform. **This work is unique and scarce, and naturally protects everyone's work from being infringed** .

In fact, the entire process for users to create their own NFT works on the Orange platform is not complicated. They can log in to the official website, open an account, upload their works (name and fill in the profile), digitally sign to confirm the rights, and choose the bidding method/price/ The time/signature process can be completed, mint Mint, thus owning your own NFT works, and having a proof of ownership on the OKChain public chain. After the ownership is confirmed, the NFT works have tradable value. Users enjoy the rights of placing orders, trading or auctioning their own works on Orange. This means that your work and digital financial assets have similar attributes and values, and your ""work"" will circulate around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cynjw48r5l881.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16b9c3a34caa301490009903c28dfacf1d0eb115)

It is worth mentioning that the account needs to be opened for the first creation on the Orange platform, and 20 ORGs are submitted as the opening fee, and this fee is no longer required for subsequent operations.

**Orange’s governance token is ORG, and holding ORG can participate in decentralized governance and obtain staking benefits.** **The total circulation of ORG is 20 million, of which 11 million ORGs are produced through mining** . The ORG mining pool is divided into 5, the first is the OKT single coin pledge pool, with 300,000 ORGs, released in 300 days, and the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the second is the ORG single coin pledge pool, with 1 million ORG, after 300 days of release, the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the third is the ORG liquidity pool, 2.5 million ORGs, after 360 days, the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the fourth is the NFT mining pool, 2.2 million ORGs will be released in 360 days, and the output will be reduced by 25% every 30 days; the fifth is OSwap, with a total of 5 million ORGs. It is reported that the total amount and output method of each mining pool are carefully calculated and planned by actuaries to ensure that the daily ORG output not only meets the needs of the market, but does not cause selling pressure on the market.

***What else do you want to say about OKChain?***

There is no doubt that Ethereum is a well-deserved leader in the industry, no matter in terms of operational value or development conditions. However, as far as the current development is concerned, although Ethereum is not concealed, there are still many shortcomings and problems that need to be corrected and revised. It is precisely because of this that other public chains are given the opportunity to catch up and even break through. Among them, there is no doubt that OKChain also has a huge competitive advantage.

100% open source code and open nodes, this is the biggest highlight of OKChain, and it also means that OKEx will contribute its own strong strength and provide underlying support for many blockchain projects, so as to achieve complete decentralization. **From this perspective, OKChain is likely to become the next Ethereum, and OKT, the high-quality currency on the platform, will also have the opportunity to become a new generation of ETH.**

However, judging from the current development progress of OKChain, not only is it not fast, it is even somewhat ""inefficient"". The current projects on the chain, in terms of popularity alone, can hardly compete with Heco and BSC.

**Even so, we are still full of expectations for OKChain.

kripto varliklarinizi teminat olarak yatirip sifir faizle (piyasada kabul gormeye basladikca yavas yavas artar diye tahmin ediyorum) mai stable coin odunc alabildiginiz bir platform, sadece geri odeme sirasinda %0.5 komisyon odemeniz gerekiyor. ustune de eger asgari likiditasyon orani (teminat gosterilen varlik degerinin odunc alinan miktara orani) belli limitlerde tutarsaniz (sistemi kullanmaniz icin tesvik etmeye calisiyorlar) kendi tokenlari olan qı kazanabiliyorsunuz. curve benzeri bu qı lari 4 yila kadar stake edip daha da cok kazanma imkani sunuyor.  


eth ecosistemi malumunuz islem ucretleri (gas) cok yuksek ve 10k-100k gibi rakamlarla islem yapmadiginiz surece defı platformlari uzerinden elde edeceginiz azicik gelir de bu islem ucretlerine gidiyor. ama mai polygon, fantom gibi cok daha ucuz blockchain lerde de calisiyor.  


hatta teminatinizi da sizin adiniza isleterek (yield farming) uzun vadede yukarda bahsettigim likiditasyon limitinizi de rahatlatmak gibi imkanlari var. ornegin eth i once aave ye yatiriyorsunuz sonra aave nin bu yatirim karsiligi verdigi tokenleri maifinance de yield farming e yatiriyorsunuz. ozetle aave nin periodic olarak kazandirdigi geliri tekrar aave ye yatirarak bilesik faizle daha da kazanmanizi sagliyor. sonrada bu yield farming den aldiginiz tokenlari da teminat olarak kullanabiliyorsunuz. biraz karisik gorunuyor, ust uste binen akilli kontrat ve gizli isletim ucretleri, islem miktarindan kaynakli cikabilecek teknik sorunlar gibi riskleriniz artiyor ancak yatiriminizi birden fazla blockchaine ve defi platformuna dagitarak bu riski de kismen bertaraf edebiliyorsunuz. ben once kucuk miktarlarla girip, bastan sona (platforma ilk giris ve komple cikis) tum sistemin guvenirliligini test edip, gizli maliyetlerini, ne kadar babysitting yapmam gerektigini gordukten sonra yavas yavas miktarlari artiriyorum.  


yatirim tavsiyesi degildir cunku ozunde kaldiracli islem yapiyoruz aslinda. yuksek risk teskil ettiginden kaldiracli islemlerden uzak durmalisiniz ancak risk seviyelerinizi (yukarda bahsettigim likiditasyon orani) ve aldiginiz borcu ne kadar riskli bir yatirimda kullanacaginiza gore risk seviyelerinizi kendiniz belirliyebiliyorsunuz. ornegin, en riskli senaryoda eth + aaveyield + qi rewards dan gelecek gelir + alinan borc ile qi alip bir de uzerine qi nin fiyat artisin gelecek gelir ile kaldiracli islem yapmis oluyorsunuz. en az riskli senaryoda da likidistasyon oranini olabildigince guvenli tutup %0.5 geri odeme masrafina karsilik, balancer, curve, saber, beefy gibi stablecoin olarak yatirip %15-20 seviyelerinde (apy/apr) gelir elde edebiliyorsunuz. piyasalarin durumuna gore bu cok riskli ile az riskli arasinda gecis/dengeleme yapilabilir yani fiyatlar sistiginde stablecoin e gecip, dip yaptiginda da tam tersi yapmak gibi. likiditasyon limitleri (collateral to debt ratio) lari yakindan takip etmek gerekiyor ve riskinizin arttigini gordugunuzde borcunuzun bir kismini geri odeyerek bu orani optimum seviyede (qi kazancini kaybetmeden ama likidite olmadan) tutmak isin en cok efor sarfedilmesi gereken kismi. ben genelde coinalert gibi app lar ile once kendime en dusuk limit belirliyorum ornegin eth 3000 in altina dusmez diyorum ona gore bir strateji belirliyorum eger eth 3000 lere gelirse stablecoin yield farming pozisyonlarimi kapatip, borcumu kismi geri odeyip bu limiti daha da asagi cekmeyi planliyorum. bakalim nasil gidecek :) hersey tepetaklak olur likidite olursam da dipten eth satmis olacagim"

DeFi trends,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/lbe769/defi_trends/,ZoeSMr,5,2021-02-03 11:15:49,1,/r/defi/comments/lbe769/defi_trends/,,"Golff is a One-Stop Services Encrypted Bank, and its products are mainly DeFi aggregator platforms, to Create a Light, Open and Free Financial World. Since the project on the exchange, it has aroused much discussion and attention from users. 

According to the latest news disclosed by the Golff team, Golff will focus on developing three sectors: Aggregate Lending, Vault2.0 and the Gas Tokens.

Golff's one-click aggregated lending service will continue to aggregate current mainstream DeFi lending platforms, such as MakerDAO, Compound, AAVE, dYdX, etc. This will greatly expand the underlying assets that can be used for lending, enhance the user's asset liquidity, and also optimize the best interest rate, reducing the user's borrowing cost. It is expected to be officially launched in mid-February.

Golff will use the Gas Tokens chain fee replacement to solve the Ethereum's high-rate issue, significantly reducing fees and lowering the barriers to user participation. This model is very beneficial to chain arbitrageurs and bulk traders who originally had excessive gas costs.  

Golff Vault 2.0 supports multi-currency participation and supports more strategies for Golff Vault V2 to switch.  As long as users deposit assets with one click, they can obtain the optimal returns. This means that the Vault has enhanced the ""strike range"" and supports the aggregation of more DeFi products. 

Golff community volunteers initiated a vote on the improved version of the Vault to supported the products on the Huobi public chain Heco, and diversified the ecosystem. It is expected that Golff will support both Ethereum and Huobi Heco at the same time. In this way, the huge user base of Huobi can be a diversion for Golff.

The most important thing for any project is the value of its tokens and the potential for future growth. GOF is a native functional token of Golff. GOF holders have the right to participate in governance while also sharing platform profits. In addition, holding GOF can also participate in liquidity mining in the Golff system. From the perspective of GOF itself, whether you want to dig GDAO to participate in governance or Vault revenue, GOF is the core.

 
In the second outbreak of DeFi recently, the DeFi currency continues to pump new highs. So users can keep paying attention to YFI and GOF, especially compared to the YFI that has skyrocketed, GOF has more potential to rise."
What is DAI and how you can earn up to 100% with DAI on Yearner Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_YearnerFinance/comments/lbmbi4/what_is_dai_and_how_you_can_earn_up_to_100_with/,YearnerFinance,1,2021-02-03 20:17:23,2,/r/u_YearnerFinance/comments/lbmbi4/what_is_dai_and_how_you_can_earn_up_to_100_with/,,"

As Yearner Finance just launched five new pools on Uniswap with amazing yield farming rewards, we want to tell you more about the tokens you can deposit. We’ll start with DAI, the world’s largest decentralized stable token.

**Main facts about DAI**

DAI is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Its value is pegged to the US dollar, so 1 DAI is always worth $1. DAI is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the DeFi industry, and its current market capitalization is $1.6 billion. The dollar peg is maintained by a set of smart contracts: if the price moves away from $1, the system will either burn MKR (Maker) tokens or create new ones to bring the exchange rate of DAI back to $1.

As DAI is a regular ERC-20 token, you can store it in most Ethereum wallets, send it to other wallets and exchanges, trade it etc. The best non-custodial wallets for DAI are MetaMask and MEW. There are also DeFi projects that ‘wrap’ DAI to use it on other, much faster and cheaper blockchains, for example, xDAI and rDAI.

**Who issues DAI?**

The issuer of DAI is the MakerDAO lending protocol, designed by the famous developer Rune Christensen. Note that it’s not issued arbitrarily by a company or group of people, but rather by an algorithm. The emission is completely automated: when users deposit crypto as collateral in MakerDAO, new DAI tokens are created

**Is DAI backed with anything?**

Yes. It is backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies deposited by users as collateral on MakerDAO. Currently the platform supports 18 collateral currencies, including ETH, WBTC, LINK, COMP, BAL, USDT, USDC, UNI, BAT etc. Every DAI token is backed by a corresponding amount in one of these 18 collateral currencies. This is the peculiarity of DAI: it’s pegged to the USD but backed by crypto.

By the way, originally the MakerDAO token had only one type of collateral — Ethereum. It was known as single-collateral DAI, or SAI. This system was shut down when the multi-collateral DAI was introduced in March 2020.

**Is DAI better than USDT or USDC?**

DAI is decentralized and 100% transparent. You can always check how much collateral is deposited in the smart contracts and match that amount with the current number of DAI in circulation. There’s no company or person administering DAI, so even if the founding team of MakerDAO were to leave the project, it will still continue working. This is very different from Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which are run by Tether and Circle respectively. You can’t really check yourself if the collateral in US dollars is indeed stored in their bank accounts. In short, USDT and USDC are not transparent at all.

**How can you earn money with DAI?**

MakerDAO’s Oasis app allows you to deposit DAI into a sort of a savings account to earn a small interest. You can get a bit more by locking your DAI into other lending protocols, such as Compound and Aave. (Once we launch Phase 2 of Yearner Finance, you’ll be able to earn much more, by the way.)

If you want to maximize the income, however, the best way to do it is through decentralized trading and yield farming. When you lock DAI in the Yearner Finance pool on Uniswap, you’ll get a part of all the trading fees that the pool generates. If the trading activity is high, you can earn up to 20% on your deposit easily. But this isn’t the main source of income: the real advantage is getting the yield farming rewards in YFNR tokens.

For each Ethereum block, we will distribute 2 YFNR to the DAI-YFNR pool as rewards. Your share will depend on how much liquidity (YFNR and DAI) you submitted to the pool. But since the block time in Ethereum is only 13 seconds, 2 YFNR per block turns into circa 600 YFNR every hour, and that’s a lot of money!

Only in the first week after the launch of the pools, we are offering a x10 farming bonus: we’ll pay not 2, but 20 YFNR per block. This is an opportunity you should not miss. Head over to [Yearner Finance website](https://yearner.finance/) for additional info, then stake some DAI in our Uniswap pool and start earning!"

Teaser: The Spartan Protocol combines UniSwap, THORChain, Synthetix and MakerDAO features, but will be launched on Binance Smart Chain as its own separate protocol. The most powerful product is the synthetic assets on Binance Smart Chain which boosted SNX on Ethereum from 10M mcap to 2B mcap (x200) within 1 year. The Synthetics launch is expected in Q1 2021 on Binance Smart Chain.

Stats:
Ticker: $SPARTA
Circulating Supply: 62M

Mcap: 19M mcap
Exchange: Binance

Tokenomics:

- No advisor tokens
- No team tokens
this will prevent a possible dump

Team:
Its lead by former of Binance Chain projects.

Initial Start Price:
The initial value of SPARTA was set at $0.30 per token, meaning most current token holders paid $0.30 per token, where it’s currently trading at $0.30. New ATH and price discovery coming.

CZ CEO of Binance highlighted Spartan Protocol:

Copy this: ""youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4610&amp;v=8vg-6mMdHYo&amp;feature=emb_logo""

Description:

The Spartan Protocol is a protocol for incentives liquidity and synthetic assets (assets pegged to the price of another asset) on the Binance Smart Chain. The core piece of the protocol are liquidity pools, similar to Uniswap, but instead of a fixed-rate fee model a liquidity-sensitive fee model similar to THORChain’s slip-based fees is used.

Currently, liquidity providers (and traders) are penalised on automated-market maker protocols, such as Uniswap, because of manipulation from value-extracting arbitrage bots. These arbitrage bots have been around for a long time now, and suck up millions of liquidity from unknowing users on a weekly basis.

As well as, synthetic mining protocols such as MakerDao and Synthetic use illiquid collateral/markets to liquidate collateral on, which makes it vulnerable to a downwards spiral which has already caused multiple chain liquidations in the past.

Spartan wants to solve these issues through an AMM protocol, through the use of a single settlement asset and protocol-wide incentives to grow liquidity. A slip-based fees model is used to reward liquidity providers rather than slippage bots, a solution discussed and researched a lot by THORchain. Finally, collateralised pool shares (synthetic assets) are used instead of liquid collateral. Synthetic assets are generated through the protocol, using price anchors offered by the liquidity pools, collaterised by liquidity pool shares. These shares are on-market, value-stabilised and can instantly be liquidated. Thanks to this, positions can be liquidated within causing downwards spirals.

The protocol aims to be community-driven and therefore uses a DAO (governance) set-up for fee rates, time factors and upgrades of certain parts of the code (voted on by holders who get incentivised to do so). But, doesn’t overcomplicate governance or sets high requirements for any proposal to pass.

Because the protocol was built on the Binance Smart Chain, BNB is required to use the protocol and pay for fees. Similar to how ETH is used to pay for gas on the Ethereum Network.

Summarised, I got interested in Spartan Protocol because:

    It took the best parts from the most popular AMM protocols, combined them and created a very solid protocol by doing so.

    The protocol was launched on the Binance Smart Chain, which is a very unique value proposition at this point, subject to Binance exposure.

    Higher leverage, lower fees and much faster then $SNX

    The SpartanDAO is build directly on smart contracts

Coinbase’s Earn Dao issued out Ethereum to convert to Dao. It took me a while to get to this point with my memory, and I’m not sure if I’m getting this right but they sent like .004 ETH or something like that and your mission was to convert using CDP on makerdao cdp.makerdao.com
I don’t remember this ever being on your wallet otherwise you would’ve just kept the ETH , coinbase locked it in this CDP so that you would have to convert .

The issue is 

At the time it was around $5 of ETH and I tried to convert but wondering if anyone else had the same issue , it wasn’t enough to pay for the gas. So there it sat in CDP. 

Maybe this is a reach, but it seems like makerdao sort of ran off with the ETH that coinbase gave them. With the current rise of ETH I’m looking to go back to my account and recover what’s there. 

I had to write this post just in case anyone else ran into a similar issue we can both rant together haha . 

If makerdao ran off with the riches it could be something big"

***First and foremost - I am not a financial advisor - my views are mine alone and not part of the MOD team - DYOR - I am an Altard and probably will lose money, however, I am up 5000% this year...***

I am not going to make an essay out of this. I usually do my research on Cryptocurrency every morning while drinking my coffee and screwing off instead of running my company. However, that is due to me making more in Crypto per year than my wages so...

**What's this about?**

I was reviewing some more stuff and ran across some videos about DeFi Indexes and also that Liked tweet from Elon Musk on [Zerion.io](https://Zerion.io) page. So like any Altard I browsed porn.... Then got back to here after taking my Ritalin. As we all know DeFi will blow up and we're looking at an explosive year for Crypto in 2021. 

If you have invested in SPY on the Stock Market than you know it's a a combination of the biggest companies and the returns are usually pretty great since you can invest and forget chasing each individual one.

**Why I think you should look into** [**Zerion.io**](https://Zerion.io) **and** [**indexed.finance**](https://indexed.finance/)**?** 

If you have small amounts to play with or even bigger you should probably look into investing in something that will explode right? You will gain more exposure to the market by hedging here. Well it's easy and probably agreeable that DeFi is this realm for 2021. It hates no Blockchain, it only needs to be Decentralized Finance.

"Excellent report on DeFi, highlighting Maker, from St. Louis Fed",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/lfv9fm/excellent_report_on_defi_highlighting_maker_from/,scottrepreneur,1,2021-02-09 13:11:01,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/lfv9fm/excellent_report_on_defi_highlighting_maker_from/,,"&gt; To illustrate the concept, let us use the example of MakerDAO, a decentralized protocol that is used to issue the USD-pegged Dai stablecoin. First, the user deposits ETH in a smart contract classified as a collateralized debt position (CDP) (or vault). Subsequently, they call a contract function to create and withdraw a certain number of Dai and thereby lock the collateral. This process currently requires a minimum collateralization ratio of 150 percent, meaning that for any 100 USD of ETH locked up in the contract, the user can create at most 66.66 Dai.6 
&gt; 
&gt; Any outstanding Dai is subject to a stability fee, which in theory should correspond to the Dai debt market's maximum interest rate. This rate is set by the community, namely the MKR token holders. MKR is the governance token for the MakerDAO project. As shown in Figure 3, the stability fee has been fluctuating wildly between 0 and 20 percent. 
&gt;
&gt; To close a CDP, the owner must send the outstanding Dai plus the accumulated interest to the contract. The smart contract will allow the owner to withdraw their collateral once the debt is repaid. If the borrower fails to repay the debt, or if the collateral's value falls below the 150 percent threshold, where the full collateralization of the loan is at risk, the smart contract will start to liquidate the collateral at a potentially discounted rate.
&gt; 
&gt; Interest payments and liquidation fees are partially used to ""burn"" MKR, thereby decreasing the total MKR supply. In exchange, MKR holders assume the residual risk of extreme negative ETH price shocks, which may lead to a situation in which the collateral is insufficient to maintain the USD peg. In this case, new MKR will be created and sold at a discounted rate. As such, MKR holders have skin in the game, and it should be in their best interest to maintain a healthy system.
&gt; 
&gt; It is important to mention that the MakerDAO system is much more complicated than what is described here. Although the system is mostly decentralized, it is reliant on price oracles, which introduce some dependencies, as discussed in Section 3.2. 
&gt; 
&gt; MakerDAO has recently switched to a multi-collateral system, with the goal to make the protocol more scalable by allowing a variety of cryptoassets to be used as collateral. 
&gt;
&gt; [cont'd]
&gt; 
&gt; There is a large variety of lending protocols. Some of the most popular ones are Aave (Boado, 2020), Compound (Leshner and Hayes, 2019), and dYdX (Juliano, 2017). Figure 5 shows the asset-weighted borrowing and lending rates for Dai and ETH. For Dai, the figure also includes the MakerDAO stability fee, which should always be the highest rate in the system. Surprisingly, this is not always the case, meaning that some people have paid a price premium in the secondary market. As of September 2020, Dai accounts for almost 75 percent of all loans in the DeFi ecosystem.

But now its time for a bigger action.

Prime Minister Modi should launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold.

India should launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold. More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.

We make this case below. But if you haven't been following cryptocurrency closely, or India's proposed ban, don't worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should buy Bitcoin rather than ban Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.

**1. Cypto is now a Trillion Dollar Industry**

Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by a pseudonymous engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto. His creation solved an unsolved problem in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.

Yes, you read that right: trillion. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of today, it's $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That's more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.

A trillion here, a trillion there, soon you're talking real money!

So in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s. And like all great innovations, it's led to the creation of remarkably valuable companies (like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken) and technologies (like Ethereum and Zcash). But people still don't get how large the space is. Let's give some more numbers.

Ethereum, the number two cryptocurrency, is worth &gt;$100B. It extends the concepts introduced in Bitcoin to permit so-called smart contracts, which allow engineers to write programs that can send and receive money.

Ethereum has given birth to an entire sector called decentralized finance (""defi"") which is to traditional finance (""tradfi"") what the internet was to paper-based media. Almost $30B in assets are now held in defi for the purpose of earning interest, taking out loans, or trading assets.

The Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were used to send &gt;$1T in volume in 2020, more than PayPal.

So-called ""stablecoins"" built on Ethereum have allowed the transfer of stable US dollar equivalents to anyone in the world; they too transact billions of dollars in volume every 24 hours.

The website [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) has a higher Alexa ranking (#324 at last check) than the website [wsj.com](https://wsj.com/) (last ranked as #440). In other words, a crypto website that lists the price of cryptocurrencies is more popular than the Wall Street Journal's official website! And that flip first occurred in 2017.

The research paper describing Bitcoin has been cited at least 13,000 times by professors at places like Stanford, Harvard, and MIT, and cryptocurrencies have stimulated innovations in applied cryptography and distributed computing.

More than five billion dollars in venture capital has been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups by the world's top tech investors, including Marc Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures.

Annual crypto transaction volumes are now in excess of $1T.

Thousands, millions, billions, trillions – the numbers start to stun after a while. So here's some qualitative commentary from prominent people and institutions to supplement the quantitative barrage.

Elon Musk: The world's richest man has said that Bitcoin is ""inevitable"" and changed his Twitter bio to simply ""#Bitcoin"".

The IMF: Cryptocurrency could ""completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills"" and ""could be the next step in the evolution of money.""

The World Bank: ""Cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are

part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and commerce are organized.""

Larry Summers, Former US Treasury Secretary: ""Bitcoin is here to stay"" and the ""financial industry will adopt the technology underpinning bitcoin.""

At this point you should realize that this crypto thing is kind of a big deal. And that there's an enormous gap between the economic impact of crypto versus its portrayal in the popular press, and that it might seem a little hasty to cut India off from an emerging trillion dollar industry.

But it's actually even more important than that. Because crypto isn't just an economic sector, it's a civilizational advance on par with the internet, and – if embraced rather than banned – can actually solve many of the issues facing modern India. Starting with national security.

**2. National Security: Crypto means India can’t be deplatformed**

As noted above, a recent bill introduced in the Indian parliament proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee. One of the likely justifications is to protect India's national security. But as we'll see, Bitcoin and allied decentralized technologies are actually essential to India's national security.

Bitcoin prevents financial deplatforming

First, some definitions. A digital rupee would be a centralized currency controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized international cryptocurrencies that no single actor has control over. The administrators of the digital rupee at RBI would be able to issue wallets, freeze accounts, and reverse transactions. But Bitcoin is more akin to digital gold, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.

It is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated 3,378 tons of gold from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.

Ethereum prevents social deplatforming

Similarly, for the same reason that Mexico, Germany, and France expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be national replacements for Twitter, but non-Indians won't be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That's what crypto permits.

Note that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too that millions of Indians are currently dependent on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like SWIFT, PayPal, or Google Pay.

What could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A fake photo of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the invasion of Brazil. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it's India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.

In short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the TikTok ban, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India's national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.

**3. Foreign Investment: Crypto brings capital to India**

A second concern often voiced as a rationale for the proposed crypto ban is that cryptocurrency will cause capital flight. But the opposite is true.

After all, what do Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Naval Ravikant, Chamath Palihapitiya, and countless CEOs, founders, angels, and venture capitalists have in common? They all support Bitcoin. So do Russian and Chinese ancestry entrepreneurs like Pavel Durov and Changpeng Zhao. The value of Bitcoin is something leaders in the global tech community agree on, like the internet or open source.

Estimates vary, but if and when Bitcoin hits $200,000 per BTC, my colleague Olaf Carson-Wee at Polychain Capital estimated that roughly 25-50% of the world's billionaires will come from cryptocurrency.

As such, if India bans cryptocurrency, it doesn't just criminalize the holdings of countless innocent Indians. It repels a trillion dollars in crypto capital from coming to India in the first place. The proposed crypto ban would itself cause capital flight.

And capitalist flight. Lest we forget, Indian entrepreneurs are highly mobile. Major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are already worth many billions of dollars; so are cryptocurrency mining companies and new digital currencies like Ethereum. All the Indian analogs to those services would happen overseas, as Indian founders are once again forced to move abroad.

Conversely, the right crypto policy would cause not capital flight, but capital landing. Visualize billions of dollars in cryptocurrency landing in India. And note that far-sighted technology capitals and financial centers like Switzerland and Singapore have taken positions that are highly favorable to cryptocurrency, because they want the world's top entrepreneurs and investors to alight in their country.

**4. Remittances &amp; Remote: Crypto enables the remote economy**

While thinking about crypto's impact on Indian capital flows, consider the following facts:

* 1.More than 400M Indians have recently come online thanks to Reliance Jio.
* 2. COVID means many more jobs can now be done over an internet connection.
* 3. India is already a world leader in business process outsourcing, earning \~$150B+ per year.
* 4. India is also the world's top recipient of remittances, receiving about $80B annually.
* 5. Cryptocurrencies work across borders, at the speed of the internet, and are globally popular with tens of millions of users worldwide. Here are some stats from 2019, before the current boom.

If you put those facts together, India is poised for an absolutely massive boom in remote work and remittances, with crypto serving as the conduit for large flows of money into the country to pay Indians for performing remote work.

Now, as a believer in global free trade, I think this will benefit both sides of the arrangement. But even a mercantilist would find it difficult to argue that a crypto-catalyzed surge in remote work and remittances is not at least in India's national interest.

**5. Strengthened Monetary Policy: A digital rupee backed by digital gold**

Another issue sometimes raised is that decentralized cryptocurrencies may hamper the Indian government's monetary policy. Yet the smart use of Bitcoin will actually strengthen India's monetary policy.

Begin by noting that monetary policy doesn't happen in a vacuum. Why does the Reserve Bank of India hold 600+ tons of physical gold? Because in an economic crisis, the rupee may need to be gold-backed. Well, by analogy, a digital rupee may need to be digital gold-backed.

Central banks in their own words on why they hold gold reserves: here. Table from here.

In more detail, every national currency trades against every other currency in a global foreign exchange market. Excessive money printing can devalue a currency. And this is part of the reason why central banks around the world say they continue to hold gold: because it's a hedge against inflation, highly liquid, a safe haven in a crisis, and internationally accepted.

That's why India holds 600+ tons of gold, worth tens of billions of dollars. And if it issues a digital rupee, it's going to want to acquire digital gold. Because the digital transformation of the economy won't just stop halfway. Digitization of national currencies will be accompanied by digitization of precious metal reserve equivalents.

That means the single highest value thing the RBI and the government could do for India today is not to ban Bitcoin, but to buy Bitcoin. Even a $3B purchase of BTC might appreciate to be on par with India's gold reserves given another 10X appreciation in the Bitcoin price. If RBI makes the right decision on Bitcoin in 2021, it could save India many billions of dollars by 2025. This is true even if the RBI doesn't want to peg the digital rupee to digital gold right away, but to simply hold BTC as a strategic reserve.

Remember also that India has had a multi-millennia long love affair with gold, and is the world's largest importer of gold. Gold was never a threat to India; gold has always been an asset for India. And Bitcoin is valuable for all the same reasons gold is valuable. It’s an internationally accepted store of value, it's highly scarce, and it's a so-called bearer instrument that can't be seized with a keypress. Like gold, it even has industrial utility; for example you can store files undeletably on a blockchain, or use it to prove the existence of a digital file for the purposes of establishing priority. But most importantly, like gold, Bitcoin will soon be the asset that sovereigns use to back or supplement their national digital currencies.

In short: digital gold is not a threat to India, digital gold is an asset for India, just like gold itself. And digital gold will be a crucial component of India's digital monetary policy.

**6. Deterring Financial Fraud: Crypto means mathematically provable accounting**

Deloitte thinks blockchain is a game-changer for accounting as it enables triple-entry bookkeeping.

Here’s a little known fact: the big four accounting firms (PwC, EY, KPMG, and Deloitte) now use Bitcoin and Ethereum as a gold standard of truth when auditing firms that engage in cryptocurrency transactions. See for example PwC's Halo, which ""interrogates the blockchain to independently and reliably gather corroborating information about blockchain transactions and balances.""

That corroborating information is trustworthy because blockchains, by their nature, use cryptography to create an immutable global record of who paid what money when to whom. So even if a company has a bug in its internal database of Bitcoin transactions, it can reconcile that payment by reference to the entry recorded on the blockchain!

Deloitte and others have called this triple-entry-bookkeeping, a ""game-changer"" for accounting, a way to ""vastly automate accounting processes in compliance with regulatory requirements."" It's perhaps the most important innovation in accounting since the invention of double-entry bookkeeping…which historians believe led to a little thing like the modern financial system!

The key concept is that on-chain accounting doesn't just make it easy to perform audits, it makes it easy to automate them. There are technologies like proof-of-reserve, for example, that allow firms to continuously certify that they have the needed cash on hand. This would prevent scenarios like the allegations in the Vijay Mallya episode, where false evidence of reserves was allegedly presented to gain access to loans. A blockchain-based loan platform (like MakerDao) would never get fooled by such a trick, because it requires cryptographically provable on-chain collateral.

If this sounds fancy, don't worry. The internet did too, once upon a time. The main takehome point is that blockchains reduce the burden on regulators by allowing them to write programs that certify that financial actors are continuously in compliance with regulations.

Blockchains also allow regulators to replay transactions for so-called market surveillance, to delegate some enforcement to smart contracts, and to even permit on-chain issuance and custody of stock certificates to enable real-time settlement. And as India contemplates permitting technology companies to enter banking, blockchain-based accounting can empower regulators to monitor their activities and conduct risk management.

By combining IndiaStack and the digital rupee, India could leapfrog the world by mandating on-chain accounting, payment, and stock issuance for all firms by 2030. Putting all financial flows on-chain would reduce corruption, increase trust in the financial system, and attract more foreign direct investment because international investors could be confident in the accounting.

In short, you can think of this as a regulatory flip. Just like the United States government initially sought to ban encryption in the 1990s, and then turned around to mandate it, so too could smart Indian regulators recognize that blockchains can actually prevent financial crime and increase trust in the system through mathematical, cryptographic proofs of compliance.

**7. Technological Development: Crypto is the financial internet**

Crypto is creating a financial internet. This CBInsights map is just a subset of what's happening.

As Marc Andreessen (creator of the graphical web browser) noted in 2014, the invention of the Bitcoin blockchain is comparable to the advent of the internet itself. Because if the internet was about sending information, blockchains are about transferring value. Specifically, until blockchains, we didn't have a digitally native representation of scarcity. Yes, you could copy data from one user to another through the internet, but you couldn't prove that the original user no longer had access to that data.

Blockchains solve this problem. The details are technical, but the end result is that you can now provably transfer assets between people over the internet, rather than simply copying data from computer to computer. And this works for virtually any asset. Just like the internet digitized books, movies, newspapers, and music, blockchains enable a financial internet that is digitizing currencies, commodities, stocks, bonds, real estate, and every imaginable variety of financial instrument.

A crypto ban would prevent all of that innovation from happening in India. It would cut India off from this financial internet, just as it's hit a trillion dollars in value. It is like banning the internet in the year 2000 or smartphones in 2010.

Just to underscore this point, decentralized finance is a rapidly growing alternative to Wall Street, and Indians would be locked out of the next stock market. Decentralized crowdfunding is a way to raise funding without access to American VCs, and Indian entrepreneurs would be prevented from using it. Bitcoin is displacing gold as a hedge against dollar inflation, and Indian investors would be prevented from adding it to their portfolios.

And these are just the applications that are already at scale! Waiting in the wings are concepts like:

User-generated capital. Right now users on social networks don't get paid for the content they generate. But new crypto-based tools allow creators to make money, not just social media corporations.

Decentralized data feeds. Today people pay for feeds of price data from companies like Bloomberg and Reuters. Chainlink and other crypto oracles have developed tools to put this kind of data – among others – on blockchains so it's freely visible to the world and accessible to any application.

User-controlled identity. Ethereum has been used to build an alternative to Facebook Login and Google Login called the Ethereum Name Service, which allows users to control their identity rather than Facebook and Google.

Decentralized stock markets. Engineers have figured out how to put stock prices, stock certificates, and capitalization tables on blockchains, which allow any country to build their own Wall Street.

User-controlled notifications. Two companies control push notifications to billions of smartphones: Apple and Google. But developers are building decentralized notification systems that are outside of American corporate control.

Decentralized social networks. Twitter and Facebook can deplatform anyone at any time, but blockchain developers are working on platforms controlled by users and communities instead of US companies.

You don't need to understand all these things to understand this: crypto is rapidly decentralizing power away from American corporations, and India has the talent to take advantage of this opportunity. But if Indians can’t even buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, let alone develop new smart contracts and crypto protocols, India will not be internationally competitive in the next generation of technology.

On the other hand, if India embraces and fully legalizes cryptocurrency, Indian entrepreneurs can build global protocols – not just companies – to fill the role that American technology companies are now abdicating to the world's surprise and dismay. The financial return from launching these protocols would come back to India to enrich the country, and the international usage of these protocols would strengthen India's reputation on the world stage.

**8. Digital Independence: Crypto is the open source alternative to foreign corporations**

The Indian government already encourages the use of open source over proprietary code when available:

The Government of India shall endeavour to adopt Open Source Software in all e-Governance systems implemented by various Government organizations, as a preferred option in comparison to Closed Source Software.

The government should prefer crypto APIs over corporate APIs for the same reason, because blockchains aren't just open source, they're also open state and open execution. That means:

Open source. Every user can view a blockchain's source code.

Open state. Every user has root access to the entire blockchain database.

Open execution. Every user can replay every action executed by a blockchain.

This is very different from a centralized service like Twitter. Twitter is closed state, so you can't download every tweet. It's also closed execution, so you can't look at Twitter's server to see what it's doing in realtime. This means Twitter can ban you from viewing its tweets, or downrank your tweets silently so that you don't know if people are seeing them.

Blockchains can fix this. Indeed, they've already fixed it by providing open source alternatives to many financial services. You can use Bitcoin instead of SWIFT, stablecoins instead of PayPal, crypto crowdfunding instead of Kickstarter, and much more.

[Defipulse.com](https://defipulse.com/) has a great list of all the ongoing open source finance action, but the point is simple: India should prefer crypto APIs as the open source alternative to corporate APIs whenever possible, just as it prefers the open source equivalent in other areas.

**9. Foreign Policy: India Should Back Neutral Crypto Platforms**

India is the #3 power in the world. It is not America, and it is not China. It should play a different game.

Right now, the US and China are on a financial collision course. The US wants all countries to accept the dollar, while China may push its digital yuan through the Belt and Road. Europe wants to stay out of this developing Cold War, but there isn't an obvious alternative yet.

The Decentralized Movement

India can reposition the non-aligned movement as a decentralized movement that advocates crypto protocols as a successor to the rules-based international order, beginning with its own financial system: a digital rupee backed by digital gold.

As noted in the Diplomat, India has already started to recognize that a renewed non-aligned movement will play a balancing role in the coming US-vs-China Cold War. And cryptocurrencies give an intellectual framework to economically align the otherwise disparate nations of this movement.

Unlike America and China, which will try pressuring nations to accept the dollar or digital yuan respectively, India can recognize that each country will ultimately want to use its own national currency domestically and a neutral platform internationally. Bitcoin and crypto protocols provide that neutral platform, a demilitarized zone suitable for international trade and communication, similar to the role that gold played in the past and that the Law of the Sea plays today.

Put another way, every nation not named America or China has the following preference ranking when it comes to the financial system.

Our country should be in charge (domestic national digital currency)

No one should be in charge (international cryptocurrency)

Others should be in charge, like the US or China (dollar or digital yuan)

This is true for India as well. Unlike the dollar or yuan, the digital rupee is not a candidate to become the reserve currency of the world. Thus, while India can be in charge of the digital rupee domestically, internationally it would prefer that no one be in charge – least of all the increasingly unpredictable US or China. And that equates to a preference for the use of cryptocurrency in international finance. Indeed, every sovereign that isn't the US or China will likely eventually align behind crypto for international trade because it's an acceptable second choice, a platform where you can't be deplatformed.

Digital Internationalism

This is a creative way of thinking about Indian foreign policy. India would still broadly line up with the West rather than China, but it would stand for the values of the West: free speech, free markets, and international law – all principles that the US has hastily abandoned and that China is in no hurry to pick up.

We should also remember that India is not a member of the UN Security Council. India is not a root user of the SWIFT system. India doesn't have Wall Street or Harvard or Silicon Valley or the New York Times. India really isn't that invested in the current system. But unlike the US, which has turned against the rules-based international order, and unlike China, which makes no bones about pursuing its national interest, India could adopt crypto to build new, provably fair digital institutions for billions around the world – a new Wall Street, a new SWIFT, a new Bretton Woods – just as it built IndiaStack for a billion Indians.

This would be digital internationalism, the pursuit of enlightened self-interest through international decentralized platforms. And it would play to India's strengths: software, finance, remittances, and above all the flexible and adaptable nature of the international Indian.

China could never make this leap, because China thinks about everything in terms of the narrow national self-interest of the Chinese people. That may be fine for them, but it is a turnoff to everyone who is not Chinese.

America likely can't make this leap either, at least not right now, because the East Coast establishment now loses in a world of truly free speech and free markets. Wall Street loses to random Reddit users without a thumb on the scale, and legacy media is outcompeted by social media in the absence of censorship. That's why the US establishment has soured on the values it once championed.

But India benefits from a game of free speech and free markets. The millions of Indians who emigrated to the US, UK, Canada, and Australia over the last 50 years did quite well in that game. With 400 million Indians newly online, in a newly remote world, India is poised to become even more formidable as a global exporter of software, finance, and media talent. Neutral crypto platforms will allow India to export these digital goods into every country, while simultaneously being provably fair to all parties. This is the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Unlike the US or China, India wouldn't just be playing to win, it'd be playing to win/win.

**10. India should buy Bitcoin, build a stockchain, attract crypto, and encourage decentralization**

To summarize, India is on the verge of banning a trillion dollar industry instead of using it to strengthen its national security, economy, currency, technology, and foreign policy.

But India's crypto ban has been reversed once before, and it's possible to envision a bold move here. Under Prime Minister Modi, the country shipped IndiaStack, ascended to #3 on the tech unicorn list, and leapfrogged the world in mobile data with Reliance Jio.

The next step is to demonstrate global leadership. As the world's third largest economy in PPP terms, India could lead a decentralized movement to develop provably fair crypto platforms, neutral international systems outside both American and Chinese control that all countries can embrace.

To get the ball rolling, Prime Minister Modi should:

* Create a digital rupee backed by digital gold. Shelve the proposed crypto ban and instead buy Bitcoin to back a digital rupee, making it the first national digital currency backed by digital gold. Even if the RBI doesn't want to peg the digital rupee to digital gold right away, it'll be useful to have BTC reserves as a backstop in a few years time.
* Add crypto to IndiaStack. Update IndiaStack to add on-chain accounting and a ""stockchain"", with the goal of putting the country's financial system – currency, payments, accounting, stocks, and more – entirely on-chain by 2030. With cryptographically provable financial statements, trust in Indian companies would rise and foreign investment would flow into the country.
* Attract crypto capital. Using the legislation passed in jurisdictions like Singapore, Switzerland, Wyoming, and Dubai as inspiration, create a crypto-favorable regulatory regime to attract tens of billions in capital to India.
* Encourage development of decentralized protocols. Encourage Indian entrepreneurs to build not just global companies, but global cryptoprotocols like Ethereum that can be trusted by any country expressly because they don't require trust.
* Help other nations with crypto. Recommend that India build its digital rupee and stockchain with an eye to exporting the designs to the rest of the world, either as services that others can use directly to work with the Indian economy or as blueprints they can fork to build their own versions.

India has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world's technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry.

The first step is simple: India should buy Bitcoin, not ban it.

It was clunky with bad liquidity, and only used by a few friends and hard core redditors who saw our posts in r/makerDAO.

&gt;The SX Token
Having proven a strong product-market fit, SportX is well positioned for its next chapter: community-led growth, control, and development.
The SX token (SX) will serve this purpose by aligning stakeholder and enabling decentralized governance that will guide SportX to a sustainable future. SX is an ERC-20 token that will exist simultaneously on the Ethereum and Matic networks.

[**Charles on the StableCoin**](https://i.imgur.com/t6X68ra.png)


And guess who is launching a stablecoin and ATM partnership this month? 

[**Ergo.**](https://i.imgur.com/Cgysghu.png)

Founded by Charles Hoskinson’s “favorite technologist” Alex Chepurnoy who contributed to the development of Cardano and started smartcontract.com (Chainlink). In an interview Hoskinson described Ergo as;

&gt;“one of the most revolutionary cryptocurrencies ever built. Got so many crazy ideas like non-outsourceable puzzles and sigma protocols and pruning the blockchain and roller chains. All this crazy stuff. Even has a proof of no premine.”

The partnership with Ergo could bring DEX, a true stableCoin, NFT auctions, and tons of other use-cases to ADA in the next few months - [sigmaverse.io](https://sigmaverse.io/)

**'Will ageU*D launch with gougen?**

&gt;'I'm gonna see if we can do an ageU*D port after we do native-assets, we already have a Plutus implementation. We're discussing a lot of legal/regularly stuff - It's definitely a high priority of mine because its interconnected for what we'd like to do for the next generation of Cardano and it's very important to pull those things together

Why not just use Cardano's network for this? Here's Charles answering 'are there use cases where PoW is better'

&gt;Until we deploy Orboros Genesis, PoW is significantly better and unique vs PoS - you don't need a checkpoint which is a huge advantage...and if you desire to gain a lot of computational abilities, especially with async resistance - PoW is better as you're building a supercomputer

**Cardano’s Stablecoin Will be ‘Better Than MakerDAO,’ Says Hoskinson**

&gt;“For example, we’ve partnered with Emrugo, and we're right now working on the logistics of a stablecoin with them that we're going to be building first on Ergo to verify everything works correctly, and then we'll pull it over into Cardano and this is going to be an algorithmic stablecoin,” said Hoskinson, adding, “We think it'll be significantly better than MakerDAO.”

**Nico Arqueros, the CTO of Emurgo, 5 months ago**
&gt;We are even working in bringing: – Oracles, Stablecoins and DEXes to Cardano! If you just follow us in Twitter would know half of this… we are releasing research videos almost every week. We want to unlock the potential of DeFi in Cardano and we believe that one of the best ways to do that is through a decentralized Stablecoin (Research + Implementation)

No affiliation with Ergo, I just like the coin. I'm also betting on [IOG/Emurgos other projects/partnerships](https://i.imgur.com/c2ZrNad.png)"

DeFi Pulse, in partnership with the digital asset modeling platform Gauntlet, has announced a rating system. 

It takes into account:

* user behavior
* collateral volatility
* protocol parameters
* the riskiness of the smart contract

## Points for projects

\+90 - a very reliable project, the chances of losses for those who deposit funds are extremely small. At the same time, this also means that the effectiveness of such investments (APY, etc.) will not necessarily be maximum. Low-risk investments are usually less profitable.

80-90 - safe, the chances of loss are quite small.

65-80 - there is a small chance of losing the deposit in extreme market conditions.

50-65 - there is a high chance of deposit losses in extreme market conditions.

less than 50 - a significant chance of losing the deposit in normal market conditions.

Aave and Compound have already been reviewed, the results being 95 and 91 respectively. MakerDAO is next to be reviewed.

They also clarify that these estimates are formed precisely from historical liquidity and volatility.

Gauntlet is currently evaluating the lending protocols. In essence, the company is auditing the project. They do not invest in it directly but build a model based on the smart contract.

To take into account the behavior of the price of coins in this model, a model is built based on the order books of various exchanges. By simulating thousands of price trajectories, Gauntlet can assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting and as a consequence, the risk in the protocol.

They also analyze the most risky collateral which is historical liquidity and volatility data, so as to determine the type of collateral that could cause problems.

Now this is only an ALPHA version, which means that not all risks are covered. The danger of low liquidity within the protocol is omitted, as well as:

* network overload and gas (at the moment gas is taken into account only conditionally)
* loans with multiple assets
* portfolio stress testing (as in traditional finance)
* protocol reserves (management could use it for payments)

I highly appreciate you reading the article till the end!

I look forward to when I can do the same thing on cardano. Would something like that need to be coded specifically, or can dapps like makerdao just use cardano’s ethereum importer/converter and hit the ground running?

I was curious if this is something we might see by the end of this month, or if it’s more realistic to not expect it for six months. 

Ive been in the crypto space since 2012, and Cardano has me excited like bitcoin used to. Such an amazing ecosystem!"

From the bottom link I was intrigued to see, if the revenue generated from Dai issuance was somewhat correlated to the MKR price since it is the source of the buy n' burn.  


According to the related pic, which is a screenshot from Makerburn. Then the two increases in Dai supply and MKR/USD seem to correlate. If that tells us that the marked believe that: 2b dai make MKR approx 2500USD worth and the two lines continue to correlate, then I believe we have a bright future ahead of us.

Note that it ""only"" took around 3 months to issue 1 billion additional Dai (from 1 til 2). And we have generated 7% of the next billion in just four days.

* More predictable gas fees, reducing user overpayment
   * “Shopping on Amazon is a lot easier than buying a house in a competitive real estate market. On Amazon, there’s no need to be strategic or second-guess yourself; you’re either willing to pay the listed price for the listed product, or you’re not” ([Section 4.2](http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf))
   * This will lead to better UX for users and applications
* Preventative maintenance to avoid possible future chain reorgs
   * In conditions where fees significantly outweigh block rewards, there is an ever present incentive for block producers to carry out short term reorgs to capture as much value as possible. Burning the BASE\_FEE removes this latent incentive.
   * Read more here: [On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf)
* Cements the role of ETH within the Ethereum crypto-economic system
   * Burning the BASE\_FEE adds a real and consistent cost to economic abstraction (paying for transactions out-of-band, or “off-chain”, in non-ETH assets)
* Will allow in-protocol congestion oracle
   * Once EIP-1559 is live, it will enable a native congestion oracle via [EIP 3198 2](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-3198.md) \- A useful tool for applications

**Possible Downsides**

* Technical complexity
   * Reforming the fee market for a live, value bearing chain like Ethereum is no small task. All client level issues aimed to de-risk it are [tracked here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Fee%20Market%20Meetings/mainnet-readiness.md).
* Miners are largely opposed to it, and are threatening to make the upgrade contentious
   * The BASE\_FEE burn, an integral part of the system, has led to miner opposition because it will reduce their income.

**Misconceptions**

* Lowering individual transaction fees
   * Transaction fees are a function of supply and demand, and this EIP does not attempt to increase average available blockspace or alternatively, reduce demand.
* BASE\_FEE burning is meant to punish miners
   * Burning the BASE\_FEE is the simplest mechanism to ensure the elastic blocksize is not gamed by miners. If not burnt, then miners could costlessly increase the blocksize while extracting maximum BASE\_FEEs from users, and recoup their sent losses.
* Increasing ETH price
   * While sometimes mentioned by proponents of this EIP, this is not a stated goal for any of the constituent mechanisms.  


Tim Beiko also [wrote a great explanation of the BASE\_FEE mechanism](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-does-makerdao-support-eip-1559/6646/29?u=tvanepps) and how it adjusts, so I will link it here.  


&gt;The increase of the base fee is linear across -12.5%/+12.5% the previous block’s base fee depending on the gas utilisation of the block (between 0% and 200%, the max allowed post-1559).  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If blocks are 0% full, the base fee goes down 12.5% compared to the previous block’s base fee;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If blocks are 100% full (i.e. gas used == target gas limit), the base fee stays the same;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If blocks are 200% full (the max allowed post-1559), the base fee rises 12.5% compared to the previous block’s base fee.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a 12.5% increase/decrease &amp; \~15 second block times, it takes roughly 5 minutes for the base fee to rise/lower 10x, 10 mins for 100x, etc."

Sentinel Network is a true p2p and decentralized VPN network.  What makes Sentinel different is that unlike other dVPNs, such as Orchid (OXT), Sentinel decentralizes both the back-end (by letting anyone host a node) and the front-end (by letting anyone build on top of the open sourced protocol). This allows existing centralized VPNs to switch to sentinel to reduce their costs for hardware hosting and liability to legal claims. It also allows any individual to build their own dVPN app on top of the network, one example being the Velocity App which is an App built on Sentinel with 50k downloads for Android. Currently the token has a diluted marketcap of 26M or $.013 per token.

Since Sentinel will be a income producing protocol we can use traditional market metrics, such as P/S ratio to determine a valuation for the SENT token. The SENT token can be staked to secure the network (similar to ATOM) which will receive block rewards as well as 20% of the income from dVPN nodes. Looking at other income producing dApps we can get a market average:

Sentinel recently announced the first traditional VPN company with over 5,000 paying users that will be transitioning to the Sentinel network. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lis7m4/pretty\_big\_ann\_today\_by\_pa\_that\_no\_one\_is\_talking/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lis7m4/pretty_big_ann_today_by_pa_that_no_one_is_talking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))

Sentinel's own dVPN app has over 100k downloads (android only) + Velocity has over 50k downloads as of December. Currently, both of these apps are free to use prior to Sentinel's mainnet. If we assume that 25% of these users convert to paying users then this would be another 37,500 users.

The average user spends $4.45/month on their VPN service. ([https://www.technipages.com/how-much-does-the-average-vpn-cost](https://www.technipages.com/how-much-does-the-average-vpn-cost))

Using this information we can estimate the Annual Revenue generated on the Sentinel Network based on current users and the announced company that is transitioning:

&amp;#x200B;

|App|Users|Monthly Revenue (Users \*$4.45)|Annual Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sentinel|25,000|$111,250|$1,335,000|
|Velocity|12,500|$55,625|$667,500|
|Transitioning VPN company|5,000|$22,250|$267,000|
|**Total**|**42,500**|**$189,125**|**$2,269,500​**|

&amp;#x200B;

Using the market average P/S of 188.61 this would value Sentinel at a marketcap of  $428,050,395.00 or $0.21 per token.

|Annual Revenue|Industry P/S|Marketcap|Price per token|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2,269,500|188.61|$428,050,395.00|$0.21​|

To get to $.30 per token there would need to be an additional 17,000 paying users on the Sentinel network:

|App|Users|Monthly Revenue (Users \*$4.45)|Annual Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sentinel|25,000|$111,250|$1,335,000|
|Velocity|12,500|$55,625|$667,500|
|Transitioning VPN company|5,000|$22,250|$267,000|
|*Future users needed*|*17,000*|*$75,650*|*$907,800*|
||59,500|$264,775|$3,177,300|
|||||
|Annual Revenue|Industry P/S|Marketcap|Price per token|
|3,177,300|188.61|$599,270,553.00|$0.30|

&amp;#x200B;

These are the catalysts that I think will generate user growth in the coming months:

1.) iOS app - The team has confirmed that the iOS app is days away from being launched. This alone I think could bring in the needed 17,000 users between the Sentinel iOS app and any 3rd party (velocity?) that could build their own iOS app on Sentinel. 

2.) Improved desktop application - The current desktop version is admittingly clunky and not user friendly. The new v3 client being built on Cosmos will have improved UI and functionality making which should increase user adoption and retention. Sentinel is the only dVPN with a windows and linux desktop application. 

3.) Marketing - the team has confirmed that marketing will begin with the launch of the iOS app. To date there has been no marketing spend and all users are from word of mouth and community efforts to promote Sentinel. [https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lma59i/were\_just\_getting\_started/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SENT/comments/lma59i/were_just_getting_started/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

To summarize, using the current market P/S for revenue generating cyrpto protocols and based on the current/anticipated users we can forecast a token price of $0.30 per token on Sentinel mainnet launch. This would be a 30x from current levels."

I don't know if it's the right place, but I have a small issues with the MakerDAO app: After been liquidated, I am trying to claim the remaining collateral. Unfortunately, after signing it successfully, the TX is never broadcast to the network, your app gives the error ""Claiming collateral failed"". I can click on a link to the etherscan TXID which doesn't exist, indicating that the tx is never properly broadcast or rejected every time.

ETH Progress since Genesis.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/lrg8wy/eth_progress_since_genesis/,Smithgift,284,2021-02-25 00:03:00,58,/r/ethfinance/comments/lrg8wy/eth_progress_since_genesis/,Strategy,"(crossposting from the daily.) 

Ethereum has come a long way in just a few years. I can tell you that--I ran an Ethereum node at Genesis.

All the way back in Frontier days...

* Transactions didn't exist, at least for the earliest few days. The chain was deliberately started with a gasLimit too low to actually do anything. Over time, there was a race to make the first transactions, then the first contracts...
* GUI Wallets did not exist. You had to use the JS console, and you had to be careful, because an early bug would send your ETH into nothingness if you left off the to field. After that, you still had to be careful because...
* ENS did not exist. But we thought it would be soon, so we didn't have address checksums, either. I don't think we even had the funky circle things.
* Block explorers barely existed. It's been a while, but I remember etherscan starting pretty early. But none of this verified contracts or token pages.
* Stablecoins did not exist. MakerDAO was just a twinkling in Rune's eye. There was a contract that hosted a list of the top ten movies, which could be altered by burning ETH. I suspect that list is now final. But of course stablecoins did not exist, because...
* ERC20 tokens did not exist. There was no standard on the chain, and everyone did what was right in his own eyes. If you're interested in history, you can check out the original issue and see a lengthy discussion on transferFrom vs. cheques. I was on Team Cheque, but in retrospect transferFrom was clearly right. In either case, it wasn't for years before there was a standard ERC20 template code.
* DeFi did not exist at all, unless you count the DAO.
* But maybe this was no surprise, because developing was a pain in the donkey. There were three languages available: Solidity, Serpent, and LLL. They all sucked in their own ways.
* Solidity was primitive--some time before Genesis I personally had discovered that the continue statement was bugged. There was no revert(), only throw (which did the same thing, but burned all gas). Constructors were named by naming a function the same way as the contract that held it. I'm not sure when SafeMath was a thing. Libraries were primitive; none of this using statements thing.
* Serpent was like Vyper, except really bad. I never used it, but Augur did. They commissioned an audit of the compiler, and the report was so bad they rewrote it all in solidity.
* No one used LLL.
* Toolchains did not exist. I remember manually linking contracts in JS.
* IDE support did not exist. There was mix, a buggy custom IDE which was notable because you could use it to simulate a blockchain. This was great, because...
* ganache did not exist. I remember starting a node on another computer to develop on, because...
* PoA chains didn't exist, either. That other node was PoW mining on its own chain.
* Neither ethers.js or web3.js 1.0 existed. Earlier versions of web3.js were callback based, or in certain horrifying cases synchronous. There were other issues.
* But let's say you got a functioning dapp. How did you get it to people? It was assumed that swarm would be functional at this point, but as it wasn't, you just had to somehow get the package to someone manually. (I'm not sure if this host-a-dapp-on-a-domain is the best solution here, but it is *a* solution.)
* Of course, neither metamask nor infura existed. You had to run your own node.
* At Genesis there was only geth, cpp-ethereum, and the python one, whose name escapes me. Parity/OpenEthereum came later. At one point there was a Java node. They were all pretty barebones--no fast sync, and definitely no warp sync. Don't even think about a light client.
* The EVM had issues. No CREATE2. DELEGATECALL didn't exist, but a broken version of it did that is now completely forgotten about. There were a lot more, although those are the biggest two.
* BONUS THING I REMEMBERED: Recovery phrases either did not exist, or were almost unused. You had a .json with your encrypted private key, and that was it.
* I will say one thing that existed back then and not now is innocence. Prior to the DAO hack, everything was perfect and amazing and nothing could go wrong. Now, millions stolen from a DeFi project going up in flames is not even noteworthy.
* And, of course, ETH was less than $1.

I think we can safely say the fundamentals have improved."

Pokazalo se da je **Fantom** veoma centralizovana mreža

Velika koncentracija glasačke moći u dva najveća validatora je izazvala probleme u radu ove stejking mreže.

Jedan  od ta dva validatora je juče zabagovao pa bio offline pa su se zbog  toga blokovi usporili oko 15h a oko 18h su totalno prestali da se  proizvode. Preko 5 sati nije bilo novih blokova.

Ova dva validatora imaju više od 1/3 glasačke moći cele mreže, jer su dosta popularni medju $FTM delegatorima.

Fantom fondacija je kontaktirala kritičnog validatora kako bi opet pokrenuli mreźu.

U  većini PoS sistema kao što je Fantom, entitet koji kontroliše preko 1/3  stejkovane sume ima moć da spreči mrežu da obradjuje transakcije. A za  reorganizaciju blokova treba 2/3.

Fantom fondacija je iznela predlog za izjednačeniju podelu stejka izmedju validatora.

Ministar  Viktor Karankevič je primetio da rudarenje rapidno raste u celom svetu  izdvajajući Kinu, SAD, Kanadu i Rusiju kao najveće ‘’rudnike’’.

Vlada Belorusije razmišlja u ovom pravcu već neko vreme, a predsednik Lukašenko ima pozitivan stav prema kriptovalutama.

Belorusija  pokušava da se dobro pozicionira na kripto tržištu i postane  crypto-friendly: doneseni su zakoni koji se tiču kriptovaluta, rudarenja  i trgovine, a najveća beloruska banka navodno razmišlja o pokretanju  kripto berze.

* FL buybacks and burn for USDFL earned

Currently, loans in Freeliquid Borrow are not charged with any interest rate (also called “Stability Fees”). At first look, it is beneficial to borrowers — their loans do not cost anything. However, it might incentivize users to hold USDFL loans for very long periods of time, preventing the return of USDFL back and thus affecting its price.

Adding an interest rate as additional USDFL for covering the debt will partially solve this issue and will also generate a revenue stream for the Protocol. The funds received can be spent on FL buybacks and subsequent burn, which will give FL utility as an earning token.

Please note that the Stability Fees can be introduced only through voting and will be discussed with the Freeliquid community beforehand.

**Introducing USDFL stabilization mechanism**

* Ensuring USDFL peg at \~$1

This is an ambitious but fully doable step that will help keep the USDFL market price at $1.00. The stabilization mechanism deserves a whole article to be explained but we will give a brief description.

One of the factors that can affect the USDFL price is the fact that users might take loans against their initial liquidity pool many times, over and over again. Each time this includes converting USDFL to other stablecoins like DAI or USDC. Obviously, this creates an unusual selling pressure to USDFL, driving its price down.

This proposal will add a possibility for other users to track positions with pools that have been borrowed against many times. If the USDFL starts moving down from $1, some of these positions can be forcefully sold for USDFL, thus driving its price back up. The user that got his LP position liquidated still retains his USDFL borrowed against this loan.

The mechanism is somewhat similar to Keepers in MakerDAO with few major distinctions. It is possible to avoid almost any financial loss to users that got their LP tokens liquidated. Only market players with locked FL will be eligible to liquidate such positions. If one wants to liquidate larger positions and profit more, one has to lock FL for a longer period of time as well. This will prevent possible “liquidation attacks” and also add more utility to the FL token.

# Conclusion

We hope that we have shed some light on the project’s closest future. Of course, the developer team has plans for Q3-Q4 as well but we would like to keep them undisclosed until the time is right. Moreover, the crypto industry is too volatile and the team does not want to give empty promises to our fellow users. Instead, we will adjust as best as we can to any state of the market."

I just couldn't accept this. I love Maker, to the point that I hate to see this and open a thread to rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah I know DAI is growing fast but others are growing faster. Yeah I know Binance it's centralized so it's a meh, but, is hard to swallow this fact

&amp;#x200B;

Can MakerDAO perhaps considering not being so conservative in terms of scaling and growing of DAI? Looking at ETH-B, there is a huge demand, but the debt ceiling has been hit for a while now and the governance is not considering increasing it due to the worry of huge liquidation, debt risk etc. Can the worry be re-considered? We are likely in a bull market now, it is a good time to grow DAI. If ETH were to soar, people will want to leverage with ETH-B. Other platforms like Compound AAVE also has similar collateralization ratio with ETH-B, and they are doing well. 

 

On another note, there are some emergency vote to increase debt ceiling recently and have to wait 2 days for the GSM. This has really limited DAI growth in terms of speed. Since now Maker is resistant to flash loan for voting now, why not considering lowering the GSM, so that all executive votes can be executed faster?"

Alchemix Finance is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform and community DAO. The platform gives you advances on your yield farming via a synthetic token that represents a fungible claim on any underlying collateral in the Alchemix protocol. The DAO will focus on funding projects that will help the Alchemix ecosystem grow, as well as the greater Ethereum community.

&amp;#x200B;

Components

&amp;#x200B;

Vaults Vaults act as the hub to generating yield advances, and share many similarities to lending platforms such as MakerDAO and AAVE. The first collateral type that the protocol will accept is DAI.

Transmuter The Transmuter allows users to stake their synthetic assets and have them be converted into their base asset over time.

Token Distribution The Alchemix governance token (ALCX) will split among the developers, the DAO itself, and the community, with the vast majority going to the community.

Alchemix DAO The governance of Alchemix Finance will be managed by a DAO with a liquid governance token, ALCX.

Brief introduction to some of the top DeFi protocols,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/m0v30z/brief_introduction_to_some_of_the_top_defi/,charmcitycuddles,1,2021-03-09 09:06:40,51,/r/defi/comments/m0v30z/brief_introduction_to_some_of_the_top_defi/,,"Hi all,

I've put together a list of some of the top DeFi projects along with a brief explanation of each:

**Maker DAO** - Lending/Borrowing

MakerDAO is a decentralized system for collateralized loans that people can lock up their ETH in to receive the DAOs stablecoin, DAI. When someone locks up ETH, they are able to take out a loan of a smaller amount in DAI, which is pegged to the US dollar. A deposit of $1000 ETH would allow the user to take out a loan of roughly $650. When the person wants to get their ETH back, they simply pay back their loan along with any fees.
The native token of this protocol, MKR is used in a twofold manner. It primarily acts as a form of support for the loan system as the price of ETH drops. When too many loans are liquidated at once, MKR is created and sold to pay off the loans, as well as bought back from proceeds from liquidation fees. It also serves an additional role as a governance token allowing holders to vote on how high fees should be and which types of collateral should be accepted by the system’s smart contracts.
Maker has become one of the flagship protocols in the DeFi boom but as we saw with markets crash caused by Coronavirus, there remains significant risk investing/pooling money in these protocols which can suddenly become destabilized due to unpredictable events. Though Covid isn’t the first existential crisis Maker has faced, having dealt with hacks in the past, the community has continued to persist and has shown impressive resilience to move past these troubles, often coming out stronger and with a more guided roadmap. It is the largest DeFi protocol by locked value at $6.57 billion.

**Aave** - Lending/Borrowing

Aave is a decentralized network of collateralized lending pools run by smart contracts that allow people to freely lend or borrow crypto. In December 2020, they rolled out version 2 of their protocol. Previously when holders provided crypto for collateral on loans, it was locked in to that collateral. The new update allows users to easily transfer their collateral from one coin to another without having to repay their loan or pull it out of Aave. This increases people’s ability to manage liquidation risk by being able to swap their collateral if the original asset began falling in price.
The governance token, AAVE, is used by holders to determine various changes to the rules and policies of the protocol. Holding the token also provides the user various bonuses such as reduced fees/rates, higher borrowing limits, and advance access to certain pools. Aave has also innovated “flash loans”, uncollateralized short term loans that are issued and settled within the same block of transactions.
Aave’s version 2 is far from the end for this project. CEO Stani Kulechov has mentioned that upcoming changes will improve and add additional nuance to both governance and its flash loans, while also working to reduce gas fees across the board.

**Yearn Finance** - Asset Managent

Yearn Finance is a DeFi protocol that gives users yTokens in exchange for crypto deposits that are then lent out via various other services such as Aave or Compound for the highest rate of return. Yearn.finance was created by Andre Cronje who promptly gave up the protocol and transferred governance to a smart contract that requires a supermajority to institute changes. There is a fixed supply of 30,000 YFI tokens.
Yearn.finance automatically reallocates investors’ funds and finds them the highest yield across various DeFi products. In other words, it gives the average crypto investor access to more advanced strategies through a user friendly user interface. It’s name recognition and ease of use will ensure that as the space continues to grow, it will remain as many investors’ first introductions to field farming strategies.
Though in itself not high risk, Yearn searches a number of high yield bearing products that can oftentimes lead to investors’ funds being put into instruments they may not personally be comfortable with. Though these may not be entirely “unsafe”, It’s fair to ask whether many of the new investors being introduced to DeFi via Yearn would feel comfortable if they knew some of the riskier strategies their funds were subject to. Additionally, the nature of crypto’s rapidly changing market conditions can lead to volatile price swings across the market and the value of yield farming assets are always at risk of becoming worthless.

**Uniswap** - Decentralized Exchange

Uniswap is the most popular and most used decentralized exchange (dex) built on Ethereum. It made headlines last summer when it surprised early users by airdropping 400 UNI tokens (roughly $1,200 at the time) to anyone who had used the platform. The UNI token is used to govern the Uniswap exchange and holders can vote on various proposals and will eventually be the sole decision makers of Uniswap. People can use Uniswap to trade any token built on Ethereum and can also provide Eth and other tokens to supply liquidity, earning fees and sometimes other rewards.
At one point Uniswap held 20% of all funds locked in DeFi protocols and had nearly 50,000 daily users and it still remains hugely popular. Due to the surprise airdrop, the token is widely distributed among the crypto community. It’s also one of the most popular platforms users are introduced to deeper DeFi concepts such as liquidity pools and yield farming.
Many Uniswap users not only use the exchange for swapping their tokens, but also to earn rewards by providing liquidity. Many of these rewards provide outstanding returns which is incredibly enticing. However there’s an underlying risk to it that many people don’t understand well. It’s called Impermanent (or Divergence) Loss and it occurs when the price of the pooled token moves far from the price the user initially provided it for.When the Automated Market Maker sells tokens to maintain the desired ratio, the underlying amounts provided are sightly affected. This risk is often offset by the fees and rewards earned, but could present a significant risk in a volatile market.

**Synthetix** - Derivatives

Synthetix allows holders to stake their SNX tokens to create on-chain synthetic versions of real world assets such as gold, foreign currencies, and recently oil. It also allows holders to create shorting products such as iBTC or iETH. Synthetix was founded by Kain Warwick, having raised nearly $4 million in private funding from Framework Ventures. Governance was originally handled by a foundation which has since been dissolved and replaced by three decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that SNX holders can vote on decisions for the future of the protocol.
Synthetix had over $800 million in total locked value at its height and continues to hold above $700 million staked with over $125 million in circulating synthetic assets. Their success shows the strong demand for the ability to trade censorship free real world assets on-chain and they continue to research, develop, and release new products. Their inverse products (iEth, iBTC, iOIL etc..) are a unique way to introduce shorting strategies to DeFi newcomers as each iSynth token has an entry point, an upper limit, and a lower limit at which point the price is frozen and the inverse asset’s holder is liquidated into a USD pegged stablecoin to help manage risk. Sythentix’s strategy of bridging traditional legacy assets and new digital assets through these innovative products presents a strong case for SNX as the space develops and matures.
One of the downsides to Synthetix is its unusually high collateralization ratio, requiring 750% of staked SNX to the value of the Synth asset. Additionally SNX is more volatile than other assets such as ETH which can lead to higher risk when it comes to keeping your ratio intact. Though staking ETH is available, it offers none of the reward incentives that SNX does.

**Compound** - Lending/Borrowing

Compound is a decentralized crypto lending and borrowing protocol run by algorithms and smart contracts. Anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet such as MetaMask can supply their crypto or borrow assets at interest rates set by real time supply and demand. This allows people to lend and borrow without having to negotiate terms through a middle man such as a bank. When people deposit their crypto funds into Compound, they are provided c-tokens (cETH, cDAI etc) which represent a claim to their portion of the asset pool. Similar to other DeFi protocols, loans are overcollateralized. That is, you must provide more value in crypto as collateral than you can borrow a loan for.
Compound was initially started as a company by Robert Leshner and funded by VC, but since the release of the COMP token has been gradually decentralized handing control and governance to the community. Votes have been held to add coins, adjust interest rates, and various other improvement proposals.
One of the inherent risks in Compound’s model is the risk taken on by borrowers who use the funds to buy more of their collateral. If an investor deposits ETH, then uses their loan to buy more ETH, a sharp drop in the price could lead to not only a call on their loan, but also complete liquidation of their collateralized ETH. Overall, Compound is fairly simple to use and understand which will continue to allow it to be a major player in the DeFi community as more people and institutions join the space.

**RenVM** - Assets and Derivatives

A major problem with the current DeFi system (and really, the overall crypto space) is interoperability. That is, roughly 75% of the total crypto market cap is outside of the Ethereum blockchain and thus not able to participate and interact with the current major DeFi protocols. RenVM is trying to solve this by wrapping outside assets, acting as a decentralized version of BitGo’s WBTC. Someone who holds bitcoin can send their BTC to RenVM which acts as a decentralized custodian, and then issues them the Ethereum token renBTC which is backed, and has the same value as BTC. Not limited to just Ethereum, RenVM can provide this service for just about any digital asset and smart contracting platform.
RenVM’s token, REN is used as a bond to act as a validator “darknode” on the network. It requires 100,000 REN to register and run a node which is locked into a smart contract and not returned until the person deregisters their node. This encourages good behavior from participants. Every time an asset is transferred across chains, a fee is taken which is paid out to the darknode operators.

**Kyber Network** - Decentralized Exchange

Kyber Network is a decentralized exchange and payments tool that allows people to instantly swap their tokens for other tokens without having to deal with a centralized order book. It makes use of pools of crypto funds called “reserves” that allow for several routes to convert the tokens, ultimately finding the best price. Though similar to Loopring, the Kyber Network has a main exchange interface and swaps the token instantly, while Loopring is the underlying protocol and network of many exchanges, and functions as an orderbook.
When converting ETH into another token, the Kyber smart contract first asks various reserves to get the best exchange price. Then, you’ll see the exchange rate and decide whether or not to go through with a swap. If you proceed, you will send 1 ETH to a Kyber smart contract. Once received, the reserve will do an on-chain exchange and your account will be credited with your token of choice. When converting one ERC20 token to another, Kyber uses ETH as the intermediary. That is Token A -&gt; ETH -&gt; Token B.
KNC is the native token of Kyber and reserve holders must pay for their right to manage the reserves with KNC. Holders can also stake their KNC to the KyberDAO which gives them governance rights as well as returning a staking reward. Additionally, it allows vendors who accept cryptocurrency to accept a wide variety, but still get paid in their preferred currency. The Kyber Network works as a service in these types of transactions.

**Loopring** - Decentralized Exchange and Layer 2

Loopring, though similar to Kyber, is unique in this list as it is a decentralized exchange protocol, not a dex itself. What this means is that Loopring allows anybody to build a custodial order-book based exchange on Ethereum (or any other smart-contract platform) and Loopring then combines the pools on those into one massive pool and matches orders across these separate exchanges built using Loopring’s structure and participating in the network. Additionally, when you place your order, your coins remain yours until the order is executed. Your coins aren’t locked into the order book and you can cancel or adjust your order as you please.
Those responsible for matching these orders, miners, are compensated for their work in LRC, and they are incentivized with higher rewards for finding better exchange rates. Loopring is also unique in that it is a Layer Two solution. That is, all transactions and trades take place *off chain* and thus the fees for trading are astronomically lower than Ethereum's during busy times, the downside being that it takes a bit of extra knowledge, and the desire to actually move your crypto there.

**Balancer** - Decentralized Exchange

Balancer is an automated market maker similar to Uniswap in that people can provide their crypto to liquidity pools to earn rewards, but differentiated by the concept that Balancer allows people to create their own Liquidity Pools with up to eight assets pooled instead of just two. The creator of the pool arbitrarily sets the weights of the underlying assets which are automatically rebalanced as the prices fluctuate to maintain the weight. This basically allows anyone to create their own self balancing index fund or invest in someone else’s. A downside to this is increased divergent loss as the prices of the various assets can fluctuate more broadly than is possible with just two assets provided at 1:1. It also leaves open big arbitrage opportunities as there is no oracle integration to bring in outside prices, thus the prices in the pools only change when someone makes a trade.
BAL is the governance token for this protocol and as the protocol develops, BAL holders will be able to “help guide the protocol to its fullest potential.” Balancer specifically names some goals such as deploying the protocol on blockchains other than Ethereum, implementing layer two solutions, introducing fees at the protocol level to generate revenue, and more as examples of actions BAL holders can make.

A few weeks ago, I told you to prepare for the changes coming in March. It’s March, and those changes have arrived.  
We’re speeding up the race to decentralization, increasing the scope of privacy, and publishing more documentation and information than ever before. There are only so many hours in a day, so we’re going to use those hours to perfect what we have before jumping into new products.

A few key things to be looking for in the coming month(s) include a new, much more informative website, more comprehensive documentation on tech, more clarity on what’s open source and when the rest will become open-source, and rolling out network upgrades like slashing and privacy v.2.

Be sure to take part in the discussions on these things happening around the forum at [we.incognito.org](http://we.incognito.org/). It’s how you shape privacy going forward.

**I.** **Project overview**

Swipe is a fiat channel for digital assets where users can trade various digital assets in real time with fiat money. It is designed to ""make digital assets the mainstream through the establishment of fiat channels."" Swipe wallet allows users to transfer, store and withdraw crypto assets. Through Swipe's Visa debit card, users can consume digital assets in their wallets in the form of fiat money.

SXP, the functional token of Swipe, is mainly used as the transaction fee, trading medium, and vouchers of discounts in transaction fees for users. In the Swipe system, 80% of transaction fees will be publicly burned on the chain.

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Business Model**

**2.1 Business model**

The Venus protocol was developed by the Swipe wallet, which Binance acquired earlier last year. Venus, a decentralized stablecoin system, is a currency market protocol that aims to introduce a fully decentralized lending system into the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to enable fast and low-cost transactions. In addition, based on the Binance smart chain, Venus will also mint the decentralized stable currency VAI backed by a basket of BEP-20 tokens. Venus can be taken as a hybrid of MakerDAO and Compound, which attempts to reshape the cross-border financial system and strengthen the financial collaboration in the global supply chain.

**2.2 Token economy**

1) Token information

Token name: SXP

Token type: ERC-20

Contract address:

0x8ce9137d39326ad0cd6491fb5cc0cba0e089b6a9

2) Token functions and distribution

The Swipe team decided to limit the maximum supply of SXP to 300 million units. However, as the tokens are burned, the total supply will be gradually reduced until it reaches 100 million units.

https://preview.redd.it/97imspsy7km61.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac81ebed799de34a034a0c1764ef0406c6cf7b4

SXP Distribution Model

As the functional token of Swipe, SXP has five main functions, namely:

① Transaction fee

② Network gas

③ Trading medium

④ Staking certificate

⑤ Voucher for the user to obtain a discount on transaction fees

In the Swipe system, 80% of transaction fees will be publicly burned on the chain.

&amp;#x200B;

**II.** **Exchanges Supported**

Currently, Swipe is supported by CoinEx, Binance, KuCoin, Bittrex, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**III.** **Team profile**

Swipe was established by Joselito Lizarondo in 2018. The team members are experienced in the fields of cryptocurrency and electronic payment. Most of them used to work for well-known international companies such as Binance, VISA, Apple, Samsung, and Google.

https://preview.redd.it/ylth8ku38km61.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8428926a50a04faa468985fa24af10ea5d320c2d

Swipe is headquartered in the Philippines and is currently available in 28 countries/regions in the European Economic Area. It supports fiat currency transactions in Euros, British pounds, U.S. dollars, South Korean won, and Philippine pesos.

In July 2020, Binance announced the completion of the acquisition of crypto startup Swipe. In November of the same year, the start-up Fincofex (later renamed SwipeX), which was acquired by Swipe, announced that it had obtained the master membership of UnionPay International and could directly issue debit cards to consumers and businesses. Swipe plans to integrate this function in early 2021 and launch branded UnionPay cards. (Fincofex has previously obtained Swift membership which allows it to process Swift remittances. It is also a major member of MasterCard in the UK and the European Economic Area and can issue debit cards for businesses)

&amp;#x200B;

**IV.** **Code Overview**

According to the Github open-source code, Swipe currently has 10 main code bases. Among them, code bases of the asset module, Venus protocol module and BSC network module are updated frequently. Overall, the Swipe code base is relatively simple and clear.

[Swipe’s open-source code. Source: Github](https://preview.redd.it/hggixnn78km61.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286ac1c22e57ca1ccacd1ff6c67bec56de762f87)

&amp;#x200B;

**VI.** **Risk Evaluation**

On January 14, 2021, Venus was hit by a major security incident. The Venus development team (i.e. the Swipe development team) has issued a new cross-chain project CANNON (cannon.finance), which sells 80 million CAN to private equity investors for a price of $0.02/unit. These tokens could only be used for mortgage lending but not for sale. Later it sold another 100 million CAN to public investors for the same price. After that, Venus announced its support for CAN as collateral, with a mortgage coefficient of 60%, and the mortgage price was determined to be US$0.35 (17 times the price in the private placement). Shortly after, someone deposited CAN “worth US$150 million” to Venus and borrowed the highly liquid assets on the platform, leaving huge losses to ordinary users. Although the ""buyer"" has returned the borrowed assets and the Swipe team has also deposited its own 2000 BTC and ETH into the protocol as a relief, this incident has exposed serious loopholes in its risk control mechanism. Fortunately, Venus has already started to follow 100% decentralized governance."

A lot of things coming this month/year! 

UniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts. 

They will add digital assets outside of the current DeFi ecosystem. There are over 6000 tokens listed on coinmarketcap and only 30 are on Aave, Compound and MakerDao. So there is a big gap there. 

Furthermore they will add trading and lending and borrowing. I really think this is a strong asset for the near future and if they deliver easy top 100 token.

When life turns into a dumpster fire, the best thing we can do is grab our sticks and marshmallows and make s’mores. This week, **inccry** was a shining example of that.

This week, we continued restructuring the Incognito paradigm and fortifying the foundations of privacy, and we’ll continue that effort in the weeks ahead. Our goal is to bring clarity to every facet of the project, and decentralize and open-source even more of the project. Continue sharing your feedback and ideas, and watch for new avenues we’re introducing for you to influence privacy moving forward.

Your role as a protector of privacy is about to get much more intensive, so stay in touch. There’s no need to go at it alone, there’s an entire community of helpful people at [we.incognito.org](http://we.incognito.org/) and in the app’s Community tab.

A while back I uploaded a sourcecred post since maker is a dao and a dao is as strong as the community backing it, the more feedback we get the better we are and we need people giving constructive feedback on proposals, making proposals and spreading the concept of what maker dao is. Specially now that the core units are being developed. 

Now the poll is pretty simple and it´s purpose is to get a grip on how to better channel the communication.

Of course it would be awesome if you could also include some comments, for example if you heard of it but you are not interested why is it? or if you haven´t heard of it but you are interested what would you need to know? Or any related matters to sourcecred for that matter.

* The Alonzo Testnet will finally allow developers to deploy their own decentralized applications on the Cardano blockchain.
* The Alonzo Testnet, which will bring smart contracts to the Cardano (ADA) blockchain, could go live as soon as April, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of the network’s developer IOHK, revealed during the Cardano360 virtual conference yesterday.
* Hoskinson claimed that the Testnet would launch at the end of April or in early May. ""For the first time ever, publicly, people will be able to write smart contracts and deploy them on Cardano,"" he said.
* Per the revealed rollout plan, the Alonzo upgrade will come in the form of a hard fork this spring. Initially, smart contracts will be available for testing purposes only, with the full mainnet launch slated for August.
* The addition of smart contracts marks a major milestone for Cardano, since it will finally make the blockchain a viable competitor to Ethereum. Since last summer, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has boomed, building on a wide array of decentralized applications (DApps)—all of which are based on smart contracts.
* Now, the same functionality is coming to Cardano. As an example, the blockchain’s developers have presented a Cardano-native dapp that allows users to swap different tokens—much like Ethereum’s “killer dapps” such as Uniswap.
* According to DeFi Pulse, the total value locked in DeFi currently amounts to nearly $40 billion. Meanwhile, major platforms such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, and many others are all based on Ethereum’s smart contracts. And with the launch of Alonzo, Cardano will be able to expand into this multi-billion market as well."

[LITT.VN](https://LITT.VN) (ASK @ 0.08)

Roadman Investments Corp.  licensee A3Com Solutions Corp. (""A3Com"") **is pleased to announce that it is entering into strategic partnerships with SATO, a next generation of Stablecoin.**

iCashRewards is very happy to partner with SATO to apply SATO to the iCashRewards ecosystem that combines the utility token (""iCashToken"") with the rewards of a loyalty point that rebates customers for use of iCashRewards eCommerce shopping platform and services. 

iCashToken is planning to merge with SATO. 

Each user from iCashRewards can redeem their iCash Loyalty points ( iCashPoints) with Sato. 

One iCashToken can be exchanged with 1 SATO. 

Each SATO is priced at $1.00, and the exchange will be effective from March 31 to April 15, 2021. 

Going forward, iCashPoints can continue to redeemed cash, USDT, BTC as well as SATO.USDT. SATO is planning to list on various exchanges on April 14, 2021.

**Background**

The crypto industry has seen the rise of various Stablecoins in the last few years. 

These Stablecoins have been built in different ways. 

USDC, HUSD, TrueUSD are backed by fiat USD DAI, Frax, OUSD are collateral based.

SATO is a Stablecoin that is neither fiat backed or collateral based. 

It is purely algorithmic and relies on market forces of supply and demand to maintain its price.

**Current Status of Stablecoin Market:**

Compared with many DeFi projects that attract users to speculate simply by relying on high mining returns, the future application scenarios of algorithmic stablecoins have more room for imagination. 

Currently, the entire algorithmic stablecoin market is still in a stage where its value is heavily underestimated, which is similar to the collateralized stablecoins such as MakerDao in early 2019. 

It is expected that the market will break out.

**AMPL, Basis Cash, ESD, Frax**

At present, the market value of DeFi is growing rapidly and there are countless projects. 

However, there are still no more than ten products that are available for use in the algorithmic stablecoin market. 

The well-known algorithmic stablecoins include AMPL, Basic Cash, ESD and Frax. Among them, only the prices of AMPL and Frax can be maintained around 1 USD. 

Although AMPL's algorithm has been modified several times by latecomers, it is still in the leading position of algorithmic stablecoins, which is similar to the position of PoW in the main chain.

 Therefore, the current single currency inflation &amp; deflation model (rebase) of AMPL has been tested by the market.

**What is SATO?**

SATO is a next generation algorithmic stable coin. SATO relies on the invisible market forces of supply and demand to maintain its price stability. 

USD and collateral backed Stablecoins have various flaws and are not suited to the crypto ecosystem.

USD backed Stablecoins rely on the broken monetary infrastructure of central banks to provide stability. As a result, the Stablecoin's stability is derived from the backed currency itself. 

Similarly, collateral backed Stablecoins use other Stablecoins with USD backed collateral. Thus, the underlying system is still reliant on the flaws of USD backed Stablecoins.

SATO doesn't rely on any centralized fiat currency such as USD. It can maintain its price stability algorithmically via smart contracts.

""We are very excited to see the users from iCashRewards have the ability to redeem the first DeFi revolutionary stablecoin SATO (""SATO"") and a Roadman subsidiary will mine the SATO through the SATO's liquidity pool once it is opened. 

We like the name ""SATO"" as it is an inspiration from Satoshi Nakamoto, a name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation,"" states Luke Montaine, CEO of Roadman Investments.

Two Flavors of Giveth.. Which One to Choose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/giveth/comments/mhd03j/two_flavors_of_giveth_which_one_to_choose/,mackerel_runner,1,2021-04-01 02:56:03,0,/r/giveth/comments/mhd03j/two_flavors_of_giveth_which_one_to_choose/,,"&amp;#x200B;

[Giveth TRACE and Giveth.io landing pages](https://preview.redd.it/q34fd0ynteq61.png?width=3615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaccd86ad4805fd8bbc41e98eff1171656fb6915)

***TL;DR*** 

## Giveth TRACE

* Allows for donations on macro and micro levels via Communities, Campaigns, and Milestones
* Has a system of oversight to prevent misuse or fraud
* Donations accepted in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC, and USDC
* Curated Donor Funds via ‘Liquid Pledging’
* Giveth doesn’t charge any fees, in fact we pay the fees to send funds to the recipient
* Works with MetaMask

## Giveth.io

* Streamlined project creation accessible for all
* Multi-wallet functionality
* Peer-to-peer transactions
* Giveth doesn’t charge any fees
* Fiat donations via Torus On-ramping
* ETH and ERC-20 token donations
* Donate on **xDai** and save on gas

Three key distinguishers of the Giveths are: ***Trust***, ***User Experience,*** and ***Scope***. Let’s dive in.

# Trust

First up let’s talk about Trust. Giveth TRACE (Originally Giveth Beta) was launched in 2017. Following [the great DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) from the previous year, the burning question at the time was: how do we make these new decentralized innovations resilient and trustworthy? Giveth itself was on the frontlines of these events and set out to solve these issues.

Giveth TRACE employs smart contracts to handle various transparency-oriented functions of the platform. These interactions happen on the blockchain, including traceable donations, escrow, and dispersal of funds. It uses Milestones for specific projects or goals that can have conditions outlined for funds to be released. An example would be to prove work was done on a project or that money was spent to acquire something specific. The milestone contract is employed to act as an escrow. A milestone creator can designate a recipient other than themselves and also a reviewer. The reviewer of a milestone is responsible to assure that any stated expectations were completed before authorizing the smart contract to release the funds to the recipient.

The new Giveth DApp does not use smart contracts to facilitate donations but instead provides a true peer-to-peer experience where funds go directly from donor to receiver. The resulting transaction is eternally scribed onto the blockchain. There are no escrow or reviewer functions on the Giveth.io DApp so while donations are much more direct, you are encouraged to do your due diligence before donating.

# User Experience

Following the rise of ‘cryptokitties’ and the mooning of the price of ETH in 2018, the Rinkeby test network was implemented on Giveth TRACE to resolve absurd gas fees and scalability issues. This allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Dapp for no actual fees, using only gas on Rinkeby to execute the majority of contract transactions. In fact, Giveth actually pays the fees to send your donations to mainnet. 

&amp;#x200B;

[“The Rise and Fall of Ethereum circa 2018 AD”  Image Source: medium.com](https://preview.redd.it/h1iyencfueq61.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db62919d5d7e9496e45a55ad3797cc35c89136ba)

Profile creation on Giveth TRACE is facilitated by smart contract interactions on Rinkeby and is reasonably straightforward, however is currently limited to MetaMask. Giveth TRACE currently allows donations in ETH, DAI, PAN, WBTC and USDC.

Giveth.io has expanded giving capabilities by allowing donations in ETH and any ERC-20 Token on Mainnet and [**xDai network**](https://www.xdaichain.com/)! The [Giveth.io DApp](https://giveth.io/) uses Onboard.js to permit virtually any Ethereum wallet to be used for donations. Project creation has been streamlined, so creators can sign-in, make a project and start collecting funds literally in minutes. For creating a profile you may choose between standard MetaMask login or Torus Wallet. Torus Wallet also provides a crypto on-ramping feature so you can convert your cold-hard cash into cryptocurrency very easily and get to donating in the digital age. [More Info on Torus wallet can be found here.](https://docs.tor.us/)

# Scope

Scope is the last, but perhaps coolest, distinction I want to mention. Giveth TRACE has **huge** scope: its donation hierarchy is broken down into Communities (formerly known as DACs), Campaigns, and Milestones. Donations made to Communities and Campaigns are stored in a ‘pledge’ vault. The Community or Campaign manager can then delegate your pledge into the Campaign or Milestone, respectively, of their choosing. This system created by Giveth has coined the term ‘Liquid Pledging’ and in effect allows for curated donor funds. This means would-be donors can make non-custodial contributions to causes that they care about and funds can find their way to the right place at the right time. Once your funds have been delegated you’re able to track where they went on Giveth TRACE.

Giveth.io Dapp aims to provide a simpler experience. While not achieving the same scope of Giveth TRACE it is much easier to navigate. Donations made on Giveth.io go straight A → B and the project owners themselves dictate the scope by the projects they choose to create.

The new Giveth is straightforward if you’re looking to make simple donations peer to peer without any added complexity but with more connectivity. Giveth TRACE allows you to define how broad or narrow your donations are while maintaining a high standard of transparency and checks on fund flow. Each has specific advantages in terms of collecting donations. Check out both and decide which flavor suits your taste; [Giveth TRACE](https://beta.giveth.io/) or [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/)."

This translates to my profits increasing significantly than what it what was before.   
What's even better is that to support the Freeqliquid project in its initial stage, the fees (interest) is set to 0% and liquidation is impossible (and guaranteed) since you can't possibly get liquidated with stablecoins.

An undervalued project with ambition that is on steam and is hitting goals on a weekly basis.

## In short

From simple payment requests to fully compliant digital currency invoices. Request helps you to get paid in crypto while providing full control over your financial data.

And i'm not going to write out their whole website for you just have a look at [https://request.network](https://request.network) as they're doing a really good job already, but i'll give you a summation and why i think req is undervalued as is. Also have a look at [https://req.network](https://req.network) to see KPI's.

Some features that have already landed or will land within a month:

* Stripe integration.
* Reputation System. (released for closed beta testing)
* Currency swaps. Thats right, request to be paid in ETH and let the payee pay in the currency they feel like.
* XDai integration to reduce fees while ethereum gas fees are extremely expensive.

Some features being planned for the near future:

* FIAT gateways.
* XERO integration. (a major accounting software provider)
* Staking.

Some of the leading innovators and organizations in the decentralized financial (DeFi) ecosystem that either use Request or are partnering with them:

* MakerDAO (top 100 CMC), read their customer story here [https://request.network/en/customer-stories/makerdao/](https://request.network/en/customer-stories/makerdao/)
* AAVE (top 100 CMC)
* Gnosis Safe (top 100 CMC)
* NEAR protocol (top 100 CMC)
* Ocean Protocol
* The Graph
* Indacoin
* 88mph

## Ambitions for this year:

* Hitting 5000 business use cases
* Daily transactions 800 to 1000 a day. (current highest day has hit 110 transactions which includes: invoice sent and invoice paid)

## So why will this ever be worth more OP?

* Adoption.
* Token burn.
* Staking.
* Voting.

## So why is this undervalued OP?

Lets see, so first of all the request foundation has around $47M in assets (Ethereum and KNC), they also hold 1/5th of the supply of all tokens which are never used therefore the supply is smaller than it looks like, oh and those tokens are worth around $33M at the time of writing. That means the company itself is worth around $80M YET the market cap is ONLY $160M! thats only twice the foundations worth.

They only just started marketing because they do not believe in quick hype and quick coins, they and their investors believe in the product, and now the product is fully usable they're starting marketing and are scaling up, looking for full stack developers at the moment.

## Oh so you like mysteries? Ok fine!

Users from the Request discord have started noticing a few whale wallets (we call them whallets) starting to buy regular tokens, normally around 80k per buy, do you have any explanation why? I might make another post about this soon. Example of a whallet: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a?a=0x027dff68c06d39e1c274b359c4dc269eb40d2c19](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a?a=0x027dff68c06d39e1c274b359c4dc269eb40d2c19)

TL;DR: Request is a invoicing network focusing on the DeFi ecosystem, pay with any currency, get paid in the currency you want. Possibly has $80M in their reserve and at the moment of writing only has 2 times that as a market cap 160 Million."
WHAT ARE STABLECOINS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenbondmeter/comments/mj81a1/what_are_stablecoins/,greenbondmeter,1,2021-04-03 21:00:18,0,/r/greenbondmeter/comments/mj81a1/what_are_stablecoins/,,"  

https://preview.redd.it/mxpnhc792wp61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea32ea031efcacfdcdab3a09ba2f4c6d656b6ae

Stablecoins or stable cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset whose value is linked to that of another asset through a parity relationship.

The most popular stablecoins maintain a 1-to-1 relationship with the US dollar, while others do so with gold or even other cryptocurrencies.

The first stablecoin was Tether (USDT), created by the company Tether Limited. It went on the market in October 2014 and until 2018 it was the only one of its kind, which allowed it to monopolize the entire segment. And also some scandals.

The emergence of DAI, from the MakerDAO project, solved one of Tether’s biggest problems: trust. From there, later stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC) were showing signs of the consolidation of the use of this type of “crypto-dollars”.

**What it is, how it works and how it is being used in the market?**

The blockchain is generally associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but these are only the tip of the iceberg. And it is that this technology, which has its origins in 1991, when Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta described the first work on a chain of cryptographically secured blocks, was not noticeable until 2008, when it became popular with the arrival of bitcoin.

When we speak of blockchains or chains of blocks, we refer to a particular way of organizing information, usually in a database format, with the distinctive characteristic that the data contained in a blockchain are arranged in successive blocks, each connected to the previous.

Each block can hold a certain amount of information, and is identified by an alphanumeric figure generated by a hash function. Hash functions are a type of cryptographic algorithm that creates a specific alphanumeric identifier for that piece of information. Bitcoin, for example, uses the SHA256 algorithm, while Ethereum uses Ethash.

In case the information of a block is altered, even in the slightest, the identifier will also be modified. In this way, the hash number allows to know if a certain set of information underwent any change or manipulation.

The chain of blocks, better known by the term blockchain in English, is a single registry, agreed and distributed in several nodes of a network. In the case of cryptocurrencies, we can think of it as the ledger where each of the transactions is recorded.

In a blockchain, each “child block” contains the hash of the previous block, which we can call its “mother block”. This mother block is also a child of another block, and thus a chain is generated that refers to the first block, also called the “genesis block”, which is the only one that does not contain hash of previous blocks.

Each block added in the chain was processed, accepted, and incorporated by the entire network in a process known as mining. Therefore, any change in a mother block generates a cascade effect that is transmitted to all subsequent blocks and that forces whoever wants to modify a pre-existing block to validate (mine) the entire chain again.

This means that the longer a chain of blocks is, the more computing power is required to mine it again. Therefore it is more difficult to change. In short, the longer a blockchain is, the more difficult it is to rewrite it.

Its operation can be complex to understand if we delve into the internal details of its implementation, but the basic idea is simple to follow.

**Advantages of stablecoins**

‍‍By always being the same value, they eliminate the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.

They keep the purchasing power of their users constant and predictable, without the need to use foreign currency.

People engaged in intense buying / selling activity can maintain stable purchasing power without the need to resort to a foreign currency.

They are a value transfer mechanism without geographical borders and with low commissions.

Most brokers accept them to exchange for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies.

They are very useful for users who trade on different exchanges."

Ethereum Scalability Race - April 2021 update,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/,Liberosist,3,2021-04-04 23:56:15,22,/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/,,"This is my personal perspective on the current status of scalability on Ethereum. Today, Ethereum is all-in on Layer 2 solutions. While there are different definitions for Layer 2, for the purpose of this post, I define it as solutions secured by Ethereum mainnet. This eliminates sidechains like xDai or Polygon, and focuses on rollups. (I will note that because Polygon checkpoints back to ethereum mainnet, so it's a grey area and still a better solution than any non-ethereum smart contract chain.) For an in-depth explanation of rollups, Vitalik's post is a must-read: [An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

[DeverseFi](https://twitter.com/deversifi/status/1376537192621862912/photo/1) has a great banner listing some of the Layer 2 projects currently building on Ethereum, I'll cover some highlights from this list.

# Application-specific rollups

Currently, all rollups on mainnet are application-specific. Some of the exciting application-specific rollups are:

\- Loopring: Payments and DEX

\- zkSync: Payments

\- [zk.money](https://zk.money): Privacy payments

\- ImmutableX: NFT minting and exchange. Interestingly, ImmutableX will have multiple applications built on top of it that need to mint and exchange NFTs, such as Gods Unchained and OpenSea.

All of these already do thousands of TPS, many offer gas-free interactions with the very low gas abstracted away from the user. For example, ImmutableX can do \~9,600 TPS, with each NFT mint costing $0.002 in gas, easily subsidized by the protocol as being effectively gas-free to the end user. Another important UX improvement is that transactions are confirmed effectively instantly. Do try these products (and more listed in the banner above) for a glimpse into the future of blockchain scalability.

# Programmable rollups

Not every smart contract has the resources to build their own application-specific rollup. This is where a programmable rollups enters the fray, and where most smart contracts will scale. It's a very interesting paradigm where there's intense competition to build the best execution environment on top of Ethereum. (Which is why I call it ""Scalability Race"".) 

**Optimistic Ethereum**: Limited mainnet since January 2021 (currently Synthetix only for staking), public testnet is now live though not officially supported till later in April. Public mainnet July 2021, although we expect ""whitelisted"" projects like Uniswap, Chainlink, MakerDAO to go live before then.

**Arbitrum**: An optimistic rollup and direct competition to Optimistic Ethereum. They are committed to a fully public release, and are currently on their release candidate public testnet. They have a crucial advantage over Optimistic Ethereum currently, with BLS signature aggregation.

**Fuel**: Also an optimistic rollup. Currently offers payments, but plans to expand into smart contracts later in 2021.

**zkSync 2.0**: Similar to Fuel, currently a payments protocol, expanding into generalized smart contract support. Unlike the above three, zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup, which brings the advantage of instant exits to L1. Public testnet: May 2021; public mainnet: July 2021.

**StarkNet**: Direct competitor to zkSync 2.0: a programmable ZK rollup. Scheduled for release in late 2021, though potentially accelerating thanks to an impressive $75 million Series B raise last month.

**Polygon**: Acknowledging the centralization flaws of their current sidechain, Polygon are also developing both ZK and optimistic rollups (among other solutions). No concrete dates I could find. My unsolicited recommendation for Polygon would be to abandon their currently announced kitchen-sink model and laser focus on delivering a world class generalized ZK rollup.

We might end up with a situation here where Ethereum L1 will only act as a settlement and security layer, with a majority of activity happening on rollups. Before we move on beyond rollups, I'd point out that there are multiple projects like Celer, Connext, or Hop that are focusing on interoperability between L1 &lt;&gt; L2 and L2 &lt;&gt; L2.

# Enhancements to application-layer

The application-layer (previously called eth1) protocol, EVM and clients continue to mature. For example, EIP-2929 mitigates DoS attacks and could lead to a minor bump in gas limit. EIP-1559 has strong UX implications that \*might\* mitigate users overpaying for gas, and smooth out spikes. There's no one big upgrade here, but a continuous series of enhancements that'll enable higher gas limits over time. As an example, while I was writing this, Vitalik has published an [intriguing proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082) to further improve EIP-1559. For context, many of these improvements have enabled Ethereum's gas limit to increase from 4M in 2017 to 12.5M today. Eventually, we may even get back to eWASM (?).

# Data sharding / data availability sampling (DAS)

DAS is focused on accelerating rollups by offering massive data availability in a granular manner over 64 shards. Where an efficient rollup can do anywhere between 1,000 TPS to 4,500 TPS today, DAS will accelerate this to potentially over 50,000-100,000 TPS. Gas-efficient rollups like ImmutableX will potentially be accelerated past 200,000 TPS. Previously, this was set to ship before The Merge, but is now coming after The Merge, potentially later in 2022 or early 2023. By the way, The Merge itself does not lead to scalability upgrades, but we could see related [proposals to increase gas limit](https://ethresear.ch/t/commit-to-pre-state-instead-of-post-state-on-the-executable-beacon-chain/8802) after The Merge.

# Statlessness / state expiry

Incredibly, we have gotten this far without actually increasing L1 scalability significantly. L1 gas is going to remain high for the near future - get used to it. This may not matter too much if we have massive scalability on L2, though, as that's where most users will be. L1 will act more of a settlement layer for the bigger players - rollups, exchanges, financial institutions, whales etc.

However, with statelessness / state expiry, this is finally being addressed - L1 gas limits will see significant increases without materially sacrificing decentralization &amp; security. It's still early days, but we finally have some [concrete options available](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). We don't have a date here, but personally I wouldn't expect this before 2023.

# Executable sharding

What was previously Phase 2 has now been pushed back given the better solutions now available. Pretty crazy to think rollups did not even exist when sharding was first conceived as a scalability solution! This is where the shards no longer just offering data availability for rollups, but are also able to execute transactions themselves. It's hard to imagine how this will turn out - if rollups attain critical mass and statelessness allows for a significant enough gas limit uptick, we may not even require executable shards at all and it would be better to focus on enhancing (or increasing) data shards, for example. Or, it could be that we only require a smaller number of executable shards. Definitely the most nebulous step here, and something that'll only become clear over time.

# Hybrid scalability

I definitely believe that we'll see all kinds of hybrid solutions going forward, with various degrees of decentralization over multiple layer. Visa and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) are effectively acting as scalability sidechains for Ethereum, though with a significant degree of centralization. What we might see in the future is that Visa cuts out [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and goes directly to a rollup/L2 wallet/service provider. Likewise, I can also see Reddit build their own rollup, which keeps a lot of data on their centralized servers, and only settles the important stuff on mainnet. We already have such solutions today: for example DeverseFi uses Validium where less critical data like order books (?) are maintained on centralized servers, while all transactions and balances are on-chain. It could even apply for a [mainstream application like Fortnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/midbun/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2021/gt4e4a6).

Alright, that probably ended up much longer than I expected, but hopefully it will be informational because there's a lot of misinformation flying around in the crypto space. Feel free to add/correct things and I'll update the post accordingly."
Does it make sense to dollar cost average short positions on Bitcoin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/mk78fb/does_it_make_sense_to_dollar_cost_average_short/,sfcpfc,0,2021-04-05 07:10:54,66,/r/Buttcoin/comments/mk78fb/does_it_make_sense_to_dollar_cost_average_short/,,"Hi. I've been thinking of dollar cost averaging a short position on Bitcoin and I wanted to get some feedback from you guys. I might do this simply as a thought experiment for fun, or might put small amounts of money, but obviously I wouldn't put more that I can afford to lose.

I would short it through Aave on Matic Network (Ethereum sidechain). Now, before you ask why I would short butts on another buttchain, I'll have you know that Ethereum does have an use case: being a decentralized casino. Fun! Who doesn't love gambling?

I wouldn't short it through exchanges as they are unregulated. Some people talked about using actual financial instruments to short it like MSTR puts, shorting GBTC, etc. but I believe the premiums should be big and honestly that's a rabbit hole I don't want to get involved with.

So, let's assume that:

* MakerDAO and DAI are stable and secure (as in, MakerDAO is never hacked and DAI never crashses)
* Aave is stable and secure
* Ethereum is stable and secure
* Matic is stable and secure (Matic can be removed from the equation but then the gas fees on Ethereum are so high that makes doing this impossible with small amounts of money)

I know, big ""ifs"", but let's just continue with the thought experiment.

Here's my premise: Bitcoin will crash eventually. If you're on /r/Buttcoin you already know and probably agree with this. If we believe that, it could make sense to short it. However, there are two concerns with shorting any asset:

* **For how long?** When will the crash happen? This year? In 5 years? No one knows. We do know that it has to crash because it's not sustainable for it to go up forever, but we don't know *when*.

  For shorting in the stock market one would have to pay interest. However in AAVE v2 the average borrow interest for WBTC since inception has been 1.26% while the deposit interest on DAI has been 8.80% (source: https://v2.aavewatch.com/).

  Assuming that we borrow WBTC and sell it for DAI, this means that as long as the BTC price doesn't move, not only we're not paying premiums for our position, we're also earing ""money"" on it. I understand that normally being early would be the same as being wrong, but if we don't pay for our position... then it may not hold true this time.

  For those of you who haven't been exposed to this DeFi madness, this is the same as if I wanted to short TSLA and my broker offered to lend me a share for 1% interest, while having access to 8% deposits on my bank account. Nonsense, right? Is it sustainable? Maybe...? The DAI interest comes from gamblers who're leveraging their position on other cryptocurrencies so it might be sustainable for the short term.

* **What if it goes up?** As we all know, we are not visionaries and we can't predict when the bubble will pop. We can't even predict if we reached the top already. The market is irrational and BTC might reach 100k, 200k... who knows? What we all know is the end result.

  So in order to protect against number go up, we dollar cost average our short positions. Just like butters who DCA their way up, we DCA our way down.

  On stock markets, it is believed that dumping all cash once (""lump sum"") is better than dollar cost averaging over time, because stonks always go up. The same would hold true for shorting, in a theoretical world where we had infinite money, but not in the real world where we can get liquidated.

  However, DCA should protect us against liquidations. We allocate a budget (say 100€ month) and distribute it according to our risk parameters (say 60€ shorts, 40€ collateral). If Bitcoin goes up, we short 60€ worth of Bitcoin and add the 100€ as collateral (40€ from our allocation and 60€ from the sale of BTC).

  This goes on for as long as needed until the bubble bursts, which we are certain that will happen eventually. I believe this should work as long as we can get the 100€/month flow going (otherwise it's game over and we lose everything).

So what do you think? I haven't done the math exhaustively yet. I know that there are many intelligent people in this sub and can point out a couple of flaws on my reasoning (besides the obvious flaw of trusting crypto buttchains to keep our position safe)

TL;DR: It literally can't go tits up"
Algunas cripto-inversiones de riesgo moderado y sin custodia [Abril 2021],https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/mk7doi/algunas_criptoinversiones_de_riesgo_moderado_y/,galapag0,5,2021-04-05 07:19:19,22,/r/merval/comments/mk7doi/algunas_criptoinversiones_de_riesgo_moderado_y/,CRYPTO,"Reedito [mi post original](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/jrrliw/algunas_criptoinversiones_de_riesgo_moderado_y/) sobre inversiones cripto de riesgo ""moderado"", para actualizar la información y proveer algunas nuevas alternativas interesantes. De igual forma que mis posts anteriores, estas son todas inversiones sin custodia que puede hacer sin KYC ni nada por el estilo. Estas inversiones pueden generar márgenes más interesantes (es difícil ponerle números, pero algunos pueden subir 5% en un día), aún con bajo capital (menos de 1k USD). Por supuesto, también tienen un riesgo mayor. 

Elegí estas criptos por sus fundamentos, por eso recomiendo fuertemente que se pongan a leer como funcionan y para qué sirven para que saquen sus propias conclusiones (al contrario de como funcionan muchos DeFi con nombre de comida que suben 100000% en un día para después desaparecer al otro día por un [exit scam](https://www.criptonoticias.com/mercados/sushiswap-tokens-aparta-proyecto-6-millones-dolares-ether/)). Para comprar o vender estas criptos sin KYC, pueden [usar Dharma/Argent](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/j7ou73/argent_vs_dharma_an%C3%A1lisis_de_wallets_de_ethereum/) o cualquier otra billetera con fácil acceso a [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) u otros exchanges similares.

Sin más preámbulos, acá está algunas criptos para holdear en Ethereum:

* ETH: el combustible con el cual funciona la red de Ethereum. No hay mucho para decir, salvo que ahora mismo está en un valor ""máximo"" de este año, así que entren con cuidado.

* SNX: el token fundamental de Synthetix, un [proyecto para generar tokens cuyo precio sigan a bienes reales](https://criptoblog.tutellus.com/synthetix-protocol-y-los-assets-sinteticos/), pero que se puedan comprar o vender como cualquier cripto. Una cripto volátil, pero en mi opinión, con gran potencial de crecimiento.

* Los tokens de gobernanza de MakerDAO (MKR), Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP) y AAVE (AAVE): estos tokens tienen buenas perspectivas de crecimiento mientras que DAI, Uniswap, Compound y AAVE sigan siendo relevantes en el espacio cripto (cosa que es probable, en mi opinión). Además, destaco RSR, el token dual de [Reserve](https://reserve.org/), que apunta a ser una nueva stablecoin para los países latinoamericanos y viene creciendo muchísimo en países como Venezuela. 

* AMPL: este es un token muy distinto a los demás. Es básicamente [un experimento monetario donde se ajusta todos los días la cantidad de tokens emitidos para alcanzar un equilibrio del precio](https://www.ampleforth.org/) (muy cercano a 1 USD). La idea es arbitrar *diariamente* con este comportamiento. Extremadamente recomendable [entender bien como funciona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-8yjmsshFg) antes de entrar. En mi opinión, es recomendable sólo si su precio está por debajo de 0.70 USD. 

Y fuera de Ethereum tenemos:

* XTZ: la moneda nativa de la red de [Tezos](https://tezos.com/), el más serio competidor de competidor de Ethereum hasta ahora por evitar el uso excesivo de energía (PoS) y tener contratos inteligentes ya funcionando (incluso un incipiente desarrollo de DeFi como [Dexter](https://dexter.exchange/))

* ADA: el otro competidor serio de Ethereum con PoS es [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) con buenas perspectivas pero un poco más atrás que Tezos. El proyecto promete pero todavía no han lanzado contratos inteligentes sobre Cardano, pero puede ser una inversión interesante, aunque sea una cantidad baja.

Dejo afuera BNB por ahora por ser una cripto completamente controlada por Binance, pero si les interesa /u/No_Swan1684 hizo [un excelente post al respecto](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/comments/lmz5ju/binance_smart_chain_pancakeswap_y_farming_sin/).

En mi opinión, estas son inversiones de riesgo moderado porque es muy poco probable que su valor sea cero de un día para otro (todos son proyectos conocidos, con auditorías públicas y bien mantenidos por su comunidad). De todas maneras, sean responsables, y usen sólo una parte de su capital en este tipo de inversiones."

This Microcap Gem Has A Market Cap of $8 Million - Going To Be $700 Million Soon,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mkoo7k/this_microcap_gem_has_a_market_cap_of_8_million/,JizenM,1,2021-04-06 00:28:31,244,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mkoo7k/this_microcap_gem_has_a_market_cap_of_8_million/,Low MCAP coin,"If you don't know who I am, I'm a blockchain enthusiast and Bitcoin investor since 2010/2011 who happens to love this subreddit. I've given you a few microcap gems already, like; [BiFrost - $BFC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/lw9a4b/my_1st_post_post_here_my_100x_token/) when it was around $0.05 and more recently this post about [PhoenixDAO - $PHNX](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/miqo8o/this_microcap_gem_is_about_to_blow_up_is/) when it was around $0.08. 

**I'm here to let you know about another massively undervalued microcap project that has already been posted on this subreddit, (I actually started my research into it after seeing it here).** 

However, I don't think the previous post here got enough attention, (at least not compared to some of the shitcoins often posted here), but since I have quite a few followers I'm hoping this post will give the attention to this project that it deserves. 

Let me know in the comments what you think? 🤷‍♂‍ 

The microcap gem that I'm talking about is **Open Governence Token (OpenDAO - $OPEN) which is a *massively undervalued microcap* project currently sitting at a measly $8 million market cap** with a token price of only around $2.25 at the moment! 

**In my opinion this project is going to explode in value to at least $100 million market cap in the coming days/weeks, and probably $700 - $800 million minimum in the coming 12-18 months*, assuming they manage to deliver what they're promising.** 

**It's one of those rare microcaps that are getting harder and harder to find in this bull market, and that's about to explode in price.** 

$OPEN is project with a solid product that has *incredible value potential* and an experienced fully doxed team, and ***with several VC firms that have already scrutinised the project and invested their own money in the first seed rounds.*** 

Ok, so what is the Open DAO project, what are they doing, and why is it so undervalued? 

**In the first Phase Open DAO - $OPEN is building a system to collateralize all types of online tokens/coins that are currently not possible to use as a security for loans.** 

So what does that mean? 

It means that if you for example hold some *Raven coin*, *DigiByte* or *Swissborg* or any other of the thousands of cryptocurrencies and tokens available on Coinmarketcap, you will soon be able to use these coins as collateral to borrow USD, (stablecoins) at a low yearly interest rate (I believe around 2% or 3%). 

So let's say that you're in crypto for the long haul, (not just to make some quick fiat gains) and you have some tokens you don't want to sell. 

However, at the same time you'd like to free up some cash to buy a new car... 

**With $OPEN you'll now be able to use those strange and wonderful tokens or coins you own as collateral for a USD loan.** 

As you probably know you can already do this with BTC, ETH, BAT and a few other cryptos that have massive marketcaps on places like MakerDAO, Compound and others, *but no one else offers you the ability to use virtually ANY tokens/coins as collateral for loans*. 

**If this got you a bit excited about the potential of $OPEN you'll need to sit down, because we're only just getting started...** 🙂 

What I've described above is only **Phase 1** of the *Open Governence Token* project, and that Phase has already started to launc just recently. 

**Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 are going to blow you away!** 

In Phase 2 you'll be able to use almost ANY listed stocks you own as collateral if you want to borrow money. 

Do you own 100 or 1000 shares in Tesla, Facebook or Apple for example? 

Ok, you can just lock them up as security in what OpenDAO calls a ***""Cashbox""*** and then use your stocks as collateral to borrow money, (see this videos to understand how the ""cashbox"" system works: https://vimeo.com/478731239 ). 

All without the hassle of dealing with a bank demanding: 

***""pLeAsE pRoViDe YoUr InCoMe StAtEmEnTs FoR tHe LaSt 3 YeArS aNd ShOw Us hOw YoU sPeNd YoUr MoNeY oVeR tHe LaSt 6 MoNtHs, So We cAn MaKe SuRe YoU kNoW hOw To KeEp A bUdGeT.""*** 

**If you go through all this hassle then *MAYBE* we will *CONSIDER* lending you some money, IF your credit score and our other arbitrary demands meet our lending criteria. Oh and yeah that will be at 8.5% interest rate since you don't have any collateral!""** 

***""But Ma'm I DO have collateral. Look, I have all these stocks in my Robinhood account, and my expensive car that's parked right outside!""*** 

***""yEaH bUt We DoN't AcCePt ThOsE sOrT oF tHiNgS aS cOlLaTeRaL aNd 2 yEaRs AgO yOu WeRe 2 WeEkS lAtE oN a PaRkInG tIcKeT.""*** 

Most of us are done with banks and their horrible and predatory practices, for these and many other reasons! 🙄 

**With OpenDAO and DeFi we don't really need the banks anymore!** 🙂 

Let's move on... 

**In Phase 3 you'll be able to use gold, silver, your car, you camper van, your summer cabin or maybe even your valuable collectable guitar or almost any other small asset you own as collateral for a loan.** 

And finally... 

**In Phase 4 you'll be able to use land, commercial real estate and other large assets as collateral, making banks almost completely irrelevant.** 

Are you starting to see how big this is going to be yet? 🙂 

**Here we have a startup crypto project that was launched last year, with a competent team and a project that has been scrutinised by several prominent blockchain Venture Capital Firms who have invested in it (because they know they are going to 100x their investment or more), sitting at *only $8 million* market cap!** 

It's almost unbelievable, and the only explanation is that they're busy building and haven't done any marketing yet, and the VC firms (that normally help with marketing) haven't done much so far, but all that's about to change! 

**According to the team a marketing campaign is planned for the near future. Apparently multiple top crypto and financial publications as well as well-known YouTubers will soon start writing/talking about $OPEN. They’re also in talks to get listed on multiple big exchanges.** 

Once this happnes, (could be within days, or maybe weeks, I don't know, but it's about to happen), the floodgates will open and the big investors will pick up on this project, which is *virtually unknown* now except for the VC firms that have already invested... 

**This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor, just like the VC firms, and ride the 10x to 100x wave that's *virtually guaranteed* in the coming days/weeks/months (it's always hard to time excatly WHEN something will explode).** 🙂 

Let me expand a bit about the VC firms btw. 

***""What's all this about VC firms, and why is it a big deal?""*** 

It's important because *OpenDAO (Open Governence Token) has gone through the extensive scrutiny* that comes with raising money from Venture Capital firms. These companies don't just throw millions in seed round funding to projects that they haven't scrutinized and analyzed. 

They do their research before investing. 

**Here Are Some Of The Venture Capital Firms That Have Invested In OpenDAO - $OPEN** 

**Moonwhale** 

These are the guys that discovered and were seed fund investors in projects like ***Avalanche***, ***SuperRare*** and ***Celsius***. 

**Signum Capital** 

This is a Singapore based Venture Capital firm that funded projects like ***Kyber Network*** and ***Zilliqa***. 

**X21 Ventures** 

These guys put in $2 million in the first seed round for ***PAID Network*** for example. 

But you may still be asking: 

*""Why is it so beneficial for me that these VC firms have already invested in Open DAO - $OPEN?""* 

**Here is my take:** 

It's really difficult for ordinary people like you and me to evaluate projects with ambitious plans with a lot of technical aspects to them, like Open DAO has. Remember, they want to collateralize almost **all** onchain and offchain assets! 

It was the same when MakerDao first arrived on the scene. 

*""Is it possible to do what they're planning technically?""* 

*""Are they likely to succeed?""* 

MakerDao now costs more than $2200 per token and is valued at more than $2.2 Billion, but it was hard to know when it launched if it would really work, **and I think these sums may be peanuts compared to what the Open Governence Token could be worth if they succeed!** 

*""Why?""* 

Because the markets they are about to collateralize are so massive. 

**All Crypto:** $1.9 TRILLION
**Stocks:** $85 TRILLION
**Real Estate:** $250 - $300 TRILLION 
**Gold/Silver:** $10 

That's hundreds of Trillions combined, and **$OPEN only needs to capture a tiny fraction of a percent of *any* of these lending markets to be worth Billions, and at the moment they are worth $8 Million!** 

So you do the math on what's about to happen to the token price once this projects gets out there. 🙂🤷‍♂️ 

My point is that it's a lot easier to judge ***the idea*** of a project, (and I think we can all agree that this idea is amazing), than it is to judge the team's ability to execute on that idea, ***but this is where Venture Capital firms excel.*** 

They have specialists that evaluate the team members, not just to make sure they're legit, but also to make sure they have the required expertise to execute on their plans. 

They are also experts at evaluating whether the project plans are achievable or not. 

In the case of $OPEN several of the heavy hitter VC firms have decided that; *""Yes their plans are indeed possible.""* and that's why several prominent VC firms have invested in them. That's important. 

Another good thing is that most VC firms don't just offer funds and then tell the team to; *""Go off and build your idea now"".* 

**They often also function like incubators.** They help projects get the right start, make sure they stay legal and help them deal with compliance and help them promote in mainstream media etc. once the projects are ready and go live. 

VC firms want the maximum return on the projects they invest in, it's as simple as that. 🤷‍♂‍ 

**Anyway, this post got a bit longer than I had planned, but I hope you now understand why a $8 million market cap, (or even $40 million if it was that!) makes OpenDAO MASSIVELY undervalued, and at some point soon it will explode in value.** 

It's up to you if you want to be part of that ride or not? 

I know I'm going to be. 🙂 

**DISCLAIMER** I have a substantial holding in OpenDAO that I've dollar cost averaged in at around $2.15 or so. I plan to sell around 30% once it hits $12 to $15 and hold the rest for at least 18 to 24 months until their project is fully operational. 

**RISK WARNING:** Although I believe there is very little chance of losing money long-term when investing in OpenDAO at these sort of prices (anything below $7 to $8) **there are no guarantees in crypto!**

Massively Undervalued Microcap Gem With Tiny Market Cap - How Long Before The Price Explodes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonshots2/comments/mkqc09/massively_undervalued_microcap_gem_with_tiny/,JizenM,1,2021-04-06 01:42:16,27,/r/CryptoMoonshots2/comments/mkqc09/massively_undervalued_microcap_gem_with_tiny/,UNI,"If you don't know who I am, I'm a blockchain enthusiast and Bitcoin investor since 2010/2011. I've posted about a few microcaps that have since gone on to do well. My last post here was about [PhoenixDAO - $PHNX](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonshots2/comments/miscz6/my_first_post_in_here_microcap_gem_that_i_think/) the other day when it was around $0.08. 

**I'm here to let you know about another massively undervalued microcap project that I think is about to explode...** 

Let me know in the comments if you think I'm right? 🤷‍♂‍ 

The microcap gem that I'm talking about is **Open Governence Token (OpenDAO - $OPEN) which is a *massively undervalued microcap* project currently sitting at a measly $8 million market cap** (Coingecko apparently showing $17 million mc so not sure if CMC or Coingecko is correct), with a token price of only around $2.15 at the moment! 

**In my opinion this project is going to explode in value to at least $100 million market cap in the coming days/weeks, and probably $700 - $800 million minimum in the coming 12-18 months*, assuming they manage to deliver what they're promising.** 

**It's one of those rare microcaps that are getting harder and harder to find in this bull market, and that's about to explode in price.** 

$OPEN is project with a solid product that has *incredible value potential* and an experienced fully doxed team, and ***with several VC firms that have already scrutinised the project and invested their own money in the first seed rounds.*** 

Ok, so what is the Open DAO project, what are they doing, and why is it so undervalued? 

**In the first Phase Open DAO - $OPEN is building a system to collateralize all types of online tokens/coins that are currently not possible to use as a security for loans.** 

So what does that mean? 

It means that if you for example hold some *Raven coin*, *DigiByte* or *Swissborg* or any other of the thousands of cryptocurrencies and tokens available on Coinmarketcap, you will soon be able to use these coins as collateral to borrow USD, (stablecoins) at a low yearly interest rate (I believe around 2% or 3%). 

So let's say that you're in crypto for the long haul, (not just to make some quick fiat gains) and you have some tokens you don't want to sell. 

However, at the same time you'd like to free up some cash to buy a new car... 

**With $OPEN you'll now be able to use those strange and wonderful tokens or coins you own as collateral for a USD loan.** 

As you probably know you can already do this with BTC, ETH, BAT and a few other cryptos that have massive marketcaps on places like MakerDAO, Compound and others, *but no one else offers you the ability to use virtually ANY tokens/coins as collateral for loans*. 

**If this got you a bit excited about the potential of $OPEN you'll need to sit down, because we're only just getting started...** 🙂 

What I've described above is only **Phase 1** of the *Open Governence Token* project, and that Phase has already started to launc just recently. 

**Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 are going to blow you away!** 

In Phase 2 you'll be able to use almost ANY listed stocks you own as collateral if you want to borrow money. 

Do you own 100 or 1000 shares in Tesla, Facebook or Apple for example? 

Ok, you can just lock them up as security in what OpenDAO calls a ***""Cashbox""*** and then use your stocks as collateral to borrow money, (see this videos to understand how the ""cashbox"" system works: https://vimeo.com/478731239 ). 

All without the hassle of dealing with a bank demanding: 

***""pLeAsE pRoViDe YoUr InCoMe StAtEmEnTs FoR tHe LaSt 3 YeArS aNd ShOw Us hOw YoU sPeNd YoUr MoNeY oVeR tHe LaSt 6 MoNtHs, So We cAn MaKe SuRe YoU kNoW hOw To KeEp A bUdGeT.""*** 

**If you go through all this hassle then *MAYBE* we will *CONSIDER* lending you some money, IF your credit score and our other arbitrary demands meet our lending criteria. Oh and yeah that will be at 8.5% interest rate since you don't have any collateral!""** 

***""But Ma'm I DO have collateral. Look, I have all these stocks in my Robinhood account, and my expensive car that's parked right outside!""*** 

***""yEaH bUt We DoN't AcCePt ThOsE sOrT oF tHiNgS aS cOlLaTeRaL aNd 2 yEaRs AgO yOu WeRe 2 WeEkS lAtE oN a PaRkInG tIcKeT.""*** 

Most of us are done with banks and their horrible and predatory practices, for these and many other reasons! 🙄 

**With OpenDAO and DeFi we don't really need the banks anymore!** 🙂 

Let's move on... 

**In Phase 3 you'll be able to use gold, silver, your car, you camper van, your summer cabin or maybe even your valuable collectable guitar or almost any other small asset you own as collateral for a loan.** 

And finally... 

**In Phase 4 you'll be able to use land, commercial real estate and other large assets as collateral, making banks almost completely irrelevant.** 

Are you starting to see how big this is going to be yet? 🙂 

**Here we have a startup crypto project that was launched last year, with a competent team and a project that has been scrutinised by several prominent blockchain Venture Capital Firms who have invested in it (because they know they are going to 100x their investment or more), sitting at *only $8 million* market cap!**

The Open Governance Token are building a new stablecoin that can be collateralized by a variety of assets, including multiple tokens that we can't use as collateral in MAKER. 

They're also going to make it possible to collateralize offline assets soon. You can already borrow USD stablecoins with gold and silver as security for the loan. 

I'm excited about the idea of being able to borrow money and using my smaller market cap tokens as security for the loan, but I'm curious what everyone thinks about how realistic it is for OPEN to also tokenize offline assets? 

They are apparently using something called a ""cashbox"" to secure the offline assets, (there is a video on their website explaining how it works), which I assume is similar to ""the vault"" that MakerDAO uses? 

I guess I'm just curious to know if you all think the plans that the Open Governance Token have are realistic technically? At the moment it has such a low valuation but it sounded on that post like the OPEN project could become even bigger than MakerDAO if they succeed. 

If that's the case I don't want to miss out on the opportunity, but sometimes on those smaller subreddits you get a lot of hype, so I wanted to hear some unbiased opinions?"

I aped in and bought some after seeing that post, and today I was pleasantly surprised to see I had gained 20% since yesterday.

Anyway, I liked the idea of $OPEN so much that today I decided to start doing some of my own research into this coin. **Because although it sounded soooooo promising in that post yesterday many of us have learned that not everything that glimmer is gold!**

**Anyway I'm now more convinced than I was yesterday that this is could be the investment of a lifetime for me!** 

Let me tell you what I found out today, (or maybe I was just too stupid to figure out yesterday and all of you guys already did?).

**OpenDAO is creating a bank!**

Not in the strict sense of the word maybe, but they are going to make as much if not MORE money than a bank does, AND ALL THAT MONEY WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG THE $OPEN token holders! That's crazy!

**Most of us know that the reason banks make so much money is because** ***they have the power to CREATE MONEY*** **by giving out loans.** 

**That is exactly what $OPEN is going to do. Create money from nothing, and then lend it out with interest!**

And guess who gets the interest? We do!

How?

**THEY ARE GOING TO PAY ALL OF US DIVIDENDS FROM THE PROFITS!**

And the craziest thing of it all is that we get to vote and decide HOW MUCH dividents we are going to get!

You know the big bosses on the board of directors in the banks, voting massive dividends and golden parachutes for each other? 

That's going to be us with $OPEN!

Yesterday I invested after having seen that post because I saw great potential for the $OPEN token to go up a lot in price. 

It's hard not to think it will when you compare it with MakerDAO (the token that creates the $DAI stablecoin) and you realize that MakerDAO is worth $2.3 BILLION and the token costs $2,350. 

Then you compare it to OpenDAO with a tiny market cap and costs $2.20 and you realize that soon OpenDAO is likely going to be MORE valuable than MakerDAO because of what was explained in that post yesterday!

So that's why I invested yesterday, **but today I learned something even MORE exciting that I guess I was too dumb to understand from the post yesterday?** 

**The Open Governance token is ALSO going to be paying dividends to us token holders!** 

These are the profits that the ""bank"" makes by creating money (almost from thin air) and then lending it out with interest. 

Anyway, I just got so excited by all that news and wanted to share it with anyone who invested in $OPEN yesterday like I did.

Here is the video where I discovered all this. 

It's from the official OpenDAO channel and an interview with the lead architect , but for some reason it only has like 130 views so far (no wonder this is a true moonshot!). The sound is really bad and it's hard to understan, but the information is priceless!

CURIO INVEST - $CUR – $3 million cap swiss crypto startup tokenizing real world assets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mlz5bv/curio_invest_cur_3_million_cap_swiss_crypto/,feelzerian,1,2021-04-07 18:31:11,19,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mlz5bv/curio_invest_cur_3_million_cap_swiss_crypto/,Low MCAP coin,"**CURIO INVEST - $CUR TOKEN** 

TLDR: $ 3 million market cap and one of the most legit projects you will find in crypto regardless of market cap. For god’s sake take 5 minutes and just read it. **Oh and they will buy a Tesla.**

First, lets quickly look at how legit CURIO is in comparison to crypto in general and especially compared to other tiny market caps:

* The company behind curio is “Curio AG”, a registered company in Indi… just kidding, CURIO is based in Switzerland and the company is registered in Liechtenstein. A shit ton of large european companies are registered in Liechtenstein for tax reasons; I know because I worked for one of Germany’s largest tax law firms and had to advise these tax evaders daily… but they were rich, at least. An “AG” is basically a corporation for you us law folks. The commercial register entry is [right here](https://imgur.com/a/N9CbJhp) for you.
* They are [part of the “swiss fintech national team”](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2020-09-17/schweizer-fintech-nati-geht-auf-pitch-tour), a small group of swiss fintech companies chosen by switzerlands biggest start up incubator
* One of switzerlands largest newspapers [wrote a whole article about Curio](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/geld/fuer-100-franken-einen-anteil-an-einem-ferrari-kaufen/story/28029869)
* a thousand other things like [being chosen as the best swiss crypto startup](https://gomedici.com/top-blockchain-startups-in-switzerland-crypto-valley)

What does Curio do? Well, let’s start with a copypasta: CurioInvest is a fintech platform enabling tokenized investments in rare collectible cars and other fine assets. Curio brings real-world assets into the Blockchain, so private investors can use them as collateral for lending as well as other DeFi services."" In essence, it enables new financial services in previous illiquid markets available for both institutional as well as retail investors.

But let me put it in simpler words:

Rich folk don’t just buy boomer ETFs or invest in hedgefunds. They also buy really really nice shit that appreciates in value even more than their stocks. Quote by Christoph Gröne (rich fuck): “When you have 250 million, you can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door. You can't destroy it. You buy a car, the car becomes more valuable. You buy houses, the houses become more valuable. You go into Gold, the Gold becomes more valuable. You can't destroy the money by consumption.” (for German speaking folks, it's [right a at the start of this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y2WxM2Srlc))

**Wait, did he just say you buy a car and it becomes more valuable?** Yes he did, and he knows best, since he has these 250 million bucks.

Now, he isn’t talking about buying a Ford Focus, but about buying really nice cars. He can do it, but you and I can’t. But what if we split that Ferrari F12tdf worth $1 Million into a million parts? You would throw $100 in, I’m putting 20k down and if we find enough people, we can buy that really nice car and everyone has a stake in it. Remember: You can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door, you can’t destroy it. This is how the rich fucks are doing it, they just don’t need a crowd.

And now give a big fucking applause to CURIO: With Curio, really nice real-world assets are being tokenized so that you and I TOGETHER can buy our fair share of that Ferrari, of that nice real estate object, of that fine Mona Lisa or nice million dollar bottle of wine and make money like the rich fucks do. And who looks after that Ferrari or that Mona Lisa? Curio does. Curio rent’s the garage, they buy the thing, they sell it, you don’t have to do jack shit but get a piece of that really nice thing.

Who is behind Curio? Well the team prefers to stay anom… fuck no, [everyone is doxed and just look at their beautiful faces](https://imgur.com/a/UUhhMYn). Beautiful.

The curio team – especially their dev – is insanely active and has been very stoically answering every boring fucking question that comes up for a year.

Token? Well, there is the [CUR token](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/curio/) and there is [GVT](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/curio-governance/), the governance token. The supply is low at 2.000.000 CUR max. If GVT picks up and you have CUR – no worries. You will always be able to swap CUR to GVT at CUR price but not the other way around, meaning that CUR will always atleast have the same price as GVT. But right now: Just get CUR and cry some tears of joy, because you are gonna make it. You can get it on UNISWAP, PROBIT and HitBTC. The entry is pretty nice right now (ATH 5$, now we’re at about 2$).

UNILORD [PEER] protocol is far more better then FEI PROTOCOL and can do 100x in few month,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mn6cfg/unilord_peer_protocol_is_far_more_better_then_fei/,ziyush,1,2021-04-09 09:17:47,0,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mn6cfg/unilord_peer_protocol_is_far_more_better_then_fei/,Low MCAP coin,"UNILORD have 2 Tokens among which one is Stable coin know as LORD and another is PEER which is Governance just like DAO and Maker Token.

UNilord protocol is far more better then FEI , FEI protocol have burned so many ETH and even after this protocol is not stable.

PEER is a critical component of the Unilord Protocol, which allows anyone to leverage their crypto assets by balancing dual-control assets Unipeer (Non-Governance Token) and Unilord (Governance Token) in the market and the products. These dual assets can be utilized as universal, low volatility collateral that can maintain its value and other decentralized finance protocols from sudden market shifts.

The PEER token’s market capitalization is calculated based on the expected LORD’s future price as well as its self-burning rate. Additionally, as the PEER market cap increases, so does the system’s ability to keep LORD stable. Thus, the design’s priority is to accrue maximal value to the PEER token while maintaining LORD as a systematic stable coin.

The Unipeer Non-Governance Token is a non-stable mining token in the Unilord Protocol. It is meant to be volatile and hold rights to governance and all excess De-Fi products provided by Unilord. It is important to note that we take a highly governance-minimized approach to designing trustless tokens. We eschew DAO-like active management such as MakerDAO.

 The fewer parameters for a community to actively manage, the less there is to disagree. The only parameters for governance through PEER are adding and switching through the pools provided to accrue values. 

The PEER token might be volatile, which might experience upside and downside through the system. The PEER supply is initially set to 100,000,000 tokens at genesis.

 However, the circulation amount will likely be deflationary as **3% of PEER executed in transactions are burned and used for fees on our own products.** The protocol design is such that PEER would be broadly deflationary in supply as long as LORD demand grows.

 

Total Supply - **1 Billion**

Circulating - **5 MILLION**

Powered by Ethereum - ERC20 based Tokens, it is available on UniSwap with an intention to expand to BSC if the community approves it.  


It allows liquidity providers to take out loans in $USDFL (the native coin of freeliquid) collateralzied by their LP's and reinvest the funds in their LP's for additional ROI. No fees, no liquidation since it's only on stablecoins.  


It's a fork of MakerDAO and $USDFL is backed by collaterals and could moon soon once it comes on BSC since UniSwap fees are a killer. Moreover, once the platform gains enough popularity, it could start charging an APR on loans and $FL could moon big- currently only worth a mere $6M."

TLDR: [$3.5 million market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/de/munze/curio) and one of the most legit projects you will find in crypto regardless of market cap. TA is looking fine, 2$ is stronghold support and [the chart is ready for elliot wave 5](https://i2.wp.com/patternswizard.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/elliottwave.png?fit=2914%2C1509&amp;ssl=1). For god’s sake take 5 minutes and just read it. **Oh and they will buy a Tesla.**

First, lets quickly look at how legit CURIO is in comparison to crypto in general and especially compared to other tiny market caps:

* The company behind curio is “Curio AG”, a registered company in Indi… just kidding, CURIO is based in Switzerland and the company is registered in Liechtenstein. A shit ton of large european companies are registered in Liechtenstein for tax reasons; I know because I worked for one of Germany’s largest tax law firms and had to advise these tax evaders daily… but they were rich, at least. An “AG” is basically a corporation for you us law folks. The commercial register entry is [right here](https://imgur.com/a/N9CbJhp) for you.
* They are [part of the “swiss fintech national team”](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2020-09-17/schweizer-fintech-nati-geht-auf-pitch-tour), a small group of swiss fintech companies chosen by switzerlands biggest start up incubator
* One of switzerlands largest newspapers [wrote a whole article about Curio](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/geld/fuer-100-franken-einen-anteil-an-einem-ferrari-kaufen/story/28029869)
* a thousand other things like [being chosen as the best swiss crypto startup](https://gomedici.com/top-blockchain-startups-in-switzerland-crypto-valley)

What does Curio do? Well, let’s start with a copypasta: CurioInvest is a fintech platform enabling tokenized investments in rare collectible cars and other fine assets. Curio brings real-world assets into the Blockchain, so private investors can use them as collateral for lending as well as other DeFi services."" In essence, it enables new financial services in previous illiquid markets available for both institutional as well as retail investors.

But let me put it in simpler words:

Rich folk don’t just buy boomer ETFs or invest in hedgefunds. They also buy really really nice shit that appreciates in value even more than their stocks. Quote by Christoph Gröne (rich fuck): “When you have 250 million, you can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door. You can't destroy it. You buy a car, the car becomes more valuable. You buy houses, the houses become more valuable. You go into Gold, the Gold becomes more valuable. You can't destroy the money by consumption.” (for German speaking folks, it's [right a at the start of this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y2WxM2Srlc))

**Wait, did he just say you buy a car and it becomes more valuable?** Yes he did, and he knows best, since he has these 250 million bucks.

Now, he isn’t talking about buying a Ford Focus, but about buying really nice cars. He can do it, but you and I can’t. But what if we split that Ferrari F12tdf worth $1 Million into a million parts? You would throw $100 in, I’m putting 20k down and if we find enough people, we can buy that really nice car and everyone has a stake in it. Remember: You can throw the money out the window and it will come back in through the door, you can’t destroy it. This is how the rich fucks are doing it, they just don’t need a crowd.

And now give a big fucking applause to CURIO: With Curio, really nice real-world assets are being tokenized so that you and I TOGETHER can buy our fair share of that Ferrari, of that nice real estate object, of that fine Mona Lisa or nice million dollar bottle of wine and make money like the rich fucks do.

It's a fork of MakerDAO and its stablecoin, $USDFL is backed by a collateral.   


Freeliquid allows liquidity providers to borrow up to 90% of their stablecoin LP tokens in $USDFL as collateral. Users can then reinvest the loans in their LP's with no additional cost (it charges a 0% APR for now) and no liquidation possible. ROI increases by 90% then and there without doing anything much.

I'm currently getting a 30% ROI on stablecoins.

  
For those wondering how I'm able to obtain MAD APYs with Freeliquid:

1. Deposit USDC/USDT in Uniswap. 

2. Collateralize my LPs for a 90% USDFL loan via #Freeliquid's smart contracts. 

3. Convert USDFL to USDC/USDT

4. Add more liquidity. 

5. Repeat the collateralization process. 

6. Once satisfied with earnings, I can sell my borrowed liquidity for USDFL, pay back my Freeliquid loan, and regain secure control over my LPs.

It charges no fees atm but it has proposed a 2% fees and when that happens. $FL could moon big. If you ask me, literally any fork of MakerDAO can be worth in the hundreds of millions, $FL can moon big."

I'm basically borrowing stablecoins with no fees and putting it at its optimal returns. Dogecoin to the moon but just don't get rekt."

MakerDAO only has one uni LPT available at the same ratio (freeliquid has forked MakerDAO I guess), at least DAI has sufficient liquidity to trade:

Or, should I wait for uni v3 because concentrating liquidity on a stablepair around 0.90 - 1.10 will yield more fees than even uni v2 with a high leverage? I am just trying to leverage for higher fee capture to increase APR."

SubDAO: We believe that an era of DAO lies right ahead.,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SubDAO/comments/mt4wyl/subdao_we_believe_that_an_era_of_dao_lies_right/,SubDAO,1,2021-04-18 11:06:40,0,/r/u_SubDAO/comments/mt4wyl/subdao_we_believe_that_an_era_of_dao_lies_right/,,"If you cut off a spider’s head, it dies; if you cut off a starfish’s leg it grows a new one, and that leg can grow into an entirely new starfish. Traditional top-down organizations are like spiders, and distributed organizations are like starfish, having a strong ability to survive.

In today’s block-chain world, such starfish organization is known as DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) which makes it possible for the old social system to go through earth-shattering changes. In DAO, the rules of management and operation are written on the blockchain in the form of a smart contract, according to which everyone acts in an open and fair way, thus realizing self-operation and “unstoppable” ability without centralized control and human intervention.

Since the failure of “the DAO” project in 2016, DAO has gone a long way, such as MakerDAO, Aragon, and MolochDAO, which are all based on Ethereum ecology. However, although we have witnessed the maturity and growth of the ecosystem, it is still in its infancy and it is too early to put it into operation on a large scale as it needs more time to evolve. With the maturity of Polka Ecology (Substrate framework is functioning increasingly perfectly, supporting one-click chaining) and compatibility (supporting cross-chaining), we have perceived the opportunity that DAO can further develop based on Polka.

There is a governance module in the Substrate framework. While creating a Runtime, the creator can freely choose to join this module, and its goal is self-evident: enable the Substrate chain to realize completely decentralized self-management. SubDAO Network (also known as Starfish Network) has different goals. The goal of **SubDAO** is to create a (1) cross-chain platform providing (2) general and customized functionalities to govern a DAO (3) connecting to DApp with the ability to (4) access off-chain external data. SubDAO enables organizations without major service chains to easily use cross-chain assets and cross-chain protocols to complete smart contract-based events, which is our initial assumption about SubDAO for Polka ecology.

Aragon has gone the extra mile for the standardized definition of DAO. We think that in the initial stage, SubDAO should realize several types of DAO templates of the simplest version, such as Fund Template, Parachain Slot Auction Template, and Voting Template, so as to design different templates by defining different types of events:

l Define creation rules (such as defining membership);

l Define voting rules;

l Define the rules and custody methods of fund pools;

l Define the budget process.

And in terms of user experience, it allows Polka users to create a DAO within “15 minutes”:

a. Select a template;

b. Select the organization name;

c. Set parameters for each template;

d. Submit the generated organization.

The early design version of SubDAO can realize the following (but not limited to) tasks and functions.

l A Polka parallel chain can realize simple fundraising through fundraising templates;

l A VC for Polka can use multiple currencies as a fund pool to complete multi-signing of the fund pool through the fund template and the investment proposal through voting, and use the fundraising DAO of the above-mentioned parallel chain to complete the token purchase. At the same time, the new tokens obtained can be guaranteed by the shareholder currency;

l An IPO-oriented fund can inject DOT and participate in the IPO voting process through the IPO template, and interact with the IPO module of the parallel chain. The DOT or parallel chain tokens obtained can be guaranteed by equity currency, and complete mortgage lending, currency stabilization, and other operations even through Acala or other parallel chains;

l A localized community (such as Polkaworld Community) can get donations supported by multiple parallel chains and go through the application and approval process of activity budget for different parallel chains.

To complete the above cases, we not only need to redesign the Ethereum products similar to Aragon, but need to design the special events of Polka:

l DAO needs to support event interaction with relay chain, and treasury, governance and society modules of other parallel chains, etc.;l

l DAO needs to support asset interaction with other parallel chains.

Although there are, of course, other aspects involving more technical planning of the SubDAO project, there is no need to describe them one by one in detail here.

The development of human society is undergoing a great change of decentralization. Perhaps this society will not be completely decentralized in the end, but at least centralization and decentralization will coexist. Organizations similar to DAO have cut a figure and made its way from Wikipedia to Skype in the traditional economy. The smart contract will become a milestone to the maturity and boom of DAO organization, just as Bitcoin has triggered a financial revolution. When DAO is mature enough to replace traditional organizations, there will be a major social change for us to embrace.

In that new society, people have the right and freedom to form organizations without centralization, borders, and government censorship. Everyone can freely put forward and decide their own needs, abide by and safeguard the rules of their own organization so as to build a more just and democratic society in which there are no sanctions or unreasonable instructions. The demands put forward by people or organizations, which will be displayed as a series of codes in the smart contract, can be voted and executed according to certain rules.

We believe that an era of DAO lies right ahead."

1) how to join Liquidity Pools (should I do uniswap, what about the binance chain and cakeswap, wtf is sushiswap...too many swaps).  Am I doomed to transfer fees everywhere?
2) yield farming? Compound? I've only recently learned of this and am just now reading more
3) staking. Is it worth taking mining revenue and staking it in Dot or Ada? Seems like smaller revenues from a small miner may not return any real revenue
4) Makerdao - is this lending a la crypto mode?
5) exchanges. How do people know the ""legitness"" of a dex? Example. I mined Ergo for 2 days for fun to learn about different algorithms. I look at coinmarketcap and see gate.io /coinex / vitex / got it and the list goes on...how do I bet the exchanges?

What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)? (Guide),https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/mvcj5v/what_is_a_decentralized_autonomous_organization/,Expensive-Analyst-65,1,2021-04-21 18:13:18,15,/r/defi/comments/mvcj5v/what_is_a_decentralized_autonomous_organization/,," Here's a quick guide for you all to get up to speed on what a DAO actually is!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a DAO?**

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, DAO, is a type of organization that isn't managed by people, but by computer programs. This allows a DAO to function by itself without the need for any human control. DAOs automate functions that would've otherwise been done by humans, through the use of many smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does a DAO work?**

To first create a DAO, the rules have to be created and put into smart contracts that run the organization, then there is a funding round. Since there is no central authority, DAOs operate by a token system where holders of the tokens get voting rights to make decisions and changes, essentially a governance token. So individuals now also have a monetary incentive to see the DAO succeed. This encourages its community to vote on changes that will be in the best interest of the organization as a whole.

Since DAOs operate on a blockchain, every financial transaction and rule change is recorded and publicly available to view. This makes it a completely transparent organization which anybody would be free to audit at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of a DAO**

MakerDAO is a DAO that is behind the stablecoin DAI. Unlike a stablecoin like USDC, MakerDAO doesn't control how many DAI are created, that is up to the users. Anybody can create DAI and use their other services, no sign-up required. Since it is decentralized most changes and decisions are made and voted on by its stakeholders, those who hold the MKR token. Eventually, the foundation will push MakerDAO into full decentralization where every aspect of the platform is decided by its community.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why were DAOs created?**

DAOs were created to solve the principal-agent dilemma. The dilemma is that in a system where an individual, “agent”, can make decisions on behalf of others, the “principal”, there are risks that the agent won't make decisions that are in the best interest of the principal. Essentially, somebody that is making decisions for others may only make decisions that benefit themselves. This is a large problem that many organizations and companies around the world face.

The way DAOs try to solve this is by first making the organization decentralized. If no one person can control the organization, then there is less risk that somebody could control it the way they want. Since the DAO runs on the internet it means that everything can be done automatically which decreases the reliance on humans. Then the token system gives its stakeholders a reason to make good changes for the organization. If they try to make bad decisions or ones that won't benefit others, when those changes get voted on the other stakeholders will simply vote against it.

In theory, the concept of a DAO is quite a revolutionary, and possibly disruptive, technology. With MakerDAO leading the pack, it will be interesting to see how they evolve and grow over time.

Radix possibly the most long term moon project in crypto today (Betanet in 7 Days),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mvpzeq/radix_possibly_the_most_long_term_moon_project_in/,T2000-TT,1,2021-04-22 05:31:40,20,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mvpzeq/radix_possibly_the_most_long_term_moon_project_in/,Low MCAP coin,"There are a lot of memecoins going round but today I present you with an actual project. Radix is the only L1 protocol with unlimited scalability and full atomic composability across all shards.


For people who don't know what atomic composability is, it is the ability to instantly commit a transaction across multiple shards at the same time in a single step. This is in contrast to non-atomic composability where a transaction goes through on one shard first and then other shards later or cross shard transactions take multiple blocks to process. Non atomic composability is really inefficient and completely breaks a lot of apps, things like flash loans and apps like yearn and MakerDAO stop working properly across shards without atomic composability and even apps like Uniswap can experience problems.
By providing atomic composability and Unlimited scalability Radix is the only project that will be able to scale DeFi indefinitely into the future without issues.


Radix makes dapp building much easier too, dapps are built out of FSM components which are more secure than solidity smart contracts, easier to build and easier to learn for traditional web devs crossing over into the world of decentralised apps. App developers who build useful components on Radix will receive lifetime royalties whenever their component is used, encouraging the growth of the Radix ecosystem and rewarding devs for making valuable contributions.
Right now the project is sitting at a marketcap of 170M, this is nothing for a project that is solving such huge problems and has this level of technology.
If the tech wasn't enough, Radix is about to release their Betanet a week from today and Mainnet in June. It is early now but momentum is building up now and after seeing what recently happened with Solana I don't think it will remain undervalued for much longer.

TLDR
- Unlimited scalability, very fast, cheap fees
- The only platform where apps don't lose performance with sharding
- Easy to build apps on
- Lower risk of smart contract exploits
- Great developer incentive program (lifetime rewards)
- Betanet in 1 week, Mainnet in June
- 170M marketcap
Radix has real potential to be a top 10 project."

The MakerDAO governance community consists of two major components:   


* **On-chain Governance**
* **Off-chain Governance**

While On-chain Governance takes place via the [Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), Off-chain Governance happens in the [MakerDAO forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/). It’s a place where everyone can come discuss, ask questions, and have their voice heard. 

**It’s fundamentally possible to influence MakerDAO’s expertise-driven decision-making processes without holding any MKR.**

As part of the efforts to further better governance participation, the DAO has enabled an incentive mechanism to reward forum contributions, called SourceCred. As a consequence, you don’t need MKR tokens to both positively influence Maker Governance and be financially rewarded for doing so.

In short, you can get DAI rewards for forum contributions appreciated by other members.

# 1. Market Wrap: Bitcoin in Neutral at $55.5K as Ether Continues Bull Run

&gt;***The price of bitcoin has changed little over the past 24 hours, despite the asset’s notorious volatility.***  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s boring bitcoin so far this week, with ether making gains for traders in a crypto market that overall is still signaling bullishness.  
Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $55,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.9% over the previous 24 hours.  
Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,565-$57,043  
BTC close to the 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.  
The price of bitcoin has changed little over the past 24 hours, despite the asset’s notorious volatility causing the spot market to undulate from $54,565 to $57,043 during the session, a $2,478 swing.  
Nevertheless, BTC has mostly stayed above $55,000 for almost a month. According to historical data, the last time bitcoin closed below that level was back on March 26.

# 2. Bitcoin Liquidity ‘Likely to Remain Resilient’ After Volatility Shock, JPMorgan Says

&gt;***JPMorgan expects bitcoin liquidity should recover, though it may take a few days as market conditions stabilize.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin’s (BTC) 15% sell-off earlier this week occurred as leveraged long positions were quickly liquidated, but since then, the market appears to have stabilized, suggesting “the worst of liquidations are behind us,” JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts wrote on Wednesday.  
“A recovery in the hashrate and signs of more efficient arbitrage trading suggests liquidity should continue to improve from here,” the analysts wrote in a report.  
“Going forward, bitcoin liquidity should remain robust and resilient; depth on major exchanges has continued to drop less and recover faster than other asset classes.”  
The report also mentioned the unique value of 24/7 access to consistent and stable liquidity pools in cryptocurrency markets, which could encourage overall stability.  
The sell-off was “likely exacerbated by the prevalence of high-frequency market making, which we estimate makes up \~80% of on-screen liquidity on major cryptocurrency exchanges and is prone to runs when threatened by a spike in volatility.”  
“Though it will take a few days to play out, history suggests liquidity should recover quickly.”

# 3. Maker Price Passes $4K for First Time, as MakerDAO Brings Real Estate to DeFi

&gt;***“Real world” assets have entered DeFi, as the Maker protocol reportedly just minted $38,000 of dai stablecoins to finance a mortgage loan.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Maker made history in 2017 as the first blockchain-based protocol to launch a major automated cryptocurrency-lending platform, helping to initiate a boom in what’s known as decentralized finance, or DeFi.  
Now Maker is paving the way for what might become another source of growth in the now-$60 billion DeFi industry: lending against trillions of dollars of “real-world” assets like residential properties, in competition with banks and other financiers. In this case, “real world” refers to collateral other than cryptocurrencies. Even the giant U.S. bank Citigroup is writing about Maker.  
Holders of the project’s maker (MKR) tokens have been rewarded with a 55% price increase in the past week, the second-most among the 46 cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of at least $3 billion. The token has gained nearly six-fold this year to a market value of about $4 billion.

# 4. Binance’s Tesla Stock Token May Have Raised Regulatory Red Flags

&gt;***Binance may need a license to market security tokens to the Hong Kong public.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Binance’s marketing campaign for its security token representing Tesla stocks to citizens in Hong Kong may be a violation of local securities regulations, according to a prominent local news outlet.  
Inducing members of the Hong Kong public to purchase securities is a regulated activity that requires a license from the city’s top financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Gaven Cheong, a partner at law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons told the South China Morning Post on Wednesday. Binance does not appear to have secured a license to market or trade security tokens in the region, according to the report.  
Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume, launched its first Binance Stock Token on April 12. This new service allows its users to buy fractions of companies’ shares with digital tokens. The zero-commission tokens qualifies holders for returns including dividends.

# 5. Ampleforth Is Giving Governance Tokens to Every Wallet That Ever Held AMPL

&gt;***Project leads estimate over 75,000 users will be eligible to claim the new FORTH governance token.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Rebasing cryptocurrency protocol Ampleforth is launching a governance token that all past and present users of its price-elastic AMPL token are able to claim.  
Project leads told CoinDesk any wallet that has ever “touched” AMPL — 75,743 wallets at press time — will be eligible to collect its portion of the new FORTH tokens through the next year. Active participants in the protocol should expect a higher share, they said.  
The FORTH airdrop is set to be Ampleforth’s first step in decentralizing the decision-making process that keeps its uncollateralized token, which has a market cap of around $460 million, more or less orbiting $1. Coinbase Pro listed FORTH Wednesday, shortly after the token’s reveal.

Who owns the actual real-asset in the newlly issued loan by the maker foundation (in case of default)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mw30qu/who_owns_the_actual_realasset_in_the_newlly/,asl2dwncb29dakjn3daj,1,2021-04-22 19:52:08,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mw30qu/who_owns_the_actual_realasset_in_the_newlly/,,"Pardon my ignorance here. I am here after reading a news story online. 


If I understand this correctly...MakerDAO just accepted a real-asses (non-digital) as collateral against a DAI loan. 

My question: in case the lender defaults, and the DAO remains with the real-world-assest, how is the DAO going to liquidate this assest? A real assest rests on legal frameworks. It also requires physical actions. 


(I tried to keep this as short as I can)


Thanks so much!"

Not even sure how Celo doesn't get much attention,https://www.reddit.com/r/celo/comments/mwc2t8/not_even_sure_how_celo_doesnt_get_much_attention/,FaviniTheGreat,1,2021-04-23 03:03:19,10,/r/celo/comments/mwc2t8/not_even_sure_how_celo_doesnt_get_much_attention/,,"I finally decided to make the choice and concentrate most of my investments into cryptocurrency rather than silver or stocks which I did for all of 2020. I opened my coinbase account and did the basic tasks to get the free crypto. Those small tasks are very good since they give you a basic introduction. I still hold the first tasks I did like Algorand, MakerDao, and Celo. This Celo platform has shown me how good of a platform it is and seeing how Deutsche Telekom decided to buy Celo surprises me of how Celo doesn't get more attention. I like Tmobile since they have always tried to be different from the cellphone industry. I know they offer bank accounts, paying solutions, unlimited data, netflix accounts, home internet that's cheaper than most internet providers. I'm not entirely sure what their plan is with CELO other than a network of sending money but I can't wait to see what they bring to the table. I love this CELO community. Keep it up guys!"
How not to get lost in the DeFi labyrinth and pay less fees,https://www.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/mwg2wk/how_not_to_get_lost_in_the_defi_labyrinth_and_pay/,autotldr,1,2021-04-23 06:03:16,0,/r/autotldr/comments/mwg2wk/how_not_to_get_lost_in_the_defi_labyrinth_and_pay/,,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://ariadneproject.space) reduced by 69%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Our story begins in frenetic 2021, where apart from massive growth and people buying meme stocks and coins, DeFi has opened the opportunity to be exposed to the rapidly appreciating and highly volatile assets while mainting USD-protected positions.

&gt; While Ethereum has a headstart there&amp;#039;s clearly more than one network that can carry financial services, and the void that is created while waiting for Ethereum 2.0 might be filled by other contestants such as Polkadot.

&gt; Multi-chain is currently also a user experience problem, managing their private keys was already hard for mom and pop, but constantly switching networks in Metamask, remember what token is used to pay for gas in a particular network and open multiple tabs for bridging capital between various blockchains is simply too much for most people.

&gt; While there is no shortage of DeFi dashboards we set out to deliver a service that would get you from point A to point B faster in your personal finances.

&gt; Scenario-driven user experience of Ariadne will let you move funds quicker and cheaper within a single or multiple blockchains.

&gt; While we do not target the DeFi space taken by zapper.

Everyone who has been in Cryptocurrency for a while knows that Reddit is one of the main hubs for Cryptocurrency information and communities (along with Twitter and Telegram).  However, with Reddit's search function not being ideal, and many communities having a variety of different names, it is hard to find any communities you may be looking for.

Below is a master-list of all CryptoCurrency Communities that have a significant presence on Reddit.  This list also includes ""Community Feed"" links, which carry a feed of all communities within a particular listing category.

This list will be updated as new communities are found or created.  Please comment below if there is a community you do not see listed.

DeFi: ¿Qué es el “farmeo” de criptomonedas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buenbit/comments/mx2843/defi_qué_es_el_farmeo_de_criptomonedas/,Buenbit,1,2021-04-24 02:48:03,0,/r/Buenbit/comments/mx2843/defi_qué_es_el_farmeo_de_criptomonedas/,,"Autora: [Diana Aguilar](https://twitter.com/criptodiana).

*Cuando comenzamos a adentrarnos en las finanzas descentralizadas, también conocidas como “DeFi”, nos encontramos con un concepto novedoso: “farmear”. Estamos hablando de una forma de generar dinero a partir de las criptomonedas que manejamos en este ecosistema donde viven servicios financieros que no dependen de bancos ni gobiernos. Pero ¿qué es el farming y cómo funciona?*

**Farmear: Una práctica común**

Este término viene de la palabra *farm* (que significa “granja” en inglés). Pero ¿por qué hablamos de “granja”? Pensemos en la [minería, que es la forma en la que se “crean” las criptomonedas.](https://buenbit.com/blog/negocio-para-pocos-como-funciona-la-mineria-en-bitcoin/) Un término común en el mundo de las criptomonedas es la de las “granjas” de minería, las cuales son sencillamente un conjunto de dos o más mineros. Estos mineros lo que hacen es validar y confirmar transacciones que suceden en las diferentes *blockchains,* como Bitcoin y Ethereum.

En base a esto, podemos decir que “farmear” es un verbo que significa **generar criptomonedas a partir de la actividad de minería con dos o más mineros.** Esta actividad se distingue por ser una forma de generar ingresos pasivos, algo muy atractivo que además se logra en otros tipos de instrumentos financieros del ecosistema DeFi. Veamos otro de ellos.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0ktbcmp3yyu61.jpg?width=901&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e3c76da4ccf78e493446e47bfdc50394d53294d)

**Crea ganancias con tus criptomonedas**

Ahora hablemos de un tipo diferente de *farming* o “farmeo” en el mundo de criptomonedas: el *yield farming* o “agricultura de rendimiento”. Esta es una práctica propia del ecosistema DeFi, la cual también permite a los usuarios realizar inversiones empleando tokens y criptomonedas directamente para cosechar ingresos pasivos.

La agricultura de rendimiento es una forma de inversión que se realiza usando la tecnología de Ethereum y de contratos inteligentes, y que es cada vez más utilizada entre los usuarios de las criptomonedas. **El** ***yield farming*** **se basa en comprar criptoactivos (principalmente**[ **tokens ERC-20**](https://buenbit.com/blog/como-armar-tu-propio-token-ethereum-en-cinco-minutos/)**, como Dai) y resguardarlos para generar valor.**

Pero ¿cómo funciona y en qué se diferencia de otras formas de inversión? Puesto de forma sencilla, en primer lugar, puedes diversificar las plataformas de inversión empleadas para colocar tus fondos y aumentar tu capital. Siendo literales respecto a la analogía de la “granja”, lo que hacemos es “plantar” nuestros fondos en diferentes tipos de plataformas para cosechar ganancias. Pero el proceso involucra más que esto, convirtiéndose en una actividad que requiere cierto nivel de estrategia por parte de aquellas personas que deseen invertir en criptomonedas o tokens. 

Así nos encontramos con un nuevo término: ***liquidity pools*** **o piscinas de liquidez.** Cada plataforma de inversión cuenta con esta herramienta, la cual es básicamente un contrato inteligente que contiene fondos. Cuando un usuario destina capital en cierto token o criptomonedas, se convierte en un proveedor de liquidez, lo cual le genera ingresos por parte de la plataforma en la forma de recompensas dependiendo del protocolo que maneje cada servicio. 

Finalmente, podemos proceder a experimentar y elegir [el mejor protocolo](https://buenbit.com/blog/como-elegir-el-mejor-protocolo-defi/) o servicio para sacar ganancias a nuestro capital haciendo agricultura de rendimiento.

**Farmear en la práctica**

Actualmente, existen proyectos como MakerDAO el cual es el emisor de la *stablecoin* o criptomoneda estable Dai y precursor en la práctica de farmear o realizar agricultura de rendimiento. Esto se debe a la capacidad de Dai para generar buenos rendimientos (al día de hoy, Buenbit ofrece retornos dolarizados del 9% anual) y generar grandes ganancias a mediano y largo plazo.

Por ejemplo, si deseamos hacer agricultura de rendimiento, podemos ir a un exchange descentralizado como Uniswap, donde es posible crear una piscina de liquidez o ser proveedora de liquidez. 

Una vez en la plataforma, podemos depositar tokens o criptomonedas (ether y Dai, por ejemplo) en un contrato inteligente generado por la plataforma, el cual permite a cualquier usuario realizar el intercambio de sus tokens por los nuestros en esta piscina. Claro, debemos aclarar que hablamos de montos importantes ya que una piscina de liquidez podría tener, por ejemplo, 1.000 ETH y 1.000.000 DAI. De esta forma, permitiría al creador de la piscina recibir recompensas por parte de la plataforma y generar rendimientos con sus fondos. 

De otra forma, podemos sencillamente participar en piscinas pre-existentes e intercambiar nuestros tokens o servirnos de los beneficios para inversores que ofrecen las plataformas donde elijamos operar.

*Debemos dejar en claro que realizar esta actividad de inversión puede ser altamente riesgosa, por lo que se recomienda discreción en el manejo de fondos y siempre realizar una investigación previa antes de colocar nuestro dinero en alguna plataforma.*"

SpaceSwap – Platform That Provides Multi-Layered Reward System Through MILK2 Coin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/mx41i6/spaceswap_platform_that_provides_multilayered/,danie_lalex,1,2021-04-24 04:13:49,0,/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/mx41i6/spaceswap_platform_that_provides_multilayered/,,"Exceeding the technical possibilities, [SpaceSwap](https://spaceswap.app/) enables cross-platform token transition. It allows users to move their liquidity tokens from one pool to another so that they can move their current deposits to SpaceSwap pools with minimal transaction fees. Project developers promise to provide a wide range of various liquidity pools for DeFi &amp; CeFi protocols - Oracles, lending protocols, synthetic assets, and so on. SpaceSwap DeFi protocol gives liquidity providers additional means of profit-making. While conventional protocols are designed to bring liquidity providers loan interest only, SpaceSwap takes it a step further by introducing a new scheme of yield farming. Aside from the high APY rates, users will enjoy additional incentives in the form of MILK tokens. Thus, their passive income isn’t restricted by the deposit period.

**Features of SpaceSwap**

SpaceSwap garnered a lot of attraction since its very beginning, owing to its 2 unique features:

▪ **A one-stop-station for all major DeFi protocols.** 

SpaceSwap integrates all prominent DeFi protocols in one place. For the first stage, leading protocols such as Curve, Compound, and AAVE (among others) will be added. Later, SpaceSwap will support DeFi stablecoins and CeFi stablecoins such as yDAI, aUSDT, wBTC and sUSD. Synthetic assets for cryptocurrencies and major oracles like MakerDAO and Compound will also be integrated in the future.  

▪ **Multi-layer reward system**

The incentivization plan of [SpaceSwap](https://spaceswap.app/) engages users even when they don't have any deposits. The native token on the platform, Milky Way tokens (MILK2), are provided in addition to interest. This will be particularly profitable after a few months, considering the fact that the price of MILK2 will rise once the project is fully evolved. The best part is, to encourage users to move their assets, SpaceSwap rewards are multiplied for the first blocks.

▪ SpaceCrew - Decentralized exchange liquidity pool - 08/30/2021.

▪ Key partnerships - new pools, new exchanges - 2021, 2022

SpaceSwap pools accrue profit for liquidity providers through all the DeFi protocols at the same time. Uniswap yields profit during the period that assets are being held in their liquidity pools. Users earn trading fees only as long as their assets are stored there. However, with SpaceSwap, it is different; LP’s opportunities are expanded. Users with crypto deposits are offered MILK2 tokens in addition to trading fees. So, even when you have to pull your funds out and thus no longer contribute to the liquidity of the platform, you can still earn a profit through your MILK2 reserves from the protocol's fees.

Economics of DAO,https://www.reddit.com/r/dao/comments/myqxe7/economics_of_dao/,economicsdesign,1,2021-04-26 14:02:46,7,/r/dao/comments/myqxe7/economics_of_dao/,,"As the world moves towards digitisation, many things are changing.  One of the themes we talk about in this series is economics. Economics  is really about **organising and coordinating resources** in our economy.

And that brings us to today's topic of DAO. It is a **new way of organisation** in our increasingly changing economy.

&amp;#x200B;

DAO is an organisation for decision making. Everyone that is part  owner of this organisation also gets to vote on decisions. Decisions can  vary — how to allocate funds, which projects to support, what to do  with funds.

DAOs are

1. Not centralised, so no one person can interfere with decision making *(Looking at you,* [*Adam Neumann*](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/24/20882133/wework-adam-neumann-dual-super-voting-stock-shares-tech-ipo) *from WeWork)*
2. Transparent and auditable
3. Cannot be shut down by any one

*My utopia*:  I imagine a world where we exist digitally. Where it transcends  geographical jurisdictions and create governance rules on its own. You  can decide which governance rule you prefer and exist in that digital  ecosystem. We are not bounded by race, nationality, skin colour or  language. But by philosophy and ideology. Then the market will decide  which autonomous organisation will succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Economics is more than just supply in demand. In DAOs, we will discuss these 3 economics:

* **Economics of trust**: we want to be able to trust the parties we are interacting with. This is done through smart contracts and skin in the game. *Example:* [*PieDAO*](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-piedao-the-asset-allocation-dao-1af9eec5ee4)
* **Economics of coordination**:  decision making with a small group of shareholders is tough. Decision  making with a decentralised group is even harder. DAO helps with this  coordination. *Example:*  [*MolochDAO*](https://www.molochdao.com/)*,* [*MakerDAO*](https://blog.makerdao.com/)
* **Economics of allocation**:  like how government collect tax revenue and decide where to allocate  it, the DAO also gets to decide on the governance structure of the  ecosystem. *Example:* [*KyberDAO*](https://blog.kyber.network/kyberdao-staking-and-voting-overview-70be71ee58f0?gi=ccc654bd482d)*,* [*Dash*](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html)*,* [*LAO*](https://medium.com/openlawofficial/the-lao-a-for-profit-limited-liability-autonomous-organization-9eae89c9669c) *(by OpenLaw)*

Ultimately, DAO is a **new way of governance as our economies continue to evolve**.  It could use tokens or do without. It is still part of the economics  design since it is a way of decentralised governance. If you go deeper  into details of the various DAO mechanisms, you will realise that the **mechanisms are not the same**.

Let me know if you want me to do a deep dive into a DAO or other episodes that you are interested in. Check the [video explanation](https://youtu.be/bCblZG3KXGY) here."
DAI Compared With Fiat- and Commodity Backed Stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/myrwge/dai_compared_with_fiat_and_commodity_backed/,thumbsdrivesmecrazy,1,2021-04-26 15:13:17,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/myrwge/dai_compared_with_fiat_and_commodity_backed/,,"Dai is one of the first examples of decentralized finance (DeFi), whe users looking to onboard and borrow Dai would need to deposit ETH into the smart contracts maintained and regulated by MakerDAO.

Stablecoins are digital assets that are pegged to a reserve asset. These coins bypass volatility in favour of remaining the same value as the reserve they are pegged to. Stablecoins are still built using blockchain technology, they do not operate with the same supply / demand economic values that many other cryptocurrencies do.

Whether calculating expected returns or present and future market value, the interest rate is a key variable based on the lending and borrowing of assets.

Interest rates for cryptocurrencies incentivize users to loan out their crypto assets, because users can earn higher returns by lending their assets, than they could have by storing them in a personal wallet or device. Rates for cryptocurrencies, coupled with strong demand for borrowing, would free previously idle balances of capital for investing, trading, and generating new market activity.

Despite the benefits that active lending, borrowing, staking and allocation would generate for the cryptocurrency industry, investors and overall market activity growth, the sector is still in the early stages of development. 

Interest on crypto deposits can vary by up to 16 percentage points, depending on the platform. This variance exists in large part because of the difference in business models.

Service providers, such as Nexo, borrow cryptocurrencies from primarily retail customers and provide loans in fiat. Others, such as [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), enables customers to stake cryptocurrencies through locking coins up for a period of time by using an app. Decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders, such as MakerDAO, facilitate loans strictly financed in crypto and paid out in also crypto. Platforms like [Midas.Investments](https://Midas.Investments) rely on allocations and all available mechanisms for earning yields enabling to invest in a managed and automated investment portfolio based on a strategy with rebalancing.

Each of these services attracts different client segments with varying expectations of fees and service levels.

Over time, companies with competitively low interest rates on cryptocurrencies will go out of business. The natural dynamics of the free market, as applied to any industry, weed out inefficient business models and promote standards of practice through competition. As the sector grows and consolidates, interest rates are likely to converge to sustainable levels.

Rocketpool Node Operator Token RPL value,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mz2cij/rocketpool_node_operator_token_rpl_value/,Altruistic-Good1296,1,2021-04-27 00:59:51,27,/r/ethstaker/comments/mz2cij/rocketpool_node_operator_token_rpl_value/,,"I'm considering running one or more Rocketpool Node(s) but can't get my head around how the Rocketpool RPL token accrues value. It seems that running a RocketPool node may make an extra % or two in ETH staking rewards, which in itself may not be worth it over running a vanilla ETH2 node. The RPL staking, on the other hand, is more difficult for me to determine value. While it'll be nice to use it and be able to pay the bills while accruing more ETH:

* What can RPL be used for other than rocketpool governance or swapping to something else to sell? Are there defi applications? I know rEth may soon be accepted into MakerDao which will let it be used in a variety of different ways (maybe allowing for higher returns than locking up eth as a node operator??)
* How does RPL accrue value? It seems like it may get bought up initially since it's a requirement to run a RocketPool node, but it inflates at 5%/year. Given that inflation, will it even keep up with ETH's price or will its value drop (RPL/ETH, RPL/USD), potentially requiring more to be put into the node to maintain the minimum collateral/insurance requirements?"

Liquidation risks / Sudden spikes in DAI price,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mzpwme/liquidation_risks_sudden_spikes_in_dai_price/,torkildj,1,2021-04-27 22:38:36,18,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mzpwme/liquidation_risks_sudden_spikes_in_dai_price/,,"I am new to the MakerDAO project and I am looking to take a loan against my ETH. My goal is to convert the generated DAI to USDC and use that USDC to generate passive income that would give me around 10-13% currently. Given the fact that the stability fee is 5.5% for ETH-A, I could make some nice returns.

When it comes to my ETH stack, I am risk averse, so I am looking for a liquidation ratio of about 400%, which should give me ample time add more collateral, in case there is a downturn in ETH prices. 

What I am not sure about is how the liquidation engine works and if sudden spikes in the DAI price could cause a liquidation, with my proposed liquidation ratio. 

If there is anybody with some in-depth knowledge about liquidation in relation to proper risk management and taking my situation into consideration, a little advice would be highly appreciated!"

What would happen, mechanically, if there was a spike in demand for DAI?  I don’t know what a big number would be, but let’s say some sovereign wealth fund decided to buy $x billion of DAI every day for a week; some number every day that’s 10 times the average daily volume. What would happen in the DAI market, the ETH market, and the MKR market?   What would happen to the stability fee?   How fast could MKR owners react?  Presumably the DAI savings rate would drop. But how?  Anything along these lines would be helpful.

InsurAce launches Insurance Services on its mainnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsurAce/comments/n068ws/insurace_launches_insurance_services_on_its/,PristineExpression87,1,2021-04-28 11:49:53,1,/r/InsurAce/comments/n068ws/insurace_launches_insurance_services_on_its/,,"After just one hour of launching their mainnet, [**InsurAce**](http://www.insurace.io/), the DeFi insurance protocol, hit its minimum stake requirements to commence providing insurance services. The **InsurAce** community staked $5 million in the first hour, equivalent to 25% of the protocol’s initial staking cap. After 12 hours, this had reached 50% of the $20 million target.

This triggered the launch of **InsurAce’s** insurance services within 24 hours of the mainnet launch, and by doing so, **InsurAce** becomes the second-largest live DeFi insurance protocol by market cap (as of 27th April at 12pm EST, according to CoinGecko).

**Initially, InsurAce will provide cover for twenty core protocols that have been announced as starting insurable assets:**

dHEDGE, Yearn.Finance, MakerDAO, Curve, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Ethereum, AAVE, Compound, Tornado Cash, Set Protocol, Synthetix, Nexus Mutual, Balancer, Vesper, Ren VM, dydx, Bancor, Reflexer, 1Inch.

DeFi Investors can look forward to the lowest premiums on the market when insuring their portfolios through **InsurAce** (proven to be up to 40%-60% less than leading competitors across a portfolio of 6 protocols with $4 million TVL). This portfolio method of insurance can also be more cost-effective with regards to Gas Fees compared to other insurance protocols. An example is laid out at the end of this article for a comparison of premium and gas fee. Furthermore, **InsurAce’s** insurance products have no KYC, respecting the privacy of its insurance customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Stakers already have access to high yields from the 6 tokens that can be staked with **InsurAce**. There is currently a limit to staking, set at $20 Million. Once achieved, the system will be stress tested for scalability ahead of releasing this cap and adding new tokens and insurance products. Following this, stakers can expect to earn a yield of 30–50% on average from their staked tokens.

**InsurAce** was recently audited by **SlowMist** and determined to be **“Low Risk”**. The audit report can be found here: [Audit Report](https://insurace-protocol.gitbook.io/landing-page/documentation/security/slowmist-security-auditing-report).

At the time of writing, there is over $60 billion Total Value Locked in DeFi projects globally. This figure is up from under $1 billion at the start of 2020 and doesn’t appear to be slowing down. Despite the enormity of the existing holdings, under 2% of the market is insured against faults, hacks, and other failures in the smart contracts that this value is held on.

Moreover, in the last 9 months alone, there have been losses totalling over $120 million due to exactly the types of issues that will be covered by DeFi insurance protocols.

InsurAce’s new insurance services and mainnet look to expand quickly into this market, boosting confidence in DeFi and reducing smart contract risk. *Take a look for yourself at* [*app.InsurAce.io*](http://app.insurace.io/)*.*

**Gas Fee comparison**

We took a range of 10 protocols and bought cover through both **InsurAce** and Nexus Mutual, the current market leader in DeFi insurance. With our portfolio method of insurance, the gas fees of **InsurAce** were 50% cheaper than Nexus Mutual because you have to buy the 10 covers separately instead of together which results in higher Gas Fees. (This may not always be the case, but this information is up to date as of 27th April 2021 12pm EST. )

&amp;#x200B;

InsurAce Protocol is a Singapore based DeFi Insurance protocol that has quickly become the second largest protocol in DeFi insurance. At the time of writing, the protocol has a $40 million market cap based on a circulating supply of 8 million INSUR tokens. There is a maximum release of 100 million INSUR Tokens which can be mined through staking on the protocol."

The basket is meant to act  as a reserve to redeem holders if the cryptocurrency fails or faces  problems. Price fluctuations for stablecoins are not meant to exceed a  narrow range. 

 Social media behemoth Facebook’s Diem is the most famous example of a stablecoin. It is a dollar-backed coin. Other examples of stablecoins are USDC and MakerDAO."
Trying to fully understand my risks. Any help is appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/n3fewu/trying_to_fully_understand_my_risks_any_help_is/,pewpewtehpew,1,2021-05-03 04:40:06,3,/r/MakerDAO/comments/n3fewu/trying_to_fully_understand_my_risks_any_help_is/,,"I have a good stash of ETH and I would love to put it to use without actually selling it.  Two things I'm trying to do.

1. Put the ETH to work without selling and missing out on potential price gains.
2. Put the ETH to work and avoid paying capital gains taxes on it, since I'm not actually selling and creating a taxable event.

For these 2 things..I feel like MakerDAO and defi in general are awesome!  However, the variable interest rate scares me and I thought I read somewhere it was a 20% stability fee at one time.

My current test vault is an ETH-C vault, 3.5% interest with a 175% min. ratio.  Aside from all the obvious risks (hacks to the smart contracts, etc) is the biggest risk the fact that the stability fee can blow up? 

If it does, what's the cycle the rate changes on? 1yr, 6mo, etc?  

What scenario do you generally see these hikes happen in?  

Are there any defi platforms out there with fixed rates that function in a similar manner (borrowing against ETH)?  

Are there any projections of what the stability fees may look like in the future?

Why Ethereum will flip Bitcoin eventually.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3v1mm/why_ethereum_will_flip_bitcoin_eventually/,SweetPie123,1,2021-05-03 20:43:25,40,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3v1mm/why_ethereum_will_flip_bitcoin_eventually/,METRICS,"Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart-contracts as you all probably know. In this post I will point out the scale at which Ethereum is already operating, giving you a better idea how revolutionary it already is.

**Tokens.**

On Ethereum you can create your own token, ERC-20. Currently there's already **394,500** Token Contracts. To put that in perspective, the amount of publicly traded companies in the world is estimated at 630,000 companies. Creating a token on Ethereum is extremely simple, so there's likely a lot of 'dead' coins in the list, but the number is still impressive. Tether is the most popular token on Ethereum, with a volume or $105,099,469,661.00 today. One hundred five billion DAILY, to put that in perspective the NASDAQ recorded a volume of 254,089,239,573 [last friday](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DailyMarketSummary). One token on Ethereum doing roughly 40% of the NASDAQ shows the scale at which this coin already operates.

**Smart contracts.**

 ''A *smart contract* is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a *contract*. Smart *contracts* allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.'' - BlockGeeks. 

**Sectors smart contracts are useful:**

* **Supply Chain** **(basically the whole world exists out of supply chains):** Imagine you buy canned tomatoes in the supermarket, all the way up the supply chain someone needs to manufacture a new one to keep the store filled with food. A smart contract makes it easier to give that data to the manufacturer, cutting out intermediaries who often do the paperwork. Automating tasks &amp; payments could bring down the cost of producing significantly lower, less administrative burden. 
* **Healthcare ( $11.9 Trillion**)**:**  Smart contracts also make it possible to encrypt personal health data on the blockchain, so it's always visible whenever needed. The supply chain can also be regulated by smart contracts, as well as testing results and other medical applications. 
* **Automobile industry (70m cars yearly produced):** The whole world is moving to a more digitalized place every day, car manufactures are working on self-driving cars for instance. A smart contract could determine who's at fault in a crash from data the car provides, or insurance can give you a better rate depending on where you live and how safely you drive.
* **Real estate (investment market size $9.6 trillion in 2019**)**:** When buying/renting real estate there's always a lot of intermediaries who take a piece of the pie (Airbnb or instance). When you pay with crypto and set up a smart contract, you cut out the middleman. Every financial sector can profit from this, it's more secure and saves the consumer money.

The total marketcap of Ethereum is at the time of writing sitting at $365B, which is large but looking at the potential growth it can have just with smart contracts in some sectors tells me this is far from over. Of course these numbers represent the whole sector, but even if just 5% of the total value flows to Ethereum we will flip Bitcoin. 

**Decentralized Finance.**

DeFi is a financial system containing a variety of financial products, all fully decentralized. No bank or authority can stop transactions or freeze funds. Loans can be accessed within a few minutes, while legacy financial institutions can take days.

**4 largest DeFi projects by locked USD:**

* **MakerDAO - $11.43B (lending)**
* **AAVE - $11.00B (lending)**
* **Compound - $9.54B (lending)**
* **Uniswap - 8.2B (DEX).**

The global lending market is valued at **$6,751.2 billion.** Uniswap has a daily volume of $1.89B today, compared to the largest CEX Binance with a volume of 34,33B. 

Meanwhile Ethereum is revolutionizing the global markets, Bitcoin is stuck at being a 'store of value'. The total gold marketcap sits at 11.269T, while Bitcoin sits at a marketcap of $1.10T. Roughly a 10x or a  price of Bitcoin around 600K and it'll be larger than the current store of value, gold. Pick your bets, but with ETH 2.0 rollout going on you know where I'll put my money. It's not a question of ''if'' but ''when'' Ethereum will take #1 from Bitcoin. (I left NFT's out due to my lack of knowledge about them, better to just not mentioning it instead of spewing bs)."

I'm asking this question while pondering the long term growth and use of DAI; I can see a future where the dollar is no longer the primary currency for global commerce, but exists in competition with a number of currencies."

The Rocket Pool team is in conversation with the auditors from Consensys and Sigma Prime and is implementing as many of the suggestions as possible (This is regarding the removal of nETH from all the contracts + more gas efficient contracts). While audits are still in progress, it seems that they may be coming to an end soon. Once all improvements are made to the contracts, a new beta will start on the Prater testnet (likely in May). This next testnet will not be incentivized with rewards. Note: The contracts used for the Prater Testnet will likely be the same contracts used on mainnet, with very few variations.

**Beta News.**

The most recent Rocket Pool Beta on the Pyrmont Testnet concluded on April 30th. There will be a new testnet starting in May (the specific day has not yet been determined). For those of you that haven’t been able to test out Rocket Pool, there is no need to worry. There will be another beta on the Prater testnet.

**Tech**

Some of the results from the auditors have been communicated with the RP team. As a result, nETH will be removed from the Rocket Pool contracts. This will eliminate some complexity behind the contracts as well as make it more gas-efficient. 

**Integration With Other Dapps**

A few community members have applied for the use of rETH to be used as collateral in the MakerDAO protocol on April 19th. The results have been determined earlier today (May 3rd), with rETH being greenlit. Meaning it will be accepted as collateral in the future in the MakerDAO Protocol. 

As for integration with other protocols, we are currently drafting applications for RPL to be used in lending/borrowing protocols."

The progress made by decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Aave, Compound (COMP) and MakerDAO (MKR) is highlighted to a greater extent.

At the same time, company analysts noted that the value of outstanding loans in the sector also reached a record level, with Compound, MakerDAO and Aave accounting for the lion's share.

The Ethereum DeFi Pulse blockchain monitor shows that the total blocked value on the platforms is currently around $55 billion, down about 11% from the all-time high of $62 billion recorded on April 15.

While the total dollar value blocked in DeFi has declined, the total amount of ETH blocked in DeFi's Ethereum-based projects is hovering around the all-time high of about 10.74 million ETH.

Among other DeFi-related platforms built on Ethereum, decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap (UNI) holds nearly $6 billion, Curve Finance (CRV) holds $5.32 billion, and SushiSwap (DEX) holds $3.87 billion (DeFi Pulse data).

""For people who don't know what atomic composability is, it is the ability to instantly commit a transaction across multiple shards at the same time in a single step. This is in contrast to non-atomic composability where a transaction goes through on one shard first and then other shards later or cross shard transactions take multiple blocks to process. Non atomic composability is really inefficient and completely breaks a lot of apps, things like flash loans and apps like yearn and MakerDAO stop working properly across shards without atomic composability and even apps like Uniswap can experience problems. By providing atomic composability and Unlimited scalability Radix is the only project that will be able to scale DeFi indefinitely into the future without issues.""

***Just a side note, I kept the portion of the paragraph in relation to Radix as that was the thread being commented on.  If you want to learn more about Radix, his comment continues:***

""Radix makes dapp building much easier too, dapps are built out of FSM components which are more secure than solidity smart contracts, easier to build and easier to learn for traditional web devs crossing over into the world of decentralised apps. App developers who build useful components on Radix will receive lifetime royalties whenever their component is used, encouraging the growth of the Radix ecosystem and rewarding devs for making valuable contributions. Right now the project is sitting at a marketcap of 170M, this is nothing for a project that is solving such huge problems and has this level of technology. If the tech wasn't enough, Radix is about to release their Betanet a week from today and Mainnet in June. It is early now but momentum is building up now and after seeing what recently happened with Solana I don't think it will remain undervalued for much longer.

TLDR - Unlimited scalability, very fast, cheap fees - The only platform where apps don't lose performance with sharding - Easy to build apps on - Lower risk of smart contract exploits - Great developer incentive program (lifetime rewards) - Betanet in 1 week, Mainnet in June - 170M marketcap Radix has real potential to be a top 10 project.""

***Radix is still in the infant stages of development but something to keep an eye on, my intentions weren't to shill Radix with this post but to inform others about atomic composability and the potential solutions being proposed***"

How does Missile.Farm work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/n6sw8n/how_does_missilefarm_work/,GM2V,1,2021-05-07 15:26:22,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/n6sw8n/how_does_missilefarm_work/,,"**We** know that many have lost money in altcoins and have high levels of skepticism about this new opportunity.

So let’s break down what Missile Farm does in language as close as possible to how the current financial world works.

1. You know what interest is:

You have $10,000 in your bank account and you earn a 12.5% annual return on your investment. After 12 months, you receive a deposit of $12,500 as an interest payment. After five years, you have $16,250.

2. You know what compound interest is:

It’s interest on interest. You get interest on the initial amount you put in, and you get interest on the interest already accumulated from the previous years.

So with compound interest, after 5 years you won’t have $16,250, you’ll actually have $18,020.

So far, so good.

***But what if there was a “third way”?***

This is the question we asked ourselves as programmers.

3. Here’s what Missile interest is:

When you take your crypto and lock it up on Missile Farm we find ways to add to the compounding of your asset. If one of the platforms we use gives away a promotional coin on top of any interest, then we take that promo coin and sell it for more of what you staked.

‌���The result is a significantly higher overall annual return.

When Missile Farm combines your 3402% annual compounding interest with the 2480% interest of another site’s promotional coin, you get 5882% APY on Missile Farm.

Missile Farm’s wBNB vault is doing just that. At the time of writing, you get 6132% APY for your BNB.

***After just 1 month, that 10,000$ would already amount to 20684.5$. How about 12 months? An astounding 613,200$! ; even with a more realistic APY, which according to our predictive model would approach to 280% in 6 months, the 5 year ROI will be around 1,721,036.8$; all in the asset you actually staked!***

Even if the mechanism is not identified, this possibility may be a factor to deter some users from using DAI. I think this could be alleviated by explaining better the interplay between MR, DAI and the rest of the crypto market ecosystem. In practice, there are many scenarios that could be simulated using multi-agent simulations. The result of the many scenarios could be published and peer reviewed to demonstrate that DAI is resilient to certain scenarios and not resilient to other scenarios. This work could also help MakerDAO foundation to make more informed proposals."

Cryptocurrency  trading and use have been marked by volatility  since launch.  Stablecoins aim to reduce this overall volatility by  pegging their  value to a basket of goods, such as fiat currencies,  precious metals,  or other cryptocurrencies. The basket is meant to act  as a reserve to  redeem holders if the cryptocurrency fails or faces  problems. Price  fluctuations for stablecoins are not meant to exceed a  narrow range.

 Social  media behemoth Facebook’s Diem is the most famous example of a  stablecoin. It is a dollar-backed coin. Other examples of stablecoins  are USDC and MakerDAO."

I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.

43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web."

Liquity Protocol: A Better Alternative to MakerDAO for Collateralized Loans,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/n98yph/liquity_protocol_a_better_alternative_to_makerdao/,showSomeRespect13,1,2021-05-11 00:13:46,0,/r/ethtrader/comments/n98yph/liquity_protocol_a_better_alternative_to_makerdao/,Warning,"*Background:* I’ve been following Ethereum since 2016 and have been a user of Maker since the beginning - including opening one of the first couple hundred CDPs. I had the absolute pleasure of being liquidated in late summer of 2018 so I’ve seen the ins and outs of the protocol.

TL;DR: Liquity lets you take a loan at 0% with as low as 110% collateral.

[Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) is a new entrant to the collateralized loans space on Ethereum, having launched April 5th and reaching 1M ETH locked in only a couple weeks. It allows for borrowers to take loans out indefinitely at 0% interest. You read that correctly - *0%*.

There’s a 0.5% initial fee to borrow as well as a 200 LUSD liquidation reserve to help pay for gas in the event your position is liquidated. When you pay back your loan, the 200 LUSD will be returned to you.

*So, why, with terms that are so incredibly favorable to borrowers hasn’t this project seen more fanfare?*

Well, to be honest with you, I’m not sure. The team is incredibly intelligent and seems to be approaching it from a heads-down academic perspective, with no marketing to speak of. I only stumbled across it randomly myself last week and was surprised I hadn’t heard a word about it in the full year up to the launch, or even as it climbed to #6 on the DeFi Pulse lending index.

*What’s the catch?*

For borrowers, there isn’t really a major downside under normal circumstances compared to MakerDAO *except* that Liquity only accepts ETH as collateral. In the event of a black swan, and ETH crashes immediately and aggressively, you’d be susceptible to liquidations. For very short term loans with large positions, you might be better off using Maker due to the 0.5% fee you’d pay up front to borrow. There are very rare situations where you may be liquidated below 150%. I won’t pretend to be able to explain it better than the docs themselves, so take a look [here](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/recovery-mode)

*So this all sounds great, how can this be?*

MakerDAO uses a variety of incentives to keep DAI pegged to $1, including having the governance feature of MKR tokens raising/lowering borrowing rates to encourage specific borrow/redemption behavior.

Liquity will automatically raise borrowing fees ever so slightly above 0.5% when very large loans are taken out (the amount is nearly negligible, however). LUSD that are minted from your “trove” - the equivalent of a CDP or vault in Maker’s system - can *always* be redeemed for $1 worth of ETH from the system. In the case LUSD falls below $1, you would expect redemptions to occur, reducing LUSD supply. If LUSD were to go above $1, minting new LUSD from your trove for a quick arbitrage brings it back to $1.

The real reason Liquity shines is that capital is always available for liquidated troves. Whereas Maker uses an auction system, which inherently requires a larger collateral in the event of a large price drop in the collateral to protect the system, Liquity only needs an additional 10% to ensure system safety.

Users are incentivized to lock LUSD in the “stability pool” in return for earning a share of new LQTY tokens, as well as the opportunity to capitalize on ETH being sold to them at a discount when liquidations occur. The APR for this will vary depending on the current price of LQTY, but tends to fall around 30-45%.

*Ok so they have two tokens? Why?*

That 0.5% fee I mentioned earlier? If you stake your LQTY tokens, you’ll receive a pro-rata share of that in the form of LUSD. When the protocol launched, APRs were nearly *1,000%*. While that’s unsustainable in the long term, as demand for new loans goes up, you can expect APRs that will likely exceed most other opportunities in DeFi. You can check the trailing 7d APR, as well as a plethora of other cool statistics about the system [here](https://duneanalytics.com/dani/Liquity).

*Is this safe?*

Great question! You might be wondering if the smart contracts themselves have been audited There are possible economic conditions where unexpected losses of funds can occur

Luckily Liquity is well buttoned-up in this regard, and you can find the audits and economic simulations in their [docs](https://docs.liquity.org/documentation/resources). I actually found the economic simulations and math behind them fascinating, and I’d encourage you to take a look. Their deployed contracts are immutable, so there’s no danger of code getting switched up on you.

*Ok but I’ve never heard of these guys before. Why should I trust them with my hard earned ETH*

You might feel more comfortable reading up on the founders and seeing that investors include Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, and well-known personalities such as Meltem Demirors and David Hoffman throughout their seed round and series A. [Take a look here](https://www.liquity.org/team)

*So how do I actually use it?*

This one is interesting. The team has opted to forgo making their own “front-end” in favor of providing the kit to do so and letting various front-ends spring up. In this way, Liquity remains even more decentralized and removes points of failure if one front-end were to go down. This decision also incentives a level of marketing at the front-end level without the team having to spend any resources on it. The “kickback rate” determines how much the end user receives from depositing to the stability pool on a specific front end. A 100% kickback rate means you’ll get all the rewards. You can find a list of front-ends on their website [here](https://www.liquity.org/frontend)

Though most front-ends look relatively similar, the one that has stood out and that I will recommend is definitely Liquity Land frontend.  
Website: [liquityland.com](https://liquityland.com/)

They have the best UI so far, with some fancy added functionalities (Liquidation price, debt in front of me etc).

If a front-end were to go down, you can use any other one. Note that if you want to change your kickback rate when switching to a new front-end, you’ll have to re-stake (unstake all funds from frontend A, and stake on frontend B).

The Liquity team has a wealth of information on their YouTube channel, including a more in-depth [explanation of how it’s different than MakerDAO](https://youtu.be/bXLTE-5BkhA). Their Docs are a good place to start for digging deep and the team is incredibly responsive on their discord. You can find a link to that on [their website](https://www.liquity.org/).

Disclosure: I’ve been using Liquity since last week and am currently holding and staking LQTY."

Nonetheless, my mind struggles with some of the working mechanisms of MakerDAO and, especially the governance voting. **The fact that voting power is proportional to the MKR holdings goes against my intuition of decentralization.** I understand that more involved people are probably more knowledgeable about the technology and possess bigger bags. However, this creates a barrier for newcomers to educate themselves about Maker and participate in votings. Moreover, the more people possess MKR the higher their voting power and the higher the centralization. In theory, big banks could buy loads of MKR to have an important influence on decisions? 

In my ideology, decentralization is a way where everyone has the same power to influence governance and where money is out of the question. What are your thoughts?"

We’re looking for a full-time remote (US preferred) operations guru who loves to create playbooks, grow a community, and wear many hats. This person needs to be confident in external facing roles and a great communicator.

## Who we are

Our team has deep crypto-native roots, working at some of the leading consumer teams in web3 like CryptoKitties and the most well-known governance ecosystems like MakerDAO. We’re combining the best of both worlds of web3 with a focus on getting mainstream users down the crypto rabbit hole ? ?️

**Market opportunity** \- cryptonetworks struggle to find the right token holders who want to grow the network instead of speculating, often willing to spend hundreds of dollars per user for millions of dollars without being able to grow the community.

**Product opportunity** \- RabbitHole is making it easy for users to discover new networks, participate, and earn tokens. RabbitHole tracks your activity on-chain to measure your progress and find the right task for you.

## About You

**You have deep experience in crypto.** RabbitHole’s mission is to help the best crypto companies succeed by serving as the best place to discover crypto projects and help them find their early users. This requires a high degree of crypto expertise, knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each network. You’ll get exposed to early stage projects and work with crypto founders directly.

**You get stuff done.** You’ll have (often ambiguous) responsibilities ranging from product to operations. You should be taking it upon yourself to always be learning and find new things to work on.

**You’re entrepreneurial.** This role is autonomous - you’re really excited about proposing and testing ideas based on issues and opportunities you see.

**You’re a proven operator.** You have 2+ years of experience in a technology company, consulting firm, investment bank, or other high-performing company.

**You’re analytical.** You’re fascinated by data and enjoy structuring complex and ambiguous problems. You’re a whiz at Google Sheets and (ideally) have experience using SQL and business intelligence software.

**You deal well with pressure.** RabbitHole’s customers work hard to build their communities, and we partner with them in their most important moments of growth. You thrive under high pressure situations like this and enjoy keeping others calm, on task and on track.

**You’re a great communicator.** This is a highly external facing role. You will be communicating with all different types of stakeholders, from projects, to users, and more. You like to communicate complex ideas very simply.

**You ship.** You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. People know they can count on you to get things done.

## What the job entails

**Make the best teams in crypto successful.** RabbitHole has helped companies like Aave, Matcha, and Gnosis grow their user base by crafting incentive opportunities for users. You’ll work closely with companies like these to support them during campaigns and leverage internal resources to make sure they’re successful.

**Improve internal decision making.** You will analyze large amounts of data and make actionable product recommendations based on it, building dashboards and helping people across the company leverage our data.

**Grow the RabbitHole community.** You will run experiments and create content to support campaigns that educates users and drives new user growth into the RabbitHole ecosystem.

**Scale our operations.** You will design amazing processes, building playbooks to help us systematically run campaigns, and balance that against a steady stream of ad-hoc operations requests and interesting problems that need solving.

**Be a founder.** As an early part of our core team, you will take it upon yourself to identify opportunities for RabbitHole, get buy-in internally, and execute. RabbitHole is an incredibly entrepreneurial environment and we want people who will take advantage of this.

* **Utility Tokens:**

Take for example Filecoin which is used to purchase storage space on a network. The fact that it might be used to purchase services or redeem rewards makes it a utility token.

* **Security Tokens:**

They resemble traditional stocks but instead are in digital forms. Security tokens give back to its owners’ equity, or dividend payout and they are attractive because of their speculation of price appreciation. Just like stocks, these kind of tokens is offered to the public through initial coin offerings (ICO), instead of initial public offerings (IPO).

* **Stablecoins:**

Cryptocurrency trading is characterized by volatility since its launch. Stablecoins, as their name suggests aim to reduce this volatility and be more stable by pegging their value to precious metals, fiats or other cryptocurrencies. Social media behemoth Facebook’s Diem is the [most famous example](https://www.investopedia.com/facebook-fb-hopes-to-launch-digital-currency-in-2021-5090528) of a stablecoin backed by the dollar. Other examples of stablecoins are USDC and MakerDAO.

* **Mining coins:**

Mining-based altcoins are mined into existence which is using a Proof of Work method where the system generates new coins by solving difficult problems to create blocks. Zcash, Monero, and Litecoin are examples of mining coins. There is also the pre-mined alternative just like Ripple XRP, that is produced through an algorithm but are distributed before they are listed in cryptocurrency markets."
A Guide to Stablecoins: Staying Green When the Charts Are Red,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nbvr8z/a_guide_to_stablecoins_staying_green_when_the/,HanditoSupreme,1,2021-05-14 08:22:27,38,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nbvr8z/a_guide_to_stablecoins_staying_green_when_the/,FINANCE,"I say quick because I could go on for awhile, I find stablecoins to be tremendously interesting. Here I will attempt to summarize what stablecoins are, give you a few key stablecoins to consider, and list some helpful resources which will probably give you better information than a rando like myself. 

**What are stablecoins?**

*Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their market value to some external reference.* Coins like USDC, DAI, Paxos Standard, and USDT (Tether) all attempt to peg their value to the US Dollar. The 4 above examples typically do so fairly effectively, so many in the crypto realm consider these coins or tokens to be a less risky investment. Crypto Banks even offer much higher interest on stablecoins because they are less risky and can be used in lieu of dollars. This means that a portfolio invested in stablecoins is less volatile than a portfolio without. Depending on the percentage of that portfolio of course.  

Okay so stablecoins won't go down with the market, but what are the risks and cons? All stablecoins are *minted* on another platform, primarily Ethereum (other examples include XLM, TRX, and BSC). This means that if the platform's network is compromised in someway, your stablecoins are likely to be susceptible if not compromised. However, this risk applies to any token minted on the above platforms (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, BAT). For the gamblers and Yolobois, you might also consider that stablecoins also do not go *up* with the market either. However, we are assuming intentions of investment, not a casino with this post.

**What are some Stablecoins to Consider?**

**USDC:** *USD Coin (USDC) is a digital stablecoin that is pegged to the United States dollar and runs on the Ethereum, Stellar, Algorand, and Solana blockchains. Each USDC is backed by a dollar held in reserve, and USDC reserves are regularly attested by Grant Thornton, LLP.* That's right, each USDC is backed by an actual paper dollar held in a bank.

**DAI**: *Dai (or DAI) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency which aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, MKR, who may vote on changes to certain parameters in its smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.* This means that the value of DAI is given by an actual pool of Ethereum that is shifted in and out of the pool according to Ethereum price and investor demand. 

**Paxos Standard**: *Paxos Standard Token (PAX) is a regulated ERC-20 stablecoin, which maintains 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar. It was issued by the Paxos Trust Company on September 14, 2018, and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).* For those in New York, this is the safest option to consider.

**USDT**: Last but not least, the most popular of them all with its first mover advantage, but the sketchiest and most risky of them all. *Tether is called a stablecoin because it was originally designed to always be worth $1.00, maintaining $1.00 in reserves for each tether issued.[7] Nevertheless, Tether Limited states that owners of tethers have no contractual right, other legal claims, or guarantee that tethers will be redeemed or exchanged for dollars.[4] On 30 April 2019 Tether Limited's lawyer claimed that each tether was backed by only $0.74 in cash and cash equivalents.* Tether was the first stablecoin to enter the market, and with first mover advantage it is paired with many other cryptocurrencies on many exchanges. This makes USDT quite useful if you trust that the value is worth 1 US Dollar. Whenever handling tether however, be aware that it is unlikely the token is *actually* backed by an entire dollar's worth of assets. On one hand, if we all treat USDT like a dollar, its worth a dollar. On the other, government agencies domestic and abroad might be weary of this token. 

There are also stablecoins pegged to other currencies, like the Euro, British Pound, and even the Turkish Lira! I find all of these to be interesting and I'd like to see more options enter the market. However, since the global financial system tends to run on USD, the crypto market follows suit and you will find these easier to move about as things currently stand.

**Stabelecoin Resources**

[Straight from the Ethereum Website](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/).

[Coindesk writeup on Stablecoins](https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-stablecoins).

[As I mentioned earlier, stablecoins tend to yield much higher yields in crpto banks. One might consider this a less risky way to stack some green, or to earn green even during a bear market. This is the best guide I've seen on bank considerations, and I've searched around.](https://prohashing.com/guides/earning-interest-on-cryptocurrencies)

I hope this was helpful to some, regular cryptos like Bitcoin and Litecoin are still fine and awesome! But stablecoins are something to seriously consider for any investor in this crazy world where things can change with a tweet."
"CoinEx Institution: Research Report on XAYA, A Blockchain Game Platform",https://www.reddit.com/r/XAYA/comments/nc3sxj/coinex_institution_research_report_on_xaya_a/,CoinEx_Institution,1,2021-05-14 16:40:25,0,/r/XAYA/comments/nc3sxj/coinex_institution_research_report_on_xaya_a/,,"**I.** **Project Background**

XAYA is an open-source project maintained by Autonomous Worlds Ltd. The history of XAYA can be traced back to 2011 when its core team members participated in the Namecoin project who later became the voluntary leader of the project in 2013. Then the team built Huntercoin, the world's first blockchain game. Released in February 2014 as an experimental 1-year project, Huntercoin was met with great enthusiasm and is still running today.

The founder of XAYA launched the Chimaera project (the word *Chimaera* comes from Greek mythology) in October 2016, renamed it ""XAYA"" in early 2018. The XAYA blockchain was launched in the second quarter of 2018 along with its first MVP game, which was *Treat Fighter* by Tricky Fast Studios; in June 2020, it announced it had been included in Ubisoft's start-up program.

XAYA’s vision is to fundamentally change how people perceive video games and how they play games. They see the blockchain as a transformational technology where games transcend the virtual and take on a life of their own in the real world.

https://preview.redd.it/2vv3j465s1z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7fa22ad382252557af352176c68d59563c5d8a6

&amp;#x200B;

**II.** **Project Introduction**

With XAYA, games can be open sourced, and run normally around the clock without a server. Users can mine in games, and innovate with the help of new economy and game types.

Soccer Manager Elite and Taurion, two of XAYA’s games, were among the 28 blockchain games to keep an eye on in 2020.

Soccer Manager Elite (SM Elite) is a remake of the classic battle-proven MMO soccer game, “SM Worlds”, which uses blockchain technology to bring players a sense of reality, ownership and complete control. You can choose a game mode from many options in the game, be it a manager, broker, club owner, stock trader, speculator or any combination of the above, and compete with thousands of players.

SM Elite is purely community driven, with true asset ownership and built to last forever. Soccer Manager coin (SMC), the currency of this game, is priced at CHI. Users can purchase SMC through CHI or earn SMC through games.

https://preview.redd.it/2aadyd6ss1z61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61ea73fa9c489f3ae66868fe9a8663bdcbd8b868

Taurion is developed on the Xaya blockchain network. Inspired by the classic science fiction novel *Dune* series, this game brings players a similar feeling. Players can choose from different factions, and each faction has its own advantages and disadvantages and game features. Players can forge their own path on this planet of deserts, and obtain resources through battles, team formation, and adventure.

https://preview.redd.it/g6d5tt6us1z61.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee9d5d559f0f36020154aeb889315a9304029a25

For developers, the ultimate benefits of these players can make the game more attractive. By providing a new and better gaming experience, developers can accelerate business development using the best features provided by XAYA.

&amp;#x200B;

A treasure hunt game, similar to a tank treasure hunt, was released in August 2020. More than 20 blockchain projects provided tokens as rewards for winners of the competition. The biggest sponsor was MakerDAO who had provided 2,500 DAI. According to XAYA, 3,000 users signed up, and eventually more than 600 participated in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**V. Latest Progress**

In 2021, XAYA issued Wrapped CHI (WCHI), a token based on Ethereum.

WCHI can be circulated in Ethereum or traded in markets such as Uniswap. The listing of tokens provides Ethereum with more types of tokens. Users can also hold WCHI in the Ethereum wallet through MetaMask, instead of the XAYA wallet. It is reported that Wrapped CHI will be listed successively on XAYA, Ethereum and other platforms.

I just had a horrible experience today with ether I went to invest in a promising  project that has a token listed on UniSwap, **4 hours** ago I had no wallet, or ether, and no clue how to achieve this investment, so I researched wallets and Ether doesn't have an official wallet, sigh, now I have to research all the third party options because I don't trust them, 1 h later I find one that resonates with an OG Dev like me **Coinami (**which listed the sha256-hash for its dl link) and gave me a mnemonic on acc creation, AND has never been hacked since 2014.

Next step how the hell do I add an erc-20 token? 1h later I figure it out get Metamask set up etc. now time to load some ether on MM, buy eth on my exchange withdraw Wait what? 17$ to withdraw ether to MM ok w/e I'm playing with profits anyway, boom sent 50$ got 33$ on MM I'm thinking that should be enough for gas, so time to send some USDT so I can Uniswap, 40$ WITHDRAWL FEE damn this is getting expensive, but I'm rdy to Uniswap, I go in add the asset click swap and.... APPROVE USDC for 15.47$ hmmm alright I'm in too deep at this point I have to see this through, I'm down to 17.53 in gas when I click the SWAP button with my fingers crossed, INSUFFICIANT ETHER PESEANT! Back to the exchange I go pay another 17$ to withdraw 50$ in ether and I'm up to 50.53$ on the MM this is it I'm home free, click SWAP and 40$ to make this transaction!?!? Jesus this is strong armed robbery, in total I paid 114$ to buy an ERC-20... Timestamp: 12:37pm UTC 15/05/2021 

Lets hypothetically do this in Algorand, .01 x2 from the exchange to algosigner, .01 to approve USDCa, .01 to swap, for a total of .04 which is .06 cents! To make a fairer comparison lets say Algorand is as popular as Ether by marketcap and the token cost is 43.2$ this trade would cost 1.70$

How do we get Algorand to 43.20$ you ask? 

AlgoSwap &gt; UniSwap

We need a quality DEX/AMM that can swap ASA's/Algo/Stablecoins/etc

Some random thoughts about some random alts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ne6z3u/some_random_thoughts_about_some_random_alts/,ethereumflow,1,2021-05-17 12:47:05,50,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ne6z3u/some_random_thoughts_about_some_random_alts/,LEGACY,"I'm an interoperability maximalist that believes in a multi-chain local network future, I don't think it will be a one chain rule them all world. I have always taken a research based approach and have dug into the depths of crypto to find projects I think are cool. This is sort of a brain dump of some different projects that I like and some explanation as to why. 

None of this is meant as shilling, I am simply sharing what I think is cool. Some of these I hold, some I don't. Don't buy my bags, always do your own research. 

**ATOM**: What people don't realize about it is what's to come. Once everything is going with the GravityDEX, Osmosis, liquid staking and Ethermint then ATOM will be a strong competitor. As the centre of the Interchain Finance vision Cosmos Hub will be a key player in the internet of blockchains connecting all of these networks together. I shill this one here plenty so I won't get too into it. 

**SCRT**: This isn't the only privacy mention I will have. I believe in privacy to be a fundamental human right and financial privacy is misunderstood. Secret Network offer a unique solution of programmable privacy. Rather than being a privacy coin SCRT is a platform for privacy applications. Everything on the SCRT main chain is transparent, addresses are public and validators as well. SCRT is not much different than ATOM in the simplest of terms but the applications of Secret Network are what sets it apart. All data in Secret contracts is encrypted. Encrypted inputs, outputs and state. This is how SecretSwap is able to be the first anti-front running DEX in crypto. Transactions are fully private, the explorer only shows that your address interacted with a smart contract. No values, no send or receive details whatsoever. As part of the Cosmos ecosystem SCRT will support IBC eventually but I feel like I should mention that SNIP20 tokens will not be. IBC won't be able to read secret contracts. 

**BEAM**: If I am honest I don't think Monero is scalable enough to be a long term privacy solution, the road to correct that is a long one. SCRT, while I think is fantastic, does not have the same ""money"" characteristics as MimbleWimble chains do, they serve different purposes. While I like the philosophy of GRIN more BEAM is years ahead in terms of development and far more user friendly. If GRIN suddenly had a multi-million dollar dev fund and committed teams able to contribute then it would be a different story. Until then BEAM is one of the most interesting and innovative platforms I have used. MimbleWimble is such a fascinating protocol, one might say magical, and BEAM have done a great job maximizing the tech. It's a centralized approach like ZEC but BEAM is on the road to decentralization and the BEAM company will progress to the BEAM foundation with more open governance. Using BEAM goes to show the value of having funded devs on the project though. 

MimbleWimble is pretty complicated because there are no addresses, no wallets so to speak and with BEAM they have added Dandelion(this ""fluffs"" the transaction to multiple nodes), zero-knowledge proofs and LelantusMW. Another thing with MimbleWimble is that transactions require interactions from both sender and reciever(annoying right?). This means that the receiver needs to be online when the sender sends, to make this easier BEAM have added a Secure Bulletin Board System(SBBS) which allows for the transaction to be signed by the other wallet within 12 hours. Again, this only requires the wallet being online and no other functions so if the wallet is a full node then it will be received immediately. BEAM transactions are fast and private and fun to do. You can even perform offline transactions to make it even more badass. 

**DGB**: DigiByte was an early interest of mine. It's as decentralized as any network could be and has no leading figure or team. There is the DigiByte Foundation which is a non-profit group of volunteers that are passionate about the future of DigiByte. The longest, fastest, most decentralized and most secure UTXO proof of work blockchain, DGB is underrated and undervalued in my opinion. DigiByte supports Digi-assets(essnetially NFTs) and has a working Digi-ID blockchain based login system. Antum ID have adopted it for a small scale project.

 DigiByte is not a privacy coin, though Coingecko class it as one, but they have one cool privacy feature added, Dandelion++. You may remember this one from BEAM, same idea but DigiByte adopted the same concept as GRIN and Monero. Dandelion protocol is kind of direct metaphor to what happens. There is a stem phase of the transaction when it is sent, then it goes into the fluff phase when the transaction is broken up into bits and sent to various nodes(this is slightly slower as a result). Unlike Monero ring signatures this isn't meant to hide the transaction but is rather to obfuscate the sender's IP address. 

The DigiByte community is also great. I have been a member of it for a while and keep up to date with it. I've even contributed to their guides for Ren Bridge as a tester and writer. The cool thing about it is that's how DigiByte happened, people volunteering their time to contribute to the network. I've learned a lot from Josiah as far as community focus growth and decentralization as a core value. 

**REN**: Since I just mentioned renDGB this is a good transition. I don't hold any REN, I like RenVM but didn't plan to run a dark node, which is the only use case for the token. I was an early adopter and tester of Ren Bridge and credit Ren for being the reason I became an interoperability maximalist. Using Ren Bridge taught me the value in cross chain value exchange and liquidity transfers. Largely a learning experience I used Ren Bridge to research the best privacy approach to Ethereum DeFi, renZEC used to be the best privacy solution (until renZEC which is public) for exchanging into and out of Ethereum and then Secret Network came along. I still think renZEC has a cool use case for Ethereum but it would now be better off bridged to Secret Network to stay private. 

Fun fact about Ren, the team behind it helped build wBTC. The knowledge they gained working on wBTC is why we now have renBTC, a decentralized and permissionless version of wBTC. wBTC Cafe uses Ren Bridge and Curve finance through a smart contract to permissionlessly wrap BTC onto Ethereum for wBTC. Ren Bridge transactions were the first really cool smart contracts I got to see and understand and that's what got me so into it. Such a complicated operation was made so simple. The team behind the project are brilliant and also very open to conversation and helpful to users of the platform. Similar to what I mentioned about BEAM, REN have a progressive decentralization plan. They wanted to build  working product and be able to help users along the way in a sort of live testnet. Everything is still considered a sort of live beta right now, not just RenVM, and it will become more decentralized as it grows. There are already over 1300 REN dark nodes. 

**NEAR**: Sharded proof of stake blockchain with Ethereum token and smart contract support, a joke in the community is ""ETH 2.0 is NEAR"". NEAR protocol is a really interesting project, they are also on a progressive decentralization plan and are now in the decentralized phase of it. They launched first as a proof of authority mainnet and have transitioned to their proof of stake mainnet now. The focus for NEAR is on usability for both developers and users of the platform. NEAR wallet has usernames instead of confusing addresses(after a 1-time setup) so that it's easier to send/receive tokens. The platform is fast and simple to use, NEAR is a sleeping giant in my very biased opinion. A lot of their use case seems to be growing in the NFT space as they have Mintbase launching very soon and Paras is live. DeFi will be an obvious addition and Ref Finance is the current community built option for the brave willing to test out a sharded DEX on NEAR. 

What I like most about NEAR is the usability. The story goes that they showed up at an Ethereum hack-a-thon and spent most of the time setting up their tooling. Multiple members of the NEAR team are competition winning developers that worked at places like Google and MemSQL so they figured that the issue was in dev tooling rather than dev skills. They set out to create the dev tools needed and did so with their own more scalable and more usable blockchain. The NEAR devs also led whiteboard sessions on YouTube which featured other devs from various projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and Solana, sharing ideas, thoughts and code. NEAR has taken a collection of ideas from these whiteboard sessions and hacked them together into what is one of the most high performance blockchains out there. 

*NEAR is also certified carbon neutral. This is important to me.*

**ZIL**: The other sharded chain, actually the first one, Zilliqa has taken their own approach to the scaling problem. Zilliqa, like Ethereum, has a custom programming language, Scilla. It is based on oCaml so may be familiar to some but is not popular. They say it is a secure programming language and I believe the, because the devs behind Zilliqa are smart. Dr. Xinshu Dong was a privacy and security programmer securing web browsers prior to and Amrit Kumar was an XMR contributor before knowing what Bitcoin was. Their combined knowledge with many other academics from the University of Singapore tell me that the brain power behind Zilliqa is strong. 

ZIL is fast, low fee and eco-friendly thanks to Zilliqa's hybrid proof of work-Byzantine fault tolerant model. Only require minutes of mining per day ZIL is able to achieve consensus through a staking mechanism. I think Byzantine fault tolerance is fascinating as it's important for Cosmos chains and illiqa are using a different approach from Cosmos there and also have a different sharding technique than NEAR. 

An interesting connection for Zilliqa comes through ZilSwap, which is powered by Switcheo. Switcheo is built with the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint which means ZilSwap will be able to support Cosmos IBC eventually, when they decide it's worth adding. ZilSwap will also be bridged to Ethereum and Binance meaning they are building a role as an cross chain DEX. 

**ANT**: Aragon is a DAO of DAOs and when it comes to decentralization Aragon is as raw to the core as it gets. Aragon is totally open source and management of the project is up to the community. AragonDAO powers plenty of projects like AAVE, 1hive, Decentraland and many more. AragonDAO is even the treasury custodian for Agave, a 1hive project built on xDAI. Agave almost deserves its own mention and you should DYOR on that one because it’s pretty sweet, pun intended. 

I’m big on governance and have learned a lot about concepts and ideas from Aragon. Luis Cuende is an inspiration and the ethos behind the project can motivate anyone to make a change. Aragon is a manifesto driven organization. The community involved are all motivated by the same vision for a better, more decentralized world. 

**ONT**: Ontology is often viewed as a NEO airdrop that went nowhere, that couldn’t be more wrong. Ontology went through a mainnet upgrade in 2020 which changed their staking system and network entirely. It’s a new and improved platform with some cool innovations. Ont-ID is a key feature of theirs along with their decentralized credit score system. Li Jun, co-founder, often talks about Ontology in relation to data. DEX is a DDX to him, a decentralized data exchange. He also refers to Ontology as a decentralized trust network. There are different levels of decentralization and Ontology are targeting more enterprise adoption and have tailored their network accordingly. 

Wing Finance is built on Ontology and is the only DeFi option on the network. Wing utilizes the credit score system built by Ontology for a credit score based lending platform, a pretty exciting innovation in the space. 

ONTO wallet might be the best thing about Ontology. Full support for ETH/ERC20 tokens and access to dapps like Uniswap, SushiSwap, AAVE, MakerDAO, Curve, KyberSwap, CREAM and more. Ontology automatically connects the wallet to dapps for use. Ontology solved mobile DeFi with ONTO wallet.


This became longer than I intended. I like talking about alts and have a lot to say about them. Feel free to comment, what do you like about these? What projects do you like that I didn’t mention and why? Feel free to have a discussion."

This is my first post, Hello World! 

I'm a newb from America and was DYOR and started thinking...

No matter what race, nationality, sexual orientation, or life choices, we all come together in crypto!

I mean think about it.

Some of the most opposite of people, for example, in my country both citizens, Republicans and Democrats, come together to drive the price (up and down), innovation and adoption of so many projects, I.E. Doge, Bitcoin, 'Shits and Giggles' etc.

Absolute, dyed in the wool, racist will invest their same fiat dollars in projects, that people they claim they despise, also invested their same fiat dollars! 

Hoping for the same outcome!

Anyways

So this DeFi stuff I keep bumping into...

If I got this right, are you telling me that these DApps, these 'Smart Contracts' 'DAOS' are actually 'Institutions Represented As Code (IRAC)'? 

Compound, AAVE, UNISwap, PancakeSwap, MakerDAO, Etc are actually digital representation of the current financial institutions?

Again I'm very new at this and trying to wrap my head around whats going on.

I've been lurking here for a few months and benefited greatly from the community as a whole and look forward to much wow!"

I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/aq55sf/how_a_liquidation_works/) and bullet point 10 says:

**If however the Dai obtained from the PETH auction is not enough to pay down my CDP, PETH will be sold off from the PETH pool for Dai.**

I assume the PETH that's sold off are other people's collateral? Doesn't this have a lot of downstream negative effects? For example, if someone gets liquidated in the PETH-DAI pool and their PETH is not enough to pay back the debt, then someone else's PETH is sold to pay off the DAI, but that could cause someone else to be liquidated and so on."

Is it similar to how Bitcoin's supply works? Can it even be mined?

Is it eventually determined that there won't be any more MAKERDAO to be mined in the future? Or does the supply increase at some points during the year?

Like what is expected of MAKERDAO's supply in a year or more? 

Also if anyone has a link that can describe how the supply works / what is expected of the supply in the future that would be great too!"

Several people have questioned the trustworthiness of the Kovan Testnet. For the following reasons, I believe Kovan is trustworthy, so I will appreciate any evidence to the contrary:

1. Kovan has been 100% dependable since it was created in March 2017.
2. There have been no reports to indicate that Kovan is not trustworthy.
3. Kovan uses Proof of Authority, which requires **a consensus of Authorities** to create blocks. According to the following article, ""This makes PoA based blockchains very popular amongst the market leaders, such as DNVGL, Walmart, GE Aviation for supply chain use-cases."": [https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/proof-of-authority/3577](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/proof-of-authority/3577)
4. Kovan's blocks are validated by Authorities that include Etherscan, MakerDao, and Parity Technologies.
5. A single malicious Authority cannot irreversibly alter the Kovan blockchain.
6. Kovan's blocks are mined every 4 seconds. Therefore, it would be very easy to identify a malicious Authority, as their block's timestamp would not be exactly 4 seconds after the previous block."

Dai (or DAI) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency which aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2017 Dai successfully kept close to one US dollar during its first year of existence.

Here’s the kicker!
Dai is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO (https://makerdao.com/en). 

MakerDAO ORIGINAL SAI WHITEPAPER
https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/sai/#overview-of-the-dai-stablecoin-system

In September 2018, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invested $15 million in MakerDAO by purchasing 6% of all MKR tokens. 

Who is Andreessen Horowitz? Andreessen Horowitz (also called a16z, legal name AH Capital Management, LLC) is a private American venture capital firm, founded in 2009.

In 2013, Andreessen Horowitz invested in Ripple, Clinkle, Coinbase, Databricks, Lyft, Oculus VR, PagerDuty, Pixlee, Soylent, Swiftype and uBiome.

In 2011, Andreessen Horowitz invested $80 million in Twitter, becoming the first venture firm that held stock in all four of the highest-valued, privately held social media companies at the time: Facebook, Groupon, Twitter, and Zynga. Andreessen Horowitz has also invested in Airbnb, Lytro, Jawbone, Belly, Foursquare, Stripe and other high-tech companies.

Specifically, network growth can be attributed by MATIC’s recent partnerships between SushiSwap, Decentraland, MakerDAO, Zebi, and Hey Coral.

Although ETH has had a bad two weeks, this is clear evidence that loss of MATIC/Polygon value has lead to an oversold token which is ripe for strong gains. The current rise in the MATIC/Polygon transaction rate is inversely correlated with the recent price of ETH. As such, as ETH begins to rise from its current dip, new all time highs can be anticipated based on the expectation of even further network activity.

How DeFi lending can restructure older financial systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm1xhw/how_defi_lending_can_restructure_older_financial/,pepperonimilkjuice5,1,2021-05-27 15:20:48,0,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm1xhw/how_defi_lending_can_restructure_older_financial/,FINANCE,"Cryptocurrencies have opened new doors for finance and lending. Since the inception of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, we have seen innovations of all kinds – from stablecoins to full-blown decentralized finance projects. While stablecoins brought stability to highly volatile cryptos, DeFi introduced new ways to generate income. One such popular method is lending.

&amp;#x200B;

The onset of the pandemic has made people look for an investment option. DeFi lending presented the preposition of making money on crypto holdings without the traditional goalkeepers of loans. Instead of banks or other central entities, people could now choose a decentralized platform to borrow or lend loans. It resulted in the explosion of this new form of lending, with over $29 billion locked in different DeFi lending platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

In this article, we explore some of these lending protocols and find out how they work:

&amp;#x200B;

\##MakerDAO

&amp;#x200B;

Developed by Rune Christensen in 2018, MakerDAO is an organization building technology for lending and a stablecoin on the Ethereum network. It allows users with cryptos to lend themselves capital in a stablecoin called DAI. The platform is the top lending protocol on DeFi pulse, with over $10.11 billion of assets locked.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How It Works\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone can lock up cryptos in a smart contract to create a certain amount of DAI. These DAIs can then later be converted into fiat or exchanged for any other crypto asset. The more locked-up crypto, the more DAI one can take as a loan. To unlock the locked digital assets, users need to pay back their DAI loan along with MakerDAO’s fees.

&amp;#x200B;

As most cryptocurrencies are volatile, when the price of a locked-up asset drops below a specific range, MakerDAO‘s protocol immediately sells off the collateral to pay back the borrowed DAI plus penalties and fees. This threat of liquidation keeps the project stable and ensures no one exploits the system. Whereas, when the price of a locked-up asset increases, users will get extra DAI.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to DAI stablecoin, MakerDAO uses MKR tokens to govern its system and support the stability of DAI. DAI is created when someone takes out a loan, and MKR is created or burned depending on how close DAI is to its peg of $1. If DAI is stable, the protocol burns MKR to decrease the total supply. When DAI goes below the $1 peg, more MKR is issued, increasing the supply and maintaining stability of MakerDao’s lending protocol. In terms of utility, MKR holders can vote on the governance decisions of MakerDAO. Also, they get incentives for acting in the best interest of the protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

\##Compound

&amp;#x200B;

Invented by a former economist Robert Lishner, Compound has been leading lending protocol in the DeFi space. It enables borrowers to take out loans by collateralizing their cryptos and allows lenders to provide loans by locking up their digital assets. Compound may look like it works like other lending protocols, although it differentiates itself by tokenizing the assets locked in its system via cTokens.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How It Works\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Similar to MakerDAO, Compound also uses crypto as collateral to lend out money. However, instead of DAI or some other token, Compound issues ERC-20 cTokens (or Compound Tokens) that represent users’ funds locked up in its protocol. In simpler terms, when users deposit any crypto as collateral, they will get an equivalent amount of cTokens. For example, for putting up ETH, users will get cETH.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, users can deposit their cryptos to earn interest. For example, for depositing ETH to generate interest on Compound, users receive cETH. Each asset locked up in the protocol has its value, and the amount of demand and supply of the underlying asset determines the interest rates to be received and paid by lenders and borrowers. Another unique factor of Compound is that all cTokens generated in exchange for cryptos become freely usable, movable, and tradeable in other DeFi applications.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to earning interest on crypto assets, users can also borrow other cryptos on Compound by depositing collateral in return for “Borrowing Power”. The more the “Borrowing Power”, the more cryptos one can borrow. Compound avoids liquidation of locked-up assets by working on the concept of over-collateralization. It means borrowers must supply more value than they wish to borrow.

&amp;#x200B;

\##TruFi

&amp;#x200B;

To bring about the next era of borrowing and lending in DeFi, TrustToken has launched TrueFi – a credit protocol for collateral-free lending. The TrueFi protocol adds something new to on-chain lending: crypto-native credit scores informed by on-chain and off-chain data, as well as the wisdom of the crowd of TRU token holders. It’s unique approach has originated over $105 million in loans, with no defaults, since November 2020. As of writing, the Total Value Locked in TrueFi is close to $100 million.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How It Works\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike other lending protocols, TruFi doesn’t require approved borrowers to deposit collateral to loan funds. Loans are drawn from lending pools funded by depositors of stablecoins like TUSD, USDC and soon USDT, on which depositors earn a competitive rate of return but also accept some risk in case of default. To borrow, applicants submit data on their business and crypto history, resulting in a credit score that sets the terms on the borrowers’ TrueFi loans – and eventually, may inform loans on other DeFi platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

Borrowers who fail to return the money within the allotted time will face legal actions pursuant to an enforceable loan agreement signed during the onboarding process, and a hit to their credit score.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first version of TrueFi, loans were given based on borrower proposals voted by TRU stakers. However, in the newly launched TrueFi V3, the platform relies on a credit model informed by several factors, including repayment history, company background, operating and trading history, assets under management, and credit metrics. Moreover, with this V3 launch, TrueFi brings multi-asset support in the unsecured lending space, soon to support almost any asset on Ethereum for lending and borrowing.

&amp;#x200B;

\##Final Words

&amp;#x200B;

The growth of DeFi lending in recent years is proof that this trend has the potential to reshape the entire financial system. However, just like any technology, it also comes with unpleasant attributes. What if a third-party smart contract in a lending protocol is faulty? There is also the risk of borrowing APY rising dramatically within a short period.

&amp;#x200B;

While the entire lending process is simple on the above-listed protocols, users should be cautious and ensure they operate on a secure platform.

&amp;#x200B;

i've been a part of this community for quite some time now and as we grow bigger and bigger I see people falling into the same mistakes EVERY TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

so if you are reading this I assume you already know what DeFi is and how it works, you probably heard of MakerDAO, Aave and Cake.

&amp;#x200B;

and you probably heard of this ""new token"" that is the ""next big thing"" and that yields you 100000% APY and you assume, HOLY COW! I found gold!

&amp;#x200B;

you do all the necessary safety checks and it all checks out, they have a reputable team, they are doxxed, they are audited, so you decide: I'm going to go all in in this!

&amp;#x200B;

and you put a fair amount of cash in their house token, say 1k dollars, in 1 day you realize you have earned 100 dollars! this is it, the cash is literally in your account, you just earned 10% in 24h, so you do the logical thing and you invest way more

&amp;#x200B;

the next day you see that the value of the token has dropped a little and you think ""oh the market is sideways its nothing to worry about, it'll come back"" and the next day it drops even more.

&amp;#x200B;

when you see its been 10 days, you have earned 300 dollars and your original 1000 are now 400 dollars. so you literally lost money.

&amp;#x200B;

""how did this happen?"" you pounder to yourself, but the answer is quite simple and its called the ""inflation problem"".

&amp;#x200B;

remember those guys in the news talking about this inflation thing that you never really understood? yeah well, inflation happens when the supply of something rises more then the demand for such thing making its value go down.

&amp;#x200B;

in DeFi, when you are staking the house token and earning the same token, you are literally making new tokens that were not in circulation before, if the token has a high demand that is not an issue as people are willing to pay for that, but the thing is that with time the demand decreases and the sell power increases, causing inflation and losing value.

&amp;#x200B;

so DON'T get all excited to see some crazy numbers, they might not be a scam but they may lose value very quickly."
Borrowing using Crypto as Collateral: My Experiences and Findings,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/nrcvna/borrowing_using_crypto_as_collateral_my/,zucchini_fries,1,2021-06-03 20:57:33,30,/r/defi/comments/nrcvna/borrowing_using_crypto_as_collateral_my/,,"As tax day in the U.S (5/17) quickly crept up on me, I found myself in a predicament: I was crypto rich but cash poor and did not have enough dollars to pay my taxes. This led me to doing research on how to borrow using crypto as collateral for I was trying to avoid selling crypto to pay taxes, which in turn would trigger more taxes.  Here are my findings below:

Since crypto is an extremely volatile asset and there is no yet established credit system in the crypto lending space, meaning crypto-backed loans are all over-collateralized. Most cases, the Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) ranges from 20%-50%. LTV = Loan Amount/Collateral Value. So to borrow 10k with a loan with LTV value at 50%, you would need to put up 20k in crypto value as collateral. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BlockFi**: Custodial crypto company which offers services including trading, borrowing and earning interest on crypto deposits. 

Loan: 10k minimum loan, acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETC, LTC, and PAXG, only allows monthly payments for interest (monthly payments are much lower but you will owe entire principal at the end), collateral must maintain 70% of value or will require more collateral 

Rates:

LTV: 20%, Interest Rate: 4.50% (Only available with BTC)

LTV: 35%; Interest Rate: 7.90% 

LTV: 50%; Interest Rate: 9.75% 

Pros: 

\-Loan direct deposit into bank account

\-No protocol hack risk

Cons: 

\-Limited cryptos accepted as collateral 

\-KYC 

\- Legally binding contract for loan, must adhere to BlockFi’s terms 

&amp;#x200B;

**Salt Lending**: Founded in 2016, Salt was one of the first companies to introduce crypto-backed lending. Salt currently offers institutional-grade crypto custody and blockchain monitoring products as well. 

Loan: 5k minimum, 1m max; acceptable forms of collateral: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, SALT, Paxos, USDC, TrueUSD, PAXG, 3-12 month loan duration, option to pay interest only or principal and interest, ability to redeem SALT tokens to lower interest rates (SALT currently \~30c)

Rates:

LTV: 30%, Interest Rate: 2.95% - 4.95% (2.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 40%, Interest Rate: 5.95% - 7.95% (5.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 10.95% - 12.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

LTV: 60%, Interest Rate: 15.95% - 17.95% (10.95% available if 272.1 SALT is redeemed)

Pros: 

\-more reasonable rates with the SALT redemption 

\-loan direct deposit into bank account

\-no protocol hack risk

Cons:

\-availability varies (really only available in the US. Outside US, Canada, UK and Australia are business only; Brazil, HK, New Zealand, UAE and Switzerland for individuals and business) 

\-KYC

\-must accept Salt’s terms and conditions 

&amp;#x200B;

**Celsius Network**: FinTech platform that offers interest-bearing savings accounts, borrowing, and payments with digital and fiat assets. 

Loan: $500 minimum to borrow stablecoins ($25k minimum for fiat except in NY and TX where min is $500); over 35 acceptable forms of collateral; 6 months to 3 year loan duration; monthly payments on interest only

Rates:

LTV: 25%, Interest Rate: 1.00% (.95% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 33%, Interest Rate: 6.95% (6.60% if you pay with CEL token)

LTV: 50%, Interest Rate: 8.95% (8.50% if you pay with CEL token)

Pros:

\-wider array of collateral accepted 

\-longer loan duration

\-lower min for stablecoin loan

Cons:

\-more KYC than other platforms (Government ID, Address, Tax ID)

\-primarily a phone app (can only borrow via phone app)

&amp;#x200B;

**MakerDAO/Oasis**: Autonomous protocol built on ETH blockchain that allows anyone to open up a smart contract/vault to deposit collateral and generate DAI. 

https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/MakerDAO

Loan: 5,000 DAI minimum (dust limit); wide range of ERC-20 tokens can be used as collateral (including LP tokens), no duration limit (in order to access collateral again, required to deposit DAI) 

Rates: 

Stability fee (interest rate) ranges depending on the token used. Balancer stability fee is 2.00%, AAVE is 3.00%, ETH is 5.00%. Most stability fees are 5.00%. Liquidation Fee is 13.00%. Non-stablecoin minimum collateralization ratio is around 150% (LTV of 66.7%) but that will risk liquidation for even slight down movement. Recommended collateralization ratio is 200%-300% (LTV of 33%-50%) 

Pros:

\-fully decentralized, No KYC, no restrictions 

\-wide range of collateral including some uniswap liquidity token

\-very competitive rates, fully flexible 

Cons: 

\-entirely up to the individual to understand and learn the process

\-if vault falls under liquidation ratio, it will automatically get liquidated so individual must be aware

\-gas fees on ETH network ( much more reasonable now) 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I did not end up borrowing, I am a fan of MakerDAO as an option. Not only are you getting very competitive rates, but also getting more flexibility and are contributing to the shift towards decentralization of finance. At its core, cryptocurrency is about financial freedom and empowerment through decentralization from traditional financial institutions, and MakerDAO encapsulates this. 

Please do not treat this as financial advice, but rather a starting grounds for your own research and DD for the best option for yourself. I hope this gives people a good overview of borrowing using crypto as collateral."
eGold Backed Stable Coins Come To The Elrond Network Via OIN Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/eGLD/comments/nrgh1o/egold_backed_stable_coins_come_to_the_elrond/,AllenOneDC,1,2021-06-03 23:41:22,5,/r/eGLD/comments/nrgh1o/egold_backed_stable_coins_come_to_the_elrond/,Announcement ,"One of the biggest catalysts for the surge of DeFi has been the introduction of stable coins. They are tokens issued on the blockchain whose value is pegged to a fiat currency such as the USD, offering a recognizable denomination for financial transactions and a haven against volatility.

There are many stable coin issuance models, such as backed by bank deposits, managed through an algorithmic function, or collateralized by a cryptocurrency. Out of all the aforementioned models, crypto collateralized stable coins offer the most trust and transparency, thanks to the public nature of the underlying smart contracts and oracles.

In preparation for the Maiar Exchange launch, we are excited to announce that we are working with OIN Finance to issue the first EGLD backed stable coin on the Elrond mainnet!

“The eGold currency has been conceived to be a store of value with powerful utility in the Elrond ecosystem. Its use as collateral for stable coins allows holders to access liquidity and engage in additional DeFi opportunities which will further drive ecosystem growth.” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond Network CEO.

OIN Finance have been a member of the Elrond ecosystem for a while, and in the meantime, they have evolved to offer crypto collateralized stable coin issuance and staking derivatives via OINDAO, as well as a DEX for swapping OINDAO staking derivatives and stablecoins.

Our collaboration will focus on deploying the OINDAO framework on the Elrond Network, to be used in issuing an eGold backed USD-pegged stable coin. In addition, a portion of the OIN token supply will be minted on our mainnet in the ESDT format. Both tokens can be used to pursue DeFi opportunities on the Maiar Exchange.

“We are excited to support the growth of the Elrond DeFi landscape through the issuance of a crypto-backed stable coin powered by OINDAO. Its store of value tokenomics make eGold a great asset for collateralization by long term supporters looking to leverage their holdings in the DeFi ecosystem.” said Amo Huang, OIN Finance Tech Lead.

The collaboration is important for the Elrond ecosystem because it brings an eGold-backed stable coin into our DeFi landscape, which will allow more flexibility for eGold holders looking to engage with the Maiar Exchange and other products that will be deployed on our mainnet.

About Elrond

Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

About OIN FINANCE

OIN is a decentralized stablecoin issuance and trading platform. While MakerDao allows only mainstream assets to be used as collateral to issue DAI, OINDAO allows projects, large or small, to issue their own brand labelled synthetic assets that are collateralized by their own coins; in essence, any projects can mint their own stablecoins to participate in the greater DeFi ecosystem. Having commenced with Ethereum, and gradually expanding to other popular ecosystems such as Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain and most recently Elrond, OIN’s aim is to become a one-stop shop for cross-chain stablecoin issuance, trading, and implementation.

I got banned from cardano,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrvne4/i_got_banned_from_cardano/,wanderingcryptowolf,1,2021-06-04 11:36:28,182,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrvne4/i_got_banned_from_cardano/,TRADING,"Here is what would need to change about Cardano for me to become comfortable with it as an investment, in no particular order:

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about the limitations of Cardano's EUTxO model.

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to questions I've been asking about Cardano's fee model under full L1 load

&gt; * Me getting straight, understandable answers to why native tokens are functionally superior to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. Everything I have read about it is either hand-wavey, or talks about how it's hard and error-prone for developers to copy-paste the ERC-20 templates (bs), or talks about how Cardano's token transfers don't cost any more than its native transfers (which doesn't matter if ALL types of transfers are very cheap.)

&gt; * Seeing Cardano adopt a scaling solution with better data availability guarantees than Hydra, which requires all interested parties to be online and active in order to arbitrate, similar to Lightening Network's ""watch towers"". Zk and optimistic rollups are one idea (like Ethereum), on-chain execution sharding is another (like Polkadot), data sharding with some extra transaction ordering guarantees are another (like Solana), a native zero-knowledge L1 is another (like Mina). Cardano is pursuing none of those avenues publicly, instead sticking with their outdated 2015 state channel tech.

&gt; * Significant amounts of liquidity migrating to Cardano. Whales who are liquidity farming on Ethereum just don't have an incentive to fragment their liquidity by moving to Cardano. It's a chicken and egg. I'll keep my eyes open for some clever tokenomics solution, but I don't have my fingers crossed.

&gt; * Significant amounts of *grassroots* projects migrating to Cardano. It doesn't matter how *many* projects, the only thing that matters is the big players. When Uniswap, MakerDAO, or Compound - or other companies that similarly command billions of dollars of volume and TVL - migrate to Cardano, I'll start taking a second look.

&gt; * IOHK starting to be more forthcoming about the limitations of their technology. As I mentioned before, the always-online requirement of Hydra. The concentration of stake into multiple pools owned by the same owner (e.g. dozens of binance pools). The compromises an AMM DEX has to make to run under the EUTxO model. Being straightforward that the ""ERC-20 Converter"" does NOT do any ""conversion"" whatsoever, it's a BRIDGE, and rename it ""ERC-20 Bridge"" so that it's clear it is the same thing that a bunch of other chains have.

&gt; * Smart money starting to take Cardano seriously. ADA had its big day in the sun when it entered the top 10 in 2017, but it's still nowhere on the radar of institutions, silicon valley, or VC-backed startups compared to Ethereum. Cardano is designed for and marketed to retail investors, not institutions or developers, and the lack of real institutional interest compared to Ethereum shows this very clearly.

&gt; * A Web3/Metamask-like way to interact with smart contracts through web interfaces via a browser extension and mobile app. This is critical for users to be able to use smart contracts, otherwise Cardano is going to go through some miserable days like Ethereum went through in 2016-2017, when you had to manually invoke functions on smart contracts through MyEtherWallet to get anything done. Huge pain in the ass.

&gt; * Being more honest about comparing either Cardano's *present* to Ethereum's *present*, or Cardano's *future* to Ethereum's *future*. A lot of the time, Cardano's future gets compared to Ethereum's present, and that's really unfair to Ethereum. Cardano's future 1M tx/sec gets compared to Ethereum's current 15 tx/sec instead of its future 100k tx/sec with sharding and rollups. Cardano's future multi-language smart contract support gets compared to Ethereum's current Solidity-only support (which isn't even true, since Ethereum supports Vyper too.) Cardano's future gain in market share is compared to Ethereum's current market share, not the bigger and bigger market share it's likely to pick up over the next few years, etc.

&gt; * Being more honest about how Ethereum's lack of on-chain governance is a deliberate choice based on Vitalik's viewpoints, and how Cardano's on-chain governance is a divergence from those viewpoints to create a blockchain that has a different philosophy. Right now it's touted as a ""straight upgrade"" rather than a difference in philosophy. It also doesn't exist yet, tying into the previous point.

&gt; * In general, having better technical resources. I still haven't seen an easy, straightforward tutorial for how to set up a Plutus dev environment and publish a ""Hello World"" contract to the Alonzo testnet. Compare that to Ethereum where there's about a million tutorials on how to test and publish a smart contract on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo Wii and your microwave oven.

&gt; * Either Cardano's technology catching up to justify its ridiculously large market cap, or the market cap lowering to meet the current state of its tech. There are other chains like Solana that have working products with a lot more technically impressive innovations than Cardano but are worth 1/10th of what ADA is right now. ADA is by far the most frothy crypto in the top 5. Even though it's not launched yet, all of its potential future growth is already priced in for some reason. There really isn't a lot more room for Cardano to run, because its run has already been *massive*.

&gt; These are a few of the things that would need to change in order for me to admit I am wrong about Cardano being a good investment looking towards the future. Right now, way too many of my questions are going unanswered about it. Unanswered on IOHK's website, unanswered in the Cardano Devs subreddit, and unanswered by any blog article or other resource I've been able to find on Google.

&gt; Because so many of my questions have gone unanswered for so long, at some point I am forced to assume that good answers simply don't exist. Otherwise someone, somewhere, would have written *something* that would have been picked up by Google, or someone around here would know something about and be able to point me in the right direction to get them answered.

Obligatory ""would like to get ethfinance's thoughts on this"".

Does anyone know how using collateral to take out a loan work e.g. minting of DAI based on ur collateral ether in makerDaO,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinAUS/comments/ntc2sd/does_anyone_know_how_using_collateral_to_take_out/,Neophyte-,1,2021-06-06 11:02:08,5,/r/BitcoinAUS/comments/ntc2sd/does_anyone_know_how_using_collateral_to_take_out/,,"simple example: you have 100k of eth, say you use that to mint 30k of DAI with a stability fee of 4.5% (interest rate). this is just a loan on your collateral. much like if you used an asset as collateral to take out a loan e.g. a mortgage. 

in the regular financial world the new money coming into your account isnt taxed as its understood its just a loan to buy xyz.

Does the ATO treat the minting of DAI the same way? on block explorers the ato can check that the DAI comes from makerDaO smart contracts so its easy to determine if the DAI you have is generated from your colalteral vs just receiving it as a deposit.

id hazzard to guess the ATO is pretty behind this, they probably just mark it as a 0 cost basis asset, so when you dispose of it, u are taxed on 100% of the value e.g. use your dai to buy eth.
this would really suck if true because you can do more with DAI then just use it to take out a loan for leverage, you can mint DAI at a 4.5% interest rate then loan it out on a defi protocol at a higher rate to earn income.

i had an idea to mint DAI using the uniswap LP token when i add liquidity for the USDC/DAI pair. the dai minted i think is 1for 1, so you only need a 100% collateral ratio. so for example i use 100k worht of usdc/dai 50/50 split to add to the liquidity pool in uniswap. i get the LP token and mint 100k of dai at a 1% stability fee/interest rate. 

the benefit of this is that you get 3% in fees roughly a year on uniswap, then you loan  out hte DAI on defi or even on a centralised exchange. you can get &gt; 5% easy for your DAI reliably. 

so in net it looks like this as a return % per year:

5%(loaned dai youve minted) + 3%(uniswap fees) - 1%(stability fee)  = 7% 

you need to subtract gas ccosts of course so this isnt worth it with small amounts. 

Ideally you just pay tax on the income. a 7% interest rate is pretty good as a conservative low bound.

of course this isnt risk free, smart contract bugs can lead to theft etc."

Your bank pays you a quarter percent. But some cryptos will pay you 6% or even way more for locking in funds for the “true-believers” in any particular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. If you’re not afraid of watching your token’s value fall 20% or more, then DeFi yield is your next crypto investment.  

Yield paying DeFi cryptos are one of the main reasons why cryptocurrency investors have been diversifying from Bitcoin to the alt-coin universe, led by Ethereum. But for the past year, at least, it’s also been about Algorand, which I own, because it pays 6% yield. It’s not as safe as the Global X Super Dividend (DIV) ETF, which I also own. But Algorand and other tokens are – for investors – another way to capture yield in a diversified, crypto way.

Many of these DeFi protocols (think of them as fintech startups, in layman’s terms) are for investors that have a deep knowledge of cryptocurrency, the platforms they are operating on, and can lose most of their investment without losing sleep.

In short, there are many ways DeFi projects pay their investors yield, not just through [‘yield farming’.](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-yield-farming-beginners-guide) 

**A Quick Overview and Three Picks**

DeFi is financial services running on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. DeFi tokens earn interest, allow you to borrow, lend, buy insurance, or simply trade as a speculative crypto investment.  

“Yield farming” is a reward scheme that’s taken hold in the DeFi crypto world over the last year. If you want to compare it to traditional investing, it’s like yield on a bond, or a dividend. It is arguably one of the main reasons investors who are not using Algorand, buy Algorand, among others.

Like a traditional dividend paying stock or bond, yield on DeFi tokens fluctuates depending on how these projects and exchanges roll them out. Anyone with a Coinbase account can easily discover which coins pay yield. It’s how I found Algorand.

“The focus of investors should be on the fundamentals of the project, not just the yield it pays,” says Eric Nguyen, CEO of Spores Research, and a former senior investment analyst of Elliott Management, a hedge fund with over $35 billion in assets under management. “If it is decided to hold certain project’s tokens over the long run, then exploring yield-paying systems is an option. But, deciding on coin investment purely based on the yield offered will be problematic since there are also downsides to take into account. One main issue is that annual percentage yield might be high but the staking period available is low – for example you can reach 200% APY in 15 days, assuming it’s compounded daily. In actuality your coin balance will only increase maybe 4.6% in those 15 days,” he says. 

Like traditional dividend payments, if the price per coin goes up, then the yield paid on your crypto gives you new coins and now you have more coins that are worth more money.

But DeFi yield, for traditional Wall Street investors, is a little more like C rated junk bonds. High risk, high reward, if you get the timing right and the underlying instrument is sound and serious about paying what it promises.

“DeFi is trying to imitate traditional financial service providers with a decentralized twist,” says Gil Shpirman, CEO of Don-Key.Finance. In April, Don-Key completed a private funding round to bootstrap it’s Defi social yield farming platform to the tune of [$2.2 million captured from some of the new blockchain funds ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/13/social-yield-farming-platform-don-key-locks-2-million-from-cryptos-top-players/)like Black Edge Capital in Chicago, Genesis Block Ventures in the Caymans, MoonWhale of Bangkok, and Dubai’s Morningstar Ventures, to name a few.

Just as a bank takes a deposit from a customer and pays him 1% interest and then loans that same amount out to another customer and charges 5% in interest, a decentralized protocol will do the same thing but with a “smart contract” in the middle to reduce cost and increase efficiency. Investors are paid in “rewards”, which is like yield and – depending on the project. 

“Some good examples are MakerDao, Aave and Curve,” Shpirman says.

The Maker Protocol is one of the largest decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain, and was the first DeFi application to earn significant adoption. Their DAI coin is a stable coin that basically trades in line with the dollar and pays around 2% yield. It’s one of the biggest stable coins and yield paying coins out there with a market cap of more than $4 billion.

Aave, another DeFi protocol I have been looking at to buy, defines itself as a non-custodial liquidity protocol designed for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets in crypto. If you owned DAI and you deposited it in the Aave application, you could earn 1.57% APY. Aave pay yield for collateral, but not for farming.

Curve Finance is not for beginners. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralized protocols exchange stable coins and capture some yield that way.

“You are providing your capital and getting a return on them, but this is not without risks as some of the smaller DeFi projects have suffered exploits in the past,” says Nguyen, meaning “hacks”. 

“You should pick coins where you understand the fundamentals and believe in their long-term value because the yield might not be able to cover the decrease in their value,” Nguyen says.

As this market becomes more sophisticated, and an extension of traditional Wall Street, investors who ultimately want to allocate more of their portfolio to crypto are going to need to do one of three things:

**1)**     Wing it with the main coins – Bitcoin and Ethereum, or Grayscale ETFs that hold them, should you not want to be bothered opening an account on an exchange (you should do it, anyway)

**2)**     Risk it with the DeFi coins you read about from trusted investors and other sources or;

**3)**    Go find a specialist cryptocurrency firm, open an account with them, and let them do the work. 

**Don’t Fear the Reaper**

The recent volatility in crypto, with Bitcoin struggling to get back over $40,000 and losing around $375 billion in market cap over the last three weeks, is unlikely to kill interest in DeFi investing, says Antoni Trenchev, Co-Managing Partner at Nexo, a regulated financial institution for digital assets with $4 billion under assets based in London. 

“There are so many legitimate (DeFi yield) projects out there, but I think the future belongs to those that are compliant, well-capitalized, and scalable businesses with functional products and highly professional teams,” says Trenchev, who thinks Nexo is one of them. They give their investor clients tax-efficient instant cryptocurrency credit lines, a high-yield on both crypto and fiat, send and pay capabilities, high-level crypto trading, custodial insurance and a crypto wallet called the Nexo Wallet. 

Despite some saying that a new “crypto winter” is starting, DeFi protocols built on Ethereum, for instance, produced all-time high revenues in May, according to data [compiled by The Block. ](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106858/defi-protocols-ethereum-may-revenue?utm_source=coinbase&amp;utm_medium=rss)

The total locked value of liquidity pools in yield farming DeFi projects stood at $7,977,544,158 as of this weekend.

More sophisticated trades use DeFi marketplaces like Venus to lend their coins like a bank, and receive interest, or “rewards” in the Venus coin, XVS. That coin price is up nearly 10-fold since January. Some of the higher yielding lending pools are for those lending in Polkadot (DOT). It pays around 10%.

Pancake Swap is another one for sophisticated traders. Some of the trades on Pancake Swap are like 10x leveraged bets in a traditional market. I’d avoid.

For this reason, I’m sticking with Algorand and watch my rewards pile up in my Algorand wallet. 

“If there’s one takeaway from the recent episode of market volatility, it is the reinforcement of the view that in crypto, you have to take the long-term view because, on the one-, five-, ten-year scale, it tends to outperform just about any asset,” says Trenchev. Their NEXO coin is up over 1,100% in the last 12 months.

“The space has survived and thrived because of and in spite of price declines of 30% and more, and a few times per year,” he says. “Cryptocurrencies remain the only free market left nowadays and show that an asset — such as Bitcoin — cannot be the best performer and also not be volatile. Volatility is an essential feature of high asset performance.”

The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021.

According to DeFi Pulse, the total value of funds locked in DeFi applications has grown from $300 million in early 2019 to several billion in 2021. For the longest time MakerDAO was almost the only serious player on the DeFi market. However, the lending sector sees new projects offering new solutions pop up on a regular basis. 

Credefi is the world's most advanced crypto P2P lending platform, that combines the best practices of DeFi and traditional finance. Our hybrid mechanism solves real life problems and inefficiencies of the conventional banking and finance sector, and provides unique opportunities for both borrowers and lenders. Credefi allows platform participants to invest in credit portfolios, individual credits, or do trade finance, directly through their personal wallet. Those who deposit their funds to the wallet act as liquidity providers, and earn yield on their capital, which is similar to having a bank deposit, except the rate is much better! In addition to this, Credefi is actively working on security mechanisms to ensure maximum reliability for both lenders and borrowers.

INTRODUCTION,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_juicefinance/comments/nw80kv/introduction/,juicefinance,1,2021-06-10 06:21:31,0,/r/u_juicefinance/comments/nw80kv/introduction/,,"

The Juice Finance is designed to enable a complete algorithmic money market protocol on Binance Smart Chain. The protocol designs are architected and forked based on Binance Smart Chain and synced into the Juice Finance platform giving the benefits of both systems into one.

**Problems**

The evolution of decentralized finance has created a diverse financial ecosystem built directly on blockchains, which are transparent/verifiable through cryptography and pre-defined coding known as smart contracts. These platforms are redefining the structure of money markets without the need for a central authority or third-party decision-makers. In today’s traditional world, users will need to provide creditworthiness, provable income, and other factors for a lender to make a decision even when the user provides collaterals such as homes or cars.

Traditional lenders do not enable digital assets and cryptocurrencies to be pledged and used to receive loans or earn interest rates for providing them to the lenders and banks.

 

Juice is not the first protocol to help bridge these gaps between traditional financial lending into decentralized protocols on top of blockchains. There have been protocols that achieved this with billions in assets locked into the protocols. However, these protocols are primarily built on Ethereum, which has become costly, slow, and has caused pain points in user experience. These protocols also lack higher market cap assets such as XRP and Litecoin.

The current protocols are also heavily centralized such as Compound, where stakeholders and private equity funds seem to be able to control most of the decision-making and do not have a variety of other control mechanisms. Their distribution plan does not equate to decentralization.

Also, over $1 billion in Ether\[3\] are locked up in MakerDao Contracts that earn no value but come at a cost to those minting assets.

Lastly, in today’s landscape, a user who wants to use their assets to mint stablecoins must remove it from a money market protocol and lock it up in a smart contract with no benefit of the underlying asset as collateral.

**Solution**

Creating a protocol that enables a traditional money market tied into synthetic stablecoin generation will lead to accessibility and benefit of locked collateral. Juice will enable anyone to utilize a high-speed and low transaction cost blockchain by leveraging Binance Smart Chain \[4\] to supply collateral, earn interest on that collateral, borrow against that collateral, and mint BEP20 stable coins on-demand within seconds. These solutions all happen directly on the blockchain and may be utilized using a GUI. This protocol unlocks billions of dollars in value that are currently on-chains that have no lending markets such as Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin, and more while enabling the participant to access liquidity in real-time."

Tether is a cryptocurrency which is defined as a stable coin. It is pegged to the US dollar and is the most widely used stable coin currently available on exchanges. It directly competes with Dai from MakerDao and USDC from Coinbase. However, recently, use of Tether has come into question due to its lack of 1:1 backing by the US dollar. 

Stable coins provide liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by diminishing volatility. Because of this, stable coins are eligible for high yield interest rates up to 12% backed by over collateralization from online banking companies like Nexo, BlockFi, Kraken, Celsius, Etc. 

**Tracking the Tether Premium:**

Stable coins like USDT are *supposed* to be equally valued and completely interchangeable with the US dollar.

A website has been setup to track the so-called “Tether Premium,” the increased price on exchanges when buying in USDT vs USDC. The website is: 

[http://www.untether.space/](http://www.untether.space/) 

The Untether site automatically tracks major cryptocurrency exchanges and details the average price of Bitcoin on each type of platform: exchanges using USDT as their base currency, and exchanges using the US dollar.

**What is Tether Made of?**

In February 2021, 24-hour trading volume using Tether was about $107 billion. Its wide adoption has occurred with both retail investors and cryptocurrency exchange/institutional investors.

In May 2021, Tether published a chart of the composition of its holdings, showing the majority of its assets to be in cash and cash equivalents, the bulk of which is commercial paper. 

[Tether Reserves as of March 2021](https://preview.redd.it/taig3jio0n471.png?width=717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5a6e107f30818dbeecce6a2f27fa4c82e8ca08)

A JPMorgan rates derivatives strategist Josh Younger noted that, if considered among prime money market funds, Tether would be in the top 10. He noted: 

*“Whether the allocation of the Tether reserve is representative of other, smaller stablecoins is unknown. A key question is why they would choose to rely more heavily on commercial paper, which brings with it more logistical and relative value considerations around credit and maturity than comparatively simpler bank deposits. There are three reasons in particular to believe Tether has and will continue to face difficulty accessing the domestic banking system—particularly at the scale required to absorb a meaningful fraction of their already sizeable reserve funds.* ***First****, their holdings are likely offshore, and not necessarily in the Bahamas.* ***Second****,* [*recent guidance*](https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf) *from the OCC authorizes domestic banks under their supervision to accept deposits from stablecoin issuers only if those tokens are fully reserved (among other requirements), which Tether has admitted to misrepresenting and violating in their* [*recent settlement*](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf) *with the NYAG Office.* ***Finally****, these admissions as well as other concerns will likely raise reputational risk concerns among larger domestic banks that can accommodate a material fraction of those reserve assets.*

*This may seem an extended discussion for what essentially amounts to a modest segment of the commercial paper market. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that this market has the potential to grow significantly.”*

Lastly, a warning from Younger at JP Morgan: “Were any issues to arise that could affect the willingness or ability of both domestic and foreign investors to use Tether, the most likely result would be a severe liquidity shock to the broader cryptocurrency market which could be amplified by its disproportionate impact on high-frequency-trading-style market makers which dominate the flow,”

**Why is MKR a better Tether Alternatives?**

The Maker Protocol, also known as the Multi-Collateral Dai system, allows users to generate Dai by leveraging collateral assets approved by “Maker Governance.” 

Maker Governance is the community organized and operated process of managing the various aspects of the Maker Protocol. Dai is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar and built upon the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is resistant to hyperinflation due to its low volatility. 

Currently, Defi income and DEX volume is at a year low. Levels are equivalent to Sept 2020 with significant undervaluing of all 3 major lending protocols, including COMPOUND, AAVE and MKR. Of these three, only MKR is deflationary.

[DEX Volume is the lowest since 2020](https://preview.redd.it/20wztywj0n471.png?width=2401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79df2aa5ae368f2b4797ff48fc65d7e2b8bea494)

**How does DAI remain stable?**

Currently, there is more demand for DAI than there is supply. This causes upward supply pressure and defeats the point of having a stable coin pegged to the US dollar. Maker solved this problem by introducing the Peg Stability Module (PSM). 

The PSM is a module which allows people to trade USDC to DAI, and vice versa, 1 to 1, minus a .1% fee when depositing USDC.

As the price of DAI increases to more than $1.001, it causes an arbitrage opportunity. Where you could deposit USDC to create DAI and sell it back on the open market for a profit. This increases the DAI supply and stabilizes the price.

It also works in reverse, if at some point in the future, there is too much supply or not enough demand, then there will be downward pressure on the price of DAI. Since there are no fees to withdraw USDC, then anytime the price of DAI falls below $1, it also creates an arbitrage opportunity where you could trade your DAI back to USDC and profit. This decreases the DAI supply and stabilizes the price as well.

The PSM basically allows people to profit should the price of DAI stray too far from the $1 peg. Essentially, because there is money to be made, greed allows the DAI to remain stable. 

**How is MKR Deflationary?**

MKR tokens are burned whenever supply exceeds 

Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) holders accrue interest on the outstanding DAI loans they have taken out. This interest fee can range from 0.5 to 11.5%. Interest which is accrued goes to purchasing MAKR off the secondary market. On the secondary market, those that value their MKR the least are the ones that get their MKR purchased by the protocol’s Perpetual Auction.

MKR tokens which are purchased on the secondary market are burned to diminish supply and increase value. 

In May 2021, 6k MKR were burned. In June 2021, so far, 2.5k have been burned. 

Assuming a VERY conservative burn rate of 4% per month, that’s 48k burned per year, equal to 5% deflation from the 900k total tokens. You can actually follow the rate of burn here:

[**https://makerburn.com/#/**](https://makerburn.com/#/)

**Maker's tokenomics are best explained here:** 

[**https://medium.com/pov-crypto/evaluating-mkr-def6d36092bd**](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/evaluating-mkr-def6d36092bd)

Essentially**,** over time (…LOTS of time), Maker slowly transitions from a buyback model, to a cash-flow model. As MKR holders become fewer and fewer (because the Perpetual Auction keeps buying people out), the few MKR holders left have the privilege to sell their MKR at increasingly higher prices.

**Why is MKR undervalued in regards to Market Cap to TVL ?**

First, we have to understand some fundamentals regarding defi metrics. The total value locked measures the total amount of funds that are locked into a DeFi platform. On a platform that does borrowing and lending, the TVL would represent the amount of funds that users have deposited onto the platform, which other users can then borrow. TVL is also being used as a metric to measure growth. If the TVL of a platform increases it generally means more money is flowing into the platform, which shows it is growing.

Like market caps, the TVL can also be used to represent the total value locked for the entire DeFi space. On [www.defipulse.com](http://www.defipulse.com/), you can view the TVL for the total DeFi space as well as individual platforms.

The market cap to TVL ratio measures the ratio of the market cap to the amount of funds locked on the platform. It can be easily found on [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/). Since the TVL can be a guide for how well the platform is doing it can be compared to the market cap to judge whether it is valued correctly. To calculate the market cap to TVL ratio simply divide the market cap by the TVL. Any value less than 1 means that a platform’s TVL is higher than their market cap. MKR has a ratio of less than 1. Specifically, their TVL is higher than their market cap with a super low ratio of .35 as of 6/11/21. 

[MKT CPT\/TVL Ratio is .3887!](https://preview.redd.it/dhydvpgfom471.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b42eeb2243a648b07a7b1337459b61c76b53e43)

**Conclusion:**

In May 2021, MKR reached a new ATH of nearly 5.1 billion DAI. It has generated an annual profit of nearly 148 million and is significantly undervalued for a token that has actual income, as well as intrinsic value. Fair value based on market cap, actual yearly income, and only 900k available tokens appears to be about 6k/MKR. At present, at a price of around $3100/token, the TVL/MCAP ratio is just 0.35. 

Furthermore, the 5% deflation rate and the fact that Tether is not fully backed 1:1 with asset protection means that institutions are increasingly using DAI and the Maker Protocol. Since the massive May 2021 liquidation of overleveraged positions, DeFi has fallen to its lowest transaction levels in a year. As such, lending &amp; collateralization protocol DeFi tokens, especially MKR, are grossly undervalued even in today’s already down market. Any dip is a chance to accumulate with a likely 2-3x return in less than 1 year."

Alongside the rise of new cryptocurrencies, a new consideration has emerged: decentralized finance (DeFi) or centralized finance (CeFi)?

https://preview.redd.it/sou5j21lgs471.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e07141f2b099b4c121b2932ae957ddf52d3dd93

 

Before the idea of DeFi came into existence, centralized finance was the standard for trading assets. In a centralized [finance model](https://www.leewayhertz.com/defi-vs-cefi/), “all trade orders are handled through a central exchange. Funds are managed by specific running of the central exchange”. In a cryptocurrencies context, this is equivalent to you not owning the private keys. The exchange makes all of the important decisions: which coins/assets to list, for how much, what are the fees, what are the general trading rules. Centralized exchanges often require KYCs and identity checks, and it is their prerogative to refuse someone a trading account, if they feel it is necessary.

When it comes to decentralized exchanges when trading assets, there is no central authority. The process takes place via automated applications. It aims to create a fair, transparent, open-source, and permissionless system, especially interesting for those parts of the world where people have limited access to financial services.

This decentralized financial system offers many services, including borrowing, yield farming, crypto lending, asset storage and more.

“The [benefit of ](https://www.leewayhertz.com/defi-vs-cefi/)using DeFi over CeFi is that you have full control over your assets and own the key pair for your wallet. Moreover, users who want to participate in DeFi need to use decentralized applications (dApps) built on the blockchain platforms to access DeFi services”, said Akash Takyar, CEO of LeewayHertz and expert in the area.

## How is DeFi different from CeFi?

The main issue here is the technology vs.people dilemma. With DeFi, users trust the technology. On the other hand, with CeFi, users must trust the people that run a given exchange.

Both DeFi and CeFi deliver a wide range of financial services, including cryptocurrency-related options. Let’s discuss some of the features and functionalities of both the ecosystems that differentiate them from each other.

## Features of CeFi

Some of the most popular centralized exchanges are Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc. Users can transfer and exchange funds, but also lend, borrow, or even margin trade.

One must remember that due to their established nature, these platforms will require users to share intimate and confidential information about themselves. Data breaches can occur, Kraken was a target of a cyber attack in the past.

“One of the [advantages](https://medium.com/@blockchain_simplified/centralized-finance-cefi-vs-decentralized-finance-defi-the-battlefield-of-cryptocurrencies-bd5250f55cf2) of Centralized Finance over Decentralized Finance is that they support cross chain exchange for multiple cryptocurrencies, although these cryptos are generated on individual blockchains, thus displaying interoperability of cryptocurrencies. CeFi exchanges also enable the conversion of fiat currency to cryptocurrency and vice-versa in an easy and seamless manner”, was mentioned by long-running magazine Blockchain Simplified.

## Features of DeFi

As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is hosted on a Blockchain platform like Ethereum, smart contracts are designed to automatically execute transactions when a particular condition is fulfilled. Since smart contracts are automatic, users can be fully assured that transactions will never fail and will be properly executed. Users do not require any permission to join a Decentralized Finance exchange since it is permissionless, which is not the case in Centralized Finance platforms.

Thus, DeFI is the leader when it comes to the protection of users’ personal data. Users are the sole owners of the data.

Some of the main examples of decentralized exchanges include: Kyber, Totle, MakerDAO.

## Quick Innovation

DeFi platforms are open-source and subject to a quick rate of innovation. One example can be that in functionalities that centralized financial services are best at, DeFi space has worked tirelessly to deliver alternative solutions. For instance, to overcome “the DeFi’s [inability](https://www.leewayhertz.com/defi-vs-cefi/) to facilitate the transfer of incompatible cryptocurrencies such as BTC, solutions like tBTC and WBTC, that are compatible with decentralized protocols eliminate the gap by behaving as tokens pegged to the value of BTC”.

## Remittance Market Solution

DeFi will have an immensely positive impact on the remittances market; the market where millions of dollars are sent across the borders by workers that are working in foreign countries.

With DeFi, it will be [possible](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history) to “cut the cost associated with sending money by 50% and more”.

## Rise to Popularity

Even though Blockchain is more than a decade old, there was not much mainstream popularity of DeFi until 2019. DeFi requires the Internet for connectivity, and before that time, a lot of people were still unable to access it. Thus, it is likely that now, with the advances in technology,DeFi will become more mainstream by 2025.

“The Internet is [growing rapidly](https://101blockchains.com/decentralized-finance-defi/) and is becoming more affordable than ever. India has also seen tremendous growth when it comes to mobiles and internet connectivity”.

## CeFi vs DeFi: Real Use Cases

Some of the most prominents crypto use cases of CeFi includes:

**Coinbase** *—* A cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates trading, borrowing, margin trading, native stablecoin, lending, payments and more.

**Fairlay** *—* It is a Bitcoin Prediction Market and Exchange that runs on the CeFi model.

**BlockFi** *—* A cryptocurrency and fiat borrowing and lending platform.

**Celsius** *—* A cryptocurrency borrowing, payments and lending platform.

**Ledn** *—* An insured Bitcoin to DAI borrowing and lending platform.

**Libra** *—* A global financial infrastructure and cryptocurrency layer.

## On the other hand, real use cases of DeFi are starting to pick up quickly, such as:

**Totle** *—* An aggregator of decentralized liquidity with automatic price optimization.

**Augur** *—* A decentralized predictions market.

**Nexus Mutual** *—* A decentralized insurance tool.

**Kyber** *—* A decentralized exchange.

## What’s best for trading crypto: CeFi or DeFi?

Both centralized finance and decentralized finance aim to achieve the same objective — to make crypto trading popular and increase the trading volume, however, through different means.

Both systems have their benefits and drawbacks. It depends on the individual investor, on what they value more. If their main goal is to maintain their privacy, DeFi is the way. If safety, sharing of risks, increased options to invest, and flexibility are your concerns, [go for ](https://www.youhodler.com/blog/centralized-finance-cefi-vs-decentralized-finance-defi)CeFi.

Cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where you can exchange or trade cryptos based on the market value. It acts as a mediator between the cryptocurrency buyers and sellers.

There are various Cryptocurrency Exchanges in the world, I have discussed the top 3 among them.

CoinMarketCap reported statistics, According to the survey, the top three cryptocurrency exchanges are Binance, Huobi, and OKEX.

**Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange** is one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges that offer to trade in more than 45 virtual coins including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Binance Coin (BNB).it was founded by changing Zhao in 2017, Malta.

**Highlights of Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange**

Binance[ ](https://www.binance.com/en)is growing in a progressive way, it shows always the biggest crypto exchange platform worldwide for trading altcoins.

Binance provides a [crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/AipiChain/comments/nq72wx/stake_aipi_and_get_33_roi_apy_aipix/) wallet for its traders, where they can keep their currencies.

Binance has its own currency, Binance Coin(BnB).

Binance has launched a kava launchpad recently.

It has a leverage of 125x in October 2019, Binance traders have a bright future.

Binance Chain is tradeable on Binance DEX, providing more trading options for DEX users with full custody over their wallets and assets.

**Huobi Cryptocurrency Exchange** is a Singapore-based global cryptocurrency exchange that has services centers in Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong, Seoul, Shenzhen, Singapore, and Tokyo.

It allows the trader to exchange crypto to crypto, including the USDT token.

It was founded by Leon Li in 2013, Singapore.

**Highlights of Huobi Exchange Platform**

Huobi has innovated with newer decentralized and peer-to-peer exchange trading models.

Huobi exchange has updated Huobi pro for his User Protection Fund strictly separate trader digital coin in cold and hot wallet, storing most of the digital assets in a multi-signature cold wallet.

Huobi also offers two things **HADAX** and **OTC**

The HADAX (Huobi Autonomous Digital Asset Exchange) is more for professional traders.

The OTC focuses to move huge quantities of cryptocurrency.

The exchange has an AML and KYC verification mandatory for the user.

In Japan, huobi raised JPY500m (USD4.6m) in a new funding method. because funding was raised by issuing new stocks to the Japanese financial services group (FPG) through private placement.

They support for **MakerDAO** tokens and decentralized apps **(DApps)** in its wallet. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is managed only by smart contracts and code.

The Huobi Token (HT) is now ready for making real-world online purchases of a broad variety of goods from the e-commerce platform FomoHunt.

**The OKex Cryptocurrency Exchange** was born out of branded OKCoin exchange. Where the cryptocurrency traders can buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens. The OKex exchange allows the standard crypto-to-crypto trading as well as fiat to cryptocurrency trading. It was founded in 2017, Malta."

Collateralized loans on Oasis. How to calculate liquidation price and how to understand 'Liquidation ratio'? Please help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/o2mr5n/collateralized_loans_on_oasis_how_to_calculate/,adsorptionspectra,7,2021-06-18 19:18:56,4,/r/MakerDAO/comments/o2mr5n/collateralized_loans_on_oasis_how_to_calculate/,,"I am considering to make a collateralized loan on Oasis but the terminology is confusing me and I want to make sure I understand it completely before doing anything. 

Let's say I will put **1 WBTC** as collateral into vault. Oasis says that I can get up to **25'184 DAI** which is in traditional terms **66%** loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. But it also says that the 'Liquidation ratio' (minimal collateral ratio) is **150%** which is the same as **66% LTV** in traditional terms. Does that mean that if I create **25'184 DAI** and the value of my 1 WBTC drops even a slightest I will be in the liquidation territory?  If this is correct, why does such an option even exist? it is super risky. 

My second question is: Can I generate less DAI as I am offered? Instead of **25'184 DAI** (and making this 66% LTV borrowing) can I instead generate **15'140 DAI** which will be close to 40% LTV ratio which is much safer if the liquidation LTV ratio is 66%?

Is it safe to deal with such high amounts on DAO?

PS: calculating liquidation prices formula on MakerDAO website is strange:  
Source: [https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/vaults/liquidation/)

    To calculate a Liquidation Price, simply use the following formula:
    Liquidation Price = (Generated Dai * Liquidation Ratio) / (Amount of Collateral)

If I plug in the numbers for the above case (for 1 WBTC = 37 776 USD) I get this:

    (25184 DAI * 1.5) / 37776 USD = 1

How is 1 a ""Liquidation price""? I don't get it

Thank you for any help."

Flash Loans are a Democratization Tool,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o504vi/flash_loans_are_a_democratization_tool/,ElBuenMayini,3,2021-06-22 01:12:06,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o504vi/flash_loans_are_a_democratization_tool/,FINANCE,"A sentiment change from the community towards this term is necessary.

Normally when this term comes up over here, the first reaction is an alarmed one: ""this thing, which I don't fully understand, is evil because an unaudited project I recklessly put all my money into was attacked by it!""

Let's make this thing clear: Flash loans are a good thing. 

They allow anyone without capital to take advantage of the many arbitrage opportunities the DeFi ecosystem continously has.

Without flash loan tools, the arbitrage opportunities, and yes, the exploits of some less-quality projects, would only be available to those with enough capital to execute them, giving more capital to the people with excessive capital in the first place.

The latest project to allow flash loans is Maker, with its new [Dai Flash Minting feature](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-flash), which I think is amazing, and there is even a revamped [Wrapped Ethereum contract](https://github.com/WETH10/WETH10), already deployed to main net, which has a built in functionality to do flash loans where you don't have to have the Ether to back the Wrapped Ethereum minted, all of this possible only if you burn the minted currency within the same transaction.

What do you guys think? Let's have a proper discussion about this topic, and finally un-demonize it, once and for all."

Let’s take a moment to avert our gaze, just for a little bit, from the challenging price action and remind ourselves that the overall development plan for the ecosystem is making solid progress and Hawaii 2022 is [definitely a thing](https://hodler.holiday/)! Although perhaps we'll all be too rekt to enjoy it?

In super positive news, the major Ethereum protocol updates - London, Altair and The Merge - are all still on track. London and Altair have additional meat around the bones re: testnet dates. London’s are [now firmed up](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/06/18/london-testnets-announcement/). This week (!) London goes up on Ropsten, with Goerli and Rinkeby to follow each a week apart. **28 July is definitely still in play for the London mainnet date.** Check out 1559 fee burn on the Calaveras devnet [here](http://watchtheburn.com/) and [Cat Herders 1559 pre-launch Q&amp;A](https://youtu.be/AC1FS3LmoT4) with Tim Beiko and the team. For Altair, [solid engineering progress has been made](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/SJoLSp_s_) by the consensus layer client teams, and an early August release date is looking more certain. Altair testnet dates soon to be agreed on 1st July Eth2 Implementers call. 

Not too much news on The Merge this week as all dev team focus is on London and Altair. Variety of date estimates on The Merge right now. Some of the more credible ones:

~ Nethermind - [October 2021](https://twitter.com/nethermindeth/status/1385699335355125766)

~ Prysm - [late 2021](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ethereum-is-about-six-months-away-4b0)

~ Besu - [December](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/)

~ Teku - [Q1 2022](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210522#The-Merge)

~ Vitalik - [early Q1](https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs?t=5691)

Looking beyond The Merge, the Sharding spec [is iteratively improving](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1405711431786434560).

Vitalik also has a proposal out for [state expiry and statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal), to occur over the course of two separate upgrades. These changes will improve scaleability by [reducing the size requirements](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_size_management) for running Ethereum nodes. We’ll need to wait and see if the ideas gain traction (let’s be real, they likely will) over the coming months before assignment to any particular hard forks.

Other things

~ Competition in the ZK-rollups space is heating up with the impending mainnet launches for both zkSync and [Starkware](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-planets-alpha-on-ropsten-e7494929cb95) edging closer (see table below).

~ No update on how close Arbitrum or Optimism are to the same but Arbitrum in particular [are announcing](https://twitter.com/arbitrum) new partner on-boardings at pace right now.

Everybody’s doing fractional co-ownership projects these days, or turning physical art into an NFT, but OMNIA is more than that. OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 
* Focusing on indexing before derivatives
* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
* Liquidity for the middle class


Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022
•  3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)
•  Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)
•  10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 


• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks 

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium

• Cyber security checks later in the month

$OMNIA will have three coins!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded. 

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 
their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi ?! :O,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/o660z3/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-23 13:03:28,2,/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/o660z3/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi_o/,," 

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like [YIELD.IS](http://yield.is/)

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a [whitepaper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/Yield.pdf) (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.

 

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### [Reflex Bond](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### [Notional Finance](https://notional.finance/)

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### [UMA's yUSD](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-yield-dollar-on-uma-3a492e79069f)

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

MEXC Exchange Research：DeFi Aggregator+Middleware Protocol — InstaDApp Project Analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/MXCexchange/comments/o67qtx/mexc_exchange_researchdefi_aggregatormiddleware/,mxc1100,1,2021-06-23 15:12:19,0,/r/MXCexchange/comments/o67qtx/mexc_exchange_researchdefi_aggregatormiddleware/,,"**Instadapp**

Instadapp is a DeFi aggregator that operates primarily on its portal website. The Instadapp protocol (DSL) is the core of the project. It serves as the middleware in DeFi and can aggregate multiple DeFi protocols into an upgradeable smart contract layer.

A DeFi aggregator refers to the platform that aggregates transactions, loans, management, insurance, and other businesses in the DeFi market. It is essentially the front end of a centralized DeFi ecosystem and can significantly reduce the entry threshold for users, especially non-technical users.

The main functions of DSL are account extensions and upgradability. The unique upgradability means that upcoming and new extensions will be upgraded, maintained, and managed by INST governance. The DSL also includes a new operational layer that acts as an “Account Extension”. These extensions allow users to access new and unique features of their DSL accounts. The evolution of these extensions and platforms forms a DeFi Center through which new use cases and extensions can be created. Some examples of possible use cases include flash modules, permission extensions, L2 extensions, and others.

The currently integrated DeFi protocols include Maker, Aave, Compound, and Uniswap. Users can trade in InstaDApp and manage their own LP (Liquidity Pools) in Uniswap, while lending the LP to leverage financing in the platform-supported lending protocols.

InstaDApp connects its products to assets held by users on various DeFi platforms and keeps obtaining the prices in order to display them on the operating interface. Before InstaDApp, users were required to manually write down the prices on each platform to find out the optimal interest rates, loans, and others. At the same time, when the user determined the optimal asset management position, previously a series of complex transactions were needed to transfer assets, and these steps were needed to be completed on each platform. InstaDApp hands over operations such as user transfer of assets to a smart contract designed for automatic execution. Currently, no fees are charged. Users only need to provide the funds to pay for the transfer of assets.

InstaDApp stores all transactions and assets in a contract wallet (DSA) that is fully managed by smart contracts. All data is publicly visible and InstaDApp does not hold any of the user’s assets.

&amp;#x200B;

TVL（Total Volume Locked）$5.2 billion USD, ranked 5th（Data from June 22）

Instadapp has achieved remarkable success in the DeFi field, creating nearly 55,000 Instadapp DSAs; the TVL is currently over $5 billion; InstaDApp is arguably the project with the highest number of flash loans ever developed and wrapped for direct use by users. Over 50% of flash loans in Ethereum are generated through Instadapp.

**Flash Loan**

Flash Loan allows borrowers to borrow without any collateral, which greatly increases the utilization of funds. Flash Loan completes the loan and repayment in a chain transaction without collateral. Compound, Aave, and others all have Flash Loan support. The repayment is subjected to pre-set rules for smart contracts and usually requires a certain handling fee. Because a single transaction in a chain can contain many operations, developers can add other on-chain operations between borrowing and repayment, which gives this kind of borrowing more room for imagination.

For example, the founder of DForce mentioned that with the help of Flash Loan, Uniswap transaction fees were reduced from 0.3% to 0.05%, and the following can be done in a single transaction chain:

1. Use a lending platform to borrow ETH worth $25 million USD

2. Put ETH worth $15 million USD in MakerDAO and borrow DAI worth $10 million USD

3. Provide liquidity to DAI with the $10 million USD DAI to Uniswap (providing DAI liquidity with 82% Commission rebates)

4. In Uniswap, perform any DAI-related trades you want to

5. Repay the original ETH loan

In this way, the fourth step in this trade needs only 0.05% of the handling fee, not 0.3%.

**DeFi Smart Layer (DSL)**

The DeFi Smart Account (DSA) was upgraded to the Open DeFi Smart Layer (DSL) in February this year. The DSL consists of the smart contract account standard (DSA), composable connectors to base DeFi protocols, and an authorization framework that allows extremely modular permissions.

**Smart Account**: An upgradable contract account where assets are stored and DSA can perform composed transactions across connectors.

**Connectors**: Used primarily by developers to develop functionality for smart accounts (DSAs), such as cross-protocol transactions, through standardized modules that interact with various protocols.

**Authority**: Users can use it to set up managers or automation robots to manage their DSAs. Permissions can be modular to the connector level. For example, users can allow specific addresses to rebalance their assets to minimize interest payments or maximize returns.

**DSA’s Functions**

DeFi Smart Account (DSA) is a separate smart Wallet.

Multi-account and sub-permission management: On Instadapp, you can create different wallet accounts and assign different permissions such as trading, voting, multi-signing, lending, and others.

Multi-user permissions work together: supports account management for different DeFi protocols and functions, and introduces a number of identity verification modules to ensure security.

Multi-protocol: currently supports Maker, Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and Polygon asset migration, cross-protocol operations.

**Supported Aggregator Functions**

Collateral lending: Lending assets and borrowing assets.

Collateral swap: Transfer of collateral on different protocols.

Debt swap: Transfer of debt over different protocols.

Auto-refinancing of debt: Automatically transferring collateral from one protocol to another to avoid large liquidation fines. (Currently only in Maker)

**Tokenomics**

**INST（DSL Governance Tokens）**

Total Supply: 100,000,000

Community and Ecosystem Development：55%，55,000,000 (Of these, 15% are used for ecosystem incentives in the 6.16 announcement.)

Current Team Members: 23.7% 23,794,114 (4-year vesting)

Investors: 12.07% 12,078,714 (4-year vesting)

Ecosystem and Future Team Members: 7.85% 7,851,941

Advisors: 1.27% 1,275,231 (4-year vesting)

**INST Incentives (15% of Total Supply)**

**Airdrop:**

On June 16, Instadapp announced the INST Token Airdrop Program, with 10% of its total supply to be used in airdrops to users (about 310,000 users) who hold positions on Maker, Compound, and Aave mainnets through Instadapp and 1% for users (about 50,000 users) who manage Aave positions on Polygon. The number of airdrops is linked to the position size. Users who use Instadapp to manage their positions will double their net value after calculation. Users can receive an airdrop by upgrading their account to DSA V2 on the Instadapp protocol and moving their positions to B2. About 36,000 users are eligible.

**Liquidity Mining (June 16 to September 16)**

After upgrading the account to DSA V2 under the Instadapp protocol, users will be entitled to participate in a three-month liquidity mining process. A total of 3 million INST tokens will be distributed proportionally based on the net value of users’ positions on MakerDAO, Compound, and Aave on the Ethereum mainnet.

**UNI-v3 Staking (June 16 to September 16)**

0.01 ETH/INST\~0.04 ETH/INST, the liquidity pool is eligible for a reward of 250,000 INST.

0.04 ETH/INST\~0.1 ETH/INST, the liquidity pool is eligible for a reward of 750,000 INST.

Since Instadapp is a centralized to decentralized process, there are some parts of governance that need attention. Initially conducted by teams and investors, the project will be decentralized when INST is officially released (launched on June 17) through liquidity mining and developer incentives. On June 17, after the INST governance was online in Ethereum mainnet, all protocol upgrades will be conducted transparently through public discussions in the community and votes by INST holders to achieve decentralized governance.

**Current DAO Governance：**

1. Submitting governance proposals requires 1% of the INST supply, or 1,000,000.

2. 4% INST of the supply is required to reach the quorum, with a minimum of 4,000,000 pieces.

3. A voting period of approximately three days.

4. Timelock delay for about two days on execution.

**Practical Scenario Analysis：**

**​Use cases:**

Participate in DAO Governance

DAO Governance, there may be a fee for some components of the platform (INST as the fee)

Liquidity Mining

Governance, Loans, Voting

**Risks:**

Partial cash out of incentives and airdrops

Partial cash out by team members"

And DeFi is evolving, the whole space is growing, maturing, changing and improving.

The last few days I came up to a project that promises to be the Gateway to DeFi for altcoins.

Basically, FinanceOIN claims they will allow every altcoin, big or small, to use the OINDAO to issue their custom-branded stablecoins and have their own staking pools.

Elrond, Matic, Dash, Avalanche, Paid Network, Harmony and Near Protocol all announced recently that they will be using OINDAO to launch their custom stablecoins, coins that will be backed by their own assets, for instance an Elrond stable-coin backed by eGLD."

Today, I came across AAVE Flash Loans and one of its use cases i.e. Arbitrages between two or more DEXs. I found it interesting and researched further by going through official guide, Youtube tutorials and few web articles. I was wondering if it's still profitable in terms of finding arbitrage opportunities and making trades. I was seeking guidance and help in terms of tools that can be used for this purpose and insight in your experiences. For example, any scanners to find arbitrage opportunities, automation tools that can swap trade and earn profit and/or any guides that can help me create or program my own Flash Loans. I saw few posts and articles about earning MATIC etc with Flash Loans or using MakerDAO along with AAVE to earn but no proper guide to follow. Thank you.

Your kind support is much appreciated."

Traditional governance systems, such as the ones existing in governments and organisations, are hierarchical and centralised. Because of this structure, most of the power is in the hand of the upper echelons while most users have little to no chance of influencing decision making. This can become an issue when the users are affected by the choices while the people in control are not incentivised to make changes in their favour. Also, decision makers are difficult to audit and are not always held accountable by other parties. This lack of transparency becomes an even greater issue in the context of representative governance. High profile examples of tampering are the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal#Aftermath) and more generally controversies on the [US elections integrity](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud).

Blockchain technology could be deployed to transform governance and community management. This is because a [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp)\-based governance system would be much more difficult to tamper with while also staying transparent and auditable.

&amp;#x200B;

## What went wrong with traditional governance?

* Failure to deliver on what is promised in the electoral campaign
* Information bottleneck
* Lack of transparency and accountability
* Inequality
* Lack of representation
* Barriers to participation

&amp;#x200B;

## Blockchain governance

Governance based on blockchain decentralises the power that is normally held by a small leadership group, allowing users to take more control of the system. This can also help preventing a monopoly of power and influence that can put the users at the mercy of whoever is in control. In a decentralised blockchain governance, there are usually three main parties holding decision-making rights:

* Developers
* Node Operators/Miners/Stakers
* Token holders/Investors

The rights and incentives for each party varies depending on the ecosystem and consensus mechanism involved.

&amp;#x200B;

## How does blockchain governance work without leaders?

Applications built on a decentralised network (dapps) have characteristics that make them ideal in solving the current governance challenges - this is because they are backed by unchangeable [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) ​that control the logic of the dapp independently of individuals or institutions.

Key features of [dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/):

&gt;**Zero downtime** – once the smart contract at the core of an app is deployed and on the blockchain, the network as a whole will always be able to serve clients looking to interact with the contract. Malicious actors therefore cannot launch denial-of-service attacks targeted towards individual dapps.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Privacy** – you don’t need to provide real-world identity to deploy or interact with a dapp.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Resistance to censorship** – no single entity on the network can block users from submitting transactions, deploying dapps, or reading data from the blockchain.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Complete data integrity** – data stored on the blockchain is immutable and indisputable, thanks to cryptographic primitives. Malicious actors cannot forge transactions or other data that has already been made public.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Trustless computation/verifiable behavior** – smart contracts can be analyzed and are guaranteed to execute in predictable ways, without the need to trust a central authority.

&amp;#x200B;

## Blockchain governance strategies

Incentives and coordination - to bring beneficial change to a shared ecosystem, common incentives must be found. All parties involved should have the same ability to coordinate so that a power imbalance is avoided. Off-chain and on-chain governance have their advantages and limitations - regardless of the strategy, please keep in mind that a blockchain project is not guaranteed to be decentralised.

*It's impossible to tell which structure is a better choice without presenting a precise governance context.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Off-Chain governance

This strategy is more similar to existing governance structure - a small, closed group (usually developers or major stakeholders) make and enact proposals.

*examples:*

* Bitcoin BTC - developers issue [Bitcoin improvement proposals](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip) (BIPs) that can be approved or rejected by miners
* Ethereum ETH - funded by the non profit [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) \- anyone in the Ethereum community can issue [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/) (EIPs) which can be enacted by community stakeholders
* [Ripple](https://ripple.com/ripplenet-committee/) (XRP) - very centralised, mostly owned and controlled by large financial institutions, strong B2B focus

*limitations:*

* partnerships with institution/company/foundation - reliance on leadership integrity
* relatively centralised
* lack of innovation incentives

&amp;#x200B;

## On-Chain governance

This strategy deploys the governance system as integral part of the protocol - smart contracts enable users to coordinate proposals and voting.

*examples:*

* [Tezos](https://wiki.tezosagora.org/positionpaper) \- self-amending blockchain, no hard forks, evolves with the community needs
* [EOS](https://eos.io/resources/stake-based-voting-and-rewards-mechanism/) \- staking-based voting rights and rewards
* [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/about/) DOT

*limitations:*

* no rollback and possiblity of hard forks splitting communities (this does not apply to Tezos)
* reliance on users' integrity
* tends towards plutocracy (for example, ATOM requires a minimum pooled amount to make proposals and the votes on proposals are proportional to staked ATOM)

&amp;#x200B;

## Current limitations:

* [gas fees](https://usenobi.com/blog/why-is-ethereum-gas-fee-so-high/) (you can check up to date gas prices [here](https://crypto.com/defi/dashboard/gas-fees))
* dapps are not as widely adopted due to development difficulty and not being as user friendly and well known as web2 existing platforms
* plutocracy and institution/whale buy out - see [Steemit hard fork](https://changelly.com/blog/steem-hardfork-explained/) and its acquisition through a large stake

Blockchain does not guarantee automatic decentralisation - e.g.: [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) is owned and managed by a company, therefore has a governance strategy that is not different from traditional companies.

&amp;#x200B;

## [DAOs](https://aragon.org/dao) - the gold standard of decentralised governance

Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are the most decentralised form of on-chain governance to date. There are various forms of DAOs with different voting strategies - however all DAOs eliminate the need for a top-down hierarchy, by coordinating votes and proposals through smart contracts.

## DAO platforms

* [Moloch](https://www.molochdao.com/) \- the older platform, focused on crowdfunding for Ethereum dev teams
* [DAO Stack](https://daostack.io/) \- more focused on governance tool
* [Colony.io](https://colony.io/) \- newer and less known/adopted
* [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) \- focused on accessibility and user experience, it is in active development to make DAOs accessible to users with no coding skills who want to build a community

## DAOs are not the future, DAOs are now

* [DAONAUTS](https://client.aragon.org/#/0x57ebe61f5f8303ad944136b293c1836b3803b4c0/) which is linked to [its subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/)
* [An extensive list of Aragon based DAOs](https://poweredby.aragon.org/)

## Current issues

* gas fees keeping small contributors from participating (but gasless and L2 solutions are currently in development for Aragon to overcome this)
* low voter turnout
* failure on executing community will
* vulnerability to malicious actors - see [The DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao)
* onboarding and including

&amp;#x200B;

## Snapshot - a ""light"" alternative

[What is Snapshot?](https://defiprime.com/product/snapshot)

&gt;Snapshot is a off-chain, gasless, multi-governance community polling dashboard

Snapshot spaces are widely deployed by well known platforms, but are not as decentralised as DAOs (off-chain and moderated by an admin group). Snapshot is easier and cheaper (for now) to deploy, manage and run.

*examples:*

* [Uniswap](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)
* [Sushi](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth)
* [PancakeSwap](https://snapshot.org/#/pancake)
* [Aragon](https://snapshot.org/#/aragon)
* [Aavegotchi](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth)

&amp;#x200B;

## Why all of this matters to us (tl;dr)

* a new model of governance is sorely needed in the light given the lack of transparency and fairness in existing governance structures
* every member in a community should have the right to propose ideas and vote, regardless of how much currency they are able to invest
* all parties involved should have equal ability to coordinate to avoid power imbalances
* automating voting and proposals on the blockchain will make tampering much more challenging and will reduce the need for vote recounts
* votes and proposals could be done anonymously with smart contracts, giving individuals at risk (or silenced by institutions) a voice
* DAO/Snapshot provide an ideal structure to **coordinate around common goals** (e.g. charity donations) while including people as equally as possible

&amp;#x200B;

## Disclaimer

I have done my best to check the background information and sources extensively (whitepapers, official about, Github pages). I try to stay neutral when covering the various projects, but I will disclose that I quite like Ethereum, Aragon and Sushi after interacting and using the platforms.

If there are any projects you think I should include, please let me know in the comments and I will edit them in :)

Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important? 😮😮,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8zzdf/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,economicsdesign,1,2021-06-28 00:06:05,15,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8zzdf/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION," What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."
Polyquity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/o94568/polyquity/,subwaybooligan,1,2021-06-28 03:45:24,13,/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/o94568/polyquity/,New Farm ALERT ,"# PolyQuity Protocol

PolyQuity is a fork of the Liquity protocol in the Polygon network. PolyQuity has the features and benefits consistent with the Liquity protocol. In addition, based on the concept of Liquity, we have designed a new tokenomics to adapt to the Polygon network.

## Vision

In view of the perfect system and success of Liquity, we expect PolyQuity to be the next MakerDao in the Polygon network. With the growth of Polygon network, PUSD might become one of the important Stablecoin assets.

We hope that PolyQuity would become the fundamental financial infrastructure in Polygon network.

## Core Feature

* By staking Matic assets, Stablecoin (PUSD) of zero interest-fee is minted to improve capital utilization.
* Minimum collateral ratio of 110% — more efficient usage of deposited Matic
* Governance free — all operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters are set at time of contract deployment
* Directly redeemable —  PUSD can be redeemed at face value for the underlying collateral at any time
* Fully decentralized — PolyQuity contracts have **no admin keys** and will be accessible via multiple interfaces hosted by different Frontend Operators, making it censorship resistant.
* Token (PYQ) holders can earn PUSD (Borrowing fee), Matic (Redemption fee) and PYQ (Tranfer fee).

## Main Use Cases

1. Borrow PUSD against Matic by opening a Trove.
2. Secure PolyQuity by providing PUSD to the Stability Pool in exchange for rewards.
3. Stake PYQ to earn the fee revenue paid for borrowing/redeeming PUSD and transferring PYQ.
4. Redeem 1 PUSD for 1 USD worth of Matic when the PUSD peg falls below $1

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# How does PolyQuity work?

PolyQuity is a fork of the Liquity protocol in the Polygon network, so it works in the same way as Liquity, and you can refer to the official document of Liquity for more information.

## What are the main use cases of PolyQuity?

1. Borrow PUSD against Matic by opening a Trove
2. Secure PolyQuity by providing PUSD to the Stability Pool in exchange for rewards
3. Stake PYQ to earn the fee revenue paid for borrowing ，redeeming PUSD and PYQ transfer fee.
4. Redeem 1 PUSD for 1 USD worth of Matic when the PUSD peg falls below $1

## What are PUSD and PYQ?

PUSD is the USD-pegged stablecoin used to pay out loans on the PolyQuity protocol. At any time it can be redeemed against the underlying collateral at face value. Learn more about the stability mechanism.

PYQ is the secondary token issued by PolyQuity. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system and incentivizes early adopters and frontends. The total PYQ supply is capped at 100,000,000 tokens. 

## Does PolyQuity charge any fees?

There is a one-off fee whenever PUSD is borrowed, and when PUSD is redeemed:

* For borrowers, there is a borrowing fee on loans as a percentage of the drawn amount (in PUSD).
* For redeemers, there is a redemption fee on the amount paid to users by the system (in Matic) when exchanging PUSD for Matic. Note that redemption is separate from repaying your loan as a borrower, which is free of charge.

Both fees depend on the redemption volumes, i.e. they increase upon every redemption in function of the redeemed amount, and decay over time as long as no redemptions take place. The intent is to throttle large redemptions with higher fees, and to throttle borrowing directly after large redemption volumes. The fee decay over time ensures that the fee for both borrowers and redeemers will “cool down”, while redemptions volumes are low.

The fees cannot become smaller than 0.5% (except in Recovery Mode), which protects the redemption facility from being misused by arbitrageurs front-running the price feed. The borrowing fee is capped at 5%, keeping the system (somewhat) attractive for borrowers even in phases where the monetary is contracting due to redemptions. Other than that, the two fees are identical and are depicted as ""Fee"" in the following exemplary chart:  


  


## What is the Stability Pool?

The Stability Pool is the first line of defense in maintaining system solvency. It achieves that by acting as the source of liquidity to repay debt from liquidated Troves—ensuring that the total PUSD supply always remains backed.

When any Trove is liquidated, an amount of PUSD corresponding to the remaining debt of the Trove is burned from the Stability Pool’s balance to repay its debt. In exchange, the entire collateral from the Trove is transferred to the Stability Pool. 

The Stability Pool is funded by users transferring PUSD into it (called Stability Providers). Over time Stability Providers lose a pro-rata share of their PUSD deposits, while gaining a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral. However, because Troves are likely to be liquidated at just below 110% collateral ratios, it is expected that Stability Providers will receive a greater dollar-value of collateral relative to the debt they pay

**Experience the DApp**

At present, most wallets can support DApps . DApp is an abbreviation of Decentralized Application.

DApp is an application developed based on the underlying technology of the blockchain. Currently DApp is mainly concentrated on blockchains of Ethereum, EOS, TRON and IOST. The relationship between DApp and the underlying platform is similar to APP and IOS and Android systems.

That is to say, the DApp on EOS cannot run on ETH, just as APP on Android cannot run on IOS system. You can experience the decentralized integration of MakerDAO on ETH in your wallet, experience car driving in EOSRacing to get EOS in return. At present, some large-scale games are in the form of third-party APPs. When experiencing these DApps, you also need a wallet as a medium for logging in, operating, and authorization.

Though about doing a post on Stablecoins. I have compared USDT, USDC and DAI.  
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the  US Dollar . (Pegging refers to fixed or tied). Stablecoins are essentially the backbone of the cryptocurrency trading universe.   


In a world of high  volatility , the Stablecoins ensure that the value of money doesn’t change drastically. tablecoinsIn this post, we will discuss the 3 different most used Stablecoins:   


https://preview.redd.it/kwy55jpov6871.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36383594ab4125d7d1a44c77d7ebed7c019ec7e3

* USDT issued by the company Tether   

* USDC run jointly by Circle and Coinbase   

* DAI, fully decentralized   
P.S. This is a non-exhaustive list. And more Stablecoins will likely be added over time.   
**USDT or Tetherus**   
USDT is one of the most talked about Stablecoins. As of today, it’s market capitalization is third largest among cryptos, after  Bitcoin and Ethereum . It speaks about the popularity and the liquidity of USDT. It is widely used as trading pairs such as  BTCUSDT ,  ALGOUSDT , ETHUSDT etc.   
FYI, USDT is issued by a company called Tether, based out of Hong Kong. The company claims that the price of USDT will always remain at one  US Dollar , as each new coin minted is backed by an equivalent amount of cash or assets being added to the company’s reserves.   
**USDC or USD Coin**   
USDC is run by a joint partnership between Circle and Coinbase. One key difference between USDT and  USDC is that  USDC is based on the  Ethereum network. It came into existence to be used for DeFi or Decentralized Finance applications   
**DAI**   
DAI is an Ethereum-based stablecoin (stable-price cryptocurrency) whose issuance and development is managed by the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization.    
The price of DAI is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and is collateralized by a mix of other cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart-contract vaults every time new DAI is minted.   
**Which is the best Stablecoin**   
Although, there is no direct answer to this, different aspects can be considered to judge the usability of each coin.   
USDC is pegged 1:1 to the  US dollar , held in reserve bank accounts, and is subject to regular attestations to ensure that it stays this way. This process mitigates the market risk from the currency. On the other hand, despite being hugely popular, the transparency with USDT remains questionable.    
To counter the transparency and centralization aspect, the Stablecoin DAI came into existence. To mint DAI, one has to deposit collateral with MakerDAO. Once the collateral has been deposited in Maker, the trader can generate a certain amount of DAI.   
Therefore, DAI appears to be the best Stablecoin in terms of decentralization, transparency and averse to market or liquidity risks. However, it will definitely take some time to catch up with the popularity of USDT."

[CreDA Introduces An Innovative Decentralized Credit System](https://preview.redd.it/fijzci7phj871.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf69a5dd6e539ac812f18e1e37e5a94be1578467)

Decentralized Finance ecosystem is growing and numerous innovations are trickling in to solve the issues in traditional finance. Lending is an incredible functionality in DeFi that is being exploited by several protocols at the moment. One thing that is common in existing lending protocols is over-collateralization. Without a credit system, the DeFi world and its efficiencies will be limited solely to over-collateralization, which will reduce the level of innovations that will find their way into DeFi. 

The DeFi realm needs innovative solutions that makes it easy for people to transition from using traditional finance features to DeFi functionalities. Importance of a credit system can't be overemphasized in the lending world, meaning that the DeFi realm needs a decentralized credit scoring to promote better lending system.

Most DeFi protocols that offer lending features like MakerDAO, and AAVE, depend on over-collateralization ratios that are between 150% to 300%, in a bid to clamp down on the risk attached to borrowing and lending within the DeFi realm. Using this system allows lending protocols to ensure that crypto lenders are shielded from default and volatility since there is no credit check system in place. 

CreDA understands that over-collateralization will reduce the innovations that come within the ecosystem, and that is why it is creating a credit system to reduce the lending risks attached to crypto holders, while permitting developers to easily create lending protocols that offers unsecured loans in the DeFi world. CreDA will create a decentralized credit ecosystem that will analyze the creditworthiness of different users, while creating a credit insurance system to hedge the risks."
It’s DAO Day!....What’s a DAO?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/obl4d0/its_dao_daywhats_a_dao/,dmiddy,1,2021-07-01 20:47:55,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/obl4d0/its_dao_daywhats_a_dao/,SUPPORT," DAO Day is in honor of [Wyoming's law](https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed) that DAOs can now register as LLCs

This is a summary of an [article](https://1729.com/daos) written by Theodor Marcu on 1729.com

**DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization**

* As of June 2021, over $1 billion has been committed towards DAOs
* Smart contracts and blockchains organize DAOs, allowing collective participation in the funding and production of community goods

**Okay...So what are they?**

* DAOs can be thought of as “internet-native constitutions”
* Traditional corporations have a set of fundamental rules/principles that establish organization and determine governance within
* DAOs have the same thing, except it is encoded in smart contracts and blockchains
   * This is what makes them autonomous → if given an input, the DAO(a smart contract) outputs something
* This automation allows for greater decentralization, as there is no one person with decision-making capabilities
* Decentralization makes them good for funding/managing projects on the internet
   * Some examples → stablecoins, venture capital funds, DEXes, meme-buying cartels
* The ultimate goal of a DAO is to give all participating members a say

**Okay...So how do they work?**

Say, for example, you want to invest in the most interesting memes on the internet

* The average person wouldn’t be able to afford a Doge NFT, but may still get pleasure from owning a piece of it
* In this case, they can pool their funds with other like-minded people in order to buy NFTs

A few coordination problems exist with this model

1. How exactly do you find people to work with? There must be mutual trust between parties
2. How do you decide which memes to buy? Where does the NFT go when bought?
3. Who’s in charge of this meme-buying organization?
4. How does the organization allocate its capital?

Traditionally, a centralized company/institution was the answer to all of these questions

How DAOs solve these coordination conundrums

1. Proof of Seriousness - A DAO can ask each members to buy-in with a minimum amount of DAO tokens to join the organization, with the expectation that the DAO token will increase as the goals of the DAO are met. 
2. DAOs can be designed so that members can submit proposals on which memes to buy, and if a proposal gets a certain number of votes, the DAO automatically buys the meme
3. Governance Provisions - Amendments can be added if a quorum of members agree on them (a member can be defined as someone owning a certain amount of tokens)

**Some interesting DAO projects**

\- **MakerDAO** \- A DeFi project governed by a DAO. It is a stablecoin protocol allowing users to lend and borrow crypto without third parties. Token holders can change the rules or provide the team a mandate for community decisions.

\- **Uniswap/Curve** \- Uses liquidity pools to enable users to trade assets.

\- **MolochDAO** \- Seeks to fund projects that advance the Ethereum ecosystem

\- **PleasrDAO** \- Buys art in the form of NFTs. Recently purchased the Doge meme for $4 million.

**Legal Status of DAOS**

As of writing, only a few places around the world recognize DAOs as legal entities benefiting from protections afforded to something like an LLC. Today (July 1, 2021), Wyoming’s law that allows DAOs to register as LLCs takes effect.

Most DAOs operate without any protection for their members, but there are projects being worked on to add a liability wrapper around DAOs, like [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/).

**What’s Next?**

DAOs are primarily specific to the blockchain industry at the moment, but there is potential for them to spread to more traditional areas. People may be more inclined to join a DAO over a startup because DAOs can provide liquidity faster, while allowing them to directly participate in the governance of the organization.

DAOs could also be a great fit for the real estate industry. It’s not hard to make the jump from owning digital property like and NFT to owning physical property. Physical property could then give DAOs more leverage when regulation time comes. Imagine a pseudo-citizenship in which members of a real estate DAO have access to a network of DAO-owned properties.

This is only the beginning of DAOs, so it’s likely the most interesting use case is yet to be found."

Merlin lab reacted too ""quickly"" to this attack and announced the closure of the project.
16:54, the project party began to investigate the matter ;
17:24, the project party drew a preliminary conclusion that the loopholes of economic rules had been used;
23:27, announced the closure of the project, informed the user to stop deposit and withdraw funds in time;
the project party began to sell tokens at 0:26 on the 30th.
The indignant voices diffused rapidly on Twitter.
""I'm not withdraw a dollar and only 1 day into Merlinlab and already got rug pulled"",
""they have been audited by Certik and included in Security Leaderboard,but any alerts on their dashboar
Cry a moment
The BSC machine gun pool project MerlinLs hacked at 15:24 on June 29. According to an analysis by blockchain security firm Peckshield, the MerlinLab was hacked There is a logic loophole in MerlinStrategyalPacabnb.
The contract mistakenly takes the BNB transferred by the beneficiary as the mining income, so that the contract issues more MERL as a reward. After repeated operations, the attacker gains $300,000 MERL and temporarily halves, from $16.23 to $6.09 .
Merlin Lab reacts quickly to this attack, but faster than most people would have expected. 
 According to the project owner, after repeated hacker attacks, the developers were not optimistic about the prospect of the project and believed that they had no more experience to deal with the potential challenges in the future, so they did nothing but to shut down the project because they could not realize their original vision.
At present, the official website of the project party can still be accessed, and funds can be withdrawn normally. The project party's documents, Twitter account and Chinese WeChat group have been disbanded. 
This incident exposes the following questions of DEFI :
1) Is the team responsible for evil or normal hacker attack? 
2) Are the audited projects safe?
 3) Are anonymous items trustworthy? 
4) The cost of the project party admitting defeat is low, so how to deal with the losses caused to the investors? Hackers are one of us?
 Peckshield said it was possible that the team had acted badly. 
One suspect: Why rush to deploy a contract on your main network when it wasn't ready? 
The single asset machine gun pool related to Alpaca Finance just went online this morning for testing on the Merlin Labs mainnet. The contract with the vulnerability has not been published yet, nor has it provided the user with the inside information needed to carry out this attack. Since the contract is deployed online and the audit is conducted by many people, there are many possible insiders Team evil may be: the core personnel take the initiative to do evil; Some personnel secretly evil; 
After the attack, the project operator shut down the project overnight, emptied the Twitter, emptied the project wiki, dissolved the WeChat group, sold the tokens and other operations. It seems that there is reason to suspect that this is the initiative of the team. 
However, the profit of this attack is about $300,000,Merlin Labs Before the attack of TVL is about 200 million dollars .If it is the core team take the initiative to do evil, they obviously have enough temptation to shut down the project, and give investors no time to extract money.
It seems that external hacker attacks, the coincidence indicated anything.
The audit does not solve all problems
Most DEFI projects will ask audit companies to issue audit reports to endorse the security of the projects. However, the audited projects are not necessarily safe. In May, BSC was targeted by hackers, many of which were audited by blockchain security companies Peckshield tells Babbitt that defending against an attack is not a static process, it's a dynamic process -- in short, it's a pre-event, post-event process Defense mode of three stages, before the new contract online to conduct a comprehensive and professional intelligent security audit contract, this step is mainly to help agreement screening known all kinds of loopholes, the audit does not solve all problems Also, pay attention to the screen in combination with other DeFi products when the business logic of the loophole, avoid logical loopholes compatibility across the contract; It is necessary to design a certain risk control circuit breaker mechanism, and introduce the threat perception intelligence and data situation intelligence service of the third party security company to respond to the security risk in the first time when the DEFI security incident occurs, and check and block the security attack in time, so as to avoid causing more losses.
In addition, a set of perfect asset tracking mechanism should be established to monitor the flow of virtual currencies in real time. After security incidents occur in other protocols, the protocol should be carefully checked and remedied, whether there are similar loopholes and whether there are potential risks We think that in addition to the need to build a safe prediction strategy, to thoroughly understand the agreement and in the prophecy machine this source fluctuation kongfu, do it from the Angle of audit found problems, provide reliable solutions, under the chain of timely check 20, can reduce the price because of how machine distortion data manipulation Anonymous project is worthy of trust?
almost all of the current top 10 DEFI projects are real names.
For example, Michael Egorov, founder of Curve, is a Russian like Vishen. Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of AVE, studied law at the University of Helsinki Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, was laid off from his first job out of school, and the world lost one young electrical engineer to one DEFI pioneer, and others like Compound(founder Robert Leshner), Makerdao (founder Rune) Christensen) Liquity(founder Robert Lauko) is also a real name project. The Venus project is supported by the Swipe team (which has since been reorganized and Swipe has stepped down from project decision-making), a Binance investment company Only the teams of Pancakeswap and Sushiswap are anonymous. 
However, several core developers of Sushiswap are active on Twitter. Although blockchain is about decentralization and trust, the reality is that real-name projects are more likely to win the trust of investors.
Unfortunately,Merlin Labs was an anonymous project
The project was discarded at random and the investors had to pay for it, right? 
The solution adopted by Merlin Labs after the attack did not fix the vulnerability and make a compensation plan for the investors like the previous two times. 
On the contrary, the project side quickly sold off the tokens and announced the dissolution of the project, which directly caused the halved coin price to go to zero . The sharp fall in the price of the coins also led to heavy losses for the LP, which provided liquidity for the project. 
To put it mildly, it is extremely irresponsible of the project party to do this, and completely disregarding the interests of investors Last night bottom-hunting investors cost more in the range of 6-8 dollars, a wake up to return to zero because the project party is anonymous, at the same time the project Twitter cancelled the cable group ban WeChat group dissolved, the loss of investors almost nowhere to ask for a claim that DEFI has no supervision, in Code is law Investors in the blockchain world rely on code security as well as ethical discipline. When those two lines of defense are breached, how we prevent it next time?"

What is BakerDAO

BakerDAO is an upgraded version of MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC) run by different community. It is a multi-collateral decentralized stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to borrow decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. In addition, BakerDAO is non-custodial and completely decentralized, in which all processes are completed based on smart contracts on BSC. No one is entitled to use collateral assets or issue BAI and BKR arbitrarily. 

BAI is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed and stable currency issued by the BakerDAO system according to the borrow protocol, which is soft-pegged to the US dollar. With very low volatility, BAI can resist hyperinflation, ensure economic freedom and provide opportunities for anyone anywhere. 

BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO. For instance, the holders can modify such parameters as the stable fee rate and liquidation rate of collaterals, and they also have options for what type of new collaterals to support.

Besides, BakerDAO is a decentralized stablecoin as well as a safe and reliable decentralized lending protocol. Currently, the amount of stablecoin DAI of MakerDAO on Ethereum has reached nearly 5 billion US dollars, which are all issued through collateral cryptocurrency, and the marketcap of the governance currency MKR market cap has also reached nearly 5 billion US dollars. MakerDAO is the most complicated and largest decentralized application in the DeFi world so far. BakerDAO will certainly make another splendid achievement with its enormous market potential by relying on the high efficiency and low gas fee of the BSC chain and the innovative economic model.

BakerDAO Economic Model

1 million BakerDAO governance token BKR will be issued, 70% of which will be issued in a fair manner, namely, yield farming. Stimulated by yield farming, more users can obtain BKR, so as to participate in the governance of BakerDAO. The distribution method is as follows:

BakerDAO **Ecosystem** **Plan**

It is well-known that the BAI ecosystem is a key marker for the BakerDAO development, so BakerDAO reserves 10% of BKR to support ecosystem projects. These projects will not be supported directly by BKR to prevent the fluctuation of BKR price. Instead, they will be supported in the following two ways:

l BAI is repurchased using BKR to support the ecosystem projects;

l BKR mining is conducted to support the ecosystem projects’ cryptocurrency.

In turn, the ecosystem projects need to airdrop a certain percentage of tokens to BKR holders to give feedback for this support.

The ecosystem projects planned by BakerDAO include stablecoin trading protocols, lending protocols and decentralized exchanges. The ecosystem will continue to grow as BakerDAO progresses. The ecosystem projects can be existing projects or new ones.

BakerDAO **Roadmap**

To better develop the Baker protocol, we will develop the BAI ecosystem, initiate governance, provide more collaterals and increase capital utilization in addition to optimizing the user’s experience on BakerDAO. The development roadmap is shown below:

l The stablecoin BAI generation protocol will be launched on June 16, 2021

l BKR yield farming will be launched on June 18, 2021

l The ecosystem project, Stablecoin Exchange Protocol, will be supported on July 18, 2021.

l BakerDAO will start governance by BKR on July 28, 2021

l The ecosystem project, Decentralized Lending Protocol, will be supported on August 18, 2021

l BakerDAO liquidation system will be upgraded on September 1, 2021

l The ecosystem project, Decentralized Exchange Protocol, will be supported on October 18, 2021

l NFT assets will be supported to generate BAI on January 1, 2022

l The utilization of collaterals will be increased using the re-collateral model on April 1, 2022

l Physical assets will be supported to generate BAI on July 1, 2022 

l BAI interest system will be adopted to improve the utilization of BakerDAO system revenue on October 1, 2022

BakerDAO Borrow system was officially launched at 18:00 on June 19, 2021. And BakerDAO Yield Farming was launched at 20:00 on June 20, 2021.

Chainlink and The Oracle Problem: For Dummies,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/od5kdr/chainlink_and_the_oracle_problem_for_dummies/,Dolphinizer,1,2021-07-04 04:20:12,9,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/od5kdr/chainlink_and_the_oracle_problem_for_dummies/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"Ok so essentially the purpose of blockchain technology is decentralization and a movement towards a ‘trustless’ world. What is meant by this, is that blockchains are inherently under the control of no one entity, such as a government, corporation, etc. They are open to everyone, entirely transparent. Immutable, and uncensorable. Blockchains make massive sacrifices in order to maintain this decentralization, this is what makes blockchains valuable.

 In order for blockchains to actually achieve something more than just sending tokens around, we want blockchains to interact with the real world, and we want to be able to have meaningful agreements and contracts on chain, something more than just ‘send tokens from address A to address B’. These are done in something called a ‘smart contract’. A smart contract is a piece of code that lives on-chain, this code automatically executes the instant the necessary parameters for its execution are met. Basically all of Decentralized Finance today is run by smart contracts.

Say you want to set up a smart contract for the purposes of betting on the superb owl. Users send tokens to the contract putting their bet on either team A, or team B. If Team A wins, all the tokens go to the users who bet on team A. This is all very simple to code on networks like ethereum, except for one major problem: how will the contract know who wins the super bowl? 

 To get any information about the real world on chain, you need an ‘Oracle’. A reliable source of definitive truth. The obvious solution is to connect your smart contract to some website like sportsnet, and just use that as your Oracle. This will probably work fine, but remember, the whole point of blockchains is decentralization, if you have all these fancy decentralized networks running your smart contract, but the execution of the smart contract is entirely reliant on a centralized source of data, then what’s the point of all those decentralized networks? A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, it doesn’t matter if you have the most decentralized computing network in the world running your smart contracts, if the source of data, which governs how the contract executes is entirely centralized. 

 This problem, of finding a way to get information on chain, in a way that matches the level of security and decentralization of blockchains, is known as ‘The Oracle Problem’, and this is the problem Chainlink solves. Oracles are the most obvious, and most vulnerable attack vector for most smart contracts.

Chainlink solves this problem by decentralizing oracles. Aggregating the results of multiple ‘nodes’, to come up with one answer. There are multiple levels of security ensuring these nodes provide honest, accurate, data to the network, but i’m not going to get into those too much in this post. Tl;dr is that they’re economically incentivized to be honest, penalized if they’re dishonest, and there is a reputation system and a number of safeguards that work to keep the oracles Chainlink provides reliable and secure. 

 The Chainlink token is used to pay for any of the services on the network, and eventually will be ‘staked’ by chainlink nodes, meaning it is locked in the network, and will be taken from these nodes if they misbehave. Chainlink is inherently modular, and customizable, so customers can pick and choose their nodes, and the specification of their oracle network according to whatever needs they have. You can think of Chainlink as a network of networks, and customers can build oracle networks customized to their needs all within the link ecosystem.

Chainlink is currently the only major player in the oracle space. They have a significant first mover advantage, and the network currently secures basically every major DeFi protocol except for MakerDAO. The total value collectively secures by these protocols is in the tens of billions of dollars, and this value is all dependant on the reliability of the data chainlink puts out, as unreliable data would lead to faulty liquidations, and lost funds from these protocols and their users. 

Chainlink is already cementing itself as the standard oracle solution, and in the long term, unless some other, superior solution is found to the oracle problem, chainlink stands to have a near monopoly on secure oracles.

Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important? 😮😮 | Econteric.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumGang/comments/odiuno/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,economicsdesign,1,2021-07-04 19:45:35,0,/r/EthereumGang/comments/odiuno/why_is_algorithmic_stablecoin_important/,," 

What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;“Stablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to”.

Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa — when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits."

it also states:

&gt;The system aims to keep a buffer of **48.7M**, and when the surplus surpasses this buffer the exceeding amount is used to buy back and burn MKR.

Does this mean a percentage of the fees earned will be used for buy back and burn once the buffer reaches 48.7M until the buffer reaches 60M then all further fees will be used for buy back and burn?"

Cryptocurrency is a relatively newer form of currency that has been floating for a while but has suddenly gotten into the limelight. Unlike fiat currencies which require a medium like a bank to complete transactions, crypto successfully eliminates a medium and hence is a peer-to-peer network. Cryptocurrency is the name given to a system that uses cryptography to allow the secure transfer and exchange of digital tokens in a distributed and decentralized manner. These tokens can be traded at market rates for fiat currencies.

The first cryptocurrency that came into being was Bitcoin which began trading in January 2009. Bitcoin was launched by a person/group of people known by the name of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. Now there are more than hundreds of cryptocurrencies and various other applications of blockchain technology readily available.

Cryptocurrency holds the potential for being cheap, secure, and near-instant transactions allowing millions of people to join the world of internet commerce. This system allows businesses to offer real-time pay-per-use consumption of their products such as cell phone services, video, etc.

The rise of cryptocurrency poses a threat to many existing traditional functions of finance. Investing in stocks, keeping money in banks are some examples of this.

 

**BLOCKCHAIN**

 

A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. This technology enables users to confirm transactions without needing a central clearing authority.

Blockchain holds the potential of going far beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrency. But in this article, we’ll stick to its use in the crypto field.

**CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

A cryptocurrency doesn’t have any intrinsic value and functions only because there is sufficient market acceptance and there is a belief that the currency has value attributed to it. In the case of fiat currencies, money has value because people trust the central bank. For cryptocurrencies additions to the public ledger are confirmed by the crowd of people participating.

**DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

Cryptocurrencies can be grouped into seven classes:

* Transaction mechanism: bitcoin,litecoin
* Distributed computation token: Internet computer where programs, smart contracts are executed when called. For eg- Ethereum, Tezos
* Utility token: Programmable blockchain asset. For eg- Golem,FileCoin
* Security token: Represents stocks, bonds, derivatives, or other financial assets. For eg- Security Token Offerings(STO)
* Fungible Token: Most popular is ERC-20 issued on the ethereum blockchain.
* Non-Fungible Token: Each token is unique and not interchangeable with another. For eg- Cryptokitties, Decentraland(LAND)
* Stablecoins: There are four categories -

1. Collateralized with fiat currency: USDT,USDC
2. Collateralized with real assets: DGX, collateralized by gold
3. Cryptocurrency Collateralized: MakerDAO offers DAI coin pegged to US dollar
4. Uncollateralized: Basis project and their coin Basecoin

**Price action of Bitcoin:**

Bitcoin price since inception has seen the rise of 26140% and has outperformed all traditional assets.

Messari Share: How to become a professional crypto analyst?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dramatic_Climate_598/comments/oe43n6/messari_share_how_to_become_a_professional_crypto/,Dramatic_Climate_598,1,2021-07-05 17:53:11,0,/r/u_Dramatic_Climate_598/comments/oe43n6/messari_share_how_to_become_a_professional_crypto/,,"Recently, blockchain data provider Messari hosted a seminar on how to become a crypto analyst on Crowdcast, where senior analysts Ryan Watkins and Mason Nystrom shared their tips for growing from Crypto to a professional analyst. They also tweeted earlier Medium and other communities have shared relevant methodologies and learning experiences, and the author has compiled these suggestions for those who want to become builders in the crypto field and continue to improve on their professional path. 

**Messari's goal is to bring transparency to the crypto economy and help investors According to Maartje Bus**, Managing Director of Messari Hub, regulators and the public understand crypto assets and build data tools to drive informed decision making and investment: 

You can think of us as the crypto version of Bloomberg terminal Messari which provides data analysis tools related to specific crypto assets. You can build your own watch list. We have a very detailed overview of each asset In addition to this, we provide enterprise-class tools to track crypto enterprise/project dynamics and assist exchanges and asset custodians. 

Messari believes that high quality and widely distributed research can help unlock Ryan's story of potential analysts in crypto.

**Ryan Watkins** 

Graduated in 2018 with a degree in Finance + Computer Science. After working in investment banking for a year and a half, Watkins became involved in crypto and joined Messari full time in October 2019. Ethereum stuff had gone up over 2,000%, and he felt like he had to look at this thing again. 

""I started trading with the money I made from my internship and learning as fast as I could to get a handle on this space that seemed to be growing at a million miles per hour In my senior year, I began to obsessed with this, almost 100% of the free time.When I don't go out to play in the study in this field, first begin with COINS I have never questioned what money is and how it works, why does it exist, what is the purpose of it, or what's wrong with it. 

I just always thought that money is useful With COINS, I began to understand and question the basic component of civilization, and I became fascinated by these enough to let Ryan consider leaving lucrative investment banking, until a few months later, when he learned that the etheric lane and is convinced that encryption to some extent, even beyond the currency, he decided to work in this industry Against the backdrop of declining trust in institutions across the Western world, the idea that cryptocurrencies could provide the basis for the development of new types of institutions adapted to the digital age is really exciting!

**Mason** 

Graduated with a degree in business administration and began his career at a small exchange in Hong Kong, where he fell in love with cryptocurrencies when he read Messari founder Ryan Selkis's title *The Apprentice: Crypto*'s article for Volunteer Analysts.

After contacting Messari via email, he became an analyst volunteer of ConsenSys. With the fame of Messari and experience in exchange related work, ConsenSys has been awarded the job Now, he's a full-time research analyst at Messari. Is a technical background necessary to be a crypto analyst? 

Mason tells us from his experience: You don't have to have a technical background. **Cryptography is a very young field, the best way to really become an expert is to use a lot of different protocols**. You don't usually have to have a technical background. I didn't have a traditional financial background, because I didn't have a fanatical interest in finance and accounting or anything like that. I just took a very general approach But as long as you're willing to invest, you can quickly learn about what you're interested in, whether it's DeFi NFT, social tokens, etc., there's always an area where you can provide value and finally, I think if you can leverage the skills that you've developed in these projects, you'll easily find a full-time crypto job. 

Ryan and Mason share some common tips on how to break into the industry and become a professional analyst: In the live stream sharing, one of the most popular questions asked was: as a person with no experience in CYPTO analysis, despite my knowledge in this area, can I participate in it, or do you suggest where I should start? 

Ryan replied: The industry is young and there are not many ways to get into it, but that's a good thing. The way to get into it is to get your hand in the program and learn from it. So in DEFI's lending area, for example, spend a few days learning about Compound, how it works, and then use it and then compare it to AVE MakerDAO, you can see how The loan agreement works and then you can compare them and see what The Compound is going to do next. Research reports are a good source of learning. Messari、 Delphi、 The Block In addition to that, go to project websites, read their blogs, listen to related podcasts, and learn in a variety of ways, which is exactly what we are doing. 

Mason: 

There are all kinds of ways to get involved besides Defi and I've met a lot of different analysts who are very enthusiastic about NFT projects like Chiliz and really get involved (and other aspects of Web 3) and join these communities to explore The members of the crypto community are very inclusive and willing to answer questions and provide information, so really getting involved is one of the easiest ways to level up. 

**Write. Keep writing!** 

Through his writing, Ryan recognized the holes in his thinking and really began to understand that cryptocurrencies might sound perfect in your head, but when it comes to elaborating on paper, it's a different story I learned the theoretical knowledge of finance and computer science in university and had the experience of investment banking, but in the practice of cryptocurrency, I found that it was a new ball game. Mason believed that collaboration could clear the mind and keep up with the latest thing in this industry, Nic Carter Chris Burniske, Derek Hsue, Phil Bonello, Tony Sheng and Kyle Samani made their names in the cryptocurrency space, starting with their blog posts on blockchain topics, mostly related to investing or research. One of the highest skills you can leverage is your writing ability. 

Not only to write good content, but also to have the courage to speak out their own views, which is actually very difficult writing, content can be written? 

Mason recommends some easier forms of writing: Share your thoughts, it might make you feel uncomfortable, get over it! If you really want to take it easy, then from the high complexity of long content. 

The process at the beginning of the work, **you will be surprised on people less time spent on reading**. The content of the planning is very important, is also very valuable. The concept of expert article: to study the specific areas,for example, Stable currency、 liquidity、 NFTs、 intelligent mining、 contracts,、digital art。

You do some exploration of the taxation of the Cosmos ecosystem and write tutorials to show people how to do it! If you don't like to write long posts, then the app takes advantage of the social media community overseas. The smartest people in cryptocurrency use Twitter to build their brands, like POMP, Ryan Sean Adams, Meltem Dimirros, Arianna Simpson， Nic Carter, Ari David Paul, Hasu, Tom Shaughnessy, Also, answering questions on Quora can also help you learn about cryptocurrencies and boost your brand. If you answer enough questions, you can put it together in a written article In the writing process, try to show you have specific areas of knowledge and the unique point of view. Finally note that writing should have good structure, guarantee the reader won't were perplexed by what you wrote a good structure, can reference the outstanding articles as sample, imitating the writing (Chinese community, but in the way of DeFi The public found a large number of outstanding sample). 

After you've written it, read it out loud to see if it makes sense, and if so, ask someone else to read it, comment on it, and see if it made any sense to others. 

In addition to experimenting with the product and writing it,Mason offers the following tips on how to land a job in crypto: 

1. **Move to a cryptocurrency city and attend parties and clubs** 

We're all products of our environment If you want to succeed in tech, you probably should live where innovation is happening. If you're in a place full of blockchain activity, I recommend going to parties or community events, most of which are free The author's note: In China, Hangzhou is exactly the city where such innovation takes place. Various cutting-edge crypto themed activities are being held in China (Hangzhou) Future Blockchain Innovation Center. 

The industry blockchain blockchain technology discussion Defi NFT Metaverse is the earlier hot dance trend of 2021 crypto art(The future and investment opportunities) are still impressive! 

2 **Volunteers or mentors** 

Volunteering can be to gain experience and a good way to establish contact with the encryption monetary world. When you are in the outstanding person, such as excellent teacher, their knowledge and experience will flow from themselves to others. The closer you get to the remarkable people, the more you learn. 

3 **Make full use of your strengths** 

People with a certain amount of work experience should take advantage of it.If you have any skills or qualifications, including: Analyst (Excel oriented), CPA, CFA, Lawyer, Fearless Public Speaker (Voice or Podcast oriented), Author (Keyboard Wizard), Social Expert, Process Design Expert (Attention to detail and operation) ,Designers (Photoshop and graphic design), economics price (encryption currency is based on incentive mechanism and game theory), if you have any of these skills, then you are than the current in the encryption industry have greater advantages For students and young adults, make full use of your time to learn a new skill experience; 

4 Maybe you're not much of a copywriter, but if you're good at creating video, especially live content, then get started **creating tutorial videos**. Presentations are a great way to discuss cryptography Bankless, Chinese community excellent podcasts also have Light Paper Wu Shi One said (both in Chinese and English content) and other cryptographic science analysis Chinese video has block Mr. Chen Mo Bitouq cryptographic vision Ma Lie vision. 

5 **For others to provide help** 

People are always searching for information, help them find the information they need For example, put content, news, information, data, people, educational materials, and so on into perspective. People can't always tell you what they want or need. What do your unique skills and attributes offer? 

6 While ETH has a lot of friends (and perhaps competitors), you should also **find a friend** who shares your passion and works together on any of the topics mentioned above. No one can reach the summit alone and make friends with the rich content machine Hasu, co-creator of the podcast Uncommon Core, is arguably one of the best researchers in the cryptocurrency field, and writes frequently with others 

7 **Best tips: Do cool things To stand out**

You need to target your audience, and employers value people who think and act on their own ideas and make cool things. How do think the company? Here are some suggestions: Create graphical charts or videos that visually express something like the knowledge planet visual thinking, and planet owner Felix has done a great DeFi visual note for DeFi and NFT Concise a cool project (stablecoinindex), do something slightly different (#defi index, DeepDao is ahead of the growing trend like social tokens by creating a website or newsletter that offers something of value, like a list of meeting times for every open source crypto project, and finding ways to save someone's time or effort Research a super niche topic related to blockchain and write/push your findings. It shouldn't be superficial, but it doesn't have to be a completely revolutionary last word. Work hard, stay humble and live a happy life."

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis [here](https://www.notion.so/FEI-Protocol-362511aaf199456e8aa5f0bdfdd36b84).

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great [research paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10098)

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021."

Unique &amp; custom-built, one-of-a-kind labeled &amp; audited contract by several dev teams &amp; 2 respectable auditing firms will carry out the official audits upon the launch.🔏 

**📝 Contract Code:** [https://bscscan.com/address/0x070082b98eDa716c9B0009c14A5650Eb51208796#code](https://bscscan.com/address/0x070082b98eDa716c9B0009c14A5650Eb51208796#code)

**$PROTO, part of the Proto.Gold ecosystem, is now live on PancakeSwap. 💡** 

**More than 1000+ BNB was raised in minutes when the DCE 1 event went live, during the crash a couple of weeks back and the soft cap target was smashed, WITH NO MARKETING!!!** 

📱 Join the fast-growing community on Telegram: [https://t.me/Proto\_Gold](https://t.me/Proto_Gold)

# PROTO is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity.

**LAW** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**DORE** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

*Lightpaper and Whitepaper in 6 languages already ready and live* \- 

🌎 English, Mandarin, Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian. More coming!

The Proto.Gold community has naturally evolved into what is known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. It is a very efficient way to transparently manage the organization’s affairs on a global basis. An added side benefit is that it also provides both increased security and community participation.

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

**Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you!** 

95 days fully locked 🔒 then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. 

PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

# Description of PROTO token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each **PROTO** transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

⏫ **Frictionless token yield** ⏫

2.5% of all transactions are shared with PROTO Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of PROTO tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. PROTO is your primary day-to-day token.

**DORE bonus airdrop🏅**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to PROTO holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your DORE airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted Gold Bullion** 

Gold supplier swaps your DORE airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto.Gold ecosystem. This forward looking statement includes a Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap** 

Swap PROTO for DORE at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery** 

Enter the DORE lottery for bigger DORE prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 DORE = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**🪙 Tokenomics Features:**

1.5% of each PROTO transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool, increasing tradeability forever.

1% of each PROTO transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. PROTO isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground. 🗺

1% of each PROTO transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper. 

0.50% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

***More information below:***

**Community competitions 🎭**

Proto.Gold announced that talented &amp; lucky community members would have the opportunity to win and earn PROTO, LAW and DORE through the year in the community games and competitions. 

**DAO - community governance “Law” token.**

Our voice will shape **Proto.Gold’**s future direction! Early supporters who contributed during the DCE 1 and DCE 2 events were registered to receive, on a 1-to-1 basis upon their PROTO holdings, an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the LAW token. Everyone else will have to acquire it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K. 

0.75% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the PROTO total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. PROTO will support the price of LAW and other tokens/coins in some parts, similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**Why the necessity of Vortex in the Defi and how it resolves the existing problem?** 

The current DeFi solutions are dispersed. It becomes extremely difficult for a regular Joe to use them all with a slow learning curve considering the DeFi market is moving at a speed of light at the moment. 

With so many protocols and platforms coming every month, It is a dream of yield farmers to be able to access them all from a single web interface. 

Vortex Defi plans to provide you access to all leading platforms and protocols from a single web-based user interface. 

*MVP of Vortex DeFi shall:* 

1. Enable Lending via Yearn Protocol 

2. Enable Lending on Compound

3. Enable Lending on Aave 

*Immediate Version 2 of the MVP (post-seed) will include:* 

1. Enable Borrowing via Compound 

2. Enable Borrowing via Aave 

3. Creation of MakerDao CDP. 

The following will be integrated in the near future.

DeFi, short for decentralized finance, is a global, peer-to-peer system of storing and transferring assets without the structure, restriction and costs of a traditional centralized banking system. Advocates assert that DeFi can do everything a bank – whether brick-and-mortar or online-only – can do, only faster and more transparently through digital smart contracts on public ledger blockchains like Ethereum. Here’s what you need to know about this emerging technology. Consider working with a financial advisor if you’re thinking of moving into either cryptocurrencies or using DeFi.

MakerDAO, which was created in 2014, is often credited with being the first DeFi platform to gain widespread use. It’s an open-source project on the Ethereum blockchain and a decentralized autonomous organization created in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

**How DeFi Works**

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi works off a public decentralized blockchain network, stablecoins and DeFi apps, also known as dapps.

Blockchains continuously collect chunks of data and links them so past transactions are immutably and unbreakably documented. Each transaction is publicly verified by everyday users, and once it goes on the chain, it can not be changed. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it more secure than alternatives that depend on one centralized owner or authority like banks, corporations and governments. Blockchain technology enables the tracking of singular pieces of data like cryptocurrency payments so financial transactions can be verified and traced back to their owners, giving it verifiable value that can be used even more securely than fiat currencies.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to combine the transparency, security and immediacy of cryptocurrencies with the stability of fiat currencies.

Most DeFi apps, or dapps, use the Ethereum blockchain to complete transactions. You can purchase Ether, the Ethereum currency, and other cryptocurrencies to spend, lend and save. Cryptocurrencies are what fuel the creation of the blockchain network. Using dapps like Maker, Compound and Bancor, you can pretty much do anything with crypto that you can with traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, including borrowing and lending. Among other things, you can invest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have been gaining popularity for artists, collectors, celebrities of all kinds and their fans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros and Cons of DeFi**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sma0pzdgvw971.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c2ed5730aba94a1ed06624a9f4e0976aa000c99

There are some major advantages of using DeFi, including cost, speed and security. Anyone with an internet connection has access to blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Users are able to make trades and move their assets whenever they want without having to wait on bank transfers or pay bank fees. DeFi is fast. The blockchain is updated as soon as a transaction is made, and interest rates are updated multiple times in one minute. The open nature of DeFi means that every single transaction can be seen by the public. It would be very hard to steal cryptocurrency because of how the blockchain logs transactions.

You can also invest on securities markets and conduct peer-to-peer activities. For example, [DX.Exchange](https://DX.Exchange) provides a platform for trading and investing in tokenized stocks backed by NASDAQ and MPS Marketplace Services Ltd. You could buy a house using crypto, provided the seller agrees and you find an abstract company that is willing to work with DeFi. Emerging technologies like BitPay can be used to make purchases for physical goods that are typically paid for in dollars by transferring crypto into cash.

The economic impact of Covid-19 and how banks responded revealed another potential benefit of DeFi. In response to the pandemic’s recession, some central banks slashed interest rates to maintain consumer spending and protect the economy. However, that cut the effective net worth of savers. Under a DeFi regime, a central bank would have a much more difficult – if not impossible – task to manipulate the value of its currency. In other words, DeFi enables users to guard the value of their assets from central bank manipulation.

There are also some disadvantages that DeFi faces. DeFi users are not able to guard the value of their assets from market gyrations. Values fluctuate frequently and sometimes extremely. Ethereum transaction rates also fluctuate, so trading could potentially become expensive. Further, dapps are a relatively new technology and weaknesses or liabilities may yet emerge. In addition, there is also an array of potential tax implications that come with purchasing, trading and investing via DeFi.

Finally, the shape of emerging policies and regulatory schemes have yet to be determined. In particular, it remains to be seen regulators will respond to stablecoins coexisting with central bank digital currencies."
"Regarding the ""defisafety.com"" audit score of 3% for SHIBA SWAP",https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBADULTS/comments/ogf19c/regarding_the_defisafetycom_audit_score_of_3_for/,kalbhairavaa,1,2021-07-09 03:55:04,17,/r/SHIBADULTS/comments/ogf19c/regarding_the_defisafetycom_audit_score_of_3_for/,Discussion,"**Defi Safety ShibaSwap Audit**

[**Defi Safety**](https://defisafety.com/) claims to be an independent DeFi app Audit blog/site. I am not sure how reputable they are, but here is my analysis of why the score is 3% for ShibaSwap.

 [**ShibaSwap Audit report**](https://defisafety.com/2021/07/07/shibaswap/)

Here is how they Check for validity - I looked at their [**review of MAKERDAO**](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/draft-0.7-makerdao#scoring-appendix)

According to them , what they do is , they look to see if the following are available from the developer's site.

* ***smart contracts on the blockchain***
* ***documentation that explains what smart contracts do***
* ***tests I ran to verify smart contract***
* ***audit(s) performed on my code by third party experts***
* ***admin controls and strategies***

They conclude that with this data made available, it is reasonable to trust the smart contracts. \[All the tokens/coins and the Dapp/Swap are/has smart contracts\]

**My Observations** \[Please do not consider this as FUD and Please correct me if I am wrong and I will update this with the suggested changes\]

\[What is in **bold** is their ask, and inlined are my comments/observations\]

* ***Here are my smart contracts on the blockchain***
   * They could not find Shiba Swap's deployed contract to see the ""Code Used Appendix"" Analytics
      * We have contracts of Individual coins but not the farm itself 
      *  Pancake swap documents them like [**this**](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-farm) 
   * So far this - [**shibaswap/core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shibaswap/core) code repo (with the same name) from npm is all that is available 
   * So this is ranked as zero
* ***Here is the documentation that explains what my smart contracts do***
   * So far the only documentation about the code in the contracts are comments in the contract
   * I will have to copy the contract on to [**Remix**](https://remix.ethereum.org/) , compile and deploy it to their testnet and then execute it and debug it to understand the code. This will take time and they haven't bothered with it.
* ***Here are the tests I ran to verify my smart contract***
   * The source of the swap itself isn't public AFAIK so no such info exists
   * My best guess about this is that , they might be using  [**Truffle Framework**](http://truffleframework.com/) **,** which would mean that the UI code for the swap would be an npm package available publicly. I couldn't find it, they couldn't either and it isn't documented that this is the official source.
* ***Here are the audit(s) performed on my code by third party experts***
   * For now we have to wait on Certik - so that is bound to change .
* ***Here are the admin controls and strategies***
   * All we know about this is the 6/9 Gnosis Safe and the dignitaries from the Woof paper, but we don't know anything about them
   * The only name common amongst the dignitaries and the devs who attended the AMA is **kaaldhairya**
   * We don't know anything else

They are basically asking for transparency which is a fair ask.

You can be anonymous like Satoshi Nakamoto and build Bitcoin, but his/her/their code is available publicly for everyone to see and audit.

Our encouragement comes from the fact that what Certik said about the project and the fact that the swap exists and it works. 

Since, the Certik audit report hasn't been out yet, we are going to have to wait for that for answers.

There is 1.54 billion USD locked in there so this kind of transparency is a fair ask, IMHO.

For reference, Sushi swap has a dev wiki that lists [all the contracts](https://dev.sushi.com/sushiswap/contracts)   

This has to be build from scratch for Shiba Swap and it is not a trivial task."

After passing the audit of CertiK, a well-known audit institution, the BakerDAO yield farming and borrow protocol, which is a decentralized stablecoin protocol on BSC, was successfully launched at 19:00 on June 19, 2021. Under the adverse situation of the downward market, the TVL is up to US $30 million, and the system has been running healthily and stably. It is reported that the net income of MakerDAO, the Ethereum decentralized stablecoin project, was $9.37 million USD in June, and the stablecoin issued exceeded $5 billion USD. Relying on the efficient, low gas cost and innovative economic model of the BSC chain, BakerDAO has huge market potential. Next, let's take a look at the latest data of BakerDAO's yield farming and borrow.

The Capmonster Twick community has naturally evolved into what is known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. It is a very efficient way to transparently manage the organization’s affairs on a global basis. An added side benefit is that it also provides both increased security and community participation.

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

**Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you!**

95 days fully locked 🔒 then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day.

PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

Description of PROTO token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each **PROTO** transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

⏫ **Frictionless token yield** ⏫

2.5% of all transactions are shared with PROTO Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of PROTO tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. PROTO is your primary day-to-day token.

**DORE bonus airdrop🏅**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to PROTO holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your DORE airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted Gold Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your DORE airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto.Gold ecosystem. This forward looking statement includes a Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap PROTO for DORE at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the DORE lottery for bigger DORE prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 DORE = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**🪙 Tokenomics Features:**

1.5% of each PROTO transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool, increasing tradeability forever.

1% of each PROTO transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. PROTO isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground. 🗺

1% of each PROTO transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

***More information below:***

**Community competitions 🎭**

Proto.Gold announced that talented &amp; lucky community members would have the opportunity to win and earn PROTO, LAW and DORE through the year in the community games and competitions.

**DAO - community governance “Law” token.**

Our voice will shape \*\*Capmonster Twick’\*\*s future direction! Early supporters who contributed during the DCE 1 and DCE 2 events were registered to receive, on a 1-to-1 basis upon their PROTO holdings, an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the LAW token. Everyone else will have to acquire it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each PROTO transaction is distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the PROTO total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. PROTO will support the price of LAW and other tokens/coins in some parts, similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

"Single Token Mining Fee Stepped Rate Plan will be Launched on 11, July（July 10, 2021）",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/ohh9m1/single_token_mining_fee_stepped_rate_plan_will_be/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-07-10 19:48:40,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/ohh9m1/single_token_mining_fee_stepped_rate_plan_will_be/,," 

Since BakerDAO passed CertiK audit and launched lending and yield farming system, TVL has exceeded 30 million USD, BKR price has exceeded 600 USD and has more than 6000 holders. However affected by the environment BKR price is declining spirally. The mining and selling behavior of single token mining users does not conform to the values of the BakerDAO community. We hope that everyone can hold BKR and develop with the community and team for a long time. This is also the purpose of yield farming: allow more people to hold BKR and contribute to the development of BakerDAO. So BakerDAO is launching single token mining fee stepped rate plan, the rate will be adjusted every day according to the price of the previous day, implemented from July 11, 2021. In the near future, BakerDAO will surely become the top DeFi project on the BSC chain like MakerDAO, and everyone's long-term holding of BKR will reflect great value.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 
* Focusing on indexing before derivatives
* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
* Liquidity for the middle class


Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022
•  3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)
•  Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)
•  10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 


• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

🔮 $SPELL abracadabra.money: Provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto assets and borrow magic internet money! $SPELL going to the moon! 🔮,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/ohppmr/spell_abracadabramoney_provide_collateral_in_the/,Doughnut_Master_19,1,2021-07-11 03:59:02,0,/r/CryptoMoon/comments/ohppmr/spell_abracadabramoney_provide_collateral_in_the/,DEFI,"With abracadabra.money, you can provide collateral in the form of interest bearing crypto assets such as yvUSDT, yvUSD &amp; borrow 'magic internet money' $MIM which is a stable coin that you swap for any other coin. This is the cheapest way to create collateralized debt position in the crypto space

You may know the principle from Unit Protocol (DUCK), but this project demands 2.9% interest, while abracadabra demands only 0.8%-1.5%. They are clearly going for high volume, which is the right thing to do giving that borrowing/lending is pretty much a commodity market (but potentially a very, very big one). Borrowing yvWETH comes with 0% interest at the moment. It's MakerDao but in cheap and targeting high volume.

Abracadabra has strong ties with yearn &amp; potentially even curve. The team is legit, dedicated and very ambitious.

$MIM is already on CRV pools with very high volume, the team is working at light speed and $MIM is available on ETH and Fantom. Stakers of $SPELL receive 10% of liquidation fees, plus rewards from interest.

Now the best part: Leveraged yielding positions &amp; deleverage flash loan repayments. With only one Transaction on the blockchain, you can leverage your yield position in up to 10 „loops“, meaning that you borrow MIM for your interest bearing crypto asset (for which you gain yield), and this borrowed MIM is automatically used for another round of yield.. &amp; again and again, up to 10 times. Not with some shitcoin that decreases in value, but with yvUSDC etc.

It's magic!!

MakerDAO Eyes Adding Gemini and Binance USD as Collateral  
The Maker community voted to prioritize GUSD, BUSD, and eight other tokens for inclusion as collateral, which would allow them to be used to create Dai.  
In brief  
Gemini USD and Binance USD received green lights from the MakerDAO community as potential collateral assets for Dai.  
If the assets are ultimately approved, users can put them on the Maker platform to generate DAI.  
The platform continues to add collateral assets as it moves away from solely allowing Ether.

**Main point:**

– Coins are any cryptocurrency that has a standalone independant blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, …)

– Altcoins are considered as coins that are not Bitcoin.

– Tokens are cryptocurrencies that do not have their own blockchain but live on another blockchain. As they live on another blockchain, they benefit from its technology. (ERC-20 tokens…)

# Coin

Coins refer to any cryptocurrency that has a standalone, independent blockchain — like Bitcoin.

These cryptocurrencies are bootstrapped from scratch, and the broader network is designed explicitly to achieve a certain goal. For example, Bitcoin exists as a censorship-resistant store of value and medium of exchange that has a secure, fixed monetary policy. The native token of Bitcoin, BTC (i.e., bitcoins), is the most liquid cryptocurrency in the market and has both the highest market cap and realized market cap in the cryptocurrency sector.

Coin projects typically draw inspiration from past technologies or other cryptocurrencies and fuse them into an innovative network catering to a specific purpose.

Another example of a coin, Ethereum’s Ether (ETH) is the native coin of a smart contracts platform for creating general-purpose computer programs that run on a decentralized blockchain. Rather than focusing on financial data, Ethereum focuses on arbitrary program data that can cover anything from games to social media. Ether is used for sending/receiving, managing assets, paying gas fees, and interacting with decentralized applications (dapps) on the network.

You might also have heard about Altcoins. Basically, we call Altcoins any coins that are an alternative to Bitcoin.

# Token

Tokens are a unique outlay of broader smart contracts platforms like Ethereum that enable users to create, issue, and manage tokens that are derivatives of the primary blockchain.

For example, the ICO craze of 2017 was fueled by Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, which is basically a protocol for creating tokens (besides ETH) on the Ethereum blockchain that can be exchanged with each other. Projects would announce or build an application on Ethereum using smart contracts, and issue a native token for use in that application, raising funds directly from investors in ETH in the process.

Tokens occupy a unique corner of the cryptocurrency market where they function as “utility” tokens within an application’s ecosystem for incentivizing certain behavior or paying fees. For example, the popular ERC-20 token Dai is part of the MakerDAO dapp on Ethereum. MakerDAO is a way for users to access credit instruments like lending/borrowing using Dai, which is designed to be stable. ERC-20 tokens like Dai can be exchanged for any other ERC-20 token or other Ethereum-based standards (i.e., ERC-721), including the ETH coin.

As a result, tokens exist as application-specific tokens within a coin’s broader cryptocurrency/blockchain network, like Dai existing within Ethereum’s ecosystem.

Other tokens besides Dai include Maker (MKR), 0x, Augur (REP), Komodo (KMD), and Golem (GNT).

Coins need to be exchanged with each other through cryptocurrency exchanges because they are built on different, non-standardized code protocols. Conversely, tokens on Ethereum (e.g., ERC-20) can be exchanged through internal applications amongst each other with minimal friction because they are built on standardized code protocols.

Approaching cryptocurrency markets is a challenging task, but understanding the basic distinction between the various types of cryptocurrencies can help you manage risk and make better decisions in a volatile ecosystem."

$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)
OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval 
OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS



How do they differ from their competitors?


Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.


Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

A thorough research report on Alpaca Finance from a #VentureCapital firm. PART 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/oj0h8u/a_thorough_research_report_on_alpaca_finance_from/,AlpacaFinance,1,2021-07-13 05:07:46,14,/r/AlpacaFinanceOfficial/comments/oj0h8u/a_thorough_research_report_on_alpaca_finance_from/,,"# Part 2

# 3.3. Future business

According to the roadmap of the team for the second half of the year, there are three areas of business progress worthy of special attention, namely:

# a. AUSD

At present, there is no too detailed information about AUSD, but it should be a stablecoin product issued with Alpaca’s interest-bearing assets (ib token) as collateral. According to the team’s AMA in April, this business was originally scheduled to launch at the end of the second quarter. However, due to the continuous outbreak of security incidents on the BSC from May to June, the team has increased the workload of security audits, resulting in delays in the release of some functions.

The collateral assets of AUSD should be mainstream crypto assets deposited by users into Alpaca, such as stablecoins, BTC, ETH, BNB, etc. The mint method may be similar to Makerdao (just guessing). However, like all stablecoin projects, AUSD also faces the same problems as other new stablecoins: **in a stablecoin market with strong network effect, what new value do you provide for stablecoin users, so that they are willing to use your products?**

Like any new product, a new stablecoin is difficult to be adopted by users if it has no “multiple benefits” compared with old stablecoins. The advantages and characteristics of the current mainstream stablecoints are roughly as follows:

* USDT: first issued with the largest issuance. Its first-mover advantage has built a strong currency network effect, but it is criticized for its centralization and opacity. The market has been worried about its credit risk.
* USDC: it was issued earlier, and its current issuance is second only to USDT. Although it is also a centralized stablecoin, it is under strict supervision and uses US dollars as collateral, which reduces credit risk. USDC is also the most rapidly promoted stablecoin outside of the crypto world.
* BUSD: its issuance ranked the third. Although it is mainly issued by Binance, there are also regulations that pay attention to its collateral and issuance volume, and the credit risk is small. In order to promote BUSD, Binance has provided strong operational support such as transaction fee reduction and exemption, so as to expand its applicable scenarios. It is currently the most widely circulated stablecoin in the BSC ecosystem.
* DAI: a decentralized stablecoin with the largest issuance and the longest history, issued by Makerdao using an over-collateralization mechanism. It has the largest network effect among decentralized stablecoins.

Due to the strong network effects and brand advantages, it is very difficult for new stablecoins to compete with old stablecoins, even if they have no problem in terms of security and decentralization. Because the lack of use scenarios will lead to insufficient demand for stablecoins, and then the coin price will be not pegged to US dollar for a long-term run. This phenomenon exists in Venus’s VAI now.

For the minters and users of AUSD, it may have two new values, making people willing to mint and use it:

* For the users of AUSD: Alpaca may first launch the leveraged yield farming scenario of AUSD within the ecosystem, which can make AUSD have an early usage scenario and income source and avoid the embarrassment of having no place to use. This is the main difference between AUSD and other pure stablecoin project — Alpaca itself can provide the early usage scenario for AUSD without the need of looking outside, which solves the problem of cold start.

Of course, AUSD will eventually need to expand its use cases beyond the Alpaca ecosystem, otherwise its ceiling will come soon. The expansion of the external scenario is ultimately determined by the size and product impact of Alpaca ecology.

# b. Institutional business

Introducing more institutional and professional-level investor funds to the platform may be one of Alpaca’s priorities in the second half of the year. In addition to the clues on the roadmap, this can be confirmed by two other events.

First, in early June, Alpaca has set up a company; second, the team has begun to recruit ToB positions such as head of business director, head of institutional growth, and head of institutional sales, and now there are already some candidates in the negotiation.

The establishment of a company can enable the project to better meet the qualification requirements of other party in the cooperation with institutions, especially traditional financial institutions. In addition, the recruitment of institutional positions indicates that the team will shift its business focus to serving institutions.

Why does the institutional business become the focus of the project? This may be determined by industry trends and Alpaca’s own product positioning. In the view of industry trend, the rapid growth in the crypto world is far from halting, and the space for investment, arbitrage, and trading opportunities is much larger than that of the traditional financial market. As long as the compliant channels for access to DeFi gradually become smooth, institutional funds will inevitably start to earn princely sums. The stablecoin yield products with a fixed return rate of 4% recently launched by Compound and Coinbase have demonstrated this trend. They are very attractive for institutional assets in the global low interest rate environment.

In terms of Alpaca’s products, the leveraged yield farming on the platform and subsequent more complex derivative trading tools have extreme high thresholds of understanding and practice to most ordinary users. Only professional players and institutions with professional data modeling capabilities and mature arbitrage experience are the best service targets for such products. Although the absolute number of such users is far less than retail players, the overall amount of their funds is far higher than that of retail players.

So why are institutional users willing to use Alpaca instead of traditional derivatives tools? In other words, after the token rewards of liquidity farming have faded, is there still any gold worth digging in the DeFi market? This answer may also be yes.

The reason behind this is that the underlying transaction mechanism of DeFi liquidity farming such as AMM, is different from the traditional transaction matching mechanism. The gaining source of liquidity farming is also more complex and non-linear. On the one hand, the gold farming opportunities come from the rapid growth of the crypto market, on the other hand, it comes from the radical change of the rules. This is a “new gold mine” different from the traditional financial market.

For example, in the communication with some senior users in the Alpaca community, they said that professional users choose leveraged yield farming as one of arbitrage tools. On the one hand, they can earn farming gains by using leveraged yield farming. This is the first type of non-loss (interest) derivative, which can make up for the loss of other derivatives combined with it. More importantly, the capital fluctuation curves of leveraged yield farming and options are different, and the intersection of different yield curves can bring low-risk arbitrage opportunities. It is worth mentioning that the game environment of DeFi products is more complicated due to its composability and openness. While amplifying uncertainty and risks, there will also be more arbitrage opportunities that can be flexibly captured.

What’s more is that even for the types of institutional clients that would use simple products like BlockFi, Celsius, Compound, and Coinbase to seek 4% interest, Alpaca can also offer at least this APY as well as doing it with no lockup and in non-custodial, decentralized fashion.

The Alpaca team may have increased its resource investment in institutional services based on the prediction of the above trends.

# c. Improve the composability of protocols

At present, Alpaca’s protocol interaction mainly comes from the direct use of users and calls from the protocol are less frequent, because the function of leveraged yield farming is far more complicated than the DeFi aggregators and the basic lending protocols. Q3 Alpaca will add its SDK to facilitate the use of leveraged yield farming function by external protocols. It is a very important means to enhance the level of business by improving the composability of protocols. Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, said in a recent AMA that currently nearly 80% of Aave’s transaction volume comes from the call of external protocols, which also makes Aave one of the most successful basic protocols on the Ethereum. In addition, innovative products such as cross-asset leveraged yield farming will be launched in the future.

# 4. Alpaca team

As a DeFi project that was born only 4 months ago, the Alpaca team is still mysterious and anonymous. It has not disclosed any information about its core members and has never given any relevant information on the number of team members, job position composition and geographical distribution.

When asked about their anonymity, their Head of Strategy Samsara responded by saying, “Our team is distributed all over the world, and we want to focus on building the best products rather than having to worry about changing macroeconomic climates in various jurisdictions, which often flip-flop on a quarterly basis, potentially hampering innovation and execution. The reality is that this is DeFi and we’re working with 100% open-source smart contracts. That means our code logic is deterministic, verifiable, and trustless. That’s true regardless of what the developers’ names are, just as it was true when blockchain was first invented by an anonymous figure, Satoshi.”

But such an anonymous team is impressive in the following aspects:

# 4.1. Fast product iteration and responsiveness

Obviously the Alpaca team is a believer and practitioner of “agile development”. The so-called agile development refers to a set of methodology which takes the evolution of user needs as the core and adopts an iterative and step-by-step approach to develop new software. Its principles include: advocating simplicity, embracing change, incremental improvement, fast feedback, and moving forward with light burdens, etc.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1uwos0rbjua71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748d2618789a223633b0fbf85af9972e09ae7ff8

Alpaca has a rich document library with six versions: English, Chinese, Thai, French, Portuguese and Russian. If you browse through the documentation of the top DeFi projects, including those that have been around for much longer, you’ll find most of them lack language support beyond English. Alpaca is promoting the project with such a work and product idea, which is reflected in the perceptible external aspects such as community management, product interaction, code efficiency, and document arrangement, etc.

In terms of product iterations, Alpaca has maintained a state with steady introduction of major functions and intensive small improvements. Here the major functions mainly refer to the core functions that can be placed on the product roadmap, such as the leveraged yield farm (LFY) recently launched and dual-asset lending. Small improvements include a quick response to detailed requirements, such as “whether users can add the real-time price on the position opening page to avoid the opening loss due to price changes.”

The agility and rapid response of the team can also be seen in another emergency. After the launch of Alpaca, it quickly attracted nearly 1 billion TVL within a week due to its original open source code, refreshing interactive pages and interesting image of alpaca. However, on March 4, Alpaca’s similar project — Meerkat Finance (MKAT) vanished a day after the launch, raising questions about the safety of the Alpaca project itself. In half a day, the TVL plummeted by nearly 30% (from 1 billion to 700 million). After the incident, Alpaca team quickly responded on Twitter and the community on the same day, giving a transparency statement and reiterating that they were conducting an audit with Peckshield and another company. On March 5, it launched the bug bounty program to encourage bug catching with high bonus. On March 6, the team announced the result of bug bounty and made amendments. As a new project that had launched for only one week, the professionalism and participation of its community users and the team’s response speed are impressive.

The diligence of the project on the product side can also be proved by the update frequency on Github. Alpaca’s code update volume and frequency are almost the highest on BSC now.

# 4.2. Innovation capability

Alpaca is not the pioneer of leveraged yield farming, whose original practitioner was Alpha (later expanded to BSC) deployed on Ethereum. However, Alpaca did not completely fork Alpha’s code, but made a lot of innovations based on its code framework, and this laid the foundation for more innovative functions as well as risk prevention in the future. So far, Alpaca’s innovations compared with Alpha include two-way asset lending (Alpha’s recent V2 version has also begun to support it), leveraged yield farm, AUSD stablecoins, and cross-asset lending. In addition, there are more user-DeFined options when opening positions.

# 4.3. Deep understanding of Meme culture

With the popularity of DeFi trend and the outbreak of Dogecoin and Shiba this year, the word “Meme” has been repeatedly mentioned in the community as well as the communication and operation of DeFi projects.

Meme refers to a popular Internet culture gene copied and spread in derivative way. It is a bit similar to the “gag culture” in Chinese.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jcvd6u7ejua71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a76d9a812cc70c7f105c9f7798c8053c76d4e72

The most successful representative of meme culture in the coin circle is the Dogecoin with dog head as the token symbol. The spiritual core of meme culture in the crypto world is to reduce seriousness, with anti-authority and geek spirit.

Alpaca chose alpaca as the mascot of the project and said formally in the beginning of the official document: Alpaca — what a majestic animal! We can’t think of a better mascot to represent our ethos.

* Alpacas love to live in the mountains at high altitudes… **They will make your farming yields sky-high once you become their friend.**
* Alpacas come in 22 gorgeous colors… **We will offer many farming pools for you to choose from.**
* Alpacas are green animals; they have a very light carbon footprint, and 95% of their wool is usable… **Sending transactions on BSC is incredibly efficient and will cost you much less gas than on other chains, maximizing your yields.**
* Alpacas do not bite, and lack sharp teeth… **Everything about our project is transparent and verifiable; there will be no rug pull!**
* Alpacas are a great investment; they’re inexpensive to raise, require small acreage, and provide a regular supply of wool… **Our protocol’s leveraged positions will allow you to amplify your profit potential, providing higher yields on less capital.**

Within a few days after the launch, the developers changed the image of Alpaca for many times, and the combined IP images include Harry Potter, Laser Eye, etc. Most surprisingly to Chinese users, Alpaca even grayed out the page and created an image of alpaca honoring Yuan Longping on the death day of Yuan Longping, the father of hybrid rice in China.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k88vynzhjua71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ebba31e7b40601c8df62baa44383e5d98a7020c

 The community inherited the alpaca meme culture from the core team. Community users continuously redeveloped the image of alpaca and created a large number of theme emoticons, which became a unique cultural language in the community, as shown in the below figure:

 4.4. Emphasis and investment on safety

The team attaches great importance to the security of funds and contracts. It arranged security audits by Peckshield and Certik before the official functions were launched. Alpaca is one of the few profitable projects that had not been affected during the period of May to June when BSC security incidents occurred frequently.

Oracle and lightning loan attacks are the most frequent attack methods on BSC. In order to prevent and control this risk, Alpaca has launched a set of exclusive risk control mechanisms, which is called as “Oracle Guard”. To be specific, when the price of an assets in a user’s farming pair from the DEX (PancakeSwap) differ more than 10% from the median of a batch of off-chain oracles verified by Alpaca, the Oracle Guard will enter the protection mode. This consists of disabling liquidations, opening and closing positions, and adding collateral, all of which aim to protect users from trading at bad prices and taking an unjust loss.

In the interviews with community users, many users mentioned the team’s focus on code security and transparency. They said that the team would cooperate with community volunteers with code audit ability to conduct multiple audits before submitting the official audit, while maintaining open source code. This practice of community participation in audits not only improves the community’s trust in the project, but also enhances code security and work efficiency.

In the evaluation of BSC by DeFi Safety on June 12 of this year, Alpaca’s safety score ranked the first. Considering the update speed of Alpaca products and the complexity of its business, this result is really incredible.

# 4.5. Summary

Alpaca team’s hard work in agile development, innovation ability, grasp of meme culture and strong guarantee on security are all impressive and highly recognized by the community. Moreover, Alpaca has not received external venture capital, nor has it issued coins for financing through IDO or IEO. This team has always maintained a high development morale and rapid product iteration, showing the maturity of senior practitioners in the product direction. Where does their motivation come from?

I think this closely related to the economic incentive mechanism of Alpaca which is different from other projects, which will be analyzed in the following section of “Token model analysis”.

# 5. Business analysis

# 5.1. Industry prospect and potential

Alpaca’s business started from leveraged yield farming. This year, it is expected to start the stablecoin, cross-asset leverage and other businesses. It can be seen as a derivatives and currency market providing services for decentralized market makers. Different from centralized exchanges, the liquidity of DEX is almost entirely provided by market makers. In addition, compared with the high threshold of market markers in the centralized exchanges, DEX allows every ordinary user to come and provide liquidity through the AMM model so they can harvest transaction fee yields. Therefore, the total liquidity of DEX in the AMM model can be regarded as the total scale of market-making capital.

 

https://preview.redd.it/7cknu83ojua71.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d12b04661c3b62e0852df5046f46533e8e6c028

According to the data of Debank on July 1, 2021, the top ten DEXs with AMM mechanism have locked US $33.77 billion of market-making liquidity (almost half of the total locked value of DeFi). This can be regarded as the upper limit of the market scale for professional market makers, and this amount is still growing.

As mentioned in the chapter “Basic information”, Alpaca’s leveraged market-making products are relatively complex, more suitable for professional market makers or institutions with arbitrage modeling capabilities (or the ability to use arbitrage models). So, in the current US $33.77 billion DEX market-making world, how much does the professional market-making capital account for?

We don’t know the specific figures for the time being. However, according to The Block research analyst Igor erdiev’s capital calculation for Wintermute, the current largest market maker in the crypto field, its total market-making capital on CEX and DEX are at least US $55 million. Wintermute is an algorithmic market maker specifically designed for cryptocurrencies, providing market-making services on almost all mainstream CEXs. Its weekly trading volume on Bitfinex is approximately US $2 billion, twice that of the second place. It is also one of the largest market makers on DEX platforms such as Synthetix, Tokenlon, and dydx.

Even so, the market-making capital of US $55 million does not account for a large proportion in the whole crypto world, and even in the DEX world. I believe that with the development of DEX and the popularity of compliant channels, more and more market-making institutions will enter the market-making field of DEX and increase the proportion of their market-making capital. Such kind of professional clients are the target users of Alpaca.

Given that decentralized trading platforms are the most important infrastructure in the crypto world, as well as the long-term trend of professional market-making capital to increase the share of DEX liquidity, the potential market size of Alpaca is also large and expected to expand rapidly.

# 5.2. Token model analysis

Alpaca adopts a single token model. Alpaca is not only the governance token of the project, but also realizes deflation through profit repurchase and burn to enhance the intrinsic value of Alpaca tokens.

At present, the sources of Alpaca’s repurchase funds currently mainly come from three parts:

* Loan interest: Alpaca will charge 10% of the loan interest as protocol fee, of which 5% will be used to buy back Alpaca and 5% will be controlled by the team as the operating capital of the project.
* The team’s liquidation robot will receive 5% of the liquidation reward through liquidation works, 100% of which will be used to buy back and burn Alpaca. It should be noted that the liquidation of Alpaca is open to all users, so its liquidation robot may not be able to scramble for the liquidation right, so the income is uncertain.
* Handling fee for leveraged yield farm yield: Alpaca will charge a 19% handling fee for the yield of leveraged yield farm (CAKE farming is currently launched), of which 10% is used to buy back Alpaca and distribute it to its deposit users, and 9% will be used as operating capital of the project and controlled by the team.

In addition to the above three sources of repurchase funds, Alpaca can obtain more sources of repurchase funds with the development of more new businesses. For example, in the recent communication with the Chinese community, Samsara who is the core member of the team, said that in the future a certain proportion of 5% of the third-party robot revenue will be used to repurchase Alpaca, and the overall liquidation revenue in the highly volatile market will also become a value source for Alpaca.

In addition, in the communication with Samsara who is the core member of Alpaca, **he mentioned that in the future Alpaca will increase the proportion of the above protocol revenue that would be used to buy back and burn Alpaca, ensuring that more than 50% of the protocol revenue would go to the holders of Alpaca.**

**New attempt of team motivation**

Readers familiar with the token economy model of DeFi projects may be surprised to see this: shouldn’t Alpaca’s protocol revenue be captured by the project token holders? Why does the team now take away more than 50% of Alpaca protocol revenue?

Alpaca’s core team did share a large percentage of the protocol revenue. In fact, in addition to the above revenue, the team also collects a 3% handling fee from the token reward reinvestment of DEX liquidity farming and 8.7% of the output from the Alpaca token from liquidity farming. This process will last for two years until all tokens are distributed.

I think this is also one of the core reasons why the Alpaca team is so effective. Although it sounds a little unusual for more than 50% of protocol revenue to be attributed to the team rather than to the holders, this may be a more reasonable team incentive model.

If we think that blockchain\\DeFi entrepreneurship is similar to traditional Internet entrepreneurship, we will find that the existing incentive model of blockchain team is a bit weird: The entire DeFi cash flow income belongs to the token holders. The core team (mainly the founding team) does not receive wages, and their incentives either come from the continuous unlocking of free team shares in the early stages of the project, or from a certain percentage of token distribution generated by fair farming. It’s as if the startup team doesn’t get paid, lives on unlocking and realizing cash from the initial offerings and options in the early stage of the startup and pays the company’s daily fixed expenses.

This model may cause two negative effects:

* At the later stage of the project development, as the actual professional manager of the project, the startup team will lose their economic motivation to keep striving.
* Due to the lack of sufficient daily economic income, the team is unable to carry out measures such as team expansion in the important development periods, limiting its development speed.

The above statement is not scaremongering. Stani Kulechov, the founder of the well-known DeFi protocol Aave, said in a recent AMA that the core team may gradually drift away from the development and operation of the project after completing the development of Aave2.5, and it is planning to start a new WEB3 venture project.

The model adopted by Alpaca is more like the business model of traditional startup companies: the protocol obtains operating income through the provision of financial services. Part of the income is used for costs and expenses (the core team uses it to pay for operating costs, including wages and office space, etc.), and the remaining part is retained as net profit for shareholders (token holders).

On the one hand, this profit distribution model ensures that the core team has a stable cash flow income to maintain expenses, on the other hand, the team’s income is also consistent with the growth of the project, because the team’s income will increase with the growth of the overall protocol revenue. This model avoids the problem of team incentives and project decoupling in the later stage of project development.

In this model, the principal-agent problem between professional managers (founding team) and shareholders (token holders) with option incentives (continuous token distribution) seems to be alleviated to a certain extent.

In the end, it will take time to observe and test whether this model is better than the existing model of “governance tokens to capture all protocol revenue”, which is a long-term road to explore.

The author argues that in this process, Alpaca holders need to observe the following:

i. Under the condition of getting more protocol revenue, does the core team have higher work efficiency than other teams and make the pie bigger more efficiently?

ii. Is the team willing to gradually transfer the distribution proportion of protocol revenue and increase the revenue capture ratio of token holders after the protocol revenue pie becomes bigger? Because as the total protocol revenue grows, the proportion of the team’s fixed expenses and labour costs in total revenue should decline.

# 5.3. Competition landscape

# Project moat and source of competitive advantage

As a platform providing financial services to market makers, Alpaca’s moat mainly comes from the following points:

* **Core team with excellent comprehensive quality.** This is reflected in agile development and product iteration capabilities, skilled application of Meme culture, accurate grasp of industry trends, and a good balance between project capital utilization rate and risks.
* **Good community atmosphere.** Due to the complexity and professionalism of the products, the average level of users in the Alpaca community is high, with good trading and financial knowledge as well as code talents. The community has given the team great help in the development of third-party tools, document compilation, production of communication materials, production of opening model tools, code audit, product strategy, community operation management and many other aspects of the project. In addition, the internal community is very united.
* **First-mover advantage of the project in product\\model\\risk management\\TVL.** The design of DeFi leveraged yield farming products is complicated. As an early project in this field, Alpaca has a certain first-mover advantage over the latecomers in terms of product and model experience accumulation.

In the traditional value investment concept, the moat of an enterprise mainly comes from intangible assets (brands, patents, franchise rights), network effect, switching cost (after users use it, the cost to replace the product is very high) and cost advantage (from the scale, geographic location, resources, etc., that are hard to imitate). These competitive advantages that are difficult to shake and hard to imitate prevent new competitors from entering the market to compete with existing players.

So, is the moat theory of traditional value investment still applicable in the blockchain field?

First, let’s look at the patent licensing of intangible assets. In the DeFi field, patents and franchises are rare due to the open source code as well as the transparency and openness of blockchain. However, Uniswap has applied for BUSL1.1(The Business Source License) for their V3 code, prohibiting other projects from forking its codes for commercial purpose without permission. It is said that Alpaca will also begin to apply for code protection for its original function codes (single-asset leverage, cross-asset lending), prohibiting other projects from forking without permission for a period of time.

However, due to the anonymity of a large number of DeFi projects, the protective effect of the license still needs to be observed. There have already been instances of anonymous projects forking Uniswap V3 code before.Still, such projects that make blatantly “illegal forks” are much less likely to receive support from investors, the ecosystem(blockchain and exchanges) or potential partners, both for liability reasons and negative PR.

The brand effect of intangible assets in the DeFi field primarily comes from the safety and longevity of the project, rather than from emotional factors. The longer a DeFi runs without risk, the more users believe in its reliability and tend to use it. For example, many users dare to use Compound and Aave even though they do not have the ability to audit the codes, just because these products have experienced a long time test and multiple rounds of extreme market stress tests.

Network effect has outstanding effects in the fields of public chains and stablecoins, but not in DeFi projects so far.

In terms of cost advantage, since the development cost of DeFi projects comes more from the intellectual capital of team members, i.e., staff salaries, it is almost impossible to build cost barriers and thus the moat of cost advantages is also very rare.

Switching costs exist for some basic DeFi platforms that are widely adopted by external protocols, because other DeFi projects may require adjustments to their overall models and new security audits if they want to replace a piece of their own DeFi Lego. Secondly, institutional users may also have a high switching cost for their arbitrage tools. They need to conduct a complete preliminary investigation on their cooperation platforms, including the understanding of platform security, stress resistance under extreme conditions, team ability, service stability, future product roadmaps and ways to deal with competition. This evaluation process often takes 3–6 months. Due to the high cost of evaluation and decision-making, organizations do not easily change their DeFi partners if there are no safety accidents. On the contrary, individual users easily quit a DAPP to use a newer or better one because their switching costs on specific products are very low.

In general, due to the openness and transparency of blockchain and the autonomy of user account rights, it is more difficult to charge high “monopoly rents” than traditional industries to form a monopoly advantage in the DeFi field. This also means that the core team of DeFi projects must continue to update its knowledge, iterate products, improve its own protocol composability and always prioritize user needs, so that it may not be caught up by later innovators.

**In other words, the core team itself is the most critical “moat” for most DeFi projects.**

# 5.4. Basic risks

# a. Main internal risks

* The team’s product development progress or market expansion is not as good as expected, especially in the institutional market. Risk level: Medium
* Bad debts caused by black swan events such as extreme market conditions and smart contract vulnerabilities. Risk level: low

# b. Main external risks

* Track competition is intensified: more professional and excellent teams will enter the market-maker service track with the support of capital, lowering the overall operating profit of the industry. Risk level: Medium
* Cryptocurrency enters a bear market: the crypto world has a distinct cycle. When a bear market cycle comes, the transaction volume of the entire trading market will decline significantly, and so will the profits of market markers. This will also have a direct impact on Alpaca’s project revenue. Risk level: Medium

# 6. Token circulation and distribution

# 6.1. Total supply and total circulation

The total supply of Alpaca tokens is capped at 188 million. Now the total supply, total circulation and market capitalization of the tokens are as follows (unit: 1,000):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1zsa9t8rjua71.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e093dcc2894534bb09481a222a33bd0fda4a681b

 Alpaca’s farming bonous lasts for 2 years and will end in February 2023. The output declines monthly, as shown in the following figure: 

 Alpaca’s farming bonus lasts for 2 years and will end in February 2023. The output declines monthly, as shown in the following figure: 

 

https://preview.redd.it/3uuwxgmtjua71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb9de2990911a9f878264684313333ebadb63dcd

The monthly inflation ratio of project tokens will drop below 5% after July, and the subsequent inflation selling pressure will gradually decrease.

It should be noted that the project launched the Stronk fund pool in March due to the large output of token mining in the early days. Users can put the locked Alpaca tokens into the Stronk fund pool and obtain the lock-up certificate sAlpaca. In return, they will be rewarded with additional sAlpaca tokens (s means Stronk). On July 12, four months later, users can exchange sAlpaca tokens for Alpaca by 1:1. It is estimated that the total amount of principal and interest to be unlocked will reach about 30 million Alpaca, which will directly increase Alpaca’s market circulation by nearly 30%, causing short-term pressure on the token price. However, it should be noted that, in fact sAlpaca is a freely circulating certificate of deposit that can be exchanged with Alpaca in the secondary market, and the current exchange rate is close to 1:1

 

https://preview.redd.it/q92ajj4vjua71.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aea322dccb7207c92df34341db8859efd0e9f08

Therefore, the circulation pressure of 30 million locked Alpaca has conducted disguised transmission to the market through sAlpaca in advance. When 30 million sAlpaca can be exchanged for Alpaca, its impact may be relatively limited.

# 6.2. Token distribution

Among the 131 million tokens supplied by Alpaca, the main wallets distributed are as follows:

# 7. Preliminary valuation

# 7.1. Five core questions

**What business cycle is the project in? Maturity stage or the early and middle stage of development?**

The project is in the early stage of operation, the core functions of its products have been launched, and PMF (Product market fit) has been verified.

**Does the project have a solid competitive advantage? Where does it come from?**

The project has a certain competitive advantage, which mainly comes from the excellent team, the experience accumulation when the project was established early as well as the first-mover advantage in capital.

**Is the medium and long-term investment logic of the project clear? Is it in line with the industry trend?**

The project has a clear investment logic, and the main scenario is precise. It aims to provide financial services for market makers and it will expand to the its market share with the focus on the institutional market. In the future, DEX will still be the foundation of the industry development, and the professionalization and institutionalization trend of market makers will continue. So the development direction of the project is aligned well with the industry trend.

**What are the main variables in the operation of the project? Are these variables easy to quantify and measure?**

The main operation variables of the project are the business development progress and industry competition. They can be intuitively measured by the key function development and implementation speed of the project, TVL, capital utilization rate and other data, as well as the focus on the expansion of institutional customers.

**What is the management and governance of the project? What is the level of DAO?**

At present, directions of product development and protocol are primarily led by the core team. The community gives feedback on product experience and other aspects and promotes the core team to solve them. Alpaca has not yet launched the voting function. In the future, users need to stake their Alpaca tokens to get the voting rights and then attend commubity governance. The DAO is currently in the early preparation stage.

# 7.2. Summary of core investment logic

Alpaca is on a track with clear demands and continuous growth. The overall quality of the project is excellent, which is a high-potential project worthy of attention:

* The market size of market maker is basically the same as the total size of DEX. In the long run, it is in a rising period. In addition, the arrival of subsequent specialized institutions will help the business volume of high-end market-making financial products such as Alpaca continue to grow.
* The project has a very excellent and diligent team, whose innovation, product iteration speed, industry direction judgment, community operation, etc. are all reliable.
* The new developments followed may bring a huge marginal increase to overall revenue and the profits of token holders, including the convenience of more external protocol access after the development of SDK, the improvement of capital efficiency and new interest income brought by the launch of AUSD, and the business expansion.
* Alpaca currently lists on seceral CEXs includes Kucoin, MXC, and Gateio, but they have not launched on top exchanges, especially Binance.

# 7.3. Valuation assessment

Although Alpaca project has a clear cash flow, in theory we can apply the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value it. Given that DeFi is still an early market and the industry is developing rapidly with too many variables, it is likely to get a “accurate but wrong” answer if using the DCF model for valuation.

This research report mainly uses the relative valuation method to compare and Evalate Alpaca. It primarily compares the valuations of Alpaca and similar projects horizontally with the preliminary conclusion that the current market value is slightly undervalued.

# a. Comparison between Alpaca and leading lending projects

Since Alpaca actually is a niche segment of the lending track, how does its valuation compare with that of Aave, Compoud, and Maker? The comparison indicator we use here is PE, i.e., the project market cap\\project earnings attributed to token holders.

 

https://preview.redd.it/2bnctlcfkua71.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3c54481cc5d4a247a441cff98e2f80c7cf39de4

Based on the above data, we found that the PE of Aave and Compound is similar, while that of Makerdao is significantly lower and that of Alpaca is also lower. However, given the inconsistency of the token circulation ratios across projects, projects with low circulation ratios will face greater inflationary pressure in the future. After the author calculated the PE comparison after the circulation ratio adjustment, we found that Makerdao’s PE valuation advantage is more obvious, followed by Alpaca and Aave, while Compoud’s PE valuation is relatively high.

Of course, although the four projects are all lending projects, their business models are quite different, thus PE valuation can only be used as a reference indicator. Given that the Alpaca’s project development is in its early stage with many growth points of follow-up business, its adjusted PE of 69.8 is more attractive than the leading loan projects already in the mature period.

Of course, the reasons why Alpaca has a lower PE valuation may come from various sources, such as the project has not yet been launched in major exchanges, or it only provides services on the BSC now, or the project duration is shorter with higher uncertainty.

In summary, Alpaca’s current valuation is quite attractive.

# b. The current valuation range of the market

At present, the market as a whole is in a correction stage after the bull market (there are also opinions that it has entered a bear market), where the valuation center has been clearly adjusted with obvious market bubbles. In terms of BTC growth, the highest point of this bull market is US $64,510, which is only 222% higher than the last round’s top of US $20,000. In addition, after the correction, the current growth rate is about 65% (US $33,000), significantly lower than the overall growth rate of previous bull markets. From the perspective of time length, the time duration that the current bull market has risen from the bottom is far shorter from the length for the last bull market (see the figure below).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k6su7jygkua71.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c169364c930f2462d76e4d052116d9e8be81ef55

However, the recent policy environment of global liquidity easing has fallen into a delicate situation. Although the Biden administration is eager to launch its 6 trillion fiscal expenditure budget, some federal officials have suggested that reducing the scale of debt purchases should be put on the agenda. The market’s divergence on whether the turning point of liquidity will come early is widening.

Recently, China government has strengthened its supervision on mining and speculation, and many policies are pending, causing greater pressure on the market in the short term. The inflation effect of massive money printing on US stocks is further evident. The CPI of the United States rose by 5% year-on-year in May, the largest increase in 13 years. Rising prices will put pressure on the current loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, which may accelerate the pace of reducing debt purchases. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates in the first half of 2022, bringing a downward pressure on valuations of global risk asset market.

The increasing divergence of market trends will also have a direct impact on the valuation of a single project, which needs to be taken into consideration in asset allocation.

# 7.4. Summary of preliminary valuation

Alpaca serves the market of market makers with clear market demands. It is expected to maintain the current growth rate with the increase of the overall DEX market size and the proportion of institutional capital. Alpaca’s core competitive advantage is its excellent team, and also comes from scientific income distribution mechanism which ensures that the team has sufficient operating budget. In the future development, we need to focus on the expansion speed of Alpaca’s institutional market and its adoption by external protocols. Based on the comparison with the valuations of competitors and leading projects in the lending industry, the author believes that the current project valuation of Alpaca is in a reasonable low position.

\*The above statement is not regarded as investment advice.

"The Proto Gold Ecosystem - a Big-Brain Savings &amp; Rewards Protocol with Codebase from the bottom up. 88% max supply with multi-year vesting. Trending as gainer on Coingecko already, with big partnerships (as in Gold Bullion-related) and more for Q3 2021",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ojk4fr/the_proto_gold_ecosystem_a_bigbrain_savings/,akejavel,1,2021-07-14 01:13:19,11,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ojk4fr/the_proto_gold_ecosystem_a_bigbrain_savings/,BSC Token,"Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad, earlier this week, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M. The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 900BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small mcap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out. But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

**Proto** is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity.  
**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.  
**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!**

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield  
2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

\- DORE bonus airdrop  
1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

**1:** 🟨 Discounted Gold Bullion 🟨  
Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

**2**: 🔄 ProtoSwap 🔄  
Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

**3**: 🎰 Lottery 🎰  
Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and Whitepaper in 6 languages already ready and live, with English, Mandarin, Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian live and more languages coming.

**Locked liquidity** 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

**DAO - community governance “Law” token.**  
Our voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! Early supporters who attend the presale or the IDO on Dxsale will be registered to receive on a 1 to 1 basis upon their Proto holdings an equal amount of LAW upon the launch of the Law token. Everyone else will have to buy it as soon as the market cap of LAW is above $500K.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

You can tokenise your house and sell 49% while still retaining majority ownership! This allows for liquidity from traditional illiquid assets (you could own 10% of a Picasso, Ford Mustang or even a part of the London Shard. 

Who can benefit from Omnia DeFi?

Millennials who are struggling to get on the property ladder 

People in the developing world who are land rich but lack the cash to invest in themselves!

Middle class who own illiquid assets and are cash strapped!

The tokenised land which will be registered on the blockchain will be laying down the foundations of web 3 infrastructure (This is the modern day equivalent of building Airports, highways or railroads!)

So great.... What are their killer features?

**Fundamentals**

Serious project not a MEME coin ⛔️ 

Will start tokenising AFTER regulated (this is so operations don’t get put down by the SEC/FCA)

Aggressive Burn Mechanisms &amp; Unique Tokenomics closely tied to business model, the more art &amp; real estate Omnia DeFi onboard the more $OMNIA they burn!

Update: ImToken’s New Smooth Layer 2 Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ok2cu1/update_imtokens_new_smooth_layer_2_experience/,CryptographicPanic,1,2021-07-14 19:25:20,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ok2cu1/update_imtokens_new_smooth_layer_2_experience/,RELEASE,"Update: imToken’s new smooth Layer 2 experience
Amazing update for EVM-compatible chains, and smooth Layer 2 experience

With imToken 2.8.4 version supporting custom node function and EIP3085, imToken has been working hard to explore the smooth experience of Layer2. Meanwhile imToken always put safety as a top priority, this new version made a lot of efforts around “EVM compatible chain asset management” and “security” aspect, with a look :)
This update follows 👇👇👇
More friendly support for Polygon, xDai, Fantom, BSC, HECO, OKEx …
… Support token display for all EVM chains
… Optimized node switching with color
… Add DApp quick entry
Use imKey hardware wallet to transfer and receive Nervos (CKB)
Tron security update
More optimizations and repairs
Amazing update for asset management of your EVM-chains
Using new chains just got way easier.
With this update your tokens on Polygon, xDai, Fantom, BSC, HECO, OKEx and other EVM-compatible chains are automatically detected.
imToken now also shows your token prices on those new chains.
Using BSC or other DApps? Simply click on ‘Ecosystem Apps’ to start with Layer 2, BSC and others.

Left: BSC wallet; Right: BSC Apps
DeFi asset management on your EVM-chains
The ‘DeFi Portfolio Manager’ is our amazing new tool we introduced in last month’s update. To enter it, simply click on ‘DeFi’ to see all your DeFi balances such as dYdX, Uniswap, Aave, MDEX, Curve, Compound, MakerDAO balances and hundreds more. Read more on our blog.
The DeFi Portfolio now supports all kinds of new chains: Ethereum, BNB, xDAI, Polygon, Fantom, Heco … you name it!

For example, switch to ‘Binance Smart Chain’ and click ‘DeFi’ to see your DeFi Portfolio
In this update we also add a color scheme that lets you distinguish different EVM-compatible chains.

ETH = blue and BSC = yellow
TRON’s risk control security system upgrade
We received feedback about some scams — on TRON — that would ask people to enter their passwords on fake websites.
That’s why we fully upgraded our security system in a way that warns users about risky addresses, as reported by users or discovered by the imToken security team.
When you see the following icon on the TRON chain, please be aware of risks!

Risk reminders
Since other common scams involve DApps, we also strengthened the DApp warnings. Visiting a risky DApp on TRON will show you the reminder below.

DApp access risk reminder

DApp transfer risk reminder
imKey hardware wallet supports Nervos (CKB)
imKey is now officially supporting Nervos (CKB). If you hold CKB, you can upgrade to imToken 2.9.4, use imKey to manage CKB wallets and experience transfers.
This currency update does not require hardware replacement and does not involve firmware upgrades. It is suitable for any imKey hardware wallet. You can automatically upgrade through the application to get CKB support.

Adding EVM-compatible chains in imToken also means that you can now use BSC, xDAI, Polygon, HECO and so on with your imKey.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that
• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation
Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked
Costly &amp; lengthy property sales
Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age
Liquidity for the middle class

Abundance of opportunities for all
Here’s how it works:
• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi 
with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  
•3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) 
Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   
•10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) 
•  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)
They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.
• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK
• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney
•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks
•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance
•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)
• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!

$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained
$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)
OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval 
OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS

How do they differ from their competitors?
Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH
• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!
Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.
Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.
Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!
OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 
Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 

their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

Farmers on #Polygon, are you ready? DinoSwap Deposits for the Fossil Farms open in less than 24 hours \~ July 15th at 12:00AM UTC. 

On DinoSwap, users will be able to stake the DINO token to earn the tokens of other projects on Polygon.

It is similar to PancakeSwap, but users stake DINO instead to get exposure to [Polygon-based projects](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polygon-vault-makerdao-matic-tokens/) and their native tokens.

The farms where users can earn tokens by staking DINO are called Fossil Farms.

The first Fossil Farms that are launching on DinoSwap are Bella Protocol, Dfyn Network, Benchmark Protocol, Aavegotchi, SportX, and Chain Guardians.

"Launchpads do offer the investors a way to reduce their risk exposures, and a way to add to their returns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/olpvnt/launchpads_do_offer_the_investors_a_way_to_reduce/,ryuk_luvs_apples,1,2021-07-17 04:57:22,1,/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/olpvnt/launchpads_do_offer_the_investors_a_way_to_reduce/,DISCUSSION,"First, to understand what we are going to talk about, we have to simplify the operational process of a crypto launchpad. To understand that, we have to know how projects raise money for their products or services. 

At first, a new project comes up with an idea, or a product that they want to develop. They create a token that will be a huge part of their planned platform. Tokens are sold in early access, at a discount price for investors, in order for projects to raise the funds needed to finance their plans. The platform that allow these sales activities are the launchpads. And then, as the project grows, the value of the token increases, and investors make money, but early investors make much more money. 

This is how launchpads offer investors a chance for a better investment, but how does such platform minimize the risk exposure? The investor is paying less than the original value of the token, so eventually the invested amount, which is the amount at risk, is less than it should be if the investor went for the token after it was released, which means that the loss is minimized already. 

This is why many investors are now looking for launchpads to invest their money in. Some of the most famous launchpads are Binance Launchpad, Kucoin Spotlight, and MakerDAO Pad. Also, an upcoming Launchpad project is gaining a lot of fame and momentum at the moment, it is Gpool.

Launcpads are a huge step forward for crypto trading, and it offers regular investors better chances with a less risky approach, however, no investment is riskless, an investor has to always make sure of his information before putting their money in any project."
👁 Oracle Solutions for Dummies 👁,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olq3tr/oracle_solutions_for_dummies/,yea-my-name,1,2021-07-17 05:09:06,1,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olq3tr/oracle_solutions_for_dummies/,MOONS 🌕,"Cryptocurrency price valuation fluctuates rapidly, it's why we love it. But in such a new, wild-west-like environment, there are many factors that can effect any given assets price, such as;  leverage, arbitrage, whales, FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), retail/institutional buying and selling. The list goes on. How do you really know what the actual value of an asset is at any given time when there are so many different factors at play? Furthermore, how do you know the exchange you purchase your crypto from is giving you the most accurate, up to date price feed for the asset you want to purchase? 

👁Oracle Solutions 👁

An oracle solution is essentially the ""all seeing eye"" for all partnered assets current price/activity feed. The oracle gives that information to all partnered exchanges/DEX's (decentralized exchanges) so there is little of a discrepancy possible between prices amongst buying platforms. Reducing arbitrage and stabilizing the fungibility of an asset.

Without a strong oracle solution bringing the most up to date, real time prices possible, assets would be disproportionate to one another amongst exchanges, along with being nearly impossible to truly evaluate the current state of an asset.

Examples of 👁Oracle Solutions 👁

\-Chainlink

\-Aurgur

\-Band Protocol

\-MakerDao

\*Extra Info\*

Chainlink is currently working on developing an NFT oracle solution. One of which I am personally very excited about. As far as my knowledge goes, they are the only platform working on developing one specifically for NFTs. It's incredibly hard to actually know a fair price for any given collectible. The true valuation of an NFT is whatever two parties are willing to sell/pay for it. You may be thinking, ""how is that any different from any other asset?"". Simply put, Fungibility. My bitcoin will always be the same price as your bitcoin, but a 1 of 1 NFT? Who makes that price.... Chainlink is working on a way to keep up to date tabs on NFT sales around the blockchain to see what other NFT's are selling for with similar qualities such as; minting, time of release, licensing , etc. To give users as accurate of a valuation as possible to what their NFT is worth!

DAI from MakerDAO is the obvious candidate that comes to my mind, but what others exist? [PegNet](https://pegnet.org/) looks interesting, but I don't have any personal experience with them.

I'm pretty sure the algorithmic, decentralized stablecoin projects have been growing like crazy without many people taking notice. This is your chance to share your knowledge.

Don't just shill your favorite coin. Spread **knowledge**. Please down-vote comments in this thread that do not meet these criteria:
- The post should clearly explain why the coin/token is decentralized (i.e. no central point of failure).
- The post should clearly explain how the coin/token is algorithmic."
Gitcoin Governance Token (GTC)? Am I delusional or is this actually a solid bet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/om9q6i/gitcoin_governance_token_gtc_am_i_delusional_or/,KiidDBuU,1,2021-07-18 02:23:53,0,/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/om9q6i/gitcoin_governance_token_gtc_am_i_delusional_or/,Discussion 🦍,"I've been looking through the other alt-tokens on Coinbase and stumbled across the GTC token that was released a month and a half ago (they airdropped 100M worth of GTC). I was curious and decided to read up on what it was. Its basically some sort governance alt token on Ethereum, that is used to help fund projects within the Gitcoin ecosystem, as well govern the Gitcoin ecosystem as well. 

 I'm thinking that demand for this will increase sooner or later, when Gitcoin's quadratic funding and platform become more popular. They already helped many big Blockchain projects like Cosmos, Harmony One, Filecoin/IPFS, Lido, and Aave to find developers and get funding. Since a lot of these web3 projects are open source they need to get funding somehow. Many of these project don't really have a solid business model. So they rely on the community to fund them. That's why Gitcoin exists, to help these companies get money, so they can continue to build and innovate. And the DAO essentially is what governs Gitcoin and how these funding mechanics operate. It's also used to help fund internal projects and research within Gitcoin itself. 

Imo I think the potential for this project is uncapped, because it's encompassing the whole Blockchain ecosystem. It's providing value to every open source Blockchain project there is, independent of it's underlying network. And many projects are relying on Gitcoin to get exposure and to market their technology. 

I'm curious to see what you guys think, does GTC have the potential to reach the hundreds, or thousands of dollars, like MakerDAO or Compounds DAO tokens? 

Rn it's $5, and the market cap is still very low. It's still very early to get in, that's why I'm considering doubling down on this. But I wanted to get your guys opinion on the subject matter.

You can tokenise your house and sell 49% while still retaining majority ownership! This allows for liquidity from traditional illiquid assets (you could own 10% of a Picasso, Ford Mustang or even a part of the London Shard. 

Who can benefit from Omnia DeFi?

Millennials who are struggling to get on the property ladder 

People in the developing world who are land rich but lack the cash to invest in themselves!

Middle class who own illiquid assets and are cash strapped!

The tokenised land which will be registered on the blockchain will be laying down the foundations of web 3 infrastructure (This is the modern day equivalent of building Airports, highways or railroads!)

So great.... What are their killer features?

**Fundamentals**

Serious project not a MEME coin ⛔️ 

Will start tokenising AFTER regulated (this is so operations don’t get put down by the SEC/FCA)

Aggressive Burn Mechanisms &amp; Unique Tokenomics closely tied to business model, the more art &amp; real estate Omnia DeFi onboard the more $OMNIA they burn!

$500 M worth of Art &amp; Real estate COMMITTED to the project!

Having collected over $30 million in fees in the last week, a cute NFT pet game called Axie Infinity is currently raking in more protocol revenue than Ethereum and Bitcoin, and more than the next 11 top-ranking dapps – that is, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Aave, Compound, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, MetaMask, Lido Finance, MakerDAO and Synthetix – combined. And in this case, its business model is designed so the people profiting from it are not just a bunch of crypto bros getting richer. It’s people farther down the food chain, those who are usually excluded from these kinds of life-changing moments of wealth creation.

OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value asset such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 •  •3 Tokens Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   •10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) •  Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

•  Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks

•  Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium (link)

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATSHow do they differ from their competitors?
Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

🚀 *The pre sale has started, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date.

"Jax coins provide an alternative to DAI. They are non-collateralized but still stable, transparent, and secure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/on1ozl/jax_coins_provide_an_alternative_to_dai_they_are/,victoroshi99,1,2021-07-19 07:09:05,3,/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/on1ozl/jax_coins_provide_an_alternative_to_dai_they_are/,," 

It will be noted that DAI has digressed from decentralization and marching towards complete centralized finance by adding centralized stablecoins as collateral in abnormally huge amounts. Not only that, the stealing of around $8.3 million in Ether which was tagged black Thursday which make the price of ETH fell down uncontrollably when investors cash out which further triggered panic sales which set a chain of liquidations of the collateral on the MakerDAO lending platform even though they manage to survive it on a long time.

Compared to DAI, [Jax coins](https://jax.network/) are non-collateralized and, therefore, completely decentralized, with no asset pegged to them. The price is market-based, thanks to the unique Jax.Network reward function, so if the demand for transactions rises, more coins are issued, and vice versa. If the price plummets, the number of coins for issuance is reduced. The issuance depends on two main factors, namely the user transaction demand and the cost structure associated with mining. The principle is quite simple. Stability in the purchasing power pegged to electricity costs, and not in value like other pegged or collateralized stablecoins, is one of the reasons why [Jax coins](https://jax.network/) can be massively adopted and outcompete existing fiat currencies."

About BakerDAO: 

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."

That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

Grayscale Unveils DeFi Fund Linked to New CoinDesk Index,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onihwo/grayscale_unveils_defi_fund_linked_to_new/,BTCrrsr,1,2021-07-20 01:13:26,6,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onihwo/grayscale_unveils_defi_fund_linked_to_new/,FINANCE," 

Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency investment manager, said Monday it has started a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, based on a new DeFi-specific index produced by CoinDesk’s TradeBlock division. 

The companies, both subsidiaries of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), wrote in a joint press release the Grayscale DeFi Fund provides “exposure to a selection of industry-leading DeFi protocols through a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.” The idea is that investors can allocate money toward DeFi without having to buy the tokens directly. 

DeFi, which consists of blockchain-based software protocols designed for the trading and lending of cryptocurrencies, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital-asset industry. The amount of collateral locked into the protocols has increased 19-fold over the past year to [about $50 billion](https://defipulse.com/), and prices for many of the platforms’ associated tokens have soared. 

“Based on the user adoption that we’re seeing around DeFi and DeFi protocols, we do think the future of this area is bright,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Monday on CoinDesk TV’s [First Mover](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/first-mover) program.

The fund is only open to “eligible individual and institutional accredited investors,” according to the press release. Grayscale said it “intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market” but added that “there is no guarantee this will be successful.” 

The CoinDesk DeFi Index is a new product from TradeBlock, one of the first firms to develop an index for professional investors to track [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) when it launched the [XBX Index](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/xbx) in 2014. CoinDesk announced its [purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-acquires-tradeblock-adding-indexes-and-pricing-to-news-events-offerings) of TradeBlock for an undisclosed sum in January.

The new index joins a growing list of offerings designed to help investors track prices for DeFi tokens and invest in them. Last month, the technology firm Amun [launched](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/25/2253105/0/en/Amun-Launches-Two-New-index-Tokens-To-Simplify-Access-To-The-Ethereum-DeFi-Ecosystem.html) two new crypto token products, the DeFi Index Token and DeFi Momentum Index.    

The cryptocurrency data firm Messari has a dedicated screening tool tracking 164 DeFi tokens. The average price of the tokens is up 395% this year, versus 8.3% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, and 160% for No. 2 [ether](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum).  

According to the press release, the CoinDesk DeFi index aims to provide a “broad-based, benchmark representation of DeFi protocols,” with assets [weighted](https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/) by their market capitalization.

As of July 1, 2021, the CoinDesk DeFi Index consisted of the following assets, with their market-capitalization-based weightings:

* [Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/price/uniswap) (UNI), 49.95%
* [Aave](https://www.coindesk.com/price/aave) (AAVE), 10.25%
* Compound (COMP), 8.38%
* Curve (CRV), 7.44%
* [MakerDAO](https://www.coindesk.com/price/maker) (MKR), 6.49%
* SushiSwap (SUSHI), 4.83%
* Synthetix (SNX), 4.43%
* [Yearn Finance](https://www.coindesk.com/price/yearn-finance) (YFI), 3.31%
* UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.93%
* Bancor Network Token (BNT), 2.00%

🔥Introducing Proto Gold Ecosystem | Unique Codebase - 88% Max Supply Locked With Vesting Up To 5 Years | Whitepaper Released In 6 languages | Savings &amp; Rewards Protocol | Gold Bullion News Q3 2021 |,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/oo2wfv/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,MarvellaKlumpp,1,2021-07-20 22:16:27,2,/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/oo2wfv/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,NEW COIN,"# Take your time, it will worth reading. Welcome to $PROTO!

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks.

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out.

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and **Whitepaper** in 6 languages already ready and live, with **English**, **Mandarin**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Russian** live and more languages coming.

Locked liquidity 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**DAO** \- community governance “**Law**” token.

Your voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! LAW was used recently in the first 3 community votes, to upgrade the code &amp; become compatable with BSCSCAN &amp; extended lockup periods of ones own wallets volunteralry.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**The Ecosystem Explained in more detail.**

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

🔥Introducing Proto Gold Ecosystem | Unique Codebase - 88% Max Supply Locked With Vesting Up To 5 Years | Whitepaper Released In 6 languages | Savings &amp; Rewards Protocol | Gold Bullion News Q3 2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/BSCMoonShots/comments/oo2xkh/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,MarvellaKlumpp,1,2021-07-20 22:18:05,50,/r/BSCMoonShots/comments/oo2xkh/introducing_proto_gold_ecosystem_unique_codebase/,,"# Take your time, it will worth reading. Welcome to $PROTO!

Launched via DxSale, the premier multi-chain launchpad 2 weeks ago, the $400k launch market cap was one of those slow fills that turn into a steady and healthy climb to currently around 2M, it 10x over the last 2 weeks.

The success and infrastructure, marketing, brandbooking and so on was successfully secured in an initial donation event where 1700 BNB was raised to be put into Proto's custom triple token vesting and governance system.

Finding a balance to create something dynamic yet long-lived has long been a problem for small MCap coins launched on BSC - as long as you are in full bull, this has in many cases just sorted itself out.

**But what if someone designed a protocol and codebase that was meant to reward in both rain, snow and sun?**

To understand the success of Proto Gold, you have to understand the triad of tokens that underpin it:

Proto is the ecosystem fuel and distributes rewards and charity, it’s only tradable token currently.

**Law** is designed for the proto ecosystem governance - and much more.

**Dore** is the quarterly savings &amp; redemption bonus, on top of the frictionless yield generation.

Description of Proto token - the Proto ecosystem fuel!

Each Proto transaction has a 10% transaction contribution split as follows:

\- Frictionless token yield

2.5% of all Transactions are shared with Proto Holders, forever increasing your wallet balance of Proto tokens. Watch your balance grow in real-time. Proto is your primary day-to-day token.

**- DORE bonus airdrop**

1.25% of all transactions are saved into the community savings Gnosis multisig vault &amp; distributed to Proto holders in a 90-day cycle as BUSD and converted into your Dore airdrop. Exciting details of the first 3 of many initiatives below!

1: 🟨 **Discounted** **Gold** **Bullion**

Gold supplier swaps your Dore airdrop for Gold Bullion at a 5% discount on the global retail price of Gold bullion, the world's oldest store of value. The discount is limited to 24 hours and according to their whitepaper provided by the Proto ecosystem. Partner announcement incoming!

2: 🔄 **ProtoSwap**

Swap Proto for Dore at the Proto DEX (decentralized exchange) to accumulate either token for your needs. Want more DORE to buy some gold? Then swap some PROTO to DORE! Want more PROTO for additional daily rewards &amp; increase the compound effects? Swap out DORE for PROTO.

3: 🎰 **Lottery**

Enter the Dore lottery for bigger Dore prizes, weekly draws, and 1 mega draw at the end of each quarter. 1 Dore = 1 ticket to each of the weekly draws and the final mega draw.

**More about the interactive tokenomics of the project:**

1.5% of each Proto transaction locked 🔒 into the liquidity pool.

1% of each Proto transaction goes towards a first-hand charity distribution, straight to the Charity Multisig vaults. Major partnership announcement VERY soon. The global partnership could be the biggest surprise with this crypto. Proto isn’t just sending crypto to a charity; there will be boots on the ground.

1% of each Proto transaction burned 🔥 the only right way by sending to the 0x0000000000… contract address, permanently reducing the available supply.

0.75% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the Marketing Binance Gnosis Multisig vault &amp; used to attract prominent influencers across the big social media platforms such as Youtube, TikTok, etc. &amp; run marketing campaigns permanently, raising awareness.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed for audits of codes &amp; further platform development. More info in their Whitepaper.

0.50% of each Proto transaction is distributed to the infrastructure finance Gnosis multisig vault to facilitate upcoming discounted offers...

Lightpaper and **Whitepaper** in 6 languages already ready and live, with **English**, **Mandarin**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Russian** live and more languages coming.

Locked liquidity 🔐 - no “rug pulls” here; all lockup &amp; vesting is hard-coded into the protocol. Fully viewable on the blockchain.

Slow-release of locked early contributor tokens; no whales will dump on you! 95 days fully locked then 110 days of release at only 0.90% of their holdings per day. PLUS: Up to 5 years of vesting on 88% of the ecosystem tokens! Core members’ allocation 15%, but locked and vesting for nearly 2.5 years. All is hardcoded into the protocol for community inspection.

**DAO** \- community governance “**Law**” token.

Your voice will shape Proto Gold’s future direction! LAW was used recently in the first 3 community votes, to upgrade the code &amp; become compatable with BSCSCAN &amp; extended lockup periods of ones own wallets volunteralry.

0.75% of each Proto transaction distributed to the DAO Vault, together with 20% of the Proto total supply, where funds will only be released with votes by the DAO members upon the launch of LAW, the governance token. Proto will support the price of Law and other tokens/coins in some parts similar to DAI &amp; MakerDAO.

**The Ecosystem Explained in more detail.**

PROTO GOLD is designed to provide short, medium, and long-term benefits to our community members to help motivate them to stay and contribute to future growth &amp; development.

Community members will maximize their benefits by holding all three tokens as they all provide different benefits - yet they all work together.

Token benefits for community members include:

Instant Rewards from PROTO

The deflationary effect from PROTO token burns

The DORE savings BONUS every quarter

LAW’s continued strengthening through accumulations into our DAO Treasury

Our tokens are three interdependent friends since:

PROTO needs LAW &gt; LAW needs PROTO &gt; DORE needs both LAW and PROTO

1 - **PROTO needs LAW**

To create extra security within our protocol, we renounced the PROTO contract keys to LAW. This means that a vote using LAW will be required before any changes can be made to the PROTO code.

2 - **LAW needs PROTO**

LAW provides our system’s governance and security. To prevent a 51% attack on the DAO, LAW needs strength. This strength comes from the DAO Treasury, which initially holds 20% of the total PROTO supply, and an additional 0.75% of each PROTO transaction also accrues to the DAO Treasury. This creates another deflationary effect on the PROTO supply and further strengthens LAW.

3.1 - **DORE needs PROTO**

The accumulation safe receives 1.25% of each PROTO transaction (in the form of BUSD). The amount of DORE distributed every 90 days is based on how much BUSD has accrued into the Accumulation Safe during that quarter.

The amount of DORE received by a PROTO holder depends on what percentage of the eligible PROTO supply an individual holds.

3.2 - **DORE needs LAW**

Community members must hold at least $100 of LAW to be eligible for the DORE airdrop. (This, in turn, also increases the incentive to hold LAW and further strengthens the DAO - and so it goes, around and around).

"What am I missing? It seems the way DeFi is currently set up it could potentially take down the entire crypto market. The whole ecosystem is over-leveraged, dependent on constant liquidity and rising token values. If that liquidity dries up, or the collateral value drops, it's game over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oohw3s/what_am_i_missing_it_seems_the_way_defi_is/,downwithnarcy,1,2021-07-21 11:32:47,117,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oohw3s/what_am_i_missing_it_seems_the_way_defi_is/,TRADING,"I'm not trying to be a doomer or just spread FUD, but I've been doing a lot of research on DeFi recently and don't really see any other way to interpret this.  I know I'm not the first to notice how fucked the current situation seems. As far as I can tell, the DeFi ecosystem has built itself into a giant house of cards, propped up by hopes &amp; dreams at this point.

Getting a picture of the entirety of DeFi is kind of complicated (I definitely don't understand it all), but for the sake of this post, DeFi i'm referring to is the series of applications developed to enable various ""decentralized"" financial functions on the blockchain.  

The 2 most popular functions being Crytpo Lending/Borrowing and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

Crypto holders are incentivized to participate in DeFi as a means of ""Yield Farming"". Basically, parking crypto assets into a liquidity pool so it can earn interest and fees, paid out in the form of an app-specific token.  Sometimes the annual interest returns are huge.

Cypto borrowers get a great deal through these apps too. Put up some coins as collateral, and in return you get instant access to liquidity. No credit checks, no applications... all automated. 

There is a lot of opaqueness in the DeFi market and like I said, I don't fully understand it all. What I understand for sure is:

1. DeFi depends on a consistent stream of incoming liquidity
2. DeFi also depends on the volume of transactions on the network (to collect fees)
3. The price stability of tokens on DeFi apps rely on arbitrage traders (a lot of this in the form of bots)
4. People who get into DeFi projects early see much higher returns. As returns drop, they move their liquidity elsewhere.

All fine in a controlled environment. But here's where I see it going all wrong.   
As the crypto market heated up in 2020, money began flooding into DeFi applications.  Since DeFi allows traders to leverage their assets to make bigger transactions...this in turn helped prop up the entire crypto market with a surge of new liquidity.  After all, all of those tokens previously sitting idle in people's wallets were now being put to work. 

The amount of value just locked into DeFi is now astronomical, currently somewhere over $66 Billion (down from a peak of almost $100 billion).  

But as the DeFi world started to heat up, more and more dApps came into the fold promising increasing interest and rewards. Interest rates in these pools are almost always higher when the coin or token supply is low and demand is high....as more people rush to participate, the yield returns typically drop.  

So we saw Yield Farmers getting increasingly sophisticated. To maximize rewards, many lenders would run their tokens between different pools chasing the highest returns. 

Yield farmers also would then re-invest the tokens received from one liquidity pool, into separate liquidity pools on other dApps for THAT token.  Creating complicated daisy chains of returns. 

To stretch things even thinner...many yield farmers would use their yields as collateral to BORROW more assets, then invest those in liquidity pools, to further increase their returns.

The economics behind this are pretty mind-numbing. Its akin to the mortgage backed securities situation in 2008. Basically....tons of collateralized ""junk"" assets are being traded, all based off a pool of inherently risky &amp; volatile crypto assets.  Remember, the market for these tokens only exists on DeFi.

Honestly its hard to wrap my head around. But I do know all of it depends on new liquidity and volume coming into the systems, and the value of the underlying tokens remains stable or growing.

So the big glaring question is....what the heck happens when the liquidity dries up or the value of the tokens drop off a cliff?

We've already seen multiple times how a dApp can have a meltdown.

* In Mar 2020, we saw the MakerDAO liquidity crisis . Basically, ETH price dropped...people rushed to  stablecoin DAI, and the app also triggered automatic liquidations (which malfunctioned). This caused a huge shortage of DAI on the system, and people to lose out big time.  [https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos)
* Later in Sept. 2020 we saw the SushiSwap rug pull. Long story short...a billion dollars flooded into SushiSwap DEX...then the developer pulls out all of his liquidity suddenly. The underlying token value plummeted...but so did the price of Etherium (by 30%+), and subsequently bitcoin. 
* Then last month we saw the IRON/TITAN ""bank run"".... investors tried to redeem their stablecoins and sell the asset, leading to a massive selloff that tanked the token price to $0 [https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem](https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem)

So we already know potential consequences that can happen.   
 **1) bank runs on DeFi tokens are possible.**   
 **2)  A sharp drop in the value of any of the assets in a liquidity pool can lead to mass liquidations,**  
**3) When the value of DeFi tokens plummet suddenly, it takes the ""mainstream"" crypto market down with it**  
**4) All of this also has the potential to unpeg stablecoins**

As far as I can tell, all it would take is for the underlying crypto asset price of Etherium or Bitcoin to crash low enough to trigger mass liquidations. Suddenly, you're left with a huge flight of liquidity, and tons of ""empty"" token pairs. As traders rush to get their tokens exchanged for ""safer"" assets, the liquidity pools are drained, and gas prices skyrocket. These combined effects could in-turn shut down the entire arbitrage and liquidation markets...all resulting in complete price instability. 

It would cause a catastrophic ripple effect throughout the entire market.  Once all of that leveraged lending goes away, and thousands of coins are unlocked/ sold onto the open market, it will be apocalyptic for crypto prices.  

Whether individual projects are ""good"" and some are ""bad"", doesn't really matter in this case. They've pretty much all been linked together in some way. If the biggest domino falls at the top, the rest come with it. 

Tbh, its kind of horrifying. 

**TL;DR:** The current DeFi ecosystem seems like the 2008 mortgage crisis, Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, and Amway all rolled into one...and its going to collapse when the price of Bitcoin / Etherium drop too low. Only this time, there's not going to be a bailout. Am I reading into this wrong?"

After passing the audit of CertiK, a well-known audit institution, the BakerDAO yield farming and borrow protocol, which is a decentralized stablecoin protocol on BSC, was successfully launched at 19:00 on June 19, 2021. Under the adverse situation of the downward market, the TVL is up to US $30 million, and the system has been running healthily and stably. It is reported that the net income of MakerDAO, the Ethereum decentralized stablecoin project, was $9.37 million USD in June, and the stablecoin issued exceeded $5 billion USD. Relying on the efficient, low gas cost and innovative economic model of the BSC chain, BakerDAO has huge market potential. BakerDAO's first yield farming has officially ended at 23:00, July 20, 2021, Beijing time. The price of BKR exceeded $4.6 within 12 hours after the end, an increase of 72%. Next, let's take a look at the final data of BakerDAO's first yield farming and borrow.

# BKR Yield Farming Data

BKR yield farming has been concerned by all parties since its launch, and has become a new star of DeFi project. Until 23:00 on July 20, various data is as follows:

• Current TVL：1,659,908 USD

• Highest TVL: 28,729,921 USD

• BKR holders：7,628 addresses

• Rewarded BKR Number: 79,695

OMNIA R1 Presale for this low market cap gem ends on the 28th July (gas been extended🥳)💎 

Here’s the TLDR for you guys🔌🔋

You can tokenise your house and sell 49% while still retaining majority ownership! This allows for liquidity from traditional illiquid assets (you could own 10% of a Picasso, Ford Mustang or even a part of the London Shard. 

Who can benefit from Omnia DeFi?

Millennials who are struggling to get on the property ladder 

People in the developing world who are land rich but lack the cash to invest in themselves!

Middle class who own illiquid assets and are cash strapped!

The tokenised land which will be registered on the blockchain will be laying down the foundations of web 3 infrastructure (This is the modern day equivalent of building Airports, highways or railroads!)

An In-Depth Guide to DAI Stablecoin**  **| Shrimpy Academy**](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-makerdao-mkr-an-in-depth-guide-to-dai-stablecoin)

MakerDAO is a borrowings, savings, and stablecoin (DAI) protocol based on the Ethereum network that captures the DeFi market."
BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V0.8 (Draft),https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/opyvy8/bakerdao_system_upgrade_scheme_v08_draft/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-07-23 17:31:07,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/opyvy8/bakerdao_system_upgrade_scheme_v08_draft/,,"Based on Ethereum's MakerDAO, BakerDAO has optimized the economic model, hoping to generate another decentralized stablecoin in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and realize billions of U.S. dollars in BAI circulation, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in annual income and billions of U.S. dollars in market value. At the initiation phase, in order to realize the decentralization of BKR, BakerDAO launched liquidity mining since June 19th, 2021, and BAI price fluctuated less than 1 U.S. dollar the next day. After that, all liquidity mining activities related to BAI limited partner (LP) were immediately suspended to prevent speculation for BAI arbitrage. Later, the market was tumbling, which caused three problems in the system, namely, collateral liquidation, instability of BAI, and BKR price decline. These problems during the execution of the project should be tackled by innovative solutions. This project mainly aims to stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar, and more ecologies could support the application of BAI. The problems and solutions are elaborated as follows.

1. Collateral liquidation 

a) Liquidation at low price 

In the BakerDAO system, auction mechanism is adopted for liquidation, with no restriction on the lowest bid. Hence, when there are a small number of people involved in liquidation, some of them can liquidate the holder's treasury assets at a very low price, resulting in the system deficit. Obviously, the system will make up the deficit through profit later. At present, BakerDAO has a debt of 73,453 BAI, which exerts little impact on the stability of the system, but more loopholes may be appear in the future, so this problem should be urgently solved.

b) Arbitrage leads to liquidation and BAI price decline 

The large market fluctuation causes that the price of collaterals in some vaults may be lower than that of BAI obtained. Consequently, holders would better sell BAI to retain their incomes, which will result in BAI price decline, insufficient collateral value and system deficit.

2. BAI instability 

BAI adopts the mechanism of soft anchoring to the U.S. dollars. In the Borrow system, BAI is considered to be 1 U.S. dollar at any time. Holders can lend and return their loaned BAI at 1 U.S. dollar and participate in liquidation, regardless of the price of BAI in the external market. This mechanism is extremely crucial, which can guarantee the stability of BAI to a great extent, but still cannot effectively avoid fluctuations.

When liquidity mining began, the selling climax of BAI led to BAI price decline. We suspended the liquidity mining of BAI LP in time, which eased the situation and gave some compensation.

Later, we performed two governances and raised the stable fee rate, but only obtained non-ideal outcomes under the stimulus of the high yield of liquidity mining. The price of BAI still fluctuates between 0.6 and 0.9, so this problem always exists, which should be urgently solved.

3. BKR price decline 

Since BakerDAO launched online lending and liquidity mining *via* CertiK auditing, the total value locked (TVL) has topped over 30 million U.S. dollars, BKR price has topped over 600 U.S. dollars, and the number of token-holding addresses has exceeded 7,000. However, BKR price declined in a spiral way, from nearly 700 U.S. dollars to less than 4 U.S. dollars under the influence of the broad environment, which exerted a great effect on the belief of BakerDAO community. This is absolutely a common problem in all liquidity mining projects. Later, our team anatomized the causes of the decline, and introduced the Stepped Rate Scheme for Single-Currency Liquidity Mining to limit the mining, withdrawal and selling of single-currency mining users, which was also strongly supported by the community. We hope that everyone can hold BKR for a long time along with the long-run development of the community and team, which is in line with the purpose of the liquidity mining, that is, liquidity mining enables more people to hold BKR and contributes to the development of BakerDAO. The introduction of the scheme made BKR price tend to be stable and avoided a large-scale decline, but it still did not bring much demand and failed to make BKR price rise sharply.

After discovering the above problems, our team began to study and discuss solutions, and some holders in the community also gave very good suggestions. So far, we have worked out solutions to the above three problems, which are divided into the following five parts: liquidation module optimization, liquidation pool, BAI stabilization system, BKR pledge pool and BAI repurchase system.

1. Liquidation module optimization 

At first, we will optimize the liquidation module and improve some parameters and restrictions in liquidation, so as to solve the above problems in the liquidation process and enable the community to share the liquidation income: 

►BUSD mortgage rate adjustment: 101% mortgage rate means that the upper limit of BAI price is expected to be 1.01 U.S. dollars, and it tends to result in surrender of pledge of assets to trigger the short-selling of BAI;

► Adjustment of stable fee rate in time: Raising the stable fee rate will reduce the supply of BAI, which is conducive to the upvaluation of BAI. After the value of BAI stabilizes at 1 U.S. dollar, the stable fee rate will be reduced to increase the supply of BAI and lower the price expectation of BAI; 

► Collateral adjustment for obtaining the upper limit of BAI: control the amount of BAI that collaterals can produce, and control the supply of BAI to regulate its price; Increase restrictions to liquidation price, and do not allow ultra-low price liquidation;

► Increase restrictions to liquidation participants, only allow fixed addresses to participate in liquidation, and withdraw the liquidation right;

► Liquidation income sharing: The liquidation income will be distributed to the liquidation pool (which will be explained in detail later) and the project team at the ratio of 7: 3; 

► Shorten liquidation cycle and improve liquidation efficiency. 

2. BAI liquidation pool 

The BAI liquidation pool system is designed to encourage more holders to mortgage to generate BAI, keep the stability of BAI and reflect the value of BAI, which allows holders to mortgage BAI to obtain liquidation income: 

► Holders deposit BAI into the liquidation pool, share the system liquidation income and participate in liquidity mining; 

► The system withdraws the liquidation right through the above-mentioned fixed addresses, and the liquidation pool shares 70% of the liquidation income according to the different proportion of BAI deposited; 

► The liquidation pool will be rewarded with the governance token BKR. 

3. BAI stabilization system 

The BAI stabilization system, also known as BAI hard anchoring system, is designed for holders to arbitrage to keep BAI anchored to 1 U.S. dollar when it deviates from this price, so as to ensure the stability of BAI. Similar to the stable currency exchange, this system adopts a lower slippage and a smoother curve to enable everyone to trade BAI and other assets. 

► Liquidity providers provide stable assets such as BUSD and BAI as trading pairs; 

► Arbitrators can carry out arbitrage when the price of BAI deviates from 1 U.S. dollar;

► Liquidity providers can be rewarded with handling fees and BKR. 

4.BKR pledge pool 

The BKR pledge pool system is designed to better reflect the value of BKR, make more community holders willing to hold BKR for a long time and stimulate the development of BakerDAO, which allows BKR holders to share the system income: 

► Holders pledge BKR to the pledge pool, and obtain different quantities of locked BKR (LBKR) based on the different locking time; 

► LBKR can be used by holders to vote for governance, but it cannot be used for trading; 

► Holders share the system stability fee, handling fee and other incomes according to the holding quantity of LBKR. 

5.BAI repurchase system 

If the original mechanism of the system and the above-mentioned BAI stabilization system do not play up to expectations, and BAI still seriously deviates from 1 U.S. dollar, the BAI repurchase system will repurchase BAI using BKR by bidding. 

► BAI holders deposit BAI into the repurchase module and choose an appropriate bid; 

► Part of BKR used for ecological rewards is deposited into the repurchase module; 

► The repurchase module will repurchase BAI using BKR according to the bid of holders; 

► The repurchased BAI will be locked for a period of time, and will continue to be used to support ecological projects after the price of BAI is stable.

The above-mentioned solutions are designed for liquidation, BAI instability and BKR instability under the new market environment, which show great achievements in innovation relative to the original system. In the future, the economic model will be updated and the implementation details of each optimization will be released. This draft is not the final version, and we will seek for opinions of the community within three days, and release and implement the final draft next week with consideration of all suggestions. In the processes of design and implementation, we will communicate with the community in time to solve the problems found, and finally we will stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar. The community will definitely witness the prosperity of BAI ecology in the BSC. In years to come, we will head towards the prosperity of BAI ecology on multiple chains through multi-chain deployment."

Thoughts on stablecoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqzqyx/thoughts_on_stablecoins/,sickvisionz,1,2021-07-25 06:37:23,12,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oqzqyx/thoughts_on_stablecoins/,FINANCE,"**TLDR: There are no good stablecoins that fit in with the** ***ethos*** **of crypto. For now, you have to pick your poison.**

Just some thoughts I've had about the current state of stablecoins.

* **Tether** isn't mystery money but it's shockingly little cash (although that's less cash a gov could shutdown via calling a bank) and financial products that definitely aren't going to be liquid during a non-crypto financial crash.
* **USDC**... Tether got a super F.  Like they got a 30 on the test.  They'd still get an F even if you graded on a 25 point curve.  They knew nothing about the material.  USDC is like a 60.  In some schools, Fs are 59 and lower so technically this *could* be a passing grade somewhere.
* **DAI**... a crypto backed stablecoin, operated by a DAO. This is seemingly the best crypto stable asset.  It's so crypto... then you read it's 60% USDC.  If you wanted all the cons of USDC and thought *let's really spice things up by throwing in some smart contract risk*...
* **BUSD**... 96% backed by actual money in a bank.  Nice.  That also means it's easy as hell for a government to shut them down given that it's just money in a regulated bank account. Not to mention that the regulators of Earth have seemingly teamed up and decided *hey you know what... f\*\*\* Binance*.
* **GUSD**... another centralized coin except they've coded the ability to censor addresses into the damn smart contract.  This is like the test case for the *digital yuan* and a company telling regulators and the government *we're the best... we already added all the features and backdoors you'd need to censor coin holders.*  
  
I could go on longer but why bother?  Most of the rest are just *we're backed 75% by USDC and our shitcoin* or amazingly decentralized/censorship resistant and were dollar pegged and trading at $0.86 three days ago.  We're still very early in the crypto game and there is no *crypto ethos* stable coin as far as I can tell that's:

1. Actually stable (lives between $0.99 and $1.01 most of the time)
2. Backed by the peg
3. Decentralized
4. Censorship resistant

&amp;#x200B;

From what I can tell...

1. If you want **stability** then you're in luck because there's a decent amount of them. That's actually not difficult. If that's all you care about and nothing else, you've got plenty of good options.
2. If you want a **collateralized by the peg** token then you're in luck.  You get the bonus of the more it fits this criteria, the more likely it is to also have **stability*****.***  However, the very nature of holding cash (in a regulated, not anonymous bank account) makes getting this feature *and* decentralization or censorship resistance incredibly difficult. They might actually be diametrically opposed ideas unless you want the organization storing cash in some unregulated way.
3. If you want **decentralization**, you're screwed. Those tokens exists but they fail miserably at maintaining their peg which makes them interesting tech ideas but not actually usable as a stablecoin.  Or they're just pulling a MakerDAO: you're decentralized but the primary thing you use to collateralize the coin and the primary asset that keeps it stable is a 100% centralized, 0% censorship resistant token. If regulators squeeze them, you're squeezed by default. 
4. **Censorship resistance** just doesn't exist to me. Not that it can't exist but we just don't have one yet. Stable coins are financial products that directly compete with cash payment systems and yield bearing products. Finance will come around to crypto but the banking industry could literally be destroyed. Literally.  You are not censorship resistant when massive chunks of your collateral and the primary item that keeps your token stable is held by and regulated by titans of said industry you will destroy and you have to go to them to access your funds.

Anyways, that's that. Just my thoughts. Almost a rant but less angry sounding (hopefully). I'd be curious to know what you all think."

One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. 

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great research paper.

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021."

Credits to u/Layneeeee 
For putting up the original post

I tried summing up the top 50 coins in 1 or 2 sentences. It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&amp;#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web."

# 3.BakerDAO Ecological Progress

BakerDAO ecology is continuing to advance, and cooperation is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

**About BakerDAO:** 

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."
Being Able to Take a Loan Using BTC as Collateral Is Incredibly Undervalued And One Reason I'm Even More Bullish. Here's Why,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/os0mb0/being_able_to_take_a_loan_using_btc_as_collateral/,wmredditor,1,2021-07-26 23:07:46,11,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/os0mb0/being_able_to_take_a_loan_using_btc_as_collateral/,TRADING,"Which of your investment assets can you borrow up to 50% of its value without aggressive paperwork and waiting several days? This property of Bitcoin is still incredibly undervalued and in my honest opinion has contributed significantly to the bullish move we have had in the past year or so.

If you own a piece of real estate and need cash, you need to go through a lot of paperwork to secure any loan on top of it. Even though this may be considerably higher than what you get in BTC, the process is very rigorous and not as easy as doing it the BTC way.

If you own stocks, treasury bills, bonds, index funds, etc, getting a loan on them is even more difficult.

But if you own BTC or ETH, there are many platforms, both in **CeFi and DeFi** that would let you take a loan against it, up to 50% of the amount deposited.

Here are some I've come across:

&amp;#x200B;

* Compound
* MakerDAO
* Nexo
* BlockFi, 
* Celsius, etc.

This essentially removes some selling pressure on these assets as individuals can take on low-interest loans that could be covered by a future price appreciation for the value of their crypto. I for one have been less hesitant to sell BTC, and would rather take a small loan against it in extreme cases.

I understand that there are third-party risks and the job of maintaining a healthy Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio by not overborrowing. However, you can't get this stuff this easy with real estate or other investment assets but you can easily do it with Bitcoin. 

I guess the more the broader investment world understands this possibility, the more likely it is that they allocate a portion of idle funds to crypto to unlock some liquidity.

It also gives HODLers an even greater incentive to HODL and never to sell at the wrong price!"

I feel like an updated version is long due and so here we are.

As usual, if something is wrong or you would like to make a correction, feel free to comment. It's obviously hard to sum up each project in a few words, but I tried my best.

Terms used:

* If I refer to layer-2 solutions, that means a protocol or framework built on top of an existing blockchain and trying to increase transaction speed or scaling.
* [PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work): Proof of Work
* [PoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake): Proof of Stake

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkador (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't. 
27. **Aave (AAVE):** a lending-borrowing decentralized protocol on Ethereum (and Polygon), the AAVE token grants discounted fees on the platform and act as a governance token.
28. **TERRA (LUNA):** Terra is a blockchain protocol offering a variety of applications, from stablecoins to synthetic assets and stocks. LUNA is the native token used to stabilize the price of UST (the TERRA stablecoin) and peg it to the dollar, and can be used to pay fees on the network.
29. **EOS (EOS):** another PoS blockchain launched in 2018, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It is designed to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology. 
30. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the native token of the Crypto.com chain and the Crypto.com exchange. Similar to the BNB token, it is closely tied to the success of the exchange.
31. **AMP (AMP):** it's an Ethereum token and it's used as collateral on the Flexa network, covering any financial transactions that fail if the need arises.
32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.

 From how to buy it and how it works to smart contracts and ETH2, a complete beginner's guide to the second-biggest cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

 *Ethereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. It is also a decentralized computing platform that can run a wide variety of applications — including the entire universe of DeFi.* 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Ethereum, which launched in 2015, is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. But unlike Bitcoin, it wasn’t created to be digital money. Instead, Ethereum’s founders set out to build a new kind of global, decentralized computing platform that takes the security and openness of blockchains and extends those attributes to a vast range of applications.  

Everything from financial tools and games to complex databases are already running on the Ethereum blockchain. And its future potential is only limited by developers’ imaginations. As the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation puts it: “Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.”

* You can check the latest prices on Coinbase's Ethereum asset page.
* Ethereum has become **a popular investment vehicle and store of wealth** (and can be used, like Bitcoin, to send or receive value without an intermediary).
* **The Ethereum blockchain allows developers to build and run a huge variety of applications**: everything from games and advanced databases to complex decentralized financial instruments — meaning that they don’t require a bank or any other institution in the middle. 
* **Ethereum-based apps are built using “smart contracts.”** Smart contracts, like regular paper contracts, establish the terms of an arrangement between parties. But unlike an old-fashioned contract, smart contracts automatically execute when the terms are met without the need for either participating party to know who is on the other side of the deal — and without the need for any kind of intermediary. 
* **Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is an open source project that is not owned or operated by a single individual.** Anyone with an internet connection can run an Ethereum node or interact with the network.
* Much like Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain allows any two strangers, anywhere in the world, to send or receive money without a bank in the middle, **smart contracts running on Ethereum’s decentralized blockchain allow developers to build complex applications that should run exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference**. 

Popular Ethereum-based innovations include **stablecoins** (like DAI, which has its value pegged to the dollar by smart contract), **decentralized finance apps** (collectively known as DeFi), and **other decentralized apps** (or Dapps).

&amp;#x200B;

 **What’s the difference between Ethereum, Ether, and ETH?** 

 *Ethereum is the name of the network. “Ether” is the native cryptocurrency token used by the Ethereum network. That said, in day-to-day usage most people call the token “ETH” (or just “Ethereum”). As a way of sending, receiving, or storing value ETH works much like Bitcoin. But it also has a special role on Ethereum network. Because users pay fees in ETH to execute smart contracts, you can think of it as the fuel that keeps the whole thing running (which is why those fees are called “gas”).*

 *If Bitcoin is “digital gold,” ETH can be seen as “digital oil.”*

&amp;#x200B;

 **Is Ethereum secure?**

 *ETH is currently secured by the Ethereum blockchain in much the same way Bitcoin is secured by its blockchain. A huge amount of computing power — contributed by all the computers on the network — verifies and secures every transaction, making it virtually impossible for any third party to interfere.* 

 *The fundamental ideas behind cryptocurrencies help make them safe: the systems are permissionless and the core software is open-source, meaning countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the networks and their security.* 

*Apps running on the Ethereum blockchain, however, are only guaranteed to be as secure as their developers have made them. For example, code can sometimes contain bugs that could result in loss of funds. While their source code is also visible to all, the user bases of each individual app are much smaller than Ethereum’s as a whole, and so fewer eyes are on them. It’s important to do research on any decentralized app you plan to use.* 

*The Ethereum protocol is currently being updated in ways that are intended to make it faster and even more secure. See the Ethereum 2.0 section below for more.*

 

## How does Ethereum work?

 

*You might have heard that the Bitcoin blockchain is a lot like a bank’s ledger, or even a checkbook. It’s a running tally of every transaction made on the network going back to the very beginning — and all the computers on the network contribute their computing power towards the work of ensuring that the tally is accurate and secure.* 

*The Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, is more like a computer: while it also does the work of documenting and securing transactions, it’s much more flexible than the Bitcoin blockchain. Developers can use the Ethereum blockchain to build a huge variety of tools — everything from logistics management software to games to the entire universe of DeFi applications (which span lending, borrowing, trading, and more).*

* *Ethereum uses a 'virtual machine' to achieve all this, which is like a giant, global computer made up of many individual computers running the Ethereum software. Keeping all of those computers running involves investment in both hardware and electricity by participants. To cover those costs, the network uses its own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency called Ether (or, more commonly, ETH).*
* *ETH keeps the whole thing running. You interact with the Ethereum network by using ETH to pay the network to execute smart contracts. As a result, the fees paid in ETH are called “gas.”*
* *Gas rates vary depending on how busy the network is. A new version of the Ethereum blockchain called Ethereum 2.0, which aims to increase efficiency, began rolling out in December 2020. (The transition to the new blockchain is scheduled to happen over the next two years.)*

 

## What is Ethereum 2.0?

 

Ethereum 2.0 (often referred to as ETH2) is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network. It’s designed to allow the Ethereum network to grow while increasing security, speed, and efficiency. 

As of early 2021, Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum 1.0 exist side by side — but the original blockchain will eventually merge with ETH2 blockchain. (If you’re an ETH holder you won’t have to do anything — your holdings on the ETH 1.0 blockchain will automatically migrate to the ETH2 blockchain.) The transition to ETH2 began in December of 2020, and is scheduled to take two years.

**Why is Ethereum 2.0 necessary?** Moving a popular cryptoasset to a new platform is a complex endeavor, but for Ethereum to scale and evolve, it needs to happen. That’s because the “Proof of Work” method used by the ETH 1.0 blockchain to verify transactions causes bottlenecks, increases fees, and consumes substantial resources (particularly electricity).

**What is Proof of Work?**  How do cryptocurrency networks make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or Paypal in the middle? They use a consensus mechanism. When ETH 1.0 launched, it adopted the consensus mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin: the aptly named Proof of Work. 

* Proof of Work requires a huge amount of processing power, which is contributed by virtual “miners” around the world who compete to be the first to solve a time-consuming math puzzle. 
* The winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions, and is rewarded with a predetermined amount of ETH.  
* This process happens every 30 seconds (compared to Bitcoin’s approximately 10-minute cadence). As traffic on the network has increased, the limitations of Proof of Work have caused bottlenecks during which fees spike unpredictably.

 

## What is staking?

 

Ethereum’s founders were aware of Proof of Work’s limitations. So a very different solution was devised for Ethereum 2.0. — one that will ultimately allow the network to efficiently process thousands of Ethereum transactions a second.

**Ethereum 2.0 uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake**, which is faster, less resource-intensive, and (at least theoretically) more secure. The end result is similar to Proof of Work’s, in that a network participant is chosen to verify the latest transactions, update the blockchain, and earn some ETH. 

* Rather than requiring a network of miners racing to solve a puzzle, **Proof of Stake requires a robust network of participants** who are literally invested in the success of the enterprise.
* These stakeholders are called **validators**. Instead of contributing processing power as miners do, validators contribute ETH to a “staking pool.” 
* The act of contributing ETH to the pool is called **staking**. If you choose to stake some of your ETH, you will earn rewards in proportion to the size of your stake. For most users, staking will function much like an interest-bearing savings account. 
*  The network selects a winner based on the amount of ETH each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there — literally **rewarding the most invested participants**. 
* Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of these attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. 
* All participating validators receive a **reward** in ETH, which is distributed by the network in proportion to each validator’s stake. 

**Staking is open to anyone who is interested** (and coming soon to Coinbase).

 

**Smart contracts 101**

*Smart contracts* *were first* *proposed* *in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo.* ***Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine.*** *Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.*

&amp;#x200B;

 

## A brief history of Ethereum

 

**2013** 

* A 19-year-old computer programmer (and *Bitcoin Magazine* cofounder) named Vitalik Buterin releases a whitepaper proposing a highly flexible blockchain that could support virtually any kind of transaction.

 **2014** 

* The Toronto-based teenager, along with a team of cofounders including Gavin Wood, crowdfunds the development of the Ethereum protocol with the sale of $18 million in pre-launch tokens.

**2015** 

* The first public version of the Ethereum blockchain launches in July. Smart contract functionality begins to roll out on the Ethereum blockchain.

**2016** 

* Hackers steal around $50 million from a smart-contract-powered venture fund called the DAO (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization) by exploiting a software bug. 
* In a divisive vote, Ethereum’s community chooses to revise the protocol in a way that would restore the lost funds. This results in the Ethereum blockchain branching off (via a hard fork) into two separate blockchains, each with its own active community: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

**2017** 

* The ERC-20 standard is created, making it easier for developers to build compatible applications. ERC-20 defines a way to create an asset (or token) on top of the Ethereum blockchain. 
* The first widely popular Ethereum-based app arrives in the form of a game called CryptoKitties, in which users collect and trade digital cats. It becomes a genuine craze; at the peak, rare digital cats sell for upwards of $200,000. 
* The nonprofit Ethereum Enterprise Alliance launches to develop practical applications for smart contract technology. Members include JP Morgan, Samsung, Microsoft, and Mastercard. 
* MakerDAO — the first Decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain — launches. Maker also introduces the first ETH-based stablecoin, DAI.
* ETH breaks $100 USD for the first time.

**2018**

* DeFi, which aims to transform the financial-services industry by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure, gains momentum with the arrival of lending protocol Compound and decentralized exchange Uniswap. 
* The USDC stablecoin is launched. Backed by the CENTRE Consortium, a partnership between Coinbase and Circle, it reaches $1 billion in issued coins in the first year.  
* ETH breaks $1,000 USD for the first time in January, before falling back under $100.

**2020** 

* The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade begins in December. The complete transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 is scheduled to take around two years to complete.
* As part of Ethereum 2.0’s first phase, Proof of Stake is introduced. ETH 1.0 continues to use Proof of Work as its consensus mechanism.

**2021**

* ETH hits new all-time high above $4,200
* See the current price at coinmarketcap.

 

## How do you buy Ethereum?

 

However you acquire your ETH, you’ll need to understand a few basic concepts. Every address on the Ethereum network is issued a public key and a private key, and you’ll need a wallet to manage your crypto holdings.  

* **Public key**: Think of this as the crypto version of an email address. Your Ethereum public key is where people can send you ETH and Ethereum-based tokens like USDC and Dai. You can safely give this out to others.
* **Private key**: Think of this like your password. You should generally avoid giving this out to people. A private key is a long string of letters and numbers. (It can also be in the form of a series of words called a seed phrase.) It’s crucial to keep track of your private keys. If you lose them, you lose your Ether forever. 
* **Wallet**: To store and secure your Ether you’ll need a wallet. If you’re just starting out, the easiest option is to make an account via the Coinbase app or coinbase.com — in which case you’ll interact with a “custodial wallet” that stores and secures your private keys for you. As you progress you might want to investigate other wallet options that are built for interacting with decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols such as Compound (a lending and savings app) or Uniswap (a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies).

 

## How does Ethereum have value?

 

There are a few ways of thinking about the answer to this question. On one level, Ethereum’s value is set by markets like any other asset. People buy it with Bitcoin, dollars, euros, yen, and other currencies 24 hours a day. Depending on demand, the price can fluctuate from day to day. (Ethereum’s value tends to be volatile compared to currencies such as the US dollar or equities like Fortune 500 stocks because it is still an emerging technology.)

But *why* the market prices it the way it does is a much more complicated question. To many investors Ethereum’s value is based on its flexibility as a platform for issuing stablecoins and running DeFi applications — resulting in a growing user base and growing transaction fees. 

## What’s next for Ethereum?

As of early 2021, Ethereum is host to the vast majority of blockchain applications and has a market cap of just under $200 billion, with over $55 billion locked into tokens on the blockchain. Popular stablecoins such as USDC and USDT mostly live on Ethereum today due to its network effects.

But a variety of new smart contract blockchains are beginning to compete in the space. So while Ethereum is the dominant market leader today, there is growing pressure for it to successfully execute the transition to Ethereum 2.0.

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS**How do they differ from their competitors?**

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 Their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

**OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that**

• Making high value assets such as real estate easily accessible &amp; investable, thus lowering the entry point for wealth creation

Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked

Costly &amp; lengthy property sales

Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

Liquidity for the middle classAbundance of opportunities for all

**Here’s how it works:**

• **$500M** worth of fine art &amp; real estate committed to Omnia DeFi with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022 
• 3 Token Ecosystem  (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin) Unique business model ( Recursive structure)   
• 10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go) 
• Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until just recently, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan.

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

•  Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium 

• Coinsniper &amp; Coinlisting traction!$**OMNIA’s 3 tiered ecosystem explained:**

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale (exchange and utility token)OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS**How do they differ from their competitors?**

Omnia Defi are not only focused on the technical layer like many projects or even just on the securities layer like many other DeFi projects, instead they go deeper and look to index all real world assets and make them tradable on our platform.
Think Google but they index asset tied data, give it a rating and turn it into an NFT. That NFT is fractionalised into 100 OATs (Omnia Asset Tokens) and 49% sold to the token buyers and 51% locked up for the asset owner. The OATs can then also sit as a pool to support the creation of our stable coin called OSC (Omnia Stable Coin).

**The first round of pre sale is about to end!!! Price will go from $1.50 per token to $3.43 in the second round!**

Make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem:

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• On MATIC chain✅

• Great Website

• Real asset oracle🚀

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded.

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 Their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that!

《BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0》is Officially Released,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/oujonx/bakerdao_system_upgrade_scheme_v10is_officially/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-07-30 20:30:59,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/oujonx/bakerdao_system_upgrade_scheme_v10is_officially/,,"  

**Introduction**

BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V0.8 (Draft)  
 （https://docs.bakerfi.com/bakerdao/blog/blog-8）since we sought for opinions to community, the draft has been widely discussed and recognized. In consideration of the opinions, we have released the official version and started to develop and launch it step by step. BakerDAO is an upgraded version of MakerDAO, which innovatively optimizes the original problems of MakerDAO and will definitely surpass MakerDAO to become a decentralized stablecoin giant.

**Glossary**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/04bpm8u9gce71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=079c8c6ec3f27dae7d9d24d780c3ea4e2a09a0c8

  

**Problems**

Based on Ethereum's MakerDAO, BakerDAO has optimized the economic model, hoping to generate another decentralized stablecoin in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and realize billions of U.S. dollars in BAI circulation, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in annual income and billions of U.S. dollars in market value. At the initiation phase, in order to realize the decentralization of BKR, BakerDAO launched liquidity mining since June 19th, 2021, and BAI price fluctuated less than 1 U.S. dollar the next day. After that, all liquidity mining activities related to BAI limited partner (LP) were immediately suspended to prevent speculation for BAI arbitrage. Later, the market was tumbling, which caused three problems in the system, namely, collateral liquidation, instability of BAI, and BKR price decline. These problems during the execution of the project should be tackled by innovative solutions. This project mainly aims to stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar, and more ecologies could support the application of BAI. The problems and solutions are elaborated as follows.

**1. Collateral liquidation** 

**a) Liquidation at low price** 

In the BakerDAO system, auction mechanism is adopted for liquidation, with no restriction on the lowest bid. Hence, when there are a small number of people involved in liquidation, some of them can liquidate the holder's treasury assets at a very low price, resulting in the system deficit. Obviously, the system will make up the deficit through profit later. At present, BakerDAO has a debt of 73,453 BAI, which exerts little impact on the stability of the system, but more loopholes may be appear in the future, so this problem should be urgently solved.

**b) Arbitrage leads to liquidation and BAI price decline** 

The large market fluctuation causes that the price of collaterals in some vaults may be lower than that of BAI obtained. Consequently, holders would better sell BAI to retain their incomes, which will result in BAI price decline, insufficient collateral value and system deficit.

**2.** **BAI instability** 

BAI adopts the mechanism of soft anchoring to the U.S. dollars. In the Borrow system, BAI is considered to be 1 U.S. dollar at any time. Holders can lend and return their loaned BAI at 1 U.S. dollar and participate in liquidation, regardless of the price of BAI in the external market. This mechanism is extremely crucial, which can guarantee the stability of BAI to a great extent, but still cannot effectively avoid fluctuations.

When liquidity mining began, the selling climax of BAI led to BAI price decline. We suspended the liquidity mining of BAI LP in time, which eased the situation and gave some compensation.

Later, we performed two governances and raised the stable fee rate, but only obtained non-ideal outcomes under the stimulus of the high yield of liquidity mining. The price of BAI still fluctuates between 0.6 and 0.9, so this problem always exists, which should be urgently solved.

**3.** **BKR price decline** 

Since BakerDAO launched online lending and liquidity mining *via* CertiK auditing, the total value locked (TVL) has topped over 30 million U.S. dollars, BKR price has topped over 600 U.S. dollars, and the number of token-holding addresses has exceeded 7,000. However, BKR price declined in a spiral way, from nearly 700 U.S. dollars to less than 4 U.S. dollars under the influence of the broad environment, which exerted a great effect on the belief of BakerDAO community. This is absolutely a common problem in all liquidity mining projects. Later, our team anatomized the causes of the decline, and introduced the Stepped Rate Scheme for Single-Currency Liquidity Mining to limit the mining, withdrawal and selling of single-currency mining users, which was also strongly supported by the community. We hope that everyone can hold BKR for a long time along with the long-run development of the community and team, which is in line with the purpose of the liquidity mining, that is, liquidity mining enables more people to hold BKR and contributes to the development of BakerDAO. The introduction of the scheme made BKR price tend to be stable and avoided a large-scale decline, but it still did not bring much demand and failed to make BKR price rise sharply.

**Solutions**

After discovering the above problems, our team began to study and discuss solutions, and some holders in the community also gave very good suggestions. So far, we have worked out solutions to the above three problems, which are divided into the following five parts: liquidation module optimization, liquidation pool, BAI stabilization system, BKR pledge pool and BAI repurchase system.

**1. Liquidation module optimization** 

At first, we will optimize the liquidation module and improve some parameters and restrictions in liquidation, so as to solve the above problems in the liquidation process and enable the community to share the liquidation income: 

►BUSD mortgage rate adjustment: 101% mortgage rate means that the upper limit of BAI price is expected to be 1.01 U.S. dollars, and it tends to result in surrender of pledge of assets to trigger the short-selling of BAI;

► Adjustment of stable fee rate in time: Raising the stable fee rate will reduce the supply of BAI, which is conducive to the upvaluation of BAI. After the value of BAI stabilizes at 1 U.S. dollar, the stable fee rate will be reduced to increase the supply of BAI and lower the price expectation of BAI; 

► Collateral adjustment for obtaining the upper limit of BAI: control the amount of BAI that collaterals can produce, and control the supply of BAI to regulate its price; Increase restrictions to liquidation price, and do not allow ultra-low price liquidation;

► Increase restrictions to liquidation participants, only allow liquidation pool (which will be explained in detail later) to participate in liquidation, and withdraw the liquidation right;

► Liquidation income sharing: The liquidation income will be distributed to the liquidation pool (which will be explained in detail later) and the project team at the ratio of 7: 3; 

► Shorten liquidation cycle and improve liquidation efficiency. 

**2. BAI liquidation pool**  

The BAI liquidation pool system is designed to encourage more holders to mortgage to generate BAI, keep the stability of BAI and reflect the value of BAI, which allows holders to mortgage BAI to obtain liquidation income: 

► Holders deposit BAI into the liquidation pool, share the system liquidation income and participate in liquidity mining; 

► The system withdraws the liquidation right through the above-mentioned fixed addresses, and the liquidation pool shares 70% of the liquidation income according to the different proportion of BAI deposited; 

►  The liquidation pool will be rewarded with the governance token BKR. 

**3. BAI stabilization system** 

The BAI stabilization system, also known as BAI hard anchoring system, is designed for holders to arbitrage to keep BAI anchored to 1 U.S. dollar when it deviates from this price, so as to ensure the stability of BAI. Similar to the stable currency exchange, this system adopts a lower slippage and a smoother curve to enable everyone to trade BAI and other assets. 

►  Liquidity providers provide stable assets such as BUSD and BAI as trading pairs; 

► Arbitrators can carry out arbitrage when the price of BAI deviates from 1 U.S. dollar;

► Liquidity providers can be rewarded with handling fees and BKR. 

**4.BAI repurchase pool**

If the original mechanism of the system and the above-mentioned BAI stabilization pool do not play up to expectations, and BAI still seriously deviates from 1 U.S. dollar, the BAI repurchase pool will repurchase BAI using BKR by bidding. 

► BAI holders deposit BAI into the repurchase pool and choose an appropriate bid; 

► Part of BKR used for ecological rewards is deposited into the repurchase pool; 

► The repurchase module will repurchase BAI using BKR according to the bid of holders; 

► The repurchased BAI will be locked for a period of time, and will continue to be used to support ecological projects after the price of BAI is stable.

**5. Open vault** 

An open vault refers to a redeemable vault. Any holders can redeem the equivalent collateral in the vault with BAI (the price of BAI is fixed at 1 U.S. dollar) by paying handling fees.

Holders can choose whether the vault is open when creating it;

Collaterals in the open vault will be uniformly distributed to the open vault pool;

The open vault possesses the same characteristics as the original vault, and the owner of the vault can freely mortgage and return BAI;

When holders use BAI to exchange collaterals, they return an equal proportion of BAI to all open vaults and deduct the corresponding collaterals, thus obtaining the share of the handling fee.

**7. Liquidity pool**

A liquidity scheme will be launched to regulate the liquidity of BKR and BAI and allow holders to trade them outside the system.

l Use system incomes and part of BKR to provide liquidity for related transaction pairs in DEX such as Pancakeswap;

l Put BAI and other stablecoins into decentralized stablecoin exchanges to provide liquidity and help stabilize the price of BAI to 1 U.S. dollar.

**8. Repurchase pool**

System incomes will be used to repurchase and destroy BKR, so as to reduce the circulation of BKR and maximize the interests of BKR holders.

**9. Aggregation platform**

Due to the high complexity of the system involving multiple related subsystems, an aggregation platform will be designed to allow holders to achieve one-click operation and maximize the incomes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

The above-mentioned solutions are designed for liquidation, BAI instability and BKR instability under the new market environment, which show great achievements in innovation relative to the original system. In the future, the economic model will be updated and the implementation details of each optimization will be released. This draft is not the final version, and we will seek for opinions of the community within three days, and release and implement the final draft next week with consideration of all suggestions. In the processes of design and implementation, we will communicate with the community in time to solve the problems found, and finally we will stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar. The community will definitely witness the prosperity of BAI ecology in the BSC. In years to come, we will head towards the prosperity of BAI ecology on multiple chains through multi-chain deployment."
Why Yieldly and other Farm/Governance tokens have value,https://www.reddit.com/r/yieldly/comments/ovj8a9/why_yieldly_and_other_farmgovernance_tokens_have/,Brawlstar-Terminator,1,2021-08-01 09:32:41,18,/r/yieldly/comments/ovj8a9/why_yieldly_and_other_farmgovernance_tokens_have/,,"I've noticed this question pop up a few times in this sub and I thought writing a post on it would be helpful to others. When I first started learning about DEFI, I was stumped on this question too. Obligatory statement that none of this is financial advice, this is purely for educational reasons. The smarter people are with their money and learn more about DEFI, the ecosystem benefits as a whole. Alright lets get into it:

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT ARE FARM/GOVERNACE TOKENS?**

Farm tokens are tokens paid out to users who provide liquidity for a protocol. They incentivize users to give their funds to the DEX/AMM/DAO because they can receive these tokens as reward. They take on the risk of impermenant loss or smart contract failures to receive the rewards of the farm token and any fees that the liquidity pool pair generates. 

Governance tokens are farm tokens that allow the holders to make decentralized changes to the protocol through voting (much like Algorand). They are farm tokens with the extra utility of being able to vote. 

If you notice, YLDY right now functions solely as a farming token. It has no other utility aside from receiving it as a reward for providing liquidity in ALGO and YLDY. There are future plans to make YLDY a governance token, so it will accrue even more value once we can use them to vote.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is fine and dandy, but why do people pay so much for these tokens? What do they do? Why do they have value? Why does this protocol even need a token?

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY FARM/GOVERNANCE TOKENS HAVE VALUE**

1. **Bootstrap Growth of the Protocol:** Tokens create interest for the protocol via airdrops and liquidity mining incentives. Remember how much buzz there was for yieldly because of the July 4th token airdrop? It serves as a form of marketing and a way of distributing the token to reward early users. Uniswap's famous airdrop is worth about $3000 right now. It also allows the protocol to incentivize users and promote growth. In the future, Yieldly could partner with AlgoMint and have liquidity mining rewards where they pay out a higher percentage of YLDY to users who deposit gBTC or gETH. This would make more users bridge their BTC and ETH via Algomint and give them growth and promotion as well. 
2. **Aligns Incentives Between Users and Protocol:** Protocols need governance tokens to incentivize early users. The more people use yieldly, the more value the token will accrue because people will speculate on the future functionality of the token. Uniswap holders speculate it will soon function like Sushiswap tokens, and allow holders to receive 0.05% of all trading fees on the platform. It also rewards the early users who took on the most risk because they were the first to use the protocol and provide feedback. Right now, Yieldly doesn't have much. Imagine in 5 years when the UI is updated and you can swap ALGO&lt;-&gt;YLDY instantly with low fees. It's the hub of blockchain interoperability with ETH, BNB, DOT users bridging their funds through YLDY to move cross-chain. Early users had to suffer through all the growing pains (remember week 4 rewards) and must be rewarded for that.
3. **Incentivizes the developers to keep working on the project:** The token serves as an incentive for the team to continue working on the protocol and make it as good as it can be. The better the Dapp becomes and the more users and liquidity it has, the more value the developers tokens are worth. The Yieldly team can also sell off a percentage of their tokens to hire more developers, raise money for certain projects or attract talented developers who want to work on the biggest protocols in an ecosystem.
4. **Protects the Protocol through Network Effects:** Governance tokens naturally create network affects that act as each protocols competitive moat. 99% of applications on Ethereum are open source. This means that anyone can copy the code, creating a fork of the Dapp. If projects can be forked(essentially making the same application) why does the original have a premium? The original protocol ALWAYS has the strongest network effects. The holders of the token are incentivized to use and maintain the value of the network. This is why although Sushiswap is arguably better than Uniswap(because Sushi lets you stake for 0.05% of all fees), Uniswap still has a higher marketcap and more users because of its first mover advantage.
5. **You need the Farm token to provide liquidity with it in a LP:** Farm tokens are higher risk, as part of their value is derived from the success of the network. Since they are higher risk, they pay out higher rewards when you provide liquidity with them. This is why staking YLDY offers you 50% APY compared to the 10% APY of depositing ALGO. For users who want to participate in the higher risk/reward pool, they have to buy the farm token.

&amp;#x200B;

**Importance of Governance**

Governance is very important utility for a token and hopefully the Yieldly team implements this soon. These are the biggest changes to Ethereum protocols that were done through governance that impacted the price of the token:

1. **Token Buybacks:** MakerDao and Vesper voted on a change where the protocol uses its treasury to buyback tokens in the market. This reduces the supply in the market, thus raising the price of the token. They can then chose to burn these tokens or redistribute them to holders.
2. **Revenue Distribution:** We discussed this one earlier, but we saw these changes in Sushiswap and Ren. To incentivize people to run nodes on Ren, holders voted to allow node runners to receive a percentage of the total fees whenever someone uses the Ren virtual machine. With Sushiswap, you can stake your sushi tokens to earn xsushi, which you can stake to earn .05% of the liquidity reserve.
3. **Deploying LP's/minting synthetic assets:** Uniswap and Synthetix hold governance votes before adding assets to their respective protocols. Uniswap votes before adding or removing certain liquidity pairs. For synthetix, they manually approve through governance which synthetic stock or index that will be issued on their protocol. This helps keep the protocol relatively safe, and makes it easier for retail investors to swap the right tokens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Protocols can also use tokens to affect user behaviour. On Bancor(a DEX), the longer you provide liquidity in a pool the higher percentage of fees you earn. This incentivizes user to keep their liquidity in the pool for as long as possible, so they can earn higher rewards. AAVE does this through increasing/decreasing interest rates on certain assets. If AAVE is running low on USDT, and there are more borrowers than lenders, AAVE will temporarily increase the APY on USDT to make more users deposit USDT onto the protocol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have only been in DEFI for about 6 months, so if anyone needs to correct me I will make changes. DEFI is high risk, but higher rewards. We are betting on the Yieldly team to add utility to the token, so it won't go to zero. If they deliver, this speculation can turn into tangible rewards. Many degenerate Yield farms see their farm tokens go to zero. This is because there is no other utility with the token aside from farming with it to earn more of the token. Yieldly currently functions as speculative token that might trend to zero like 90% of farms on Ethereum/Polygon. If the utility is added, then it will be worth substantially more than it is now. These are the risks we take as DEFI and Yield farmers.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people saying what will the price be in 1-2 years. The truth is, no one knows. But we can do our research and speculate with as much information as we can. Keep in mind bear markets are harsh in crypto, and most altcoins see significant losses. Yieldly is a 4-5 year hold for me. When the next bear market comes, I will just DCA and HODL. No one knows what will happen in the next couple years, but you have to take a longer term objective approach to investing.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Farming and governance tokens incentivize users to add liquidity by paying users in their token. People who receive these tokens are more aligned with the protocol, and are more likely to use the network over other alternatives. Governance allows these tokens to make changes that impact the utility and tokenomics of the token, letting it accrue even more value."

BakerDAO ecology is continuing to advance, and cooperation is welcome.

**About BakerDAO:** 

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."
"How does liquidation works? I am confused, could some1 explain?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/owbd02/how_does_liquidation_works_i_am_confused_could/,zdragonmaidenz,1,2021-08-02 17:54:27,16,/r/MakerDAO/comments/owbd02/how_does_liquidation_works_i_am_confused_could/,,"I deposit 10 ETH into the vault (worth $100,000). 

I took out a DAI loan of say maybe $30,000

Suppose ETH crashed and hit whatever liquidation threshold,

Liquidators would bid for my ETH and they would purchase my ETH in the collateral and pay using DAI 

So my ETH disappears to the buyer and MakerDAO receives some DAI which is then immediately burned 

What happens to the 30k DAI that I am currently holding?

It does not match up since the buyer has repaid my loans by buying my collaterals

But I still have 30,000 DAI?"

# B.Protocol

&gt;B.Protocol is a Backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi lending platforms, currently integrated on top of MakerDAO and Compound. Users of B.Protocol give priority to the Backstop liquidators in the liquidation process, and the liquidators in return share the liquidation profits with the users. B.Protocol is fully decentralized and is governed by $BPRO holders. 

Website: [https://bprotocol.org](https://bprotocol.org)

# RAI protocol

&gt;RAI is a non-pegged stable asset and automated credit facility which recently implemented self-repaying loans. RAI can only be borrowed against ETH. 

Website: [https://reflexer.finance](https://reflexer.finance/)

# Going forward

The following announcement was made on Discord about the road ahead:

&gt; **RAI and B.Protocol snapshots have passed and will be integrated into the DeFi Smart Layer!**  
&gt;  
&gt;In the next few days the team will enable the RAI and B.Protocol Connectors enabling their use throughout the DeFi Smart Layer.  
&gt;  
&gt;**When will we see RAI and B.Protocol on the main interface?**   
There is no time horizon for these integrations on the main interface. You an access and test out their operations on Instadapp Terminal.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the next few weeks we will release Instadapp Assembly our new open source dashboard, where we can start creating some use cases and build interfacing for these connectors. We will encourage both the teams, the newly created **#🛠-assembly** guild and community members to begin building out strategies for these connectors."

Delegation is live in MakerDAO!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ox27xn/delegation_is_live_in_makerdao/,LongForWisdom,1,2021-08-03 20:15:13,29,/r/MakerDAO/comments/ox27xn/delegation_is_live_in_makerdao/,,"Delegation has now been launched for the Maker Protocol. If you hold MKR and haven't been voting in the past, please give serious consideration to delegating your MKR to one or more of Maker's Recognised Delegates.

**Ineffective or participation-starved governance will kill the Maker Protocol over the long-term just as surely as governance attacks will in the short term.**

If you are holding capital in the MKR Token you should seriously consider delegating responsibly. The safest and lowest-effort way of doing this is to split your MKR across the Recognised Delegates. Alternatively, taking a little more time and determining which delegate you prefer is also advisable.  

**Here are a couple of highlights:**

* Each Recognised Delegate has a public profile that describes their values and plans for the Maker Protocol.
* You can split your MKR across different delegates.
* Delegation contracts expire after one year, so plan to check in on occasion. 
* You can also delegate to one of the Shadow Delegates, but this is more risky and there are less guarantees as to delegate consistency and performance. 

**Here are some recommended considerations (taken from the MKR Holder's Guide to Delegation.)**

* **Trust**  
Delegation is an expression of trust of the MKR Holder in the delegate.
* **Incentives**  
Examine your delegate’s incentives, these are not solely monetary, these are not always permanent.
* **Recognition**  
Recognised Delegates are safer than Shadow Delegates (but not by much).
* **Balance**  
Be aware of the checks on power among delegates and Core Units. Having only a few large delegates is a risk. Delegation to Core Unit personnel is not advised by GovAlpha.
* **Cost-Benefit**  
Responsible Voting &gt; Responsible Delegation &gt; Apathy &gt; Irresponsible Voting &gt; Irresponsible Delegation. Responsible delegation is much, much cheaper than responsible voting and almost as good

**And here are several resources:**

* [The Recognised Delegates Code of Conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384) \- The Recognised Delegates are required to meet these criteria. 
* [The Token Holder's Delegation Agreement](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/token-holders-delegation-agreement/9385) \- Describes the holder-delegate relationship from the PoV of the Holder.
* [The MKR Holders Guide to Delegation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mkr-holder-s-guide-to-delegation/9602) \- Describes the risks and considerations that should be understood by MKR Holders prior to delegating their MKR.

Let us be clear, there is no stable coin backed 1:1 with USD, including the often suggested USDC.

If you are looking for a new stable coin to keep your money in during dips or to earn interest on, look no further than DAI :DAI:

* DAI is the only coin issued by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (MakerDAO), making it the only truly decentralized stable coin.
* DAI is backed by a variety of Crypto Assets and is algorithmically programmed to balance assets, collateral, interest rates and circulator supply to maintain price stability.
* DAI is the Stable Coin of the xDAI Chain.  xDAI is a SideChain of the Ethereum network that offers fast speeds and low transaction fees for popular projects and dAPPs like Gnosis, HoneySwap, SushiSwap, Agave and many others.  **xDAI is also the initial chain of xMOONs** (now porting to Arbitrum), meaning they were one of the first Cryptos/Chains/Organizations to support our r/CryptoCurrency community.
* DAI is available on most popular exchanges, and has liquidity pools and yield farming across most of the popular DeFi platforms.
* As of this post, USDC has Blacklisted 8 addressed, and USDT has Blacklisted over 400.  DAI has blacklisted 0 addresses, making it the least censorship-prone Stable Coin of the bunch.

If you want a Stable Coin that stays true to the purpose of CryptoCurrency (Decentralized Money), yet is still widely available and usable across the multitude of CryptoCurrency platforms and ecosystems, DAI is the clear-cut choice.

A new solution I just found about is called Neon EVM, which has nothing to do with Neon, the blockchain formerly known as Antshares.  Strategic on their part? Maybe. Confusing and annoying for us? Yes!

This Neon EVM thing is just a smart contract on the Solana blockchain, without the need of a parachain to run the evm interpreter. Its right on the order book, so it has the fastest finality because it can interpret EVM code in * parallel * whereas normal eth evm code is sequential, meaning much higher throughput is possible with Neon. 

If im understanding this correctly, anyone can use this without having to port your whole dapp to Rust.  Its on the Solana testnet right now and will support big projects like Uniswap, Sushiswap, MakerDAO and 0x at launch this quarter, said Cointelegraph.

I was one of only 445 people watched their AMA, meaning most people are sleeping on this thing. (Its on Youtube)

This feels like the start of something bigger, because even if ETH2 was finished tomorrow this thing has the fee and speed advantage. Where's the catch?

Curious if anyone else knows about it and can explain the drawbacks like centralization.  The only one I can think of is the low number of validators Solana has as you gotta have bank to even spin one up, but 850+ validators is still pretty decent for a mainnet that went live a year ago,and has the blessing of Alameda Research's infinite cashola and other top VCs.

BACKGROUND 

The current infrastructure for the information of the internet is one of convenience and relatively good reliability. It’s designed and does have a very good capability of sending and receiving data. However, this convenience is outweighed by the the reliance of centralisation. Our data that we send back and forth are controlled by centralised servers or group of servers. This issue here is the representation of value as the data can be altered, duplicated or completely removed. Therefore, puts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data at risk. 

We know that blockchain technology aims to tackle these problems through decentralisation, the cryptography and consensus that secures the blockchain which allows data to be secured and unaltered, this removes that single point of failure through the current system of centralisation. 

Smart contracts takes blockchain technology a step further by allowing the ability to securely have ownership of an asset of value. This value could be in the form of currencies or a digital representation of important documents, voting and much more, this concept allows ownership to be truly verified and tracked knowing it’s unique and unaltered. So let’s dig deeper into what smart contracts actually are. 

WHAT IS A SMART CONTRACT 

In simple terms, a smart contract is a digital representation of a real world contract. The contract is determined by a pre-existing set of rules and conditions. Smart contracts allows the ability to complete complexed transactions in an automated and decentralised manner. The word smart contract was initially created by Nick Szabo ([brief bio](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/nick-szabo)

A simple example would be if I was selling a house. I would need the ability to store the deed to my house and I would need a way for an individual to buy it and transfer the price for it. In the traditional world this can take ages due to the reliance of third party entities involved and can cost more through unnecessary fees and the outcome can vary greatly due to unknown variables. However, the smart contract in this concept would accept the deed, allow someone to purchase it and once purchased would transfer the deed from the smart contract to the recipients account. Then it would release all the funds was the deed is sold to my account all in an automated, speedier, deterministic and decentralised process. These types of advanced transactions go beyond just simple P2P transactions and require complex data structures within the code such as loops and more. In the case of Ethereum the smart contract orientated programming language is called Solidity and is where many of our favourite and popular Dapps started. Alternative use cases for smart contracts can be event based insurance, IOT, funding, lending and so much more. Smart contracts also have the ability to call other smart contracts which creates a convenient and simplified system. Therefore, contracts are the fundamental building blocks of decentralised applications and have the ability to remove third party entities through an automated process. 

HOW DO THEY WORK 

Smart contracts are stored within the blockchain, therefore are both immutable and distributed. Immutable meaning once it’s created and deployed it cannot be changed and distributed due to the fact the smart contract output is verified through the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. The only issue in terms of trust would be from external sources such as real world data which is minimised by the reliance on oracle networking to provide reliable and correct data. The smart contract is written in a programming language specified by the blockchain it’s on (as mentioned, Solidity for Ethereum). Depending on the use case of the smart contract, variables and conditions will be written into the program. Some examples of smart contract which are used continuously is defi such as the creation of algorithmic stablecoins, smart contracts for providing liquidity or crowdfunding that will only unlock funds once conditions are met and can be verified by anyone. 

Smart contracts essentially allow a permissionless, decentralised and more powerful way of conducting business in various sectors and in the future will have a limitless amount of use cases. 

SMART CONTRACT RISKS 

The most obvious and most common risk that plagues any form of source code is coding flaws and bugs. This can lead to a compromised smart contracts being used for malicious purposes. Probably the most notable smart contract exploit was the DAO hack [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-dao-hack). This emphasises the importance of why all code including smart contracts must go through a thorough and rigorous integrity audits and through a verification process. 

Alternative issues could be from blockchain upgrades that may lead to unforeseen behaviour or oracle services being unable to interpret real world data.

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.

&gt;This could be an indication of where DeFi is headed."

BakerDAO is an upgrade MakerDAO protocol on Binance Smart Chain(BSC). It is a multi-collateral stablecoin borrow system on BSC, which allow users to generate decentralized stablecoin BAI by leveraging collateral assets like BNB, BUSD, ETH, BTC and so on. Excess collateral, self-balance system, liquidators and other ecosystem participants ensure that 1 BAI is soft-pegged to 1 USD. BKR is the decentralized governance token of BakerDAO, and its holders can use it to initiate proposals and vote to govern the major events or decide development directions for BakerDAO."

For comparison's sake, last month, on this day, (July 11th), we had a price of .05425; and it felt like we fluctuated between the fives forEEEEVEEEEEER; and then, a few more days after forEEEEEVEEEEER, when we moved to .06? The world joined us to .09.  
Two months ago, on this day, June 11th, we had a price of .0618, and we were skyrocketing up towards our ath of .12X. Many of you were not here back then. Once the world saw us past .07, they joined us.   
I invite folks to reshape their thinking.   
(This is not financial advice) It takes us very little momentum, to get the world to look at us. We're so small in our price. That if we go up even one cent, we become a top mover with potential to gain 10more in an hours or less time.   
I invite folks to reshape their thinking; and see .06 as our default.   
If we ever, god forbid, fall to .03;  
know; the core base here; us 26.4k reddit potential holders of around 34.5k total potential hodl holders. (not financial advice) can try bringing it back up to .06. and if it ever goes past .07? wherever our new floor becomes after the world spins our fate's wheel.   
Find comfort in these days.   
Find comfort eating 6s in the morning.  
6s at noon.  
6s in the evening.  
Find comfort knowing, once upon a time, just a month ago; we were eating nothing but 5s for what felt like weeks. just stacking. and then? just like that? our whole floor raised a level.  
Find comfort knowing, once upon a time, just two months ago; we were just trying to beat our previous all time high of .07x. and when we finally went from .03 to .07; the world took us to a new high of .12x.   
.07, the world looks at us.  
.06, we eat dip &amp; stake baby. 

There's a new Cryptocurrency Exchange opening up in India called CoinDCX. i invite my fellow Ampians sometime today to tweet at them or message them and invite them to adopt AMP as a crypto on their opening year.   
A potential billion indians seeing AMP as a potential buy might be pretty tight. 

For Today, i offer everyone, what news AMP (and AMP related) has been found within, over the month of August. Ill do this again when we hit another major milestone, \[this one in particular because we hit 34,500+) for those that like to read about AMP related news. one after the other after the other. (Some of it will look like its talking about SHIB, but those are mainly amazon related news articles that talked about both SHIB and AMP). If you have news sources you like to get your AMP Related News from anywhere; feel free letting me know!  


I love hearing where people learn about their crypto and am always down for new friends, pardon my slow replies tho; i just use reddit for my version of fun &lt;3

Dear SubDAO community,

The SubDAO official team is glad to see there are so many participants in our “Do Your Own DAO” event. All participants have shown a rich knowledge about the DAO and submitted a good answer on our test. Here is the answer to the doubt when you answer our question. Search for the correct answer right now!

#### 1. How to define DAO from the perspective of sociology？ 

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization whose essential operations are automated, agreeing to rules and principles assigned in code without human involvement. 

A DAO is a novel, scalable, self-organizing coordination on the blockchain, controlled by smart contracts”. In short, a DAO can be defined as people with common goals that join under a blockchain infrastructure that enforces a set of shared rules. DAO activity is recorded in the blockchain and, as a result, implies a cost. Validating and confirming transactions on the Ethereum blockchain requires a certain amount of work, called gas (paid in crypto-currency). This work is performed by blockchain miners in order to include transactions in a block. Gas ultimately translates into money and the amount of gas depends on the size and type of each transaction. As a result, it is expected that DAO activity is conditioned by this since users are required to pay small amounts of cryptocurrency if they want their operation to be executed. 

We can consider two kinds of DAOs, those built from scratch, and those created from a template provided by a DAO platform, i.e. DAOs as a service. In the first type, the members are usually developers who have specialized knowledge to create and manage them. Both types are described below. DAO is not only a sociological concept, but also a paradigm of organizational relations, even becoming a buzzword when breaking the circle in the encrypted world. Bitcoin itself can be understood as the earliest DAO. 

After 12 years of growth, DAO, like all collaborations, will produce the division of labor and development of participants, and it is necessary to follow the context of DAO to look at its future.

#### 2. What is the roadmap of DAO development? 

The development of DAO and the development of the crypto market are following each other. In the pre-Ethereum era, DAO is embodied as Bitcoin’s on-chain consensus and community governance. With the diversification of the underlying public chain, here is the first differentiation of DAO implementation methods. 

The formulaic negotiation model of off-chain proposals represented by BIP provides continuous support for network upgrades, but there are still disputes over development efficiency and on-chain execution. Some communities believe that more events should occur on the chain, and Decred has appeared. And Tezos and other chains automatically execute the upgraded governance logic. 

In Dash, DashDAO, a node specifically responsible for governance, was created. After Ethereum went online, there was a watershed event “The DAO”, the earliest financing DAO project, which culminated in the successful raising of US$150 million and ended with the theft of funds. Although the project fell quickly, the model of “creative projects obtained financing from the community, DAO token holders and future benefits” remained and became the basic logic of the current popular venture DAO. 

Moloch, the prototype of the financing DAO, inherits this logic in its concise functional design. The development decisions of the underlying technology may be more concentrated among crypto enthusiasts and geeks, and the scope of participation in governance cannot be expanded, so governance can only be the self-entertainment of a few people. Encrypted users start to participate in governance extensively and personally, often starting from the application layer. 

MakerDAO is not only the originator of DeFi but also the beginning of the practicality of DAO. This kind of application layer protocol directly facing end-users makes people truly feel the rights they enjoy as currency holders. Before DeFi formed a prairie fire in 2019, due to the relatively concentrated economic distribution of tokens for most projects, and the limited capital and user scale, voting governance had not yet become a normal operation for crypto players. And some visionary practitioners recognize that DAO, as the prerequisite for the organization of the crypto world, is an essential requirement for any community-based organization. 

The DAO service platform represented by Aragon (2016) and DAOstack (2018) has provided DAO tools for thousands of community projects and has deposited hundreds of millions of dollars in governance. According to incomplete statistics, the number of DAO participants has exceeded 60,000 addresses, which has increased more than 60 times from 10,000 at the beginning of last year.

With the rapid development of the scale of the encryption industry and the refinement of services, DAO is also evolving rapidly. While Ehereum’s ecosystem of competitors is developing rapidly, its organizational paradigm is also seeking innovation. Polkadot adopts the mode of the timely upgrade of on-chain governance at the protocol layer, and the multi-chain architecture also provides new development soil for DAO. 

Different from Etetherem’s “strong application and weak protocol” status, rising stars like Polkadot rely on powerful tool support to provide a silky development experience for the project to help the application to be implemented at a low cost and efficiency. In this environment, a strong infrastructure is a necessary guarantee for latecomer advantages. 

DAO is an essential component, and the value of its service platform is particularly precious. SubDAO came into being. It helps the Polkadot ecological project to create and manage DAO agilely and can become a solid middle platform for the entire ecosystem, further realizing the value capture of DAO.

#### 3. What is the specific application utility of DAO?

According to actual use cases, it is more widely present in all projects. There are relatively few decentralized communities on similar platforms DAOstack and Colony. What is interesting is that dozens of forked communities have been generated based on Moloch, which is the most common DAO model in financing. 

According to the scene classification of the application layer, we discuss the mechanism of DAO in the following environment. 

**1)Financing scenario** 

Purpose: To create a decentralized incubator for funding investment or grants to provide support for project development

Moloch Dao, Duckdao, Marketing Dao, DAOSquare, DAOX, DEPO

**Extended application: Initial DAO Offering**

In 2019, developers in the Ethereum community forked code to modify smart contracts to develop more complex DAO. MetaCartel Ventures and Marketing DAO, for example, are able to distribute and transfer shares and other assets among members. Since then, the for-profit DAO MetaCartel Ventures, which focuses on early investments in Ethereum projects, has raised nearly $24 million from its 64 members. 

DAOs like DUCKDAO and DAO Maker also run token public offerings. DAO Maker has even been approved by regulators in Malta. The project uses chain address analysis to find historical transactions to identify potential applicants for long-term token holders and to develop them into valuable community members.

**2)DeFi scene**

In the governance of each project of the application layer based on its business model, governance content is different, more representative of the following scenarios:

**The DAO module in DeFi**

Primarily used to decide key parameters in DeFi’s business in a decentralized manner, starting with MakerDAO, governance to Uniswap has become a landmark transaction for chain activities and is widely marked as a criterion for project screening of qualified users (e.g. for airdrops)

**Cross-chain liquidity DAO**

Represented by BadgerDAO, BoringDAO, and LidoDAO, it is designed to address the centralization of assets across chains.

**3)NFT encryption art scene**

DAO project focusing on investment and ecological construction of encrypted artworks. With the NFT boom (or bubble) peaking, the DAO that surrounds the NFT has also attracted attention.

**4) Service aggregation scenario**

The increase in project demand for DAAs, which specialize in providing developers and projects with easy-to-use standardized modules for integrated DAAs, will become standard in any blockchain ecosystem.

#### 4. What kind of governance is decentralized?

Concepts of decentralization have changed rapidly over the past quarter of a century in tandem with the evolution in thinking about governance. Until the early 1980s government and the state were generally perceived interchangeably. The government was seen as the institutional embodiment of state sovereignty and as the dominant source of political and legal decision-making. 

The use of blockchain as an infrastructure for governance has confronted two points of view. The ones who have a high degree of techno-determinism, who embed the idea of “market” in the made decisions or the way that an organization has to operate, however, they tend to ignore the complexity of social organizations. On the other side, the critical ones defend the role of traditional central authorities. They consider central authorities necessary to enable democratic governance. 

These views usually advocate regulating blockchain markets in order to reinforce the role of the state. Moreover, governance under blockchain is challenging, since it is difficult to steer a decentralized community and promote its development without sacrificing decentralization. The tool that has emerged to enable organizations to operate in the blockchain is DAO.

#### 5. How do we achieve “autonomy” with DAO?

Autonomy is dedicated to dealing with quantifiable transactions in DAO governance, such as development tasks, design work, financial processing accounting work, and so on. These transactions can usually be designed in advance to automate procedures. A good way to do this is Bounty. Bounty’s biggest advantage is standardization. We just need to design a perfect Bounty mechanism to handle different types of work. Bounty’s most important thing is “quantification”. As long as sufficient quantification is achieved, many tasks and tasks of DAO do not need to rely on communication or even communication. Generally speaking, if your DAO is a non-minimum feasible DAO, such as a product development team, or a decentralized company, then autonomy will definitely account for most of the workload of DAO governance.

#### 6. The advantage of DAO should be to reduce the cost of communication between people through automatically executed code, but why does it seem that we did not reduce the cost of communication, but higher?

DAO technology could help improve the agency relationship, but also proposed the potential of blockchain technology as an emerging technology of governance design, in which many ideal models and theoretical evaluations were limited by the real world. First of all, the blockchain is a fundamental technology, and its transformative impact will take decades rather than years to establish and reform the system. In the corporate governance environment, the application of blockchain technology may develop in the existing centralized structure or decentralized environment. 

The former requires consensus on how and when to implement such technologies for governance use cases. For the latter, only when a true decentralized common blockchain emerges, with scalability and full security, can the proxy relationships be truly removed to overhaul them? With the complexity of the agency relationship, human behavior in the agency relationship needs a backstop, namely the continuous support of the human code. Without decentralized human support for code, the immutability of the blockchain and its cryptography security systems may not create true transactional guarantees and trust between principals and agents to maintain the integrity of their contractual relationships.

The blockchain-based corporate governance solution in DAO requires an incremental blockchain governance protocol. Thus, the socially optimal hard fork rule may not be applicable. Today, many companies are investing resources to develop and implement blockchain-based programs. In traditional contract governance, the effectiveness of contract management cooperation depends on the quality of the national legal system to a large extent. 

Conversely, DAO governance does not directly depend on the enforceability of external legal systems. Enforcement in a blockchain is achieved through prescribed code and algorithms, such as smart contracts. Even more, in governance, direct connections between collaborators are not required in a blockchain. Thus, blockchain may be considered the first form of governance that truly leverages digital technology’s computational- and data-based capabilities, well beyond traditional forms of social governance. DAO, like other governance mechanisms, does not govern all types of transactions equally well. DAO governance can reduce searching, monitoring, and enforcement costs but tends, but often means relatively high design costs.

#### 7. I want to use DAO to complete the development of a product, how do I manage the project? 

This is the aim SubDAO wants to realize. SubDAO is primarily a tool for creating and managing DAOs for DeFi and NFT applications, helping applications to create and manage DAOs more quickly. 

Today, the governance approach of DAO has evolved into the organizational framework of DeFi projects today. As we progress further, we expect more projects to use governance like DAO. There are now some DAOs on the blockchain, and most DAOs have their own governance scenarios and systems, such as MakerDAO, TheLAO, etc., that develop their own systems for governance. Other organizations have developed basic chains of DAO governance tools, such as Aragon. 

As more and more applications become available, we will find that the development of DAO governance tools is not convenient for every application, only those organizations with sufficient research and development strength or sufficient initial capital reserves can afford the cost of building a DAO, but it is impossible for small organizations or organizations without capital reserves of their own research and development governance tools. In addition, current application requirements have the common needs of DAO, such as voting and money management, as a combination of multiple forms of decision-making, automated implementation of governance behavior, community day-to-day governance communications, etc. These demands are difficult to meet, while only some systems have open interfaces to customize personalized needs, and high requirements for personalized technical are very common. These conditions are almost impossible to achieve for small and medium-sized organizations. 

Enriching and refining the DAO governance toolchain as much as possible is the foundation for the DAO’s sustainable development, and allowing users to participate in the governance and expansion of the DAO as easily as possible is the way to enable the DAO to present a variety of approaches. SubDAO was born for this purpose as Polkadot’s DAO infrastructure to provide all DAO users with the tools they need for governance, while SubDAO also owns cross-chain capabilities to enable multi-asset management, enabling DAO organizations to manage and precipitate funds to maximize returns.

#### 8. Is the DAO the final governance model? 

DAOs are particularly conditioned by the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain technology, which is decentralized and serverless, with immutable records, and where operations imply a cost. Furthermore, despite being in their infancy, these sociotechnical systems are already facing problems that may relate to those that affect other socio-technical systems and are already studied in the literature. 

Thus, we believe DAOs deserve interdisciplinary research attention to ascertain whether their problems are similar or not to those from other online and offline alternatives. Furthermore, to determine whether they provide an effective means for running a decentralized organization, or they only work under certain conditions, for example, when voters are known and the topics are limited in scope. 

* DAOs are no gatherings of smart contracts, but socio-technical ecosystems consisting of mutually dependent parties. Organizational processes are thereby increasingly ingrained and enacted on-chain, blurring the division between systems and organizations. 
* Even though motivated by strong enthusiasm, funds, and beliefs, DAOs face several inhibitors to decentralization and autonomy; it remains interesting, why these projects have not originated generativity, yet. One could argue that these DAOs may become the victims of their financial successes where, instead of experimenting freely on a large scale, legal issues or public feuds take center stage. 
* Human intervention in DAOs is being displaced, transformed, but not marginalized. Instead of achieving autonomy, our DAOs showed the reliance on several central actors acting as gatekeepers, administrate funds, or accumulating expertise, which reintroduces trust into a system, which was repeatedly considered trust-free. 
* Shortcomings of “Code is law” are met with “Code is Constitution”, where our studied DAOs show mechanisms to change fundamental processes when the need arises. As a consequence, blockchain’s immutability, one of its core characteristics, is questioned. 
* DAOs need to invest heavily up-front in governance structures, while their infrastructures find limited use, which draws similarities from studies on the Internet and their bootstrap problem. Without considering infrastructure in practice, these upfront costs pass unseen, while only promises of more efficient transactions through smart contracts are highly applied.

#### 9. How will DAO develop in the future? 

DAOs are coordinated by consensus mechanisms. Thus, DAOs are different from markets coordinated by the price mechanism, hierarchies coordinated by fiat, or networks coordinated by social relations. How should one make sense of DAOs? DAOs are not governed by principal-agent relationships, since they do not have shareholders or managers. Because they do not rely on fiat or hierarchies and operate transparently using public blockchains and open-source software, they are, to some extent, immune to the issues of opportunism and information asymmetry. And because they operate with little human coordination and do not incur costs for monitoring employees, they may behave in ways that traditional perspectives in organizational economics are ill-equipped to capture. 

In particular, the growth of DAOs is likely not bound by increases in the marginal cost of organizing (because DAOs are not hierarchies), and the cost of conducting additional transactions within DAOs can theoretically decrease with size owing to positive network externalities. Thus, at this stage, the scholarly community may lack the theoretical tools needed to understand either the growth of DAOs or, more generally speaking, what determines the boundaries of such organizations. The present study only begins to tackle this problem.

#### 10. Is DAO An Alternative to the Public Corporation? 

There are fewer than half as many public corporations today as there were fifteen years ago. The public corporation in the US is now unnecessary for production. Meanwhile, over the last few months, over 150 DAOs have gone public through initial coin offerings, a public sale through which the general public can acquire, early on, cryptocurrency tokens to support the development of the organization. While the number of public corporations is dwindling — there are 37 percent fewer today than there were in 1997 — DAOs are on the rise. 

Outside the payments sector, DAOs are providing new solutions for supply-chain management in the luxury goods industry, record-keeping in trade finance, trusted-identity provision in online environments, and patient-history management in the healthcare sector. What these industries have in common is that their business activities are prone to moral hazards and behavioral uncertainty. As a result, expensive intermediaries are heavily relied upon to provide trust to the interacting parties. Going forward, DAOs may be able to provide competitive alternatives for organizing in those sectors. 

More than 30 years ago, Rothschild and Whitt identified factors that should lead to the development of “collective organizations.” These included the demystification of knowledge, defined as the process whereby “formerly exclusive, obscure, or esoteric bodies of knowledge are simplified, explicated, and made available to the membership at large”. By publishing all software related to the blockchain, protocol, and peer-to-network in an open-source format, DAOs are well on track to achieve this demystification. 

At a theoretical level, the shift from the public corporation to the DAO may be a radical one, and this research represents a first attempt at exploring its implications from the viewpoint of organizational scholarship. The organizational and management scholars will pay attention to these developments that are currently changing the face of the heavily intermediated form of capitalism that has prevailed in our economies since the seventeenth century.

**About SubDAO**

### Problems

Based on Ethereum’s MakerDAO, BakerDAO has optimized the economic model, hoping to generate another decentralized stablecoin in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and realize billions of U.S. dollars in BAI circulation, hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in annual income and billions of U.S. dollars in market value. At the initiation phase, in order to realize the decentralization of BKR, BakerDAO launched liquidity mining since June 19th, 2021, and BAI price fluctuated less than 1 U.S. dollar the next day. After that, all liquidity mining activities related to BAI limited partner (LP) were immediately suspended to prevent speculation for BAI arbitrage. Later, the market was tumbling, which caused three problems in the system, namely, collateral liquidation, instability of BAI, and BKR price decline. These problems during the execution of the project should be tackled by innovative solutions. This project mainly aims to stabilize BAI at 1 U.S. dollar, and more ecologies could support the application of BAI. The problems and solutions are elaborated as follows.

### Launch plan and system design

To address the above problems, the team released the *BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0* last month and received widespread acclaim from the community. At the same time, the team conducted a preliminary feasibility analysis and demo. After thoughtful consideration and discussion, we decided to use three versions to launch the content of the upgrade scheme in stages. The detailed plan is as follows:

►V0.9: to be launched in September 2021, including liquidation module optimization, BAI liquidation pool, BAI stabilization pool, DAO pool, and liquidity mining; optimization and development of the next version will be carried out in Q4 2021;

►V1.0: to be launched in Q1 2022, including open Vault and repurchase program;

► Aggregation platform: to be launched in Q2 2022.

This document mainly provides a detailed description of the V0.9 version that will be launched in September 2021. The goal of V0.9 is to build BakerDAO from a simple stablecoin issuance protocol to a MakerDAO +Liquidity+ Curve complex to ensure the stability and liquidity of BAI and the stability of BKR, and to initially anchor BAI at USD 1. This will form the foundation to build a BAI ecosystem. After that, we will consider the deployment of multiple chains to realize a prosperous multi-chain BAI ecosystem.

#### 1. Liquidation module optimization

This version will optimize the clearing module, improve some parameters and restrictions in the clearing, to solve the problems in the previous clearing process, and let the community share the benefits:

a) Adjust the BUSD mortgage rate. The 101% mortgage rate means that the upper limit of the BAI price is expected to be $1.01, and it is easy to give up the mortgage assets and short BAI;

b) Increase the liquidation price limit, do not allow low-price liquidation, and ensure that the system has no deficit caused by liquidation;

c) Increase the restrictions on clearing participants, and only allow the clearing pool (explained in detail later) to participate in the clearing and withdraw the clearing right;

d) The liquidation income is shared, and the liquidation income will be distributed to the liquidation pool and the project team in a ratio of 7:3;

e) Shorten the clearing cycle to 2 minutes and improve the clearing efficiency;

f) Adjust the stable rate in a timely manner. Increasing the stable rate will reduce the supply of BAI, which will help the price of BAI. After the price of BAI stabilizes to $1, the stable rate will be reduced to increase the supply of BAI and lower the expected price of BAI;

g) Adjust the upper limit of the BAI obtained by the collateral, control the amount of BAI that the collateral can produce, and control the price of BAI by controlling the supply of BAI.

#### 2. BAI liquidation pool

The BAI liquidation pool system is designed to encourage more holders to mortgage to generate BAI, keep the stability of BAI and reflect the value of BAI, which allows holders to mortgage BAI to obtain liquidation income,and participate in BKR farming:

► Users uses the collateral to borrow BAI from the Borrow system;

► Users mortgages BAI to the liquidation pool, shares the system liquidation proceeds, and obtains LP: LBAI

► Users can pledge LBAI to the liquidity mining pool to receive LBKR rewards, and LBKR holders will share the DAO pool rewards.

► The system withdraws the liquidation right through the above-mentioned fixed addresses, and the liquidation pool shares 70% of the liquidation income according to the different proportion of BAI deposited;

► The rewarded LBKR can be unlocked after a period of time into BKR in the DAO pool, but the user will no longer receive the DAO pool rewards after unlocking.

#### 3. BAI stabilization pool

In order to improve the liquidity of BAI and ensure the stability of BAI, when the value of BAI deviates from 1 U.S. dollar, users can arbitrage to keep BAI anchored at 1 U.S. dollar. The BAI stable pool is specially designed, which can also be called BAI hard anchoring system. , This pool allows users to trade BAI and other stablecoin assets with a lower slippage and a smoother curve. The initial stablecoin support: BAI, BUSD, and USDT.

► The liquidity provider provides BAI, BUSD, USDT as pools, and obtains LP: SBAI;

► Liquidity providers can pledge SBAI to the liquidity mining pool to receive LBKR rewards, and LBKR holders will share the DAO pool rewards;

► Users can buy and sell BAI for arbitrage when the price of BAI deviates from $1

► Liquidity providers can get a 60% reward of transaction fees;

► The rewarded LBKR can be unlocked after a period of time into BKR in the DAO pool, but the user will no longer receive the DAO pool rewards after unlocking.

#### 6. DAO Pool

In order to better reflect the value of BKR, make more community users willing to hold BKR for a long time, and contribute to the development of BakerDAO, it is planned to share 40% of the system revenue with BKR holders, and the remaining system revenue will be used to maintain System stability, specially designed DAO pool, can also be called BKR pledge pool:

► The user locks BKR to the DAO pool, and obtains different amounts of locked BKR according to the lock duration: LBKR;

► The DAO pool will reward 40% of the system stability fee income according to the proportion of users holding LBKR;

► The LBKR rewarded by other pools is equivalent to the BKR that the user has locked in the DAO pool and is entitled to the same rewards;

► The LBKR can be unlocked after a period of time into BKR in the DAO pool, but the user will no longer receive the DAO pool rewards after unlocking.

To better understand the design logic of V0.9, see the following two diagrams:

An Unexpectedly Happy Ending To A Liquidated CDP: Both A Story &amp; Heads Up,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/p2uf5w/an_unexpectedly_happy_ending_to_a_liquidated_cdp/,KingKoopa7574,1,2021-08-12 14:43:16,27,/r/ethfinance/comments/p2uf5w/an_unexpectedly_happy_ending_to_a_liquidated_cdp/,Technology,"Hey Community,

I've been in the space since 2017. I have a degree in computer science and thought I reasonably understood Ethereum and the ecosystem but something that happened yesterday totally caught me off guard (in a happy way). I'm making this post for the benefit of anyone who is layman enough (like me) who might accidentally discover a windfall after reading this post.

Turn the clocks back to 2019. I was a cocky idiot who thought ETH is going nowhere but up. So I created a CDP, filled it up with cheap ETH. Expecting the price to rise, I drew more and more DAI from the CDP, used it to buy ETH and deposited the ETH back as collateral - only to draw more DAI, rinse and repeat.

You can see where this is going. After I accumulated a large chunk of ETH in the CDP as collateral, I got liquidated when ETH dropped like a brick. Disheartened, I swore to never play with CDPs ever again (I had had a CDP liquidated for the same reasons in 2018 as well). It was painful - all that ETH - gone. I'm not going to say how much, because of opsec.

Fast forward to yesterday. I still have a long term hold ETH stack, and because my fiancèe and I are looking to close a deal on our dream house. So I thought I'd open a CDP to borrow against my position (but this time with massive overcollateralization).

So I went to DefiSaver and connected my wallet again, ready to put in some collateral.

That's when I see a message on the dashboard:

*""You have unclaimed collateral. This has most likely happened due to your CDP being liquidated. Claim it to return it to your CDP.""*

Huh?

I clicked through to that message, and lo and behold:

A big chunk of ETH lying somewhere in there as ""unclaimed collateral"". Can't say how much again here, exactly, but it was the five figure range $USD wise. Hands shaking, mouth dry, can't believe it.

Paid a few bucks as transaction fees and boom, money put away comfortably toward our house.

What was so weird for me was that I couldn't see the ""unclaimed collateral"" anywhere. Not on Etherscan, not on Zerion, etc etc. It was literally invisible magic money.

Long story short - if you're a degen like me and have CDPs liquidated in the past - check Defisaver, specifically this URL:

[https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/manage](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/manage)

And hopefully you might find some ETH in there?

I've never won the lottery in my life, but this comes pretty close to what that must feel like.

Godspeed my friends. Let me know if any one uses this post to find any money tucked away they didn't know about."
DFC's vision for The Times: rebuild financial order,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DeFiCoin/comments/p2w3vl/dfcs_vision_for_the_times_rebuild_financial_order/,DeFiCoin,1,2021-08-12 17:05:38,0,/r/u_DeFiCoin/comments/p2w3vl/dfcs_vision_for_the_times_rebuild_financial_order/,,"As the US stock market triggered the financial crisis, the US began to take a series of measures to save the market during the epidemic, such as printing money, rising stock prices and opening closures.

Breaking traditional fund myths, DFC's imperial ambitions

DFC is a cross-chain decentralized financial platform created by the Tiffany Blockchain Foundation in Singapore. DFC is committed to solving the shortcomings of traditional finance, such as high cost, opaque information and complicated process, and providing users with a complete set of decentralized financial service system, such as decentralized transaction, lending and wealth management, cross-chain asset transaction and mining ecology.

&amp;#x200B;

DFC is about to restore financial order

Today we focus on DFC's Mining Ecology division, championed by Mr. Rajiv Kapoor, DFC's Chief Financial Officer. Rajiv Kapoor is from the United States with extensive influence in Europe, and has many years of experience in finance and trading with leading financial companies in the industry. He has also established four strong financial companies, how will he lead the DFC layout?

Rajiv Kapoor, chief financial adviser at DFC, was the first to come up with the idea of mining ecology. In his view, a mature economic model must have a variety of rewards. Just like playing a game and leveling up, the constant incentive for the user will continue to work. This is where DFC differs from general blockchain finance. Under the incentive system, DFC community will become an enthusiastic and active community, and users can show unprecedented vitality through mining ecology. This scene has also stimulated the development of the entire blockchain ecosystem. That's why Rajiv Kapoor created a mining ecology.

DFC lending acts like a mortgage in the traditional industry, except that cars and houses pledged to banks are exchanged for digital currency. The lender writes down the type and amount of its mortgage asset and chooses the amount it wants to lend, then creates a CDP, which is a written contract that specifies the type, amount and duration of the mortgage.

Rajiv Kapoor says mining ecology is an important part of DFC. In this area, users will get benefits that are usually hard to get. Mining ecology is also an important part of keeping DFC with active users. The introduction of a large amount of ecological flow will also gradually stabilize THE DFC project. By rewarding users for their contribution to the flow, the flow will be brought to the ecology and the start-up of the whole ecology will be promoted. Users can receive tokens as a reward when they complete the loan. Overall, the user's borrowing costs will be reduced to a low or even positive return, a win-win situation.

The release of DFC opened a ""Pandora's box"" under the ""borrow is dig"" game, which will push the popularity of DFC to another climax, even beyond MakerDAO. Help the platform capital pool to achieve prosperity and demand coexist, bring new hot spots and diversion points to the DeFi world, and rebuild a new future of financial order."

Breaking Down DeFi: Beginner's Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3ntri/breaking_down_defi_beginners_guide/,pbjclimbing,1,2021-08-13 23:54:39,7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p3ntri/breaking_down_defi_beginners_guide/,EDUCATIONAL," We have all heard of DeFi and know that it stands for decentralized finance. It is a lot more complicated than it sounds. Below are several of the common DeFi applications (dapps). Many of them can be used independently, but some of them are often used in combination with each other. There are many many more than I am including. Some of the explanations are simplified and are meant to give a general gist, not be argued about the minutia.

# Borrowing and Lending 

This might seem straightforward and it can be, but a lot of the DeFi network is based off of leverage. People will put some assets down as collateral and then borrow a greater amount and user one of the methods below to have that money make them more money

**Compound** and **Aave** are two dapps that allow you to borrow and lend crypto assets. There is a spread between the borrowing and lending rates. 

# Decentralized Exchange Platforms 

Commenly called a DEX, decentralized exchange platforms, use automated market makers (AMM) to complete trades. A normal exchange has an order book where they have a list of what people will sell and buy a crypto for and then they match two together. AMMs have liquidity pools which consist of 2\* cryptos at a ratio to each other (called a pair). The balance between the 2 cryptos in the pair sets the ratio, which is essentially the exchange rate. If one is in more demand than the other then the balance will change which will change the price.

**Uniswap:** This is one of the most popular DEXes for ERC-20 tokens and very straight forward. Any user can set a liquidity pool between 2 tokens and earn a portion of the set spread (normally 0.6%). Uniswap how the majority of people buy an ERC-20 token that is not listed on an exchange/their exchange. Other DEXes that are similar to Uniswap include SushiSwap (ERC-20) and Pancake Swap (BEP-20)

**Balancer:** A more complicated version of Uniswap. Instead of just having liquidity pairs, Balancer has multi-token pools which can function like an index. The fees tend to be hire, but you can sometimes get a better rate than going through Uniswap, especially if there is not a direct pair between the tokens.

**Bancor:** Balancer is like a more complicated version of Uniswap and Bancor is less complicated, but tries to address ways that liquidity providers can lose money through impermanent loss, slippage, and involuntary exposure

**Curve Finance:** A low fee DEX that focuses on stablecoins

# Prediction

The DeFi market is filled with dapps that allow you to attempt to predict the market. They also have

**Augur:** Prediction market protocol that allows you to essentially bet on anything (might need a VPN some places).

**dYdX:** One of the larger decentralized margin trading platform that allows leverage.

# Staking

Staking is one of the core tenants of the DeFi network. You can stake a token and earn that token, or another token. You can also stake a liquidity token (essentially the proof that you have money in the liquidity pool).

**Yearn.Finance:** Yearn, finds the best way to stake your tokens using smart contracts, often resulting in a higher return. Very active community and governance.

# Synthetic/Wrapped Assets

Synthetic/wrapped assets are essentially a crypto that mimics something else. Either a 1:1 backing or smart contract allows a crypto to be traded on another chain (bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain). They can also allow other assets like stocks, indexes, commodities to be traded via the blockchain.

**Synthetix:** Allows the creation of synthetic assets like gold, stocks, fiats. The synthetic assets are backed by collateral locked into smart contracts

# Traditional Financial Services

**MakerDao:** A USD pegged stablecoin, DAI, backed by crypto collateral. This allows banking services and is one of the backbones of the DeFi world. USDC is backed 1:1 by USD in a bank account. Tether is backed by “trust us its good”.

**Nexus Mutual:** Provides cover/insurance for smart contracts. This is most commonly used for complex DeFi staking endeavors that have far greater returns than the cost, but involve many smart contracts which could all be a vulnerability.

# Conclusion

If you are not used to the DeFi space, this can all sound overwhelming. It is very easy to lose a lot of money in the DeFi space if you are unsure of what you are doing. Keep in mind that the higher the yield, frequently the higher the risk. Earning 80% APY on ETH will involve significant risk and depending on the protocol, you might not even know exactly what the risk is."
Polygon Opens Vault On MakerDAO and Beefy Finance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/p3ou46/polygon_opens_vault_on_makerdao_and_beefy_finance/,ryuk_luvs_apples,1,2021-08-14 00:39:29,1,/r/0xPolygon/comments/p3ou46/polygon_opens_vault_on_makerdao_and_beefy_finance/,,"For the users who do not know what is MakerDAO: an organization for borrowing savings, and a stable cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. It has created a protocol permitting anyone with ETH and a MetaMask wallet to loan themselves money in the form of a stable coin referred to as “DAI.”

Here is the fresh news, Polygon has announced the integration of yield optimization vaults on the Maker Network and investing 50 million dollars of MATIC tokens from the treasury.

In other words, the protocol has now broadened in scope, vision, and transformation to become an Ethereum scaling aggregator typically allowing anyone to borrow money and reliably predict how much they had to pay back.

This for sure will ease the fear that used to come from crypto to crypto borrowing.

Similarly, there are few other networks opening vaults on polygon technology such as Beefy Finance.

I guess Polygon is elated, Don’t you think so?"

# Axie Infinity Has Beaten Even Ethereum in Network Fees Thanks to its Sidechain

 Facebook may be grabbing headlines with its talk about the metaverse as the basis for the company’s future, but blockchain game Axie Infinity already has a metaverse up and running and it’s grabbing something longer-lasting: revenue.

Protocol revenue on Axie Infinity yielded $305 million over the last 30 days, compared with $91.4 million for Ethereum, according to[ Token Terminal](https://www.tokenterminal.com/). That beats dominating a news cycle.

[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a blockchain-enabled play-to-earn game run by the company [Sky Mavis](https://skymavis.com/). At first glance, it looks a lot like [Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/), but it also has a deckbuilding element reminiscent of Blizzard’s [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/) or Wizards of the Coast’s [Magic: the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en).

“User growth and revenues are exploding,” Jeff Dorman, of the investment management firm [Arca](https://www.ar.ca/) said over Twitter DM. He said the fundamentals indicate investors are betting on much higher growth ahead for the ecosystem as well.

While the team behind it prioritizes making a high-quality game, really the feature that means the most to its users seems to be the fact that wealth generated by the game and its platform is driven back to them. Specifically, it’s provided a way for many players to earn a living for themselves in the form of crypto.

Right now, Axie is bringing in far more revenue than other more widely discussed projects, such as the stablecoin engine [MakerDAO](https://thedefiant.io/what-is-makerdao-and-how-does-dai-work/), the Binance Smart Chain automated market-maker [PancakeSwap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQPNTYSpKoU) and even, the [Ethereum blockchain](https://thedefiant.io/eip-1559-economics/) itself.

Axie Infinity went from $100,000 in platform revenue in January 2021 to $196 million in July, Aleksander Leonard Larsen, Sky Mavis’ chief operating officer, told the Defiant.

“In the end it’s just kind of numbers on a screen,” he said. “It’s not like we take that money anyway. We put it in the treasury.”

Axie Infinity will eventually become a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. It took the first step in that direction this year with the release of Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), the governance token that controls the aforementioned treasury. 

 Protocols by revenue can be found here: [https://www.tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol\_revenue/cumulative](https://www.tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/protocol_revenue/cumulative)

The Axie Infinity project has been around since 2018, so why is it experiencing this jump now?

Sources The Defiant spoke to all attribute this success to one shift in particular: the launch of Sky Mavis’s[ Ronin sidechain](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain). Once the company moved players’ characters over to Ronin, the game became appreciably less expensive. In particular, players weren’t forking over expensive Ethereum gas fees to breed new Axies, the in-game characters users need to play.

“The fetters were removed. Then the word could spread and spark a fire,” Baronar, a community member who runs the[ Axie Chat](https://axiechat.com/) podcast told The Defiant over Discord. 

A sidechain is a separate blockchain built to interact with a main chain, such as Ethereum in Axie’s case, but with its own security model. Ronin was built specifically for the game. It first went live early this year, but Axies and their breeding were only able to run on it in late April. That’s when things started to change.

“Axie is a combination of not only the game but also the community aspect of it that surrounds it, and it’s also the economy,” Larsen said. 

#### No Transaction Fees

Once Axies lived on Ronin, players no longer lost a large portion of value to miners for logging breeding activity on chain. For now, Ronin has no transaction fees. That has lowered the barrier for so many players that the overall economy has grown dramatically.

AK is a community member who pioneered Axie sharing ([called scholarships](https://leveldash.com/axie-infinity-scholarship-guide/)) to the ecosystem. He said when Axies moved to Ronin in April, they saw a brief slump in Axie prices as a breeding uptick brought more Axies onto the market, but then once pent-up demand kicked in it started moving the value of the whole ecosystem back up. 

There are two kinds of revenue for the protocol right now: breeding fees (creating new Axie by pairing existing ones) and marketplace fees. Breeding fees in AXS all go to the treasury but the marketplace fees are in flux. Some of those may go to Sky Mavis at some point. Marketplace fees are just accumulating in a wallet right now.

#### More Play

By lowering the price to participate with Ronin, the team was making a key adjustment to the economy that unlocked a lot of activity, and at a certain point, that increased activity became a virtuous cycle.

After Ronin, players felt compelled to tell others about the game and drive even more activity, which made all the underlying Axie assets more valuable. There are several assets — a utility token called Smooth Love Potion (SLP), AXS, game real estate and in-game items, as well as the Axie NFTs.

Both of the tokens have been trending up lately. SLP hit a new all-time high on July 13 (at $0.3997) and AXS hit a new one yesterday, on August 11 (at $75.73).

Both are way up from mid-April, just before Ronin onboarded Axies, with SLP trading then at about $0.05 and AXS at generally just under $8.

The game is still in beta, so while its vision as a metaverse is much larger, now there are really two things players can do in the game: engage in battles with other players and go on solo quests to earn SLP.

The[ latest release](https://axie.substack.com/p/-axie-arena-season-18) of the game actually lowered the amount of rewards that players could accrue playing solo and increased rewards for playing against others, as a way to encourage everyone to focus on becoming better players rather than just gathering SLP. 

#### Bot Play

Solo play can be run by bot accounts, and Sky Mavis wants to eliminate as much bot-play as possible. Playing matches is a high skill activity, and at least for now, no one has built a machine that can do that well.

“There had been some issue with bots, and we’ve always been banning them,” Larsen said. With this latest change, he said it was like “moving from unskilled labor — that can be bots — to skilled labor.”

#### A Serious Living 

The play-to-earn model may be more serious than many Westerners realize. It’s actually feasible for people in many parts of the world to make a living[ playing Axie Infinity](https://thedefiant.io/nfts-are-becoming-a-major-source-of-income-for-crypto-newbies-in-the-philippines-to-colombia/). The more skill they build up at the game, the more they are able to earn.

“The goal was always to make a living playing the game and to own your own characters,” OhhShiny, an Axie community member told The Defiant. “It took a long time for people to understand.”

OhhShiny describes himself as a community manager for the metaverse, helping to onboard as many users as he can across the whole Axie ecosystem. He has the distinction of owning[ Galadriel](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/axie/991), potentially the single most valuable Axie.

Making meaningful income has become much easier for more players around the world as the value of SLP has gone up. The biggest roadblock is getting the in-game assets that allow a person to play, the Axies themselves.

#### Lending Axies

AK, the community member who created scholarships, has a large stable of Axies. For now, this is a fairly high-touch system that requires trust on both sides of a given loan. But it has proved lucrative enough that AK has gone full-time running scholarships, describing himself as a digital pet store operator.

Many of his earliest players have gone on to build their own guild of Axies and run scholarships of their own. Players using loaner Axies typically get to keep 60 to 65% of their earnings, while owners are able to put Axies to work that would have otherwise sat idle in their wallets.

To OhhShiny, it is difficult for those in the West to appreciate how significant it is in other parts of the world to be able to generate meaningful income by participating in an online ecosystem. If someone finds a way to earn money as readily as they can with Axie Infinity, he argued you basically have a responsibility to spread the word or you are a bad family member or neighbor.

“It has the highest co-efficiency of virality of anything that’s been invented on the internet before,” OhhShiny said. “I believe it has the potential to transform global labor markets.”

While Facebook is doing its press junkets, Axie Infinity looks like it could break a billion dollars in revenue this year."

Before [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) ([GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)) existed, developers who wanted to create decentralized apps needed to index all of Ethereum's data manually, a task which could take multiple developers months-years minimum to complete. The Graph indexes the previously unorganized blockchain data and makes it organized and easier for developers to create applications with.

Everytime a user is using a dApp (eg, Uniswap) to trade or view data, the dApp has to query The Graph for data. The Graph recently received up to 800 million daily queries in [May 2021](https://thegraph.com/blog/20billion-queries), with 20% growth monthly growth rate since launch in 2020.

Have you ever heard of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Balancer, USDC, Synthetix, Sushiswap, MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve, or basically any of the popular dApps? They all functionally rely upon The Graph. A good representation of what The Graph is is when you use [info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org) \- all of this data comes from The Graph. Everytime you refresh, that's a query that Uniswap has to make to The Graph in order to provide you with up to data price data.

For the past 8+ months, dApps were getting this data for free, but soon they will migrate their subgraphs to the decentralized mainnet and be charged microfees per query. The query fees will be paid out amongst indexers (those who actually organize the data into subgraphs) and curators/delegators (those who stake/participants in the network). We are talking roughly $0.0001 or $0.00001 per query, so hundreds of millions of monthly capital flowing through The Graph and its participants.

Currently, there are 10-15 layer 1 blockchain networks (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and others) and hundreds of popular dApps (those listed above, and [more](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/)) using The Graph. Several, like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/thegraph), asked The Graph to index their chain - they approached The Graph, not the other way around. However, in the future, there will be thousands of blockchain networks indexed by The Graph, millions of dApps/subgraphs, and trillions of daily queries. Imagine everyone using their phone to transact, refresh, and interact with media/applications that require data from The Graph.

As one of the most important trends in blockchain application, it is profoundly changing the way people use financial instruments. Smart contract is an important technical basis for DeFi development, and the generation mechanism of decentralized stablecoin is an important prerequisite for the construction of DeFi ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, the DeFi ecosystem based on Ethereum is the mainstream of decentralized finance. It is widely known for its most abundant applications and the largest amount of deposits. It can be said that thanks to the large-scale development of DeFi, ethereum public chain has ushered in the second spring after the release boom of Ethereum, and become the most ecological and active public chain on the chain. At the same time, however, the DeFi ecosystem continues to expose problems due to the limitations of Ethereum. In fact, Ethereum is also actively preparing to upgrade the system, but because the upper structure has been built, the underlying infrastructure improvement is difficult, it is difficult to fundamentally improve the status quo in the short term. DFC, a decentralised financial platform with strong technological advantages, is trying to change this. The model of DFC is an integrated and integrated DeFi platform, completely different from the decentralized DeFi ecosystem of Ethereum. This efficient and convenient decentralized financial model will represent the future development direction of DeFi.

With the popularity of various public chains and the emergence of a large number of on-chain tokens, the management of digital assets has become an urgent problem to be solved. The emergence of DeFi to a large extent to meet the needs of people's on-chain transactions, more importantly, DeFi for the traditional financial industry to provide a new solution. It can be said that 2019 is the first year of DeFi, and the DeFi ecosystem on mainstream public chains such as Ethereum and EOS has gradually developed. Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is the fastest growing, largest, and most representative.

Despite its rapid development, DeFi is still unable to replace some centralized financial services facilities due to technical limitations. Decentralised switches (DEX), for example, are no match for centralised ones. The speed with which a decentralized exchange processes orders depends on the efficiency of the public chain. In addition, decentralised exchanges lack depth and volumes are small enough to handle large trades. Therefore, DFC hopes to solve various application problems faced by DeFi by constructing a DeFi financial ecology with more optimized mechanism and more complete ecology.

An important prerequisite for the development of stablecoins is to provide a reference system for the value of fiat currencies. In ethereum's DeFi ecosystem, MakerDAO solves this problem by proposing a mechanism to generate decentralized stablecoin DAI through token over-collateral. It also spawned applications for lending, leveraged trading, insurance, payments and many other games. However, DAI's lending rates lack stability. When the market was hot and loan demand was leveraged, MakerDAO had to organize a vote to raise the loan rate to stabilize the risk. Instead, mainstream money markets fall and interest rates will follow. The frequent fluctuation of interest rate leads to the instability of DeFi's economic structure, which is easy to form a transitional speculation situation and cause DeFi to lose its practical application value.

Since the beginning of the year, the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem has been exposed to a steady stream of news of malicious arbitrage by hackers exploiting the DeFi ecosystem's smart contract vulnerabilities. The malicious arbitrage of hackers by organizing different DeFi projects reflects the lack of coordination of decentralization in the DeFi ecosystem, as well as the vulnerability between smart contract combinations of different services. The DeFi ecological model on Ethereum, while very flexible and free, does not guarantee security issues and is generally not very user-friendly in use.

DFC mode will change the DeFi ecosystem

DFC model is just an intensive DeFi platform model, which integrates financial services on the basic chain. Users only need to use the DFC platform to conduct six DeFi services, including stablecoin mortgage, decentralized transactions, cross-chain asset transfer, on-chain financial management, and decentralized mining. These six services are implemented through a unified DFC platform, which fundamentally avoids the ecological loopholes caused by fragmentation. Thus, most users of the market are protected from asset losses caused by DeFi vulnerability, so that everyone can fully participate in it and enjoy more convenient, efficient, intelligent and secure decentralized finance."

The Graph was recently given the honor of being [one of the first protocols to roll out on Arbitrum mainnet next month](https://thegraph.com/blog/arbitrum-graph).

Moons, and applications that are developed to implement the usage of Moons, will almost certainly be using The Graph on a fundamental level, as will the entirety of the token economy of Reddit. 

When Moons and Reddit subgraphs are created, users who hold GRT will be able to curate the subgraph. What that means is they will be able to stake their GRT to the subgraph to signal to indexers that it will be a valuable subgraph and will yield many queries. The more queries, the more applications have to pay indexers, and the more the indexers indexing the subgraph and the curators signaling that the subgraph would be profitable, profit.

So you can actually use GRT's curation market as a predictions market to ""bet on"" Moons and Reddit's token economy being successful by staking to their respective subgraphs using GRT and profiting off of their growth over time."
Zero-Coupon Bond in DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/p5ycnm/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi/,economicsdesign,1,2021-08-17 14:33:14,0,/r/ethtrader/comments/p5ycnm/zerocoupon_bond_in_defi/,Discussion," 

DeFi is booming. And it is starting with lending and borrowing. In this article, we will discuss the interest rates in the crypto lending and borrowing industry. Specifically, zero-coupon bond. In the next newsletters, we will dive into interest rate swaps, direct collateralised swaps and other interesting structures.

# General Conclusion

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the hottest use case of Ethereum at present. DeFi has been attracting the attention of the community. In recent times, we have been experiencing a DeFi summer with the fastest growth since its inception.

DeFi is transparent and autonomous. It is a set of execution of smart contracts which operate on a publicly viewable blockchain. Users need not rely upon any party or anyone. This mechanism empowers everyone who interacts with protocols.

**Lending and Borrowing**

Most popular use case of DeFi is lending and borrowing. On DeFi, we can find lending money to strangers easily by smart contracts. This means we can give someone our money to earn passive income, at the same time borrowers will also mortgage their assets to get coins they want. The collateral is not the physical asset like gold, silver or real estate. Here, the collateral is cryptocurrencies.

**Interest Rates**

One such platform is MakerDAO which has 2.8M $ETH locked (\~2.45% existing $ETH supply). MakerDAO provides $DAI — a stablecoin, when users lock-in ETH. $DAI is tried to peg at $1. It provides liquidity into the MakerDAO system. There are many other DeFi dapps like Compound, Aave, Sushiswap, etc. who use $DAI. They are providing different types of lending and borrowing assets which is backed by collaterals. Borrow and lend relate to the **floating (or variable) interest rate.** DeFi is doing well.

&gt;But, DeFi still lacks one important tool which provides **the fixed interest rate.**

# Fixed Interest Rate

In traditional finance, the Fixed interest rate often understood as low-risk interest rates and almost absolutely safe. It is a needed and important factor. Clearly, it affects other factors in the economy: lending rates of banks, Interbank interest rates, Gold Price, Real Estate Price, etc. On a more macro level, one country's interest rates can affect other countries with each trading relationship.

On DeFi the same. The Fixed Interest Rate will impact investor's behaviour because a rational investor always tries to produce a yield greater than the fixed interest rate (in this case). That means it will impact our portfolio.

Fixed Interest Rate does not change during a loan period, allowing borrowers/lenders to accurately predict how much they need to pay or receive in future.

Currently, DeFi has a lot of projects starting to implement fixed-rate products with 2 main approaches:

(1) Zero-coupon bond.

(2) Direct Collateralised Swap.

# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon bond (ZCB) pays a fixed yield on maturity. The crypto market is volatile and lending-borrowing is taking place on a variable rate of interest. But other one wants to control risky better by using the fixed interest rate products. Non-availability of a fixed rate of interest is a barrier towards mass adoption of DeFi.

## So what is zero-coupon bond ?

&gt;A zero-coupon bond is a type of bond that does not pay interest periodically. That is interest is paid at the time of the bond purchase or on the maturity date.

### Valuation

The present value of the bond is determined by its future face value, the interest rate of the bond and the duration of the bond.

    PNV = (FaceValue)/(1+r)^n

All things equal,

* Higher duration = lower price to pay now
* Higher face value = higher price to pay now
* Higher interest rate = lower price to pay now

## In DeFi

2 ways we see zero-coupon bond concept:

1. An ERC20 token with the above mechanism — lower price now for future payouts
2. Protocol like YIELD.IS

### ERC20 token as zero-coupon bond

Crypto research company Paradigm published a whitepaper (April 2020) depicting how to make and issuance of the zero-coupon bond as ERC20 tokens which is called yTokens.

As this whitepaper, ""*yTokens are like the zero-coupon bonds and are backed by collateral in another asset. By buying or selling y Tokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a fixed term. yTokens are fungible and trade at a floating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of yTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, yTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically issuing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.""*

To make sense easier, participants in the protocols using zero-coupon bond include the borrower, the lender, the liquidity provider.

* **The borrower** will mortgage the asset, in exchange for the token representing the loan, debt tokens can be redeemed at a fixed value in the future. The borrower then sells the debt token at a discount.
* **The lender** is a person who buys a bond at a discount price and receives interest when the bond matures.
* **The liquidity provider** that will provide liquidity for the bond in return receives transaction fees and profits when the bond matures.  
📷

yToken's yield doesn't rely upon system governance. It decides price according to market price rather than depending on governance or any formula.

Compare with $DAI, the problem of $DAI is that it is pegged to $1 but the collateral is not USD and the interest rate is continuously changed by the governance model, theoretically. But yToken price is expected to float and the interest rate will be determined by the trade discount. It also will have an expiration date. If you hold yToken for a certain period, you would earn predictable of interest and if you withdraw early (difference with selling), you may incur a loss.

**But how does the system work exactly?**

""You can create yTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to effectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying yTokens is economically similar to lending\* the target asset. The effective ‘interest rate’ received by yToken holders is determined by the discount at which yTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.”

\**Lending the asset because when you buy the bond via owning yTokens, it transfers the ownership of the collateral from the depositor to you.*

A sample use case:

James wants to lend 10,000 $ETH and earns interest for 1 month. The current price of yToken (that bond token) is 0.98 $ETH. With 10,000 $ETH, he can get 10,204.08 yTokens.

If he keeps it for 1 year, he will get out 204.08 $ETH.

But he only wants to keep it for 1 month. So he earns 17 $ETH. (204.08/17)

At the end of 1 month, he gets back his principle (10,000 ETH) and interest (17 ETH).

The volatility of $ETH does not affect the yield in $ETH as the yToken has been issued against the borrower's collateralised Ethereum.

&gt;Aka, the principle and interest are denominated in the same asset. Hence, not affected by volatility.

## New Same DeFi Product

### Reflex Bond

One of those top upstart efforts is **Reflex bonds** by blockchain developer Stefan Ionescu. he outlined how to create a bond product on Ethereum that provide price stability (as stablecoins) without maintaining an arbitrary and common in the cryptoeconomy to date.

In other words, reflex bonds would have ""floating redemption prices""-the same with $yToken that I mentioned, that has the ability to minimise the price volatility from the market compared to stablecoins.

The purpose of a reflex bond is to be a more stable representation of its collateral while maintaining a high level of reliability. If it is used in other platforms, a reflex bond can protect its user from huge and sudden volatility.

### Notional Finance

Notional Finance has launched a fixed-rate borrowing/lending protocol through a financial method called $fCash. $fCash are negotiable tokens that represent positive or negative cash flow requirements at a specific point in the future, and can be traded against the base currency (e.g. $DAI, $USDC) in the liquidity groups that support AMM.

Lenders buy $fCash and close a rate that represents the amount of the base currency they can claim against their $fCash at maturity. The borrower uses $fCash and can sell it to receive the base currency, in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the base currency at a specific time in the future. $fCash tokens are always paired - assets and liabilities are always zero on the Notional system.

### UMA's yUSD

UMA has launched its first yield dollar token -$yUSD (SEP20), which is essentially a zero-coupon bond redeemable for $1 at the expiry date and can be traded with $USDC through Balancer AMM.

**TLDR:**

&gt;Economics of tokenisation and ecosystem is free weekly in your inbox. Please share it with anyone that can benefit from this knowledge.

We have explained that those products about Fixed Interest Rate, although they are quite new they are essential in the DeFi space. More Fixed Interest Rate products will appear in the future and are intended for those who want risk control and easy access to traditional investment firms that use Fixed Interest Rates for their portfolios.

Next, we will continue to showcase another interesting product, the Interest Rate Swap. They are also in essence a derivative product."

“Decentralized Finance” (DeFi) covers financial services performed on the blockchain. DeFi is a financial service without a centralized authority.
DeFi keeps the traditional elements of banking while eliminating the middleman by using a smart contract.
DeFi needs decentralized infrastructure to function.
DeFi’s inception was in 2015 on the dApp (decentralized App) MakerDAO. This platform allows users to use crypto as collateral to apply for loans.
DeFi functions as an open, trustless, and decentralized financial network. DeFi has no central ruling authority. Foul play is mitigated by the protocols being enforced with Smart contracts. DeFi has attracted many investors. This interest has skyrocketed the amount of tokens in DeFi to nearly $88 billion (USD) in mid-May 2021 (https://defipulse.

D-REIT is a project that bridges the gap between DeFi and new tangible investment opportunities that otherwise don’t exist on the blockchain.
Leveraging blockchain technology, D-REIT allows assets such as real estate, shares in companies, operations of renewable energy plants, and more to be traded on a native marketplace, facilitating P2P trades to both single buyers and crowdfunded projects.
Benefits generated on the platform, both on-chain (commissions generated within the platform) and off- chain (income from capital gains on the sale of real estate and rental income), will be distributed proportionally among the holders of DRT (D-REIT Token).

Mission Statement
Implement a scalable, decentralized, and autonomous platform based on blockchain technology with strong technical and security capabilities.
D-REIT offers users the opportunity to invest in projects of their choice, automatically earning users a portion of the profits generated.

Vision Statement
To be a decentralized and an autonomous business platform that creates financial opportunity and generates profitability. To facilitate the democratization
and accessibility of investments, granting opportunities for all types of investors. To offer the best adaptation strategies in an ever- changing economic environment by pioneering solutions through the use of blockchain technology."

BakerDAO System Upgrade Explanation and Q&amp;A | Review of the First AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/p7e8ph/bakerdao_system_upgrade_explanation_and_qa_review/,Baker_DAO,1,2021-08-19 20:53:13,0,/r/u_Baker_DAO/comments/p7e8ph/bakerdao_system_upgrade_explanation_and_qa_review/,,"  

At 20:00 (SGT) on August 13, 2021, DH, head of BakerDAO technical team, broadcasted an AMA live show on the Development Plan and System Design of BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0 in ""BakerDAO 🥯Community"", giving an in-depth explanation of the system upgrade and answering related questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights: DH, head of BakerDAO technical team, mentioned in the AMA live show that: V2.0 will be launched in September; the 24-hour TVL target is USD 300 million after launch; BAI will stabilize at USD 1; BKR will be benchmarked against MKR (up to USD 6,300), reach USD 1,000 by the end of the year, and will be listed on Binance Exchange.** 

**The script of this AMA is as follows:** 

&amp;#x200B;

Q1: Good evening, everyone. The long-awaited BakerDAO's first AMA has now started. Today we have DH, head of BakerDAO technical team, here with us. Anyone who is interested, especially our BakerDAO family members, is welcome to ask questions in an effort to build a strong BakerDAO community\~ 

**DH:** Hello, everyone. I am DH. As I am responsible for leading BakerDAO's product and technical team, I've been deeply involved in R&amp;D. I am also the main planner and drafter of the BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme previously released. I'm very glad to have an AMA with our BakerDAO community to give an in-depth explanation of this system upgrade, and you are welcome to ask questions. 

In the beginning, I would like to talk about two topics: one is the overall system upgrade scheme, and the other is the version to be upgraded in September. 

First of all, we remade the version planning, and regarded the core BAI lending agreement that was first launched as V1.0. The subsequent systems will be upgraded on the basis of V1.0. The liquidation module will be called V1.1 after optimization, the BAI liquidation pool V1.2, the new version of liquidity mining V1.3, the DAO pool V1.6, the BAI stabilization pool V2.0, the open vault V3.0, and the aggregation platform V4.0. 

After all the system upgrades are completed, BakerDAO will have seven systems: the core Borrow system, BAI liquidation pool, BAI stabilization pool, DAO pool, liquidity mining, open vault, and aggregation platform. 

With the above seven systems, the three key problems encountered before, namely, liquidation, BAI instability and BKR instability, can be perfectly solved. The liquidation module optimization and BAI liquidation pool will solve the previous liquidation problem; the BAI liquidation pool, BAI stabilization pool and open vault will solve the problem of BAI stability and liquidity; the DAO pool gives BKR holders more returns and will solve the problem of BKR instability. 

We put a lot of effort to make this picture [Principle of the BakerDAO Upgrade Scheme.jpg](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/15/fgSv90.jpg). To enable the community to better understand the BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme, I suggest everyone take a look at it carefully, and then you can also understand the difference between ours and other decentralized stablecoin protocols. We've always been innovating and creating value for BKR holders. 

Our first upgrade will be launched in September, the V2.0, which will include the liquidation module optimization, the BAI liquidation pool, the DAO pool, and the BAI stabilization pool. In fact, they are also the core components in the upgrade scheme. Upon completion, it shall be able to solve the above three problems. Meanwhile, it will also solve the problem of BAI liquidity and bring proceeds to BKR holders. Now I will introduce the overall development plan. 

For more details about the upgrade to V2.0, please read our article titled Development Plan and System Design of BakerDAO System Upgrade Scheme V1.0. 

After the V2.0 upgrade, BAI will stabilize around USD 1 and have sufficient liquidity. We will build a BAI ecosystem and find more partners to support the application of BAI. 

Someone mentioned MakerDAO just now. Our benchmark is MakerDAO on Ethereum. After this upgrade, BakerDAO will surpass MakerDAO at the product level, and then we will promote the building of community, operation and BAI ecosystem simultaneously. With the support of the community, we will complete the deployment of multiple chains. Then it will definitely surpass MakerDAO in every aspect and become the world's number one decentralized stablecoin. 

This is the general situation by now. I will not expand the details of the development work. Thank you for your participation\~\~\~ You may ask questions about the issues you are interested in. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2:** Will it be launched soon? 

**DH:** Yes, it will be launched soon. The team has been designing, discussing, and verifying feasibility since the release of V1.0. We've been preparing for more than a month, and development is underway. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3:** So what about the progress of development? 

**DH:** OK, I'll talk about the development progress first. At present, the overall completion rate is about 60%. The contract team has completed the development work and is doing the testing. The front-end page is 80% complete. Integration testing will be carried out after completion. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4:** When can I use the BKR in our hands? 

**DH:** BKR can be pledged to the DAO pool after V2.0 to share the system revenue. According to related reports, MakerDAO's annual system revenue is hundreds of millions of US dollars, which is a substantial lot. But they don't share it with MKR holders. So this is a big step for us to share the proceeds with BKR holders. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5:** Can you tell us about the new mining system? 

**DH:** The first mining system we will launch next month is for LBAI and SBAI. LBAI is the LP for the BAI liquidation pool and SABI is the LP for the BAI stabilization pool[\[c1\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_msocom_1) . This is to encourage more people to participate in the new system, as mining is lossless and risk-free. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6:** How can we participate in mining? 

**DH:** Regarding how to participate in mining, I just prepared a description of the application methods for a few roles. You may read it. We will also prepare more detailed documents to teach you how to use the system. 

First of all, the mining in V2.0 is lossless and risk-free. The main purpose is to reward BKR to the lending and liquidation participants, BAI liquidity contributors, and BKR holders. There are several paths for your participation: 

1. BAI borrower: borrow BAI in the ""Borrow system"", pledge BAI to the ""BAI liquidation pool"" to share the liquidation proceeds and receive LP: LBAI, and pledge LBAI to participate in ""liquidity mining""; 

2. BKR holder: pledge &amp; lock BKR to ""DAO pool"" to receive a share of the system proceeds; 

3. BAI liquidity provider: provide liquidity of BAI and other stablecoins to the ""BAI stabilization pool"" to receive LP: SBAI, and pledge SBAI to participate in ""liquidity mining""; 

4. BAI trader: trade BAI in the ""BAI stabilization pool""; 

5. BKR liquidity miner: participate in ""liquidity mining"" to get LBKR; this is to reward users for pledging &amp; locking BKR: LBKR in the ""DAO pool"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q7:** The BKR trading pool is too shallow now. How to solve this problem? 

**DH:** We will consider solving the BKR liquidity problem after V2.0. Users may pledge BKR in the DAO pool, share the system proceeds, and participate in the governance vote in V2.0 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q8:** Can you provide a plain and simple liquidation tutorial? 

**DH:** Regarding liquidation, the liquidation rights will be withdrawn in V2.0. Only the BAI liquidation pool is involved in liquidation. At the same time, users who pledge BAI to the BAI liquidation pool can share the liquidation proceeds, so there is no need to worry about the previous scientist liquidation and system deficit. The liquidation pool will no longer bring deficit to the lending system. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q9:** Do you have any expectation on the TVL after this upgrade? How much can it reach? 

**DH:** Our TVL goal is USD 300 million in 24 hours after the launch. All parties are working towards this goal. By then everyone is welcome to participate in the lossless, risk-free mining. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q10:** Is there any plan to get BKR listed on any exchange? 

**DH:** Our target exchange is Binance Exchange. After the V2.0 upgrade, we will have in-depth communication with Binance Exchange and also participate in various activities of BSC. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q11:** At present, only a small group of users are participating in the BKR project. How can you attract more people to join in later? 

**DH:** We will organize a series of promotion and marketing activities before the launch. Our first goal is to expand the community and attract more supporters. We also hope that users can introduce BakerDAO to their friends and expand the BakerDAO community together\~. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q12:** Have you considered the follow-up promotion? How to get foreigners involved in the future? 

**DH:** We are also speeding up to build the BakerDAO English community. Meanwhile, we are looking for foreign publicity and promotion channels to find more BSC users to join in and support BakerDAO, which is also the priority in our future work. 

**DH:** Time is up. We have to stop here today. Thank you very much for joining us \~ If you have any question in the future, you may ask in the ""BakerDAO 🥯Community"", or send it to BakerDAO. I will receive it promptly, and try to give my best answer. With your support, BakerDAO will grow stronger. Let’s build a mighty BakerDAO community together \~"
"The Graph (GRT), also known as the ""Google of blockchain"", is the single most important piece of the blockchain puzzle",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p7r2o6/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,graph_marine,1,2021-08-20 08:15:23,59,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p7r2o6/the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/,FUN,"Think about a book - when you want to find a specific piece of information, you can either spend hours-days reading through the whole book to find it, or you can skip to the index and find it within seconds.

Before [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) ([GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)) existed, developers who wanted to create decentralized apps needed to index all of Ethereum's data manually, a task which could take multiple developers months-years minimum to complete. The Graph indexes the previously unorganized blockchain data and makes it organized and easier for developers to create applications with.

Everytime a user is using a dApp (eg, Uniswap) to trade or view data, the dApp has to query The Graph for data. The Graph recently received up to 800 million daily queries in [May 2021](https://thegraph.com/blog/20billion-queries), with 20% growth monthly growth rate since launch in 2020.

Have you ever heard of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Balancer, USDC, Synthetix, Sushiswap, MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve, or basically any of the popular dApps? They all functionally rely upon The Graph. A good representation of what The Graph is is when you use [info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org) \- all of this data comes from The Graph. Everytime you refresh, that's a query that Uniswap has to make to The Graph in order to provide you with up to data price data.

For the past 8+ months, dApps were getting this data for free, but soon they will migrate their subgraphs to the decentralized mainnet and be charged microfees per query. The query fees will be paid out amongst indexers (those who actually organize the data into subgraphs) and curators/delegators (those who stake/participants in the network). We are talking roughly $0.0001 or $0.00001 per query, so hundreds of millions of monthly capital flowing through The Graph and its participants.

Currently, there are 10-15 layer 1 blockchain networks (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and others) and hundreds of popular dApps (those listed above, and [more](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/)) using The Graph. Several, like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/thegraph), asked The Graph to index their chain - they approached The Graph, not the other way around. However, in the future, there will be thousands of blockchain networks indexed by The Graph, millions of dApps/subgraphs, and trillions of daily queries. Imagine everyone using their phone to transact, refresh, and interact with media/applications that require data from The Graph.

When GRT launched, it was released on Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance on day 1 - no other coin in history has had this red carpet rollout, and there is good reason for it. All of these exchanges had [info pages](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-the-graph-grt) written for The Graph, where they referred to it as the ""Google of blockchain"".

The Graph is like a combination of decentralized versions of Google, banking, all of social media, all other service providers and other industries, all in one.

Edit: One response so far, in jest, mentioned that I did not mention Moons. Well, the layer 2 solution chosen by Reddit for Ethereum scaling of Reddit's subreddit token economy was [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) (scroll to the bottom and you'll see The Graph's logo). Arbitrum not only uses The Graph, but [boasts its partnership with The Graph frequently](https://offchain.medium.com/the-graph-indexing-and-querying-services-are-live-on-arbitrum-one-c539a122da14). The Graph was recently given the honor of being [one of the first protocols to roll out on Arbitrum mainnet next month](https://thegraph.com/blog/arbitrum-graph).

Moons, and applications that are developed to implement the usage of Moons, will almost certainly be using The Graph on a fundamental level, as will the entirety of the token economy of Reddit. 

When Moons and Reddit subgraphs are created, users who hold GRT will be able to curate the subgraph. What that means is they will be able to stake their GRT to the subgraph to signal to indexers that it will be a valuable subgraph and will yield many queries. The more queries, the more applications have to pay indexers, and the more the indexers indexing the subgraph and the curators signaling that the subgraph would be profitable, profit.

So you can actually use GRT's curation market as a predictions market to ""bet on"" Moons and Reddit's token economy being successful by staking to their respective subgraphs using GRT and profiting off of their growth over time."
Is the Peg Stability Module actually used? How does DAI maintain its price of $1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/p7x9z5/is_the_peg_stability_module_actually_used_how/,karna852,1,2021-08-20 15:23:28,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/p7x9z5/is_the_peg_stability_module_actually_used_how/,,"It's quite confusing - I don't understand what are all of the mechanisms that allows DAI to remain at $1. Please don't just point me to the docs or the white paper - I have read both and attempted to understand both.

As far as I can tell here are the mechanisms (I am talking about Multicollateral DAI, not SAI).

1. Interest rates. MKR owners can vote to set the savings rate and the interest rate charged for borrowers. A higher savings rate causes more DAI to come into vaults, lowering DAI supply and hopefully increasing price. A lower interest rate for borrowing, makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging borrowing and increasing the amount of DAI in circulation, raising the supply and lowering price. 
2. Auctions. Suppose the cause of DAI being &lt; $1 is due to a fall in the general crypto market and is accompanied by falls in the price of BAT and ETH (which, apart from USDC, also account for collateral put up for a loan). When the price falls so much that there is not enough collateral to justify the loan, an auction is created in which people can use DAI to buy that collateral at a discounted rate. Therefore they lock up DAI in exchange for buying that collateral. 
   1. Suppose the cause of DAI being &gt; $1 is due to increased demand for DAI. We want to issue more DAI in order to expand supply. This is correlated with having more DAI with MKR. MKR holders (who are incentivized because they govern the DAI token and if they burn MKR, the price of MKR will rise), use their MKR tokens to buy DAI and release it into the market. This causes the supply of DAI to go up, lowering the price.
   2. If nobody wants to buy the collateral, people who want to own MKR, use DAI to pay for the outstanding debt and are issued MKR tokens in return. This restricts the DAI supply and also punishes MKR owners by reducing the price of MKR.
3. Market Maker Keepers --&gt; I seriously don't think I understand this, and the docs are absolutely terrible.
   1.  I \*think\* these are bots that will offer to buy/sell DAI within a set of defined prices (called bands). 
   2. I \*do not understand\* how they actually cause the price of DAI to move back to $1.
   3. You might be smarter than I - if you can understand this - [https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper), please explain it to me. 
4. Arbitrage
   1. If the price of DAI is &lt; $1 and I expect it to return to $1. I am incentivized to buy DAI at below $1 and wait for it to rise to $1. I can make risk free profit here.
   2. I don't understand how Arbitrage helps if DAI is &gt; $1. 
5. Emergency Shutdown.
   1. In this case, something bad has really happened. The system stops allowing new vaults to be created and stops issuing new DAI. Instead, everyone who holds DAI gets back a part of the total collateral in the system (so everything deposited + everything stored from the stability fees). 
   2. **Not sure how this maintains day to day peg stability, or how it maintains stability in the event that there's a large loss of confidence in all collateral types.** 

***Questions***

1. How do market maker keeper bots help with keeping the price at $1?
2. Do arbitrage bots have a place in Multicollateral DAI, or are they deprecated?
3. What is the role of the Peg Stability Module? I asked on the DAI chat and someone said ""Yes - arbitraging, mainly using the Peg Stability Module is very much still relevant."", but I can't find any indication of its use in the docs or in Github.
4. How does the Emergency Shutdown mechanism help maintain the price at $1?

I'm in the middle of a deep dive into DAI and trying to simplify a lot of the language so that people can understand what is going on.

I intend to release this freely and publicly.

Any help would be great!

Thanks!"

Kava Labs is a developer of Kava Platform, the most trusted DeFi platform by financial institutions. This subreddit is officially managed by Kava Labs.

Kava Platform aims to become the default DeFi platform by providing stablecoins and decentralized lending against all major crypto assets. Kava utilizes Cosmos and operates with a Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. At its core, Kava relies on a system similar to MakerDAO with CDPs but leverages the zones from Cosmos to add cryptocurrencies running on independent networks (e.g., XRP, Bitcoin). Kava Platform delivers 3 different applications (Kava Protocol, Hard Protocol, Swap Protocol) that allows users to mint, lend and swap all in one place.

ALPHA - is OIN the next Near Ecosystem Gem for Guaranteed 10x?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/nearprotocol/comments/p94di3/alpha_is_oin_the_next_near_ecosystem_gem_for/,fatbutfriendly,3,2021-08-22 10:30:19,10,/r/nearprotocol/comments/p94di3/alpha_is_oin_the_next_near_ecosystem_gem_for/,,"Hello friends!

NEAR is Pumping. OCT sale is pumping. Skyward and REF are pumping. The entire ecosystem is starting to gain momentum. FOMO is in the air... But, I think I came across an underrated opportunity: [oin.finance](https://oin.finance) 

There's a few different pieces to this puzzle that only OGs and basement dwelling degenerates are starting to grasp now:

1. Launch of Metapool ([https://twitter.com/meta\_pool](https://twitter.com/meta_pool)), the first Liquid Staking solution on Near. Metapool is going to unlock a ton of liquidity that is currently locked in Staking (users lock their Near to secure the network and receive rewards approx. 10%). With Liquid Staking, they are still locking their assets with Metapool and receiving staking rewards BUT now they also receive stNEAR, a token that represents their stake. This token can now be used elsewhere in the Defi ecosystem for leverage: i.e. put down as collateral and take out USD loan.
2. Recent S[taking and Collaterals AMA Featuring Metapool and OIN Finance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L7GJUKLeQw)
3. OIN Finance enters the picture; they'll be among the first platforms to receive stNEAR to issue a Near Native USD stable coin (similar to MakerDao and DAI).
4. ATM the OIN token doesn't really do much, but it has been said by the team during other AMAs that fee share to token holders is coming (DYOR).
5. OIN is a multi chain protocol, but I believe that even with just the Near integration they could fly.

At the core of the investment thesis above is that OIN is dramatically cheap right now. Market Cap is around $4m with fully diluted under $20m. With such low valuations, and such strong integrations coming up, I am pretty bullish on this one. \* NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE \*

Let me know what you think?"
OMNI [4.7M Market cap] [0 days old],https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetDegens/comments/p9hpqp/omni_47m_market_cap_0_days_old/,OPMHERO,1,2021-08-23 02:17:09,13,/r/SatoshiStreetDegens/comments/p9hpqp/omni_47m_market_cap_0_days_old/,,"OMNIA DeFi aims to be the biggest real world assets tokenisation platform by 2030 🥇 Entering the largeset undisrupted market ($280+ Trillion)❤️

Everybody’s doing fractional co-ownership projects these days, or turning physical art into an NFT, but OMNIA is more than that. OMNIA is all about creating win-win situations for people; here’s how they do that

• Making high value assets easily accessible &amp; investable, lowering entry point for wealth creation

\* Focusing on the developing world and the unbanked 

\* Focusing on indexing before derivatives

\* Allowing young people the chance to enter the real estate market from a younger age

\* Liquidity for the middle class

Here’s how it works:

• $500M worth of fine art &amp; real estate ready to tokenise with the goal of $1bn by the end of 2022

• 3 Tokens (Exchange &amp; Utility Token, Asset Token and Stable Coin)

• Unique business model (Token price is linked with how successful the business is)

• 10% of tokens will be placed as AR tokens on the moon (think Pokemon go)

• Aiming to be the largest tokenisation platform by 2030 (3 Trillion dollars)

They’ve been building in super stealth mode until earlier this month, focusing on building a robust &amp; scalable business plan. 

• Team has worked at Danske Bank, US legal department and IOHK

• Advisors work with YFDAI, MAKERDAO &amp; Disney

• Recent coverage in The Capital- more press in the coming weeks 

• Certified GDPR practitioner, focusing majority of her time on compliance

• Smart contracts successfully audited by Blockchain Consilium

• Cyber security checks later in the month

&amp;#x200B;

$OMNIA will have three coins!

$OMNIA- about to go into its presale 

OAT- will be created after full regulatory approval

OSC- Stable coin packed by the pool of OATS

🚀 \*\*The pre sale is about to start, make sure you don’t miss out on this low cap gem\* 💥 :

• Major Marketing and Branding Experts added to the team (Marketing team is now 11 people, with the recent addition one of the minds behind CUMROCKET) 🤯

• Major Partnership in the Works (unnamed for now as fine details are being ironed out) 🧐

• Legal Entity Created 🏢

• Staking and Farming available at launch🧳

• Aggressive burn mechanisms 👨‍👦‍👦

• Real asset oracle🚀 

• Compliant in AML, GDPR, KYC 💎

• Exchange listing later this year 👀

• SUPER 🔥🔥🔥 MARKETING PUSH

• OMNIA is bringing fair trade to crypto!   
 

Other than lowering the barrier for wealth creation, the Omnia DeFi tokens can serve as the blockchain layer of infrastructure for many developing nations! (The modern day equivalent of building railroads or highways) Think Google but for indexing real world assets that can be traded. 

Omnia DeFi will be getting full regulatory approval before creating OAT asset tokens.

Furthermore the OMINA DeFi team will reply to any question you have regarding the business, they’re so transparent!

OMNIA’S potential far surpasses popular cryptocurrencies. 🗻 Entering one of the largest undisrupted markets with less than 1% being digitised to date. Think about how disruptive Google or Uber was to the traditional markets🗳 

Charitas’ community is attentive to global events and pivots to raise money for disaster relief. 🌋 With their newest team members putting together processes to vet and onboard charities to their platform, they will be the premier charity token. 

THEY ARE THE CRYPTO BUILT FOR CHARITY FOR A REASON.

Furthermore their commitment to social impact is really good to see, I dont know about you guys but I got into the space because of the equality, fairness and empowerment crypto brings to us… OMNIA does just that

"Marnotaur AMA session with GAINS: development, raising funds, $TAUR token and the team",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Platinum_QDAO/comments/p9wf1y/marnotaur_ama_session_with_gains_development/,Platinum_QDAO,1,2021-08-23 17:42:26,2,/r/u_Platinum_QDAO/comments/p9wf1y/marnotaur_ama_session_with_gains_development/,,"https://preview.redd.it/mukbqq66w2j71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5692da8a4b0022a2c6921c094ea535f4b7561a24

Marnotaur recently held an AMA session with GAINS. Our team gave answers to some interesting queries about the platform, held a quiz for the community and replied to questions asked by the community on social media. 

GAINS is the only crypto community to provide both events that involve interaction with crypto companies and investment opportunities. These events give us a chance to understand the crypto and blockchain space better and help us to make more educated investment decisions. The main events are usually AMAs (Ask Me Anything) and quizzes. Communication and connection with people is at the heart of human nature, that’s why GAINS decided to hold an AMA session with their audience. 

## Marnotaur AMA session results

During the AMA session, the Marnotaur team answered several questions about the platform. First of all, GAINS asked about our project and our team, specifically what experience it had before crypto. We were also asked about raising funds, the development stage and the value of our ecosystem. 

The answers to these questions gave us an opportunity to share information about the Marnotaur protocol and its design. During the session, we explained that Marnotaur is a liquidity protocol that allows traders, farmers and liquidity providers to multiply their gains. Our project is self-funded and we are now working with MakerDAO to launch an IDO on BSC and the launch of a Community Round to reward our first users. $TAUR is the utility token of the Marnotaur platform and it has several uses: as rewards for providing liquidity, staking and farming, as well as powering platform governance.

In addition to the AMA session, there was a special quiz. A quiz is basically a reverse AMA: the project team asks questions about the product, technology, strategy and more. AMA session participants answer these questions, usually whilst joking and chatting together. The quiz consisted of 4 questions. The questions were about Marnotaur: what it is; what chains it will support; if there are any trade restrictions; what actions are not available on the platform and so on. Our team also replied to several questions posted on Twitter.

## About GAINS

GAINS started over 2 years ago and is now one of the biggest and most respected crypto communities. The project has raised several million dollars for many ICOs and has organized lots of events with companies. At these events, you can: learn more about crypto and blockchain; share and discuss your ideas; and compete for prizes (sometimes worth over $1,000) by asking questions or sharing your knowledge. GAINS members have the opportunity to invest in the latest and best crypto projects. You can track all your investments easily with GAINS. 

GAINS believes in quality over quantity, they always offer much fewer deals but of much higher quality. They have a community of several thousand members on Telegram and Discord. After joining, you will be able to discuss ideas, projects and crypto in general with experienced crypto enthusiasts who are ready to help you better understand this complex ecosystem.

They are pegged to the native currency they are meant to represent and that should be the end of it. 

Right? 

**Unfortunately not quite.** Haha. I'm like Dr. Suess. 

Not all Stablecoins are created equal, and I'm here today to talk to you about what makes each of our most boring crypto investments special. 

**USDC** 

USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, and governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. USDC boasts the ""largest Stablecoin ecosystem"" used by hundreds of companies, exchanges, Defi protocols, etc. 

With 27.3 Billion in circulation, USDC is massive. It's a Coinbase darling, and it's widely used and accepted as the Stablecoin standard. 

USDC is largely backed, so it wouldn't have a Tether situation. Which for those who don't know is the FED of crypto. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. 

**DAI** 

My personal favorite. 

The first decentralized, collateral-backed Stablecoin, DAI maintains a 1:1 value with the US dollar by locking other cryptocurrencies into contracts. 

This means that unlike other asset-backed cryptocurrencies, which may be issued by for-profit companies, DAI is the product of an open-source software called the Maker Protocol, a decentralized application running on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

As such, DAI maintains its value not by being backed by U.S. dollars custodied by a company, but by using collateralized debt denominated in Ethereum. 

**How DAI works**

The Maker Protocol, through smart contracts running on Ethereum, enables borrowers to lock ETH and other crypto assets, thus collateralizing it, in order to generate new DAI tokens in the form of loans. 

If borrowers wish to recover the locked ETH, they will have to return the DAI to the protocol and pay a fee. In the event of liquidation, the Maker Protocol will take the collateral and sell it using an internal market-based auction mechanism.

If users want to acquire DAI, they can spend ETH to purchase the dollar equivalent amount in DAI on an exchange or they can collateralize ETH and other assets using the Maker Protocol. 

The latter method allows users who do not want to sell their assets to still acquire DAI.

Collateralized Debt positions 

Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) are the smart contracts on the Maker Protocol that users can leverage to lock their collateral assets (i.e., ETH or BAT) and generate DAI. 

CDPs can be thought of as secure vaults for storing the aforementioned collateral. To account for the volatility in the crypto collateral, DAI is often over-collateralized, meaning that the deposit amount required is typically higher than the value of DAI.

For example, users must spend $200 in ETH in order to receive $100 DAI, which is meant to account for the potential decrease in the value ETH. As a result, if ETH depreciates by 25%, the $100 in DAI would still be safely collateralized by $150 in ETH. 

In order to recover the stored ETH, the user has to return the DAI and pay a stability fee.



**Supply the DAI** 

Due to its design, the supply of DAI cannot be altered by any party in the network. Rather, it is maintained through a system of smart contracts designed to dynamically respond to changes in the market price of the assets in its contracts. Again, avoiding a Tether situation. 

DAI was founded in 2014 by the foundation that would become MakerDAO, launching officially in 2017.

**Tether**

* Aave (AVE) - Similar to Compound, Aave is a borrowing and lending protocol but instead provides uncollateralized loans, more in line with the traditional financial sector.

* Synthetix (SNX) - allows for the creation and trading of derivatives on a wide range of assets (stocks, currencies, commodities) through its derivatives issuance protocol.

* Uniswap (UNI) - is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that uses smart contracts and automated liquidity protocols to facilitate the exchange of crypto assets.

* Yearn.finance (YRN) - provides an autonomous protocol that searches for the best yields across the DeFi space and automatically invests in them."

I’ve heard it’s over-collateralized and that MakerDAO regulates it and that’s all great, but can I effectively treat putting cash into DAI for staking as putting it into a savings account with crazy high interest? Of course, I know that’s not what it is and there are risks, but how big are those risks? Is it realistically possible for DAI to get “unpegged” from $1.00?"

Find out what are the main DeFi networks available in the cryptocurrency market,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReefDeFi/comments/pbskb4/find_out_what_are_the_main_defi_networks/,yokesh351,1,2021-08-26 12:53:20,3,/r/ReefDeFi/comments/pbskb4/find_out_what_are_the_main_defi_networks/,,"As already presented in other series, the universe of decentralized finance (DeFi) is quite wide. With this, the investor can have access to a wide range of financial services and products and even investments in works of art, such as NFT. However, what are the most secure and reliable DeFi protocols on this market? Many DeFi protocols have come under attack throughout 2021. This type of failure often causes both direct token theft and massive price devaluation. In either case, the investor can suffer huge losses if he invests in an unknown or poorly secure protocol.

Therefore, this text will present the main networks and protocols that exist in the DeFi market. Through them, it will be possible to start your research and investments with more security and practicality. In this text, we are going to know and understand more about these protocols, the most known of which are the following:

* AAVE ;
* Maker ;
* Compound ;
* Curve Finance;
* Synthetix ;
* Chainlink ;
* Uniswap .

Main DeFi Networks and Protocol Types Currently, most DeFi protocols basically work on two networks: Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Other networks, such as Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) are taking their first steps, but they still do not have large shares of this market. Generally speaking, DeFi protocols can be divided into the following categories:

* loan protocols;
* Yield Farming Protocols;
* Decentralized Exchanges (DEX);
* Asset tokenization;
* Arts and NFTs negotiation;
* Derivatives.

As presented in the first text in this series, one way to see which DeFi projects are safer is through the Total Allocated Value (TLV). The projects with the most money allocated from this list are also often the most used and safest. Therefore, they are the ones we will see later in this text.

In addition, it is important to assess which platforms are most sought after by investors. The aforementioned DeFi Pulse website, for example, brings the projects in order of TLV and also by categories. It is possible to deduce from the table below that, among other things, the most sought after modality by investors in DeFi is loans. After all, five of the ten protocols with the highest TLV are focused on this modality.

After loans, decentralized exchanges (DEX) appear with three projects among the largest. That is, 80% of the largest DeFi protocols are exchanges or borrowing platforms. Therefore, the great demand of investors is for 1) platforms that make it possible to receive returns on capital, and; 2) places to trade DeFi tokens.

Most of these projects run on Ethereum, the network that pioneered the popularization of DeFi and smart contracts. However, other networks have shown growth and, as a result, have stolen market shares. The main one, let's get to know the best known and most valuable projects within the [development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)network.

## AAVE

AAVE is a liquidity protocol that allows investors to earn interest by borrowing their cryptoactives . This protocol is non-custodial, that is, the borrowed crypto actives are under the custody of their owner and not of AAVE. In addition, the platform is decentralized and open source.

The protocol supports borrowing with various tokens, including stablecoins and other DeFi tokens. In this sense, AAVE brings a new investment option, especially for long-term holders. With the protocol, these investors can place their tokens to earn interest, thus generating passive income.

In this process, the entire operation is done through the connection of the wallets with the AAVE protocol. Thus, there is no need to transfer ownership of the tokens to a platform or place them in the custody of third parties. As there are no deposits, the protocol has no funds that can be stolen by hackers, for example

In other words, the AAVE is a safe way to create savings or passive income with cryptocurrencies. Interest rates are usually attractive, in many cases exceeding the double digits per year, and mostly compound interest. This is currently the largest DeFi protocol in terms of allocated value, with over $19 billion.

## Maker (MKR)

The MKR is the token that feeds the Maker, also known as the MakerDAO. As the name implies, MakerDAO functions as an Autonomous Decentralized Organization (DAO). In turn, this network is responsible for managing and issuing one of the best known stablecoins on the market: DAI.

DAI, in turn, is a stablecoin native to the DeFi market. Like the protocol, DAI is decentralized and, unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, does not have a central company or issuer. Therefore, network tokens cannot be confiscated or blocked.

Within the DeFi ecosystem, DAI serves as a way for investors to obtain a stable currency without having to sell their cryptocurrencies. For example, imagine an investor who has Ether ( ETH ), needs to borrow money, but doesn't want to get rid of his cryptocurrencies. He can borrow dollars via DAI, using his ETH tokens as collateral.

With this, the investor can use his position in ETH to obtain dollars via DAI. Such an operation has two clear advantages. The first is that there is no need to sell ETH. The second is a consequence of the first, since, by not selling the tokens, the investor will not have to pay capital gain taxes and other fees that could be charged in the transaction.

In addition, the MKR and DAI can be borrowed on multiple platforms, earning interest to their holders. The protocol was conceived in 2015 and launched in 2017. Since then, both the network and stablecoin have grown exponentially in value, reaching, at the time of writing this text, US$ 7.35 billion in allocated value.

## Compound (COMP)

Compound is another protocol that operates in the loans and interest segment. You can borrow or borrow up to 14 tokens, including stablecoins and DeFi tokens. The platform was also launched in 2018 and, since then, it has grown significantly both in use and in allocated value.

There are a number of liquidity pools in Compound and you can invest in one or more of them. When making this loan, the platform gives in exchange cTokens, which represent the amount invested. If you want to redeem your capital, the investor sells these tokens and redeems the invested capital.

Each token has its cToken version. Thus, whoever applies ETH in the protocol receives cETH, USDT applications yield cUSDT, and so on. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens against the underlying crypto-asset increases, and the investor can redeem them for more than the amount initially invested. This is how the protocol distributes your interest, whose fees can be seen on the website itself.

## Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) is a protocol used to exchange tokens created in the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are carried out in an automated way through smart contracts. Created in 2020, Uniswap saw its popularity explode along with DeFi and the launch of the UNI token in 2020.

As a DEX, Uniswap does not hold custody of any token traded on the platform. For trades to take place, the platform has people who use their tokens to provide liquidity to each traded pair. They are known as liquidity providers.

In exchange for providing liquidity, providers are rewarded with part of the fees charged by Uniswap. In this sense, DEX pays only transaction fees charged by the platform. In other words, trading through Uniswap provides lower costs and, with automation, more agility in operations.

## Yearn.finance (YFI)

The yearn.finance protocol was one of the first to take advantage of the rise of DeFi. It acts as an investment aggregator that enables investors to seek the best yields on the market. The protocol uses automation to always find the highest rates, boosting profitability for liquidity providers.

The project was launched in February 2020 and was an almost immediate success. In just three months, the YFI token came to cost US$ 82,745, a historic high reached in May. By way of comparison, the BTC cost $8,804 at the same time. In other words, YFI was worth almost ten times more than the main cryptocurrency on the market.

Even today, yearn.finance is one of the best known DeFi income projects. Although it lost space, the protocol made history by calling attention to the advantages of the DeFi market. Besides, of course, it was one of the few tokens in history that managed to surpass the unit value of BTC.

## Synthetix (SNX)

The name Synthetix comes from the English word Synthetic, which means synthetic. The word itself was a great inspiration for what the platform does: creating synthetic assets. In other words, Synthetix creates tokens that represent real assets such as stocks, derivatives, or even cryptocurrencies.

The network was launched in 2017 through Ethereum, but gained prominence from 2020. The protocol works through synths, synthetic assets that can replicate almost anything, from the price of oil and cryptocurrencies to the highest stock indexes in the world .

Synths track and provide returns based on the underlying asset without requiring the investor to directly hold the asset. In this way, Synthetix provides access to traditional market investments through tokenization. The protocol has advantages such as security, 24-hour operation and fast liquidity.

Other DeFi Networks So far, the protocols seen in this text have been built on Ethereum, which is, in fact, the main core network for DeFi. However, Ethereum also has its limitations, especially in the high price of fees, which brought difficulties for small investors. In this sense, other DeFi networks started to gain space in the market.

Networks like Polygon – formerly Matic – seek to increase the scalability of Ethereum and have grown in value. Others, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), have lower rates as one of their differentials. As a result, projects with less capital can run their operations without having to worry that network congestion will increase transaction prices.

Recently, BSC broke its daily transaction record by reaching more than 12 million transactions on July 29, 2021. The amount was almost ten times greater than transactions handled by Ethereum on the same day, as shown in the chart below. This achievement demonstrates not only the growth of the network, but the demand that still exists in the DeFi market.

Finally, the [development of the DeFi](https://www.blockchainx.tech/decentralized-finance-defi-development) ecosystem is quite broad, which means that new projects are always popping up. At the same time, protocols that seemed promising disappear or lose relevance. Keeping up to date and paying attention to which networks are more or less secure is essential for investors to be able to keep their capital protected and, at the same time, not be left out of this great revolution."
Marnotaur’s AMA session with CryptoKudasaiJP,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Platinum_QDAO/comments/pbu2bz/marnotaurs_ama_session_with_cryptokudasaijp/,Platinum_QDAO,1,2021-08-26 14:46:03,4,/r/u_Platinum_QDAO/comments/pbu2bz/marnotaurs_ama_session_with_cryptokudasaijp/,,"https://preview.redd.it/86gtkuk9fnj71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebe7dc7b1d8ff7f14f90cf11d2d84a960cf9d5f8

We are glad to present you with a summary of the recent AMA session Marnotaur held on August 24th with CryptoKudasaiJP - a Japanese Blockchain KOL community and investment group. The AMA session included several preset questions and a live Q&amp;A. During the session, the Marnotaur team answered questions about its technologies, top milestones, the $TAUR utility token, current partnerships and main goals. 

**What we talked about**

We started the AMA session by introducing our project and team. We informed the audience that the Marnotaur team consists of 10 IT specialists and more than 15 specialists from other fields. We also explained the advantages of project Marnotaur, such as the distribution of liquidation fees to stakeholders, liquidity provision, leverage of up to 5x and the rebalancing of leveraged positions.

Then we were asked about our notable technologies and we explained that our team had developed a liquidity protocol for secure margin with insufficient collateral. 

There was a question about Marnotaur’s top milestones and we discussed the fact that we have already developed a mechanism for Shadow staking native tokens and smart contracts, for liquidity pools and for opening leveraged positions. We also completed the Chainlink price integration, the Rinkeby testnet and rebranded ‘5x Margin Tool’ to ‘Marnotaur’. We also shared our main goals for this year - the successful launch of the platform and increasing the number of platforms, pools and projects we offer. And we said that any obstacles we faced were overcome successfully. 

Then we had an opportunity to talk about our utility token $TAUR. This token will be used for rewarding liquidity providers, stakeholders, farmers and it will be used for the platform’s governance. We also have a Buy &amp; Burn program that reduces the number of tokens in circulation and makes the token more valuable.

The Marnotaur team shared part of its marketing strategy: to create local communities supported by local KOLs and our support team, which we have already achieved. Moreover, we have formed many partnerships that are helping us to develop and promote the product. We were delighted to list some of our partnerships with strategic investors such as 7percent Ventures, Avalaunch, OneMax, Hyperion Decimus, GAINS Associates, Follow the Seed, DCAP, Lemonode, Mars Academy and many others. 

In addition, we were asked about the team’s source revenue and investors. We explained that our project is self-funded but that we plan to raise funds from large Venture Capitals. Right now, we are working with MakerDAO to launch our IDO on BSC. 

There was a question about hacking and security and we gladly shared that our platform is preparing to release a testnet for our community. The security of funds will be guaranteed by decentralized smart contracts, which have been audited and found to be reliable. We also mentioned that the smart contracts will be open-source. 

Then we answered several questions posed by the community in the chat group. Our team was asked about leveraged trading and we were pleased to explain how it works. First of all, the platform generates a personal smart contract when you make your first deposit. This contract works as a remote wallet, which automatically borrows funds in the same currency that you deposit. After that, you can start trading on our platform but you can’t withdraw funds until you repay the loan to the liquidity provider that you borrowed funds from. 5x leverage will be available for the first stage of the project and in the future, we are planning to increase it. 

We also had a great opportunity to share the reasons why you should choose us. First of all, to take advantage of leverage, you shouldn’t go through KYC/AML or perform other actions. Moreover, we will have unique features such as liquidation revenue sharing, capital efficiency, cross-chain support and popular DEX integrations.

Then there was a question about liquidity keepers and we explained that every trader in the system has a person who helps them avoid losses by closing positions in a timely manner. Each keeper has an opportunity to receive rewards for liquidating positions. Since Marnotaur is part of the DeFi family, our Liquidity Keepers are always ready to liquidate positions if the initial margin is not enough to cover the loan and its interest. We are doing everything we can for the safety of our liquidity providers. 

In addition, we mentioned that for beginners as well as professional traders, there is a lot of educational content on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarnotaurMarginTrading).

## About Marnotaur

Marnotaur is a liquidity protocol for secure under-collateralized margin that allows traders, farmers, liquidity providers and keepers to increase their profits. Marnotaur allows traders to deposit their funds in a smart contract and then trade on a DEX with 5x leverage, which is nearly 250% higher than current DeFi margin standards.

 **About Maker (MKR)**

Maker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol:

1. MakerDAO: A decentralized organization to manage DAI, a community-managed, fully decentralized stable coin whose value is pegged to the US dollar.
2. Maker Protocol: A DeFi lending platform based on Ethereum that allows users to take out loans by locking-in collateral in exchange for Dai.

MKR tokens serve as voting shares for the organization managing DAI. MKR gives the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol.

"According to reports, the SEC has hired a blockchain analytics firm to keep an eye on the DeFi business",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pdgwq0/according_to_reports_the_sec_has_hired_a/,-Aporia,1,2021-08-29 04:07:44,3,/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pdgwq0/according_to_reports_the_sec_has_hired_a/,NEWS,"According to reports, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has inked a $125,000 agreement with blockchain analytics startup AnChain. Artificial intelligence will be used to monitor and control the decentralized finance industry. MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave, and Xfinite are just a few of the major platforms.

An [AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI) business representative confirmed the deal with the federal regulator to Forbes on Friday, adding the SEC and blockchain startup have the opportunity to sign up to five separate one-year contracts for $125,000 each, for a total of $625,000. According to reports, the first contract began in May.

“The SEC is extremely interested in learning more about what is going on in the area of smart contract-based digital assets,” said Victor Fang, CEO, and co-founder of [AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI). “We're giving them technologies to evaluate and track smart contracts,” says the company.

Following SEC chair Gary Gensler's call for decentralized finance, or DeFi, initiatives to register with the agency, saying they are ""decentralized in some respects but extremely centralized in others,"" the government body and the blockchain business have reportedly reached an agreement. According to Gensler, DeFi platform developers and others may create a centralized team that falls under the SEC's regulatory umbrella. The SEC recently stated that it has filed an enforcement action in the first case involving securities employing DeFi technology.

The sector has a market value of more over $126 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Uniswap is the biggest decentralized exchange by volume, with over $1 billion in DeFi tokens moved in the previous 24 hours; its UNI token is also the most valuable, with a market valuation of $14.2 billion.

[AnChain.AI](https://AnChain.AI) is a blockchain analytics company based in California that analyzes crypto transactions across several public and private chains. According to Forbes, the company has created methods to make its business more ""preventive,"" recognizing suspect addresses and transactions rather of waiting until a hack or other problem occurs to investigate."

Why bother owning governance tokens?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdt6u4/why_bother_owning_governance_tokens/,Wilmotac,1,2021-08-29 18:55:55,43,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdt6u4/why_bother_owning_governance_tokens/,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"So I'm primarily thinking of tokens whose only purpose is for governance (Uniswap, MakerDAO), so this doesn't really apply to tokens that distribute some of the protocol fees to governance token holders.

Where do these tokens get their value from? Uniswap is an amazing platform, but you don't need to own Uniswap to use Uniswap. The same goes for most DeFi protocol governance tokens. The vast majority of holders are never going to use their tokens for voting, so what is the purpose of holding these tokens?

Governance token holders, please inform me as to why you buy and hold governance tokens."

* Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution based on the Optimistic rollup protocol. 
   * It will facilitate low-cost smart contracts with high throughput while leveraging the security and decentralized features of Ethereum.
   * There is no Arbitrum token, the protocol is built on-top of the Ethereum blockchain. 
   * Arbitrum users will essentially be opening 'bar tabs' on the Ethereum network, allowing users to make several transactions and 'roll the up' as one bulk transaction at a later time.

&amp;#x200B;

* Transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain is too damn high for everyday users, especially during times of network congestion where fees can cost more than $20. 
   * It claims to reduce Ethereum gas fees by more than 50x. 
   * Average gas fees for the Ethereum network right now costs $5 - $7. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Arbitrum is onboarding AAVE, Curve, MakerDAO, Sushiswap, Uniswap, and Cream Finance, among other dapps built on Ethereum.
   * The aforementioned dapps are 'blue-chips' with more than $1B in total-value-locked (TVL), in total they share $38B in TVL. 
   * There's currently $110B in Ethereum's defi ecosystem or more than 70% of all of defi. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Bonus: Cryptocurrency's MOON token is built on the Arbitrum network. With a public mainnet launch, we could possibly see easy to access liquidity pools for MOONs. 
* Note: For the first few months, it will be semi-centralized to ensure the safety of the protocol and funds while users get familiarized with the protocol[.](https://imgur.com/a/3gmcBIO)"

At times like this it's hard to keep track of the space so here's a run-down of what's happening in Defi.

Total value locked in Defi is currently sitting at an all-time-high of $169B, breaking the previous ATH of $154 set back in May 2021. Since June, Defi added $62M! But this only accounts for 7.5% of all of the money in crypto right now. Here are the major chains to look out for by alphabetic order:

1. **Arbitrum**, a built-in layer 2\* solution for Ethereum, just launched it's public mainnet on August 31, expecting *blue chip* defi dapps like AAVE, Curve, MakerDao, Sushiswap, and Uniswap to integrate soon. One of their partners Huobi, a centralized exchange, also has announced support for direct withdrawals to Arbitrum, which will allow users to circumvent Ethereum's gas fees when moving assets. 
2. **Avalanche** has an ongoing liquidity mining incentive pool worth $180M, seeking to attract users into their network. They recently announced a $15M allocation to Sushiswap and we're still awaiting news on the likes of AAVE and Curve's allocation.
3. **Celo**, a mobile-first defi platform that recently launched, also raised $100M for ""educational initiatives, grants, and incentives,"" with a $34M allocation split between the usual culprits: AAVE, Curve, and Sushiswap. 
4. **Cardano's** *Alonzo Purple* hard for is a public testnet due to launch of September 12, the culmination of more than three years of development. 
5. **Terra Luna's,** a Layer 1 chain known for it's influence on the Korean demographic, *Columbus-5* upgrade will take effect on September 9 and will introduce a similar upgrade to Ethereum's burn mechanism (EIP-1559). For Terra Luna, they will burn all *Seigniorage* or the cost to produce their native token, LUNA, effectively making it a deflationary token.
6. **Optimism,** another built-in Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, recently added a bridge for all ERC-20 tokens, which removes the added step of swapping for users who want to bridge from Ethereum to Optimism. Optimism is one of few chains that was able to pull Uniswap, which is still the king of DEXes, trading $1.5B a day; almost three-time more than it's closest competitor PancakeSwap.
7. **Solana**, one of the fastest Layer 1 chains, just launched *Igntion*, a hackathon with up to $5M in prizes, for developers to add to their budding ecosystem and build more defi, NFTs, and gaming applications. 
8. **Fantom,** a highly scalable Layer 1 launched in 2019, recently announced a $370M incentive program for developers to build on their network. Fantom's TVL is up 48% in the past week, the highest among the networks aged +3 months. 

That's a total of nine networks with major updates over the past month either through incentive programs, which will benefit developers and/or defi users, or mainnet launches. And that's only the *recent* news. 

https://preview.redd.it/o3myx5cco3l71.png?width=2076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=921c377fddbe8b6d97ef002d3d2dec7b2343d2f9

Other chains like Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon are still trodding on and building more and more partnerships along with sleeping giants like Harmony, Tezos, and xDai. And Polkadot isn't even here yet. We're also seeing Dapps integrating on different networks. Sushiswap, for example, is currently building on eight different chains! Ridiculous progress! I'm sure a the chart above will experience some major changes in next few months.

*Which chains do you think will come out on the top of the mountain? Which networks have you had your best experience one? And distributed do you think the defi sector will be?*"

Using MakerDAO to materialize gains and retain exposure,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/phs1jl/using_makerdao_to_materialize_gains_and_retain/,CrazybutSolid,1,2021-09-04 21:59:14,4,/r/defi/comments/phs1jl/using_makerdao_to_materialize_gains_and_retain/,,"Hey guys, I thought of a strategy to materialize gains without paying taxes in the US and keep the exposure. Please help me find the flaws in my plan:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Deposit 10 ETH in [OAsis.app](https://OAsis.app)

2) Borrow at today's rate 10k DAI

3) Exchange 10k DAI for 10k USD

4) Do whatever I want with those USD.

From what I gather ([https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/](https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/)) I should not pay taxes at all since technically I have not made any gains.

I never intend to pay the loan. Three scenarios:

1) ETH goes up: I take out more DAI and repeat steps above. Still not taxable right?

2) ETH goes down: MakerDao liquidates part of my ETH to pay back my debt, I should pay taxes, but normally I won't since ETH's value is lower than when I bought it

3) My debt catches up with the minimum collateral %: MakerDAO liquidates. If ETH went down, no taxes. If ETH went up, I do have to pay taxes, but ETH had gone up so I can probably afford it without sweating it.

This seems to me like a win/win/win scenario. What am I missing?

Thanks!"

# Introduction

In this crypto space, it is all about innovation. One of the key innovations today is the development of stablecoin mechanisms. The types of stablecoin mechanisms today are so varied that 2017's classification is not applicable. Today, stablecoin is more than just the classification of on-chain collateral, off-chain collateral and algorithmic stablecoin.

In addition, stablecoins have different objectives and reasons for existence. Because of these varying objectives, different types of stablecoins were born. Many of them have failed and only a few familiar faces remain. In this article, we share how to discuss the stablecoin toolkit to classify stablecoins.

# 2017 Stablecoin Mechanisms

In 2017 there was a very brilliant report that classified stablecoins into three kinds of mechanisms. It is not available anymore, but it was a popular article that everyone quoted.

## 1. On-chain stablecoins

These are coins like $DAI from MakerDAO where you take and keep on-chain assets like $ETH, $USDC, $YFI or $LINK. Then create stablecoins out of it. You take on-chain assets and use them as collaterals to mint $DAI.

## 2. Off-chain collateral

Off-chain collateral is where you give your money to someone and get the equivalent amount in crypto. Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD. An example is $USDC which is managed by Coinbase — you send USD to Coinbase and it gives you crypto USD. Every 1 $USDC is backed by 1 USD in the Coinbase bank.

## 3. Algo stablecoins

Algo stablecoins can be classified as different kinds of rebasing mechanisms. Examples are $UST (TerraUSD on the $LUNA network), or Amperforth, as well as mechanisms like Empty Set Dollar and Dynamic Set Dollar. $FEI is also considered algo stablecoin. We did the recent analysis here.

# 2021 Stablecoin Mechanism

Today, we have a better way to classify these mechanisms. Shoutout to Amani Moin, Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi for their great research paper.

## Reserves

Most of these stablecoins are backed by reserves. Just like after World War II when the world economy was recovering, and a lot of currencies were volatile. Money was backed by gold and every central bank had gold in the bank. When they printed currency like 1 USD, it was worth that amount of gold in the reserve. This means that the **stablecoin can be redeemed for the underlying reserve**.

The reserves then were gold but today it could be a lot of things like on-chain collaterals or off-chain collaterals. It could be like a MakerDAO where you have a lot of different kinds of currencies like $ETH, $YFI or $AAVE. Or it could be off-chain collaterals like gold, US dollars, Japanese yen, etc. Reserves are used to create mechanisms to determine stablecoins with low volatility.

## Dual Token

When we talk about stablecoins, we are talking about a coin with low volatility or a coin that does not move much. But the truth is that a lot of things actually do still move and there is a lot of volatility in the space.

The dual token model has **one token that is stable while the other token absorbs the volatility**. When prices go up or down the secondary token absorbs the volatility. The secondary token could do a lot of other things but the main purpose is to absorb volatility so that it does not impact the stablecoin.

## Algo stablecoins

An algo stablecoin is about creating a stablecoin **defined by math**. The math changes according to different market changes, to allow the stablecoin to remain at its peg value (e.g., $1).

You can change the math if you want (e.g., multi-sig governance) or if the governance votes for it (e.g., DAO). Algo stablecoins come in many different types. You have a rebasing model, a bond-like model, and a debt-like model.

## Mixed

A mixed mechanism is a combination of two or a combination of all of the mechanisms; these mechanisms need not exist alone. In stablecoins, one mechanism is not the end and you can mix them up because they serve different kinds of purposes and have a different kind of volatility. You can hedge against volatility in a variety of ways.

Thus, we have four mechanisms in 2021.

 

**TLDR**:

Although, stablecoin is no stranger to many people, it is still developing and improving the existing advantages — from creating the first stablecoins to having them automatically adjust to the market. These adaptations are something to be proud of, but is every market phase the same?  
As we can see, the Stablecoin market is a ""play ground"" for projects that fully answer the three questions above. In the future, we will see a variety of complex stablecoins, including many tools that aid in securing the anchor. This is a topic that will be discussed further in the future."
What is decentralized finance (DeFi)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Owl2102/comments/pliknd/what_is_decentralized_finance_defi/,No-Owl2102,1,2021-09-10 18:43:28,0,/r/u_No-Owl2102/comments/pliknd/what_is_decentralized_finance_defi/,,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5e5wbgpdnnm71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4787e92065fe60830a39bf34e702b7f5c8241b5

DeFi is a blockchain-based form of finance that uses smart contracts on blockchains, the most common of which is Ethereum, to offer traditional financial instruments rather than relying on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks. People can use DeFi platforms to lend or borrow money from others, trade cryptocurrencies, insure themselves against hazards, and earn income in savings accounts.

# Decentralized finance (DeFi) explained

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is an umbrella word for a multitude of public blockchain applications and projects aimed at challenging the existing finance world. DeFi refers to financial applications built on blockchain technologies, generally employing smart contracts, and is inspired by blockchain technology. Smart contracts are enforceable agreements that are automated and can be accessible by anyone with an internet connection. They do not require any middlemen to execute and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

# Why smart contracts?

Most smart contracts include Turing Complete programming languages, which allow numerous parties to interact without the need for a centralized middleman. The ability of blockchain to take use of smart contracts has made it an attractive platform for developing financial applications.

# How did DeFi get its start?

DeFi, according to some, began in 2009 with the debut of Bitcoin, the first peer-to-peer digital currency built on top of the blockchain network. The idea of introducing transformation into the traditional financial world via blockchains became a necessary next step in the decentralization of legacy financial institutions thanks to Bitcoin. All of this was made possible with the development of Ethereum and, more especially, smart contracts in 2015. The Ethereum network is a second-generation blockchain that was the first to fully use the technology’s potential in the financial sector. It incentivizes firms and enterprises to develop and deploy projects that make up the DeFi ecosystem.

DeFi provided a wealth of opportunities for creating a transparent and robust financial system that is not controlled by a single company. However, 2017 saw the beginning of a new era for financial applications, with initiatives allowing for more than just money transfers.

# Challenges within centralized finance

Bitcoin and other early cryptocurrencies were only decentralized in terms of issuance and storage, despite the fact that they were designed to allow individuals complete control over their assets. Until the advent of smart contracts, which enabled DeFi, providing access to a broader set of financial instruments remained a challenge.

# DeFi protocols and how they work

Here’s an overview of the most popular DeFi use cases and protocols available in the market today:

# DeFi lending and borrowing

By allowing lending and borrowing, DeFi gave finance a new path. Decentralized financing, often known as “Open Finance,” provided crypto holders with chances to earn annual returns on their investments. Individuals might borrow money at a set interest rate thanks to decentralized borrowing. The goal of lending and borrowing is to meet the demands of the bitcoin community while also serving financial sector use cases.

# Decentralized exchanges

Decentralized Exchanges (DEx) are one of DeFi’s most important features, as they lock the most capital compared to other DeFi protocols. DExs enable users to trade tokens for other assets without the need for a centralized middleman or custodian. Traditional exchanges (centralized exchanges) provide similar services, but the investments available are subject to the will and costs of the exchange. Another disadvantage of CExs is the additional cost of each transaction, which is addressed with DExs.

## Top decentralized exchange: Uniswap

Founded in 2018 by Hayden Adams, UniSwap is the largest automated token exchange by trading volume deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was launched after receiving grants from multiple capital ventures, including the Ethereum Foundation. UniSwap automated transactions between cryptocurrencies through smart contract.

## How does it work?

UniSwap today offers three functionalities: Swapping tokens, adding liquidity, and removing liquidity.

**Swapping tokens**

1. Users are required to create an account on [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) to utilize this service.
2. Once a Metamask account is created, users can select tokens they own to swap for another type of cryptocurrency.

**Adding liquidity**

1. To provide liquidity, users deposit an equivalent value of tokens into the token’s associated exchange contract
2. Once you have tokens for liquidity, you can add them to a “pool” on the UniSwap interface.
3. Users who provide liquidity on UniSwap earn exchange fees, calculated per the value of tokens offered for liquidity.

**Removing liquidity**

1. You can remove the liquidity on UniSwap by merely choosing the ‘Remove Liquidity’ option from a drop-down menu.

# Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a feasible answer to the volatility issues that plague cryptocurrencies, and they are assisting DeFi in gaining popularity. Stablecoins’ value is tied to a generally stable item, such as gold or the US dollar, in order to maintain its price consistent. Stablecoins were beneficial in the crypto ecosystem during risk-off periods, providing a safe refuge for investors and traders. They are a reliable collateral asset because of their stability. Stablecoins are also used in liquidity pools, which are a significant aspect of the DeFi ecosystem and DExs.

## MakerDAO

Founded in 2015 by Rune Christensen, [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/en/) is an organization building technology for savings, borrowing, lending, and a stable cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was one of the earliest DeFi protocols. Instead of conducting an ICO, the project privately sold $MKR tokens to fund the development over time. $DAI, Maker’s stablecoin, was launched in 2018 and has experienced significant traction.

**How does MakerDAO work?**

The protocol works like this:

* A user can send or deposit $ETH to a smart contract on Maker’s protocol and create a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). This will enables the ability to take $DAI at a specific collateralization rate.
* Suppose the price of $ETH drops in the future. In that case, the CDP of a user will automatically be closed to ensure the network has enough capital locked against the borrowed tokens. This can be prevented by putting in more $ETH or taking out less DAI in the first place.
* $ETH can be claimed back by paying back the amount, with the addition of a small fee.

# The future of DeFi

Through the advancement of distributed ledger technologies, we are witnessing a quantum jump in the new functionality of money. For the first time in history, the people of the world are shaping a global financial system. Everyone can participate in DeFi protocol governance and have a seat at the table where the world of decentralized finance is actively constructed.

Despite some of the challenges that come with working on the cutting edge of innovation, the world of decentralized banking is on the road to prosperity. When the power to construct financial services is democratized, it’s difficult to forecast how this field will evolve over time. However, when DeFI and fintech intersect and integrate, we’ll reach a tipping point where fledgling financial technology becomes a component of a new financial system. One that embodies the ideals of speed, security, accessibility, and equality."
Summary of One Question A Day Event on SubDAO,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SubDAO/comments/plkqw9/summary_of_one_question_a_day_event_on_subdao/,SubDAO,1,2021-09-10 21:10:36,0,/r/u_SubDAO/comments/plkqw9/summary_of_one_question_a_day_event_on_subdao/,,"&amp;#x200B;

[Summary of One Question A Day Event on SubDAO](https://preview.redd.it/2mofyyiu3nm71.png?width=4001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d635e1d464a288d923de184d7a1a2bba565226a3)

&amp;#x200B;

We are glad to announce that the One Question A Day event has been completed. All participants show their enthusiasm and wisdom in the event which provides a chance that can help the community know more about SubDAO and its ecosystem.

In order to help more members understand SubDAO, we make a summary of all questions and answers from two rounds of events. Check and learn it now!

### Round 1

1. **How does SubDAO make a contribution to developers?**

The SubDAO will run as a parachain to provide specific services. The various DAO templates and SubDAO Airfone will alleviate the burden on developers to maintain DAOs and to create DApps linked with DAOs.

The initial governors of a DAO can easily create a cross-chain DAO with only a few clicks without any tech skills at all. Developers who are willing to build DApps can give the governance to communities by using SubDAO to create the very DAO connected to DApp through SubDAO Airfone.

And the OCW (O-chain Worker) provides the ability to access the o-chain world, which would empower SubDAO to access external data rather than only On-chain data, such as the price of stable coins, the contributions on Github, and so on.

**2. Which part is the fundament of the SubDAO network in the component of SubDAO?**

SubDAO Node is the customized chain node for the SubDAO network built by Substrate 2.0. It’s the fundament of the SubDAO network that contains the basic functionality as a normal chain node but also provides the ability to fetch external data needed for DAO governance with the OCW (O-chain Worker) from Substrate 2.0 Framework.

**3. How to build a new DAO from the perspective of the SubDAO network scenarios?**

As shown above, the steps to create a new DAO are marked. The DAO governor calls the smart contract of the SubDAO Guard to choose a proper DAO template from the DAO Template Library. After the governor fills in the basic information required by the template such as name, description, the rules of governance, initial members, and so on and deposits the initial fund to the Asset Vault, the SubDAO Guard contract will create the DAO according to the chosen template and filled information. All extra information, such as images, texts, and files, will be stored in a decentralized storage network like IPFS.

**4. In most features of SubDAO, Which feature can help SubDAO Network to interact with off-chain Workers?**

The on-chain worker is a new feature in the Substrate Framework that allows the SubDAO Network to interact with on-chain data.

**5. If a developer wants to interact with SubDAO DAO contracts, which components will be involved in this process?**

The first way to get involved with a specific DAO is using the Front End created by the SubDAO Labs to interact with all the DAOs on the SubDAO Network. The second way is using the SubDAO Airfone. The SubDAO Airfone will hide all the details of calling smart contracts for users and is used by DApps since the developers of DApps can customize their scenarios according to their needs.

**6. What’s the function of the PolkaSign?**

PolkaSign is a Web3.0 application for electronic protocols built on the Polkadot ecosystem. PolkaSign uses the Substrate Framework based on the SubDAO network to develop, can be replaced with any Substrate-based chain, and provides services for any type of organization with electronic agreements.

**7. How many members are there in the PDA? And who?**

There are 17 members on PDA until now, including Plasm, Phala, Stafi, Crust, Litentry, Bifrost, Patract, Darwina, Zenlink, and DeepDAO, members include zCloak Network, Clover, MathChain, Apron, and Stone, Manta Network.

**8. What are the basic functions of DAO on Substrate built by SubDAO?**

The basic functions include creating DAO, managing the assets vault and members, and conducting voting governance. So far, all modules and contracts of SubDAO have been integrated, becoming the first Polkadot project to implement DAO basic functions on Substrate, opening a new exploration of Polkadot ecological DAO governance.

**9. What do you know about the process of SubDAO blockchain and Smart Contract development?**

The detail includes:

* Upgraded the master node to Substrate3.0+, deploy a multi-node testnet
* Expanded flexibility on module design and adjusts to add new modules after creation.
* Adjusted the authority control voting module on the Vote process (Adds the function of setting the voting crowd, and adds the optional range when voting).
* Added voting and approval procedures for withdrawal applications on Vault (Anyone can initiate a withdrawal application, which is required to vote for it by a moderator so that the withdrawal can pass the verification).
* Adjusted the logic of personnel settings on Org, which can increase the way for personnel to join the organization (Org adds personnel to exit independently).
* Optimized the deposit process and increased withdrawal approval.

Other user experience and performance optimization :

* Optimized the Moderator Permission management;
* Fix list DAO instance owner logic bug;
* Compiled DAO manager contract.

**10. Which investment institutions have invested in SubDAO until now?**

Hypersphere Ventures, Huobi Ventures, OKEx Blockdream Ventures, CMS Holdings, Signum, NGC Ventures, Digital Finance Group(DFG), Spark, SevenX, LD Capital, Digital Renaissance Foundation, Dealean, Kernel, Divergence Ventures, Bixin Ventures, Kenetic Capital, AU21 Capital, Illusionist Group to participate, and individuals including early team members and former chief growth officer of the DCG Group, Massari founders Ryan Selkis, Mask Network founders Suji participated in the investment.

### Round 2

**1. What kind of endeavor has the SubDAO team made to build the brand?**

Building of Polkadot DAO

AllianceOffline Promotion

**2. What content has been updated on the SubDAO official website?**

SubDAO’s official website has been upgraded and revised, which will bring the audience a brand new visual presentation. This revision not only gives the overall visual effect a whole new look but also shows some differences in the structure of the official website and the display unit on the homepage.

**3. How will the SubDAO Node work with the external data?**

&amp;#x200B;

[How SubDAO Node works](https://preview.redd.it/rdl5mjl54nm71.jpg?width=916&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d94b862e7e4b5a049d06366b7476c5c921a35f)

As shown above, the steps to create a new DAO are marked. The DAO governor calls the smart contract of the SubDAO Guard to choose a proper DAO template from the DAO Template Library. After the governor fills in the basic information required by template such as name, description, the rules of governance, initial members, and so on and deposits the initial fund to the Asset Vault, the SubDAO Guard contract will create the very DAO according to the chosen template and filled information. All extra information, such as images, texts, and files, will be stored in a decentralized storage network like IPFS.

**4. Do you know the SubDAO team members? List their name.**

Team Members are as follows.

**Wang Qiang:** Technical Contributor; Chief Solution Architect in Tencent; Former Team Lead in IBM; Core Developer of Smart Cloud / HSLT; Code Contributor of KVM; Community Contributor in RedHat

**Humphrey:** Community Contributor; Graduated from Peking University; Co-founder of PAKA Fund; Investor in many early projects of Polkadot

**Marvin Tong:** Technical Contributor; Founder and CEO of Phala Network; Former Product Manager in Tencent

**Owen:** Community Contributor; Stafifi Co-founder

**Da Jun:** Technical Contributor; Former Senior Software Engineer in Alibaba; Core Developer of Wetez and StaFi.io; Over 12 years of experience in Development

**Sang:** Community Contributor; Founder of Polka Warriors; Founder of Dotmarketcap

**5. What’s the motivation that SubDAO builds great work?**

DAO is the ideal governance model in the mind of the team. Creating and maintaining a DAO is not so easy, especially to make a DAO working across different chains. But with the help of Substrate 2.0 and Polkadot, the team thinks it is the time now. In the area of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, there are many mature DAOs maintained in different ways with different tools or platforms, such as MakerDAO and The LAO. Also, there are some

other tools to help governors building a DAO, such as Aragon. Aragon is a project providing tools to create and the governor a DAO, but only available on Ethereum.

**6. Which features make SubDAO unique and different from other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem?**

SubDAO is an enabler that aims to make DAO service easier-accessible. It is a cross-chain DAO creation and maintenance platform for DApps, powered by Substrate and Polkadot.

Despite several DAO service platforms, we are still far away from the real mass adoption of DAO and faced by many obstacles, including high technical barriers, unsatisfying user experience, simple and basic DAO functions that are unable to meet diverse user cases, most solutions are focused on Ethereum, etc.

However, SubDAO is created to tackle the problems that have been long ignored by other teams. So I would say that SubDAO has the following unique features: 

* Cross-chain platform;
* Access to off-line data;
* 0 technical background needed to create a DAO;
* Easy-to-navigate user interface. In the future, SubDAO will add more DAO templates and all types of organizations will be able to find a suitable DAO template for their own use.

**7. What are the use cases of SubDAO tokens?**

GOV, short for “Governance”, is the native token of the SubDAO network. The total supply of GOV is 1 billion, with an annual inflation rate of 5%. The design of the SubDAO tokenomics model boils down to three goals: 1. Slot Auction; 2. Incentive the development of DAO; 3. Governance.

**8. What is the basic logic of governance farming design?**

Every organization with a DAO will have assets in the DAO. The amount of the initial shares (equity token) obtained by each DAO is decided by the asset size of the DAO;

DAO can realize share inflation and redistribution of DAO assets through voting and other governance activities, to achieve the goal of the organization;

We believe that the value of a DAO depends on many aspects including fund size, member count, and the frequency of governance activities. The bigger the fund, the more the member count, and the higher the frequency of governance activities, the more valuable and successful a DAO is.

**9. What do the Genesis Farming pools include?**

A total of 7% of the tokes will be distributed to 5 Genesis Farming pools. We will adopt a whitelist application mechanism. Then the DAOs that pass the application will receive farming rewards in GOV. The 5 types of DAO farming pools are:

* Foundation-based DAO
* Community-based DAO
* DeFi-based DAO
* Art (NFT)-based DAO
* Developer-based DAO

**20. Do you know the core roles of the SubDAO ecosystem? List them.**

In the SubDAO network, there are several core roles: para-chain contributors, farmers, and the SubDAO Council.

**About SubDAO**

SubDAO is a DAO infrastructure based on Polkadot, where any decentralized organization is allowed to conveniently create and manage a DAO. SubDAO does not only connect DAO with DApps to realize DAO’s cross-chain management but also bridges Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.

The founding team of SubDAO is composed of the former Technical Team leader of the IBM Group and many early well-known developers from Polkadot. All team members own rich experiences in Internet companies such as IBM, Tencent, and Alibaba. Jack Platts, former Director of External Cooperation of the Web3 Foundation and Partner of Hypersphere Ventures, serves as a strategic contributor to SubDAO. So far SubDAO has completed multi-million dollar financing including Hypersphere, Huobi Ventures, and other institutions.

New book about DeFi and a tiny failed experiment.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plz2ci/new_book_about_defi_and_a_tiny_failed_experiment/,GreenStretch,1,2021-09-11 10:39:39,25,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/plz2ci/new_book_about_defi_and_a_tiny_failed_experiment/,FINANCE,"I tried posting about a new book about DeFi when I first picked it up and hadn't read any of it, but it got rejected for being too short.

[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/DeFi+and+the+Future+of+Finance-p-9781119836025](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/DeFi+and+the+Future+of+Finance-p-9781119836025)

It's very short, the body of the text not much more than 150 pages.  Vitalik wrote the preface.  

So the sections are an introduction about five problems of centralized finance, a general history of finance, the elements of DeFi infrastructure, the primitives or basic functions and elements of DeFi, a deep dive looking at several DeFi platforms and tokens, risks of the sector, and a conclusion.

I'm in the deep dive section now which looks at MakerDAO, both the governance token MKR and the DAI stablecoin, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Yield Protocol, dYdX, Synthetix, Set Protocol, and Wrapped Bitcoin.  While reading this last night, I kept looking at the websites for some of the major DeFi tokens and the rates paid on different assets.  

I've posted many times here about my skepticism of DeFi, even though I own a few of the major tokens.  But reading this made me excited and wanting to try this out on a small scale.  Just browsing on the sites, eventually there would be a point where they would ask to connect a wallet.  I didn't attempt that until now and felt a little scared because as far as I can tell, the public blockchain only shows isolated little subwallets when generating new addresses or creating separate subaccounts.  I didn't go as far as creating a brand new wallet with new seed words.  Connecting to the site, it was a bit shocking that it listed all the subaccounts, not just the tiny one I intended to use.  Logging out again, I went to a centralized exchange and purchased a very small amount of a DeFi token to deposit at a high interest rate.  By very small, it was only 33 dollars worth.  Going back to the site, I reconnected and selected the small subaccount with the token.  The box above the ""continue"" wallet had fine print that said the estimated ETH gas fees would be 71 dollars.  So far DeFi turned out to be as stupid as I feared and I didn't proceed with that transaction."

The (unpopular) vision of a Bitcoin-based ecosystem,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmzmm6/the_unpopular_vision_of_a_bitcoinbased_ecosystem/,M-A-L,1,2021-09-13 03:44:42,17,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmzmm6/the_unpopular_vision_of_a_bitcoinbased_ecosystem/,SPECULATION,"The Ethereum-killers like Cardano, Solana, and Elrond, are all performing really well atm. It seems to be a popular assumption that the future will either involve Ethereum, or one of these Ethereum substitutes (or both). 

There is an alternative vision however, namely of a Bitcoin-based ecosystem in which both Ethereum, the Ethereum-killers, and everything based on them, slowly move into the background. This isn’t a narrowminded Bitcoin maxi view and deserves to be more widely known. Here is the version of the Bitcoin-based view that I personally like: 

*Bitcoin* as store of value. Needs no introduction. 

*Lightning Network* to make Bitcoin functional as a currency and the transactions cheaper. I think many underestimate how well this is already working, how fast it is, how low the fees are and how quickly the network is growing. Lightning-powered Bitcoin might make things like Litecoin, BCH, Doge, Nano, Dash, etc. increasingly less attractive. 

*Defichain* for DeFi in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Deserves to be better known. This is a Bitcoin fork modified to enable DeFi functionality and nothing else. Like Bitcoin, it has no EVM (and is not Turing complete), which makes it very hard to exploit or hack. It’s not a general smart contract platform, so no one can blow it up with cryptokitties or other smart contracts gone viral. It anchors into Bitcoin’s ledger (so a 51% attack on it, requires a 51% attack on Bitcoin). By the end of the year, it aims to offer the full DeFi suite: a DEX, margin trading, overcollateralized loans, synthetic stocks (tokens tracking the price of Gold, Tesla, etc.), its own oracles, its own stablecoin, futures and options. One can swap trustlessly between BTC and dBTC on Defichain. If adoption skews to Bitcoin, Defichain becomes heavy competition for Uniswap, MakerDAO, Synthetix, Compound and so on. 

*Rootstock* to bring a general smart contract platform to Bitcoin. Also deserves to be better known. It’s a general smart contract platform on a Bitcoin layer 2, with gas paid in terms of rBTC. It also borrows its security from Bitcoin, through mining with Bitcoin, and here too one can swap trustlessly between BTC and rBTC on Rootstock. RSK supports all the programming languages used for the smart contracts of Ethereum. Any remaining functionality that is offered on Ethereum can be offered in principle within the Bitcoin ecosystem. One great example of this is RIF on rootstock, an infrastructure for all sharing economies, such as the sharing of identity, services and communications through a p2p marketplace. Any utility projects, like FileCoin, BAT, Civic, Syscoin, SelfKey, etc, could be moved over to Rootstock. 

As you can see, with these four, so much of the current cryptospace can be covered, and all revolve around Bitcoin. They are empowered by any heavy adoption of Bitcoin in the future. 

\*\*\*

If the adoption skews heavily in favor of Bitcoin as the most entrenched holder of value and the most heavily secured network, then one would expect a pressure to mobilize that value (as currency, in DeFi, and other smart contracts) and to tap into the security of that network. That is not a crazy thought, but it’s a world that might leave little room or need for most of the currently popular projects. 

No one knows the future, of course, but I think this is not at all an unrealistic scenario. It should at least be on your radar."
Decentralized Autonomous Organization DAO - Explained in Simple Terms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/png88j/decentralized_autonomous_organization_dao/,spritecut,1,2021-09-13 22:10:31,3,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/png88j/decentralized_autonomous_organization_dao/,EDUCATIONAL,"Wikipedia defines DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles[.](https://blockchainhub.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DAOs_TaditionalOrganisations.png)

###Decentralized autonomous organizations aim to be:

- Open platforms where people interact with each other according to self-enforcing open-source protocols, making them extremely trust worthy.
- Keeping the network safe and performing other network tasks is rewarded with the native network tokens, encouraging active participation.
- All transactions of the organization are recorded and maintained on a blockchain making them very secure. 
- Interests of the members of the organization are – if designed correctly – aligned by the incentive rules tied to the native token. 

###Evolution and Examples 

**Bitcoin** network can be considered to be the first true DAO, coordinated by a consensus protocol which anybody is free to adopt. It provides an operating system for money without banks and bank managers, and has stayed attack resistant and fault-tolerant since the first block was created in 2009. However, Bitcoin lacks complex governance rules that are characteristic of DAOs.

**Ethereum** With the emergence of the Ethereum Network, the concept of DAOs moved up the technology stack from blockchain protocol to the smart contract. Smart contracts are necessary ingredients for DAOs to be possible. Nonetheless, Ethereum itself is not a DAO but a framework for developing DAO projects. 

**Uniswap** is the first DeFi protocol to have pioneered **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** which led it to become the most popular **decentralized exchange (DEX)**. The network has its own governance token UNI, which is used for voting on improvements and funding liquidity pools. As such, Uniswap is a full-blown DAO but one has to own 1% of UNI’s total supply in order to propose new governance rules or tweak existing ones, effectively barring over 90% of users from participating in directing the network’s development. 

**MakerDAO** is the most comprehensive example of DAO. As a DeFi protocol similar to Uniswap but for lending. MakerDAO has two token, stablecoin DAI and governance token MKR. The MakerDAO Foundation has been distributing MKR to incentivize contributors, spur voter participation, and decentralize the governance process. Effectively, the foundation’s goal is to abolish itself by giving away all the tokens to the network’s stakeholders.

**Aragon** is both a DAO and a platform for creating customized DAOs. This makes it extremely useful for users who don’t have advanced programming knowledge. Aragon takes care of the types of smart contracts and the interface, leaving it up to you to decide how to manage your organization. This makes Aragon a DAO ecosystem with a broad range of use cases.

###Criticisms

However, DAOs can be architecturally decentralized (independent actors run different nodes), and geographically decentralized (subject to different jurisdictions), but they are logically centralized (the protocol). As such, DAOs are on a spectrum of decentralization. 

The question of how to upgrade the code – when and if necessary – is very often delegated to a set of experts who understand the techno-legal intricacies of the code, and therefore represent a point of centralization.

Further, when we look at this from a legal perspective, it is clear that a DAO is neither a corporation, nor any other type of existing legal personality. It doesn’t have a registered office and has no physical place of business or registration. There are no shareholders or managers. As a result, it cannot perform many of the tasks commonly attributed to it, like owning property or engaging in legally binding contracts.

📷 Bluejay Finance 📷  


Bluejay Protocol is a system for creating and managing stablecoins to track different currencies around the world. Our approach uses a collateralized debt position (CDPs), like MakerDAO, to create an elastic supply of stablecoins soft-pegged to sovereign currencies that are programmable, decentralized, and fully backed by collaterals.    


Bluejay aims to bring access to world-class financial services to the masses by mirroring their money on the blockchain. By leveraging on the existing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, the ecosystem can offer the under-banked population services like:  


\* Access to safe-haven assets like USD for short term saving through Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)  
\* Instant &amp; low-cost remittances to other currencies through DEX   
\* Mid to long term savings plan through different asset management &amp; lending/borrowing protocols  
\* ... and many more 

&amp;#x200B;

The liquidity mining program will start 1 week after the auction launch, which is on September 17th. The liquidity mining will start at exactly block **19202000**. The countdown of the start block is available [here](https://polygonscan.com/block/countdown/19202000).

Users may stake their BLU-MATIC Liquidity Provider token in the mining contract before the start block but rewards will only start accruing at the start block. Users may do this to avoid a rush when the program starts. 

The liquidity mining program will have a 2x bonus for a week. The bonus will end at exactly block **19454000** before returning to the 1x reward.

Have you tried generating passive income with DeFi? What platforms do consider valuable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/po1b2g/have_you_tried_generating_passive_income_with/,OkImpress244,1,2021-09-14 19:57:35,2,/r/investing_discussion/comments/po1b2g/have_you_tried_generating_passive_income_with/,,"Today, modern decentralized protocols and smart contract applications offer the DeFi user things like yield farming, staking, and lending, allowing them to accrue steady growth on their initial outlay. So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It’s a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use “staking” as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

\#3: Yield farming

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

This one is perhaps my favorite method for DeFi. Yield farming is a newer concept than staking, though the two share many similarities. While staking can refer to actions such as locking up 32 ETH to become a validator node on the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 network, yield farming refers more exclusively to providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol in return for yield. Your liquidity is being used for AMM, paying you the fees when traders exchange one of the tokens you deposited. Examples: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Curve](https://curve.fi/), [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

At the same time, some platforms use a combination of some of these methods, due to which a high interest rate and simplified investment process are achieved. It can be good for early investors. Example: [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/).

How to Generate Passive Income With Decentralized Finance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/po3679/how_to_generate_passive_income_with_decentralized/,Icy-EndCrypt,1,2021-09-14 21:50:22,2,/r/economy/comments/po3679/how_to_generate_passive_income_with_decentralized/,,"Today, modern decentralized protocols and smart contract applications offer the DeFi user things like yield farming, staking, and lending, allowing them to accrue steady growth on their initial outlay. So, what instruments should we consider?

\#1: Lending

Lending is perhaps the most recognized DeFi activity in the space, mainly because many of the early DeFi platforms like [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) specialized in lending protocols. It’s a straightforward concept: you lend your digital assets to a platform by locking your assets into a smart contract. This works for me well, and there is no reason to avoid this approach. 

\#2: Staking

As the term implies, staking involves the process of locking in digital assets into a smart contract. Many DeFi platforms also use “staking” as a means to open what is essentially a savings account on the blockchain. Like a savings account, your balance will accrue additional income, typically in the form of the same type of tokens or another token on the same blockchain. In other words, you deposit an asset, and someone uses it, paying you the interest rates based on demand. Examples: [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [AlphaHomora](https://homora.alphafinance.io/alpha).

Crypto101: What's a Governance Token?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/poe46z/crypto101_whats_a_governance_token/,economicsdesign,1,2021-09-15 07:20:59,6,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/poe46z/crypto101_whats_a_governance_token/,SUPPORT," 

# General Conclusion

Governance tokens emerged thanks to the birth of famous DeFi projects such as MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, etc., which have seen growth in marketcap skyrocket since DeFi Summer 2020.

In today's article, we will discuss what governance tokens are, how they impact the DeFi space, and why they are valuable.

# What Is A Governance Token?

&gt;A governance token is a type of token that grants voting rights to their owners in a particular protocol.

There are currently two ways to calculate the power of voting for governance tokens: token-weighted voting (almost protocols) and time-weighted voting (e.g. Curve).

Voting power is weighted according to the number of tokens, which means that the more governance tokens a holer holds, the more decision-making weight they have on an issue. While time-weighted voting rights give more rights to those who lock the governance token for longer.

## Off-Chain Governance

In off-chain governance, network participants communicate outside of the network. These mechanisms can be used to grant token holders informal voting rights. Votes can signal the community to download the code change, but **votes do not automatically trigger the change**. If a minority disagrees, they can choose not to download the code update. This will result in two separate networks (hard fork).

## On-Chain Governance

With on-chain governance, **code changes are done automatically once voting is complete**. Similar to off-chain governance, a minority can choose a minority group can choose to create a hard fork with the new changes.

The main difference between the two governances is in the way in which participants choose to participate. The on-chain governance allows the code change to occur by majority vote, while the off-chain governance requires participants to download the code change.

&gt;As an open-source network, each scenario presents an opportunity for the minority to create a network that works for them.

For example, we have seen many forked platforms like Sushiswap from Uniswap, Swerve from Curve or Mirror from Synthetix. Basically, these fork platforms either compete directly with the original platform (Swerve) or go in a new direction compared to the original platform (SushiSwap, Mirror).

Governance tokens allow holders to vote for changes in the network to which they belong. Usually, the number of tokens a person holds is proportional to the power of votes they have.

# Governance Token Impact On DeFi

For many in the crypto space, governance tokens are a key function of the DeFi protocol that enables decentralised voting. This approach is consistent with the financial decentralisation that the system hopes to achieve.

The principles of DeFi focus on financial democracy:

* The ability for all users to participate; and
* Have a voice in a monetary system that works in favor of the majority.

Looking back in history, we have seen a change in governance in protocols like MakerDAO and Synthetix. In March 2020 MakerDAO completed its transition to complete community governance. In the course of 2020 Synthetix launched several DAOs, with each DAO managing separate parts of the protocol created by the main developers.

&gt;This could be an indication of where DeFi is headed.

 

**TLDR**:

In short, the governance token is a step forward in the decentralisation of voting rights led by DeFi. With Governance tokens, if they only have governance functions, have no intrinsic value in themselves, but they are related to the incentives of each different protocol, so they carry other values. Their value can be seen in three main incentives: Liquidity Mining, Lending, and Staking, along with a combination of protocol-specific incentives. That is why we often see relatively valuations like PE and PS. However, governance tokens still have certain risks which affect the main purpose for which they are formed."

I also want the opinions of the Ethereum Community.**

**I am going to discuss a fair bit about economics, finance, and how it pertains to technique. This thread is by no means intended to be taken as financial advice.**

To me it is clear that the current financial and economic system we have in place only deprives humanity of dignity and freedom. Can alternatives permanently solve the problem, or will the problem exist as long as technique exists? When I speak about technique, I am using Jacques Ellul's definition in his book ""Technological Society"" ""Technique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity"".

The Federal Reserve is looking to create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This gives the federal reserve a lot more influence on the consumption habits of Americans who hold USD IE Negative interest rates, inflation. Since your money loses its value over time, it is said that a small inflation rate is actually better for the economy since this encourages consumers to consume sooner rather than later. With the implementation of CBDC's, the Federal reserve will likely implement negative interest rates on those dollars, again further encouraging consumption as you are losing wealth if you do not. There are also major privacy risks involved with CBDC's. CBDC's are already becoming popular in China. I argue that this is an insult to human dignity and freedom.

Alternatives to our traditional banking system currently exist, like Ethereum, a censorship resistant, decentralized, trustless, smart contract blockchain. Ethereum has various applications such as lending pools (pools of assets where you can earn solid interest and borrow from) with decentralized stable coins (coins soft pegged to USD using Ether and other ERC-20 tokens as collateral, governed by MakerDAO holders). It is a very speculative technology, but I believe Ethereum has really matured. The asset Ether recently surpassed Paypal in terms of market cap as well as Ethereum settling more transactions in a quarter than Paypal did in a year. Lending pools like AAVE or Compound host a decentralized stable coin called DAI which offer far more competitive rates than a traditional savings account and especially more than a CBDC.

This technology I have been a passionate advocate for for over a year now regardless of my increasingly anti-technical views, however I often ponder on how this technology may only temporarily solve the issue of centralization in the financial sector, and it by no means solves the issue of technique. A lot of these projects utilize a governance token model, meaning that you vote using your tokens, and the more tokens you have, the more voting power you have. Depending on how these tokens are allocated, on how much early investors hold, or how much money you have, that voting power can be very centralized amongst few people. Popular Decentralized Exchange (Dex) aggregator 1Inch has 41% of all tokens held by one Ethereum wallet owned by popular crypto currency exchange Binance. This gives Binance the ability to swing any 1Inch proposal 41% in their favor instantly. Unfortunately there isn't a good way to remedy this at the moment. There are also issues with these exchange tokens potentially being labeled as securities and being subject to regulation by the SEC. Because of this and many other things it is becoming increasingly clear to me that Ethereum, despite being an improvement to the traditional banking system, is not enough.

Due to the efficiencies of blockchains, I also fear that this technology can be used as a means to coerce. Ethereum after upgrades and rollups is projected to be able to settle up to 100,000 to 150,000 transactions per second. Visa currently settles closer to 20,000-40,000. It should be no surprise that Visa has decided to utilize Ethereum to settle stable coin transactions. I fear that because they are so efficient, they can be utilized as a way to surveil or coerce. There was a blockchain in South Korea used to verify if people were vaccinated. It is not my intention to start a discussion about the covid vaccine, but merely a warning of how blockchain can be used to determine your status. Are you a dissenter? Did you pay your taxes? There is also nothing stopping governments or corporations from creating their own centralized blockchains, likely having more throughput than decentralized chains (with a few exceptions IE Solana) which may end up being the traditional, legal, settlement layer.

Since Ethereum is a public blockchain, anyone can view any transaction you make on the blockchain. This can be a corporation, a government, your neighbor. There are ways to increase your privacy, however I fear that people A. will not care about privacy (you would be surprised about how little people care) or B. that the ability to track on-chain data drastically improves. It is true that Ethereum is not the only blockchain. Monero is an example of a blockchain that allows for private transactions and the inability to search where a transaction is being sent. This asset is heavily regulated however. The only way you can obtain this asset without giving up information is if you buy it locally or if you mine it yourself. There is also limited functionality other than being a private decentralized blockchain.

It has become more apparent to me that these improvements over time degenerate to the very thing it sought to destroy. The United States has undergone numerous radical reforms to prevent corruption i.e. the Jackson Era and the Progressive reforms of 1920. These reforms only had temporary effects. As the movement relaxes, the corruption crept back in. I fear that blockchain is merely a temporary solution, and will resemble what it replaced, with only small practically insignificant differences. Does no solution exist as long as technique exists?

I have my doubts that a popular leftist philosophy taking hold of our society will end up improving the overall freedom and welfare of society. A prominent talking point I have heard from many left wing anarchist types is that AI can be used to decide the best way to allocate resources, including labor. This is an even more blunt manipulation of human behavior. Human beings will progressively let technology and AI make more and more of our decisions and play a bigger role in our lives, however turning it off would amount to suicide. Think of what would happen tomorrow if the internet or electricity was ripped from our society? This means that an industrial technological system would softly take power from all of humanity. One can argue that this already happened. Ellul mentioned in the Technological Society that the electronic brains running automatically has reduced seemingly powerful leaders into mere figureheads who only seem to direct procedures which are so complicated that no human brain could replicate them. Regardless of whatever system is in place, communism, capitalism, socialism, anarchism, etc, as long as there is technique, it will invade every faucet of your life and will continue to regulate your behavior until individual liberty ceases to exist.

I hope to set myself up in such a way where coercive forces have little to no influence in anything I do. I hope others do the same.

I have only briefly begun to mention my concerns regarding finance, economics, and technology. Please feel free to comment on anything that anyone wants to add."

Bringing real-world assets on-chain will hugely scale DeFi as we know it, and DeFi-driven liquidity could unlock trillions of real-world financing. EntroFi is unique as it is similar to borrowing in trad-Fi, and is structured for smooth end-to-end execution for new trad-Fi users tapping into DeFi.

Our NFT-based DeFi lending platform will significantly improve the efficiency of existing financial infrastructure by connecting DeFi capitals directly to loan borrowers. Our protocol channels DeFi liquidity directly to SMEs and individuals, and brings real-world collateral assets, such as real estate and account receivables, as well as native NFTs, to DeFi by converting them into a new type of financial NFTs.

EntroFi utilizes the concept of NFT to accomplish two primary objectives:

1. Enables real world assets to access DeFi liquidity by connecting to DeFi protocol via NFT infrastructures.
2. Incorporates existing native NFTs with financial attributes via collateralization, improving their overall liquidity.

This is done through three separate layers in the EntroFi network:

1. Protocol layer, which is comprised of external DeFi, CeFi, or NFT protocols, such as MakerDAO, dForce, Yearn, Aave, Opensea
2. Liquidity layer, categorized into senior or junior capital based on risk/reward profiles
3. Asset layer of off-chain and on-chain assets, such as real-world assets backed NFTs (such as REITs, secured loans, tokenized bonds, Uniswap LP tokens, and OpenSea NFTs)

Stablecoins - Explained in simple terms,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/prqnmi/stablecoins_explained_in_simple_terms/,spritecut,1,2021-09-20 16:34:55,23,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/prqnmi/stablecoins_explained_in_simple_terms/,,"Stablecoins are a more stable and secure means of holding funds during times of volatility and are pegged to widely used fiat currencies such as the US Dollar or Euro (or sometimes even commodities, such as gold) - **They offer the stability of fiat without losing the flexibility, rapid transferability and lower fees of cryptocurrencies**. It is also a critical component in decentralised finance (DeFi) because people often need a volatility-free means of transacting. 

As fully collateralised stablecoins gained interest, it soon became clear that as they grow in demand and adoption, collateralising them will be a difficult task. Not only is it difficult to amass and secure hundreds of billions of dollars, but it is also an inefficient use of capital, because the collateral is sitting idle instead of being put to more productive use elsewhere. 

. . . 

###Types of Stable Coins

###Centralised
- These are fully collateralised and backed 1:1 by fiat currencies, which are generally stored in bank accounts **They are centralized because they are launched and governed by a central organization, which could be either a company, a bank or even a government.** They generally maintain their peg through contraction or dilution (minting and burning) of the total supply, changing the relative price of each token until it reaches the desired peg. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Gemini USD (GUSD) 

###Decentralised
- Loans are created through Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) using smart contracts to collateralise a cryptocurrency in order to mint stablecoins. They are generally over-collateralised to compensate for volatility. **They are fully decentralised and both more transparent and more stable, because the protocols automatically stabilise the value of the coins** - MakerDAO (MKR), a pioneer of decentralised finance (DeFi), is a project where users deposit ETH, YFI, LINK, AAVE, UNI. BAT or even TUSDT, PAXUSD  at an over collateralised rate of 150%, and borrow against the value of these deposits to receive newly generated DAI. 

###Decentralised Algorithmic
- Utilising a two token system there is no collateral backing these. They consist of one stable asset and one speculative asset, which automatically expands or contracts the circulating supply with the minting and burning of the speculative asset. These mechanisms are called **‘seigniorage models’** and use Algorithmic Market Operations controllers (AMOs) to maintain stability with the speculative asset not only absorbing the volatility of the system, but profiting from it as well. Clearly there is an issue if the protocols get hacked there is nothing backing up the coins. 

###Fractionalised Algorithmic stablecoins 
- The concept of algorithmic stablecoins inspired developers with the idea that a stablecoin could achieve mass adoption, yet require less than full collateralisation - **collaterally-backed and algorithmically modified to achieve stability**. The benefit of being under-collateralised is that if a stablecoin does not require 100% (or 150% in the case of DAI) of its supply to be collateralised then that capital, which would otherwise be required to sit idle, can instead be deployed elsewhere in a more efficient manner, such as in yield farms or used in lending.

. . .

###Centralised Stablecoins

###Tether (USDT)
Since its creation in 2014, Tether (USDT) is undoubtedly the predominant market leader and has been mired in controversy. According to the official website, “Every tether is always 100% backed by the company’s reserves which include traditional currency and cash equivalents” Which has now been updated with the “from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, “reserves”).” However, the “Cash” portion of this is in fact only 2.9%

USDT is operated by Tether Limited, which is closely associated with iFinex, which is the parent company of the popular exchange Bitfinex.

It’s worth noting that there are several networks that USDT is being minted on including ; Omni, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, and Liquid.

###USD Coin (USDC)
USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin powered by Ethereum blockchain, as an ERC-20 token, launched by Coinbase, together with trading desk Circle. According to the official website of Coinbase, each USDC is backed by one US Dollar, which is held on bank accounts. Coinbase rewards its customers for holding the USDC on their exchange account. 

###Paxos Standard (PAX)
Paxos is also based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 blockchain. Paxos Trust Company, PAX issuer, is also the company that operates the Paxos exchange, along with custody services and safeguarding physical and digital assets as a regulated trust.

Paxos claims that the dollars, which back each PAX in regulation, are held in segregated accounts, which are FDIC-insured and domiciled in US banks. According to the official website, PAX is listed on over 100 exchanges.

###True USD (TUSD)
TUSD is another ERC-20 based stablecoin, and is supported by more than 70 exchanges around the world, including the major ones. TrueUSD’s issuer also issued other stablecoins pegged to other coins: those include TrueGBP, TrueAUD, TrueCAD, and TrueHKD.

###Gemini Dollar (GUSD)
The Gemini Dollar (GUSD) is touted as the first-ever regulated stablecoin. It’s issued by the Gemini Trust Company, owners of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, which operates as a qualified custodian under New York Banking Law and is also licensed by the State of New York.

According to the official website, the USD deposit balance is examined every month by a registered public accounting firm in order to guarantee the pegging. All the reports are published and available online.

###Binance USD (BUSD)
Binance USD (BUSD) is the stablecoin that resulted from a partnership between the leading crypto exchange and Paxos. It has received the approval of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and it was made available for trading since 
2019.

###Decentralised Stablecoins

###Dai (DAI)
DAI is not governed or issued by a central authority or, as in most of the cases here, by a centralized company. Instead, DAI is governed by a decentralized community of MKR token holders. These holders are in control of the Maker Protocol, which is the smart contract behind the DAI stablecoin.

This comes with a lot of benefits. For once, it takes away the worry that the company controls the supply of the stablecoin. It’s also immutable, censorship-resistant, and entirely transparent by design.

The main threat of decentralized stablecoins, such as DAI, is hacking to the smart contract. In such a scenario, there is no physical backup of the DAIs.


###Decentralised Algorithmic Stablecoins

###Terra (UST)
Terra is a Proof of Stake blockchain built using Tendermint, a core contributor to the Cosmos Network, that focuses on global payments and settlement. 

Consensus and security uses a seigniorage model, which is achieved through the LUNA token and absorbs the volatility of the stablecoins. When TerraUSD is priced at $1.01, the system expands to print more TerraUSD through burning LUNA. The idea is that LUNA holders can exchange their for $1 worth of TerraUSD, then sell it for $1.01, and profit from the difference. 

Part of the LUNA exchanged is burned while the rest of it compounds in a community pool. When TerraUSD is $0.99, the opposite happens, and TerraUSD is exchanged for $1 worth of LUNA. 

(In May 2021, LUNA faced its biggest test due to TerraUSD falling below its peg for several days due to a combination of the LUNA price crashing and a number of collateral liquidations. At one point, the stablecoin reached $0.92, but has since recovered.)

###Fractionalised Algorithmic Stablecoins

###Frax (FRAX)

At its core, it’s a seigniorage model yet in its infancy decided to be partially backed by USDC. Currently, FRAX is 85% backed by USDC with the remaining 15% being algorithmically stabilized by Frax Shares (FXS) which is continually minted and burned by arbitrageurs in order to maintain its $1 peg which to date has never shifted off of it.

FRAX is going with the multi-chain approach for adoption. Currently, FRAX is circulating on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, and plans to expand to Moonbeam. 

. . .

###TL;DR - Stablecoins offer a stable and secure means of holding funds during times of volatility. Different coins serve different markets at different times and have a wide range of goals and objectives over a given time horizon. The centralised coins are arguably the most popular and accessible. The decentralised DAOs are so far serving their ecosystems exceptionally well. And the Algorithmic coins are trying to push how far the concept of seigniorage can go.

What is Yield farming?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/pub9qq/what_is_yield_farming/,subwaybooligan,1,2021-09-24 11:20:00,1,/r/Cryptofarmbets/comments/pub9qq/what_is_yield_farming/,,"***TLDR at the bottom***

**What is yield farming in DeFi and how does it work?**

**What is yield farming?**  


At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards on their holdings. With yield farming, an investor deposits units of a cryptocurrency into a lending protocol to earn interest from trading fees. Some users are also rewarded with additional yields from the protocol’s governance token. 

Yield farming works in a similar way to bank loans. When the bank loans you money, you pay back the loan with interest. Yield farming does the same, but this time, the banks are crypto holders like yourself. Yield farming uses “idle cryptos” that would have otherwise been wasting away in an exchange or hot wallet to provide liquidity in DeFi protocols like Uniswap in exchange for returns.

**Understanding liquidity pools, liquidity providers and automated market maker model**

Yield farming works with a liquidity provider and a liquidity pool (a smart contract filled with cash) that powers a DeFi market. A liquidity provider is an investor who deposits funds into a smart contract. The liquidity pool is a smart contract filled with cash. Yield farming functions based on the automated market maker (AMM) model. 

This model is popular on decentralized exchanges. AMM eliminates the conventional order book, which contains all “buy” and “sell” orders on a cryptocurrency exchange. Instead of stating the price that an asset is set to trade at, an AMM creates liquidity pools using smart contracts. These pools execute trades based on predetermined algorithms.

The AMM model relies heavily on liquidity providers (LPs), who deposit funds into liquidity pools. These pools are the bedrock of most DeFi marketplaces where users borrow, lend and swap tokens. DeFi users pay trading fees to the marketplace; the marketplace shares the fees with LPs based on their share of the pool’s liquidity. 

Take Compound, for instance. The protocol provides liquidity to borrowers who want to borrow funds in cryptocurrencies. The Compound Finance system does this using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. LPs deposit funds into the liquidity pools. These contracts serve as the matching engine for market participants. 

Once an interest rate for the loan has been agreed upon, the borrower gets the funds.

In exchange for their funds, LPs get Compound Finance’s native COMP tokens. They also get a cut of the interest that the borrowers pay.

Some of the most common DeFi-related stablecoins include USDT, DAI, USDC and BUSD. Some protocols can also mint tokens, which represent your deposited coins in the system. For instance, if you deposit ETH into Compound Finance, you get cETH. If you deposit DAI, you get cDAI.

**Yield farming returns**

Estimated yield returns are calculated on an annualized model. This shows the possible earnings for locking up your cryptos for a year.

Some of the most common metrics include annual percentage yield (APY) and annual percentage rate (APR). The primary difference between them is that APR doesn’t consider compound interest, which involves plowing back your profits to increase your returns.

Still, most calculation models are simply estimates. It is difficult to accurately calculate returns on yield farming because it is a dynamic market. A yield farming strategy could deliver high returns for a while, but farmers could always adopt it *en masse*, leading to a drop in profitability. The market is quite volatile and risky for both borrowers and lenders.

**Should you try yield farming?**

**First, understand its risks**

Despite its obvious potential upside, yield farming has its risks. They include: 

* **Smart contract risks** 

Smart contracts are paperless digital codes that contain the agreement between parties on predefined rules that self executes. Smart contracts eliminate go-betweens, are cheaper and safer to conduct transactions. But, they are susceptible to attack vectors and bugs in the code. Users of popular DeFi protocols [Uniswap](https://decrypt.co/43927/ethereum-user-scammed-for-140000-in-uniswap-uni-tokens) and [Akropolis](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-steals-2-million-from-cryptocurrency-service-akropolis/) have all suffered losses to smart contract scams. 

* **Impermanent loss risk** 

Yield farming requires liquidity providers to supply funds into pools to earn yields and trading fees from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This offers LPs market-neutral returns, but it could be risky during sharp market moves. 

This risk is possible because AMMs don’t update token prices in line with movements in the market. For instance, if an asset’s price drops by 60% on a centralized exchange, the change won’t immediately reflect on a DEX.

As a result, a savvy arbitrage trader could use that narrow price gap to sell their token on a yield farming platform at a premium. LPs will eventually have to cover this difference, and incur losses when the price drops. Since their capital is locked in the pool, they can’t benefit when the price rises. One way of addressing this issue is to choose protocols that trade assets with low price slippages, such as the [WBTC and renBTC pairs on Curve.](https://taiyangzhang.medium.com/)

* **Liquidation risks** 

As with the traditional finance space, DeFi platforms use their customers’ deposits to provide liquidity to their markets. However, a problem could arise when the value of the collateral drops below the loan’s price. For instance, if you take out a loan in ETH collateralized by BTC, a price increase in ETH would result in the loan being liquidated as the value of the collateral (BTC) would be less than the value of the ETH loan.

* **Capital intensive and complicated process**

Yield farming is a capital-intensive operation. Most of the cost concern surrounds the issue of gas fees on the Ethereum network. Josh Rager, the founder of cryptocurrency trading service Blockroots.com, took to Twitter to [complain](https://twitter.com/Josh_Rager/status/1293760986520969217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293760986520969217%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F38556%2Fethereum-fees-briefly-equal-a-us-stimulus-check) that he had to pay as much as US$1,200 in fees to purchase tokens on a DeFi project. This is more of an issue for smaller participants than for wealthier users, who have access to more capital. Smaller participants might find out that they can’t withdraw their earnings due to high gas fees.

Getting into yield farming is a risky endeavor if you have no experience in the cryptocurrency world. You could lose all your investment in one fell swoop. Invest at your own risk. The world of yield farming is fast-paced and volatile. If you decide to try your hands on yield farming, you should not invest more than you’re willing to lose.

**What the future holds for yield farming**

Yield farming uses investors’ funds to create liquidity in the market in exchange for returns. It has significant potential for growth, but it’s not without its faults.

Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, even promised not to dip his feet into yield farming until it “stabilizes.” Several other blockchains like Polkadot and Solana have tried wooing DeFi platforms with new features. Tezos completed an upgrade dubbed “Delphi” which it claims would reduce gas fees for developers by 75%. This proposition is expected to attract DeFi developers.

**The Seven Most Popular Yield Farming Protocols**

[**1. Compound**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/) is a money market for lending and borrowing assets, where algorithmically adjusted compound interest as well the governance token COMP can be earned.

[**2. MakerDAO**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/) is a decentralized credit pioneer that lets users lock crypto as collateral assets to borrow DAI, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Interest is paid in the form of a “stability fee.” 

[**3. Aave**](https://aave.com/) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol to create money markets, where users can borrow assets and earn compound interest for lending in the form of the [**AAVE**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/) (previously LEND) token. Aave is also known for facilitating flash loans and credit delegation, where loans can be issued to borrowers without collateral. 

[**4. Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/) is a hugely popular decentralized exchange (DEX) and [**automated market maker (AMM)**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) that enables users to swap almost any [**ERC20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token pair without intermediaries. Liquidity providers must stake both sides of the liquidity pool in a 50/50 ratio, and in return earn a proportion of transaction fees as well as the UNI governance token.

[**5. Balancer**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/) is a liquidity protocol that distinguishes itself through flexible staking. It doesn’t require lenders to add liquidity equally to both pools. Instead, liquidity providers can create customized liquidity pools with varying token ratios. 

[**6. Synthetix**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/) is a derivatives liquidity protocol that allows users to create synthetic crypto assets through the use of [**oracles**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) for almost any traditional finance asset that can deliver reliable pricing data.

[**7. Yearn.finance**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance-protocol/) is an automated decentralized aggregation protocol that allows yield farmers to use various lending protocols like Aave and Compound for the highest yield. Yearn.finance algorithmically seeks the most profitable yield farming services and uses rebasing to maximize their profit. Yearn.finance made waves in 2020 when its governance token [**YFI** ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)climbed to over $40,000 in value at one stage.

Other notable yield farming protocols: [**Curve**](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/), [**Harvest**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/), [**Ren**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/) and [**SushiSwap**](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/16/bullish-activity-for-bitcoin-under-the-hood-of-the-sushiswap-saga-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock/).

TLDR:***At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards on their holdings. With yield farming, an investor deposits units of a cryptocurrency into a lending protocol to earn interest from trading fees.***"

The Axie core team will build functionality for the game assets associated with the Axie brand in concurrence with the community. The Axie universe must be fun above all else; only by having an immersive gaming experience can the ecosystem attract enough participants to accrue value to the network.

# Battling

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img iakoupn6cnp71...*

In October 2018, the Axie core team released the first battle system built on top of the Axie game assets. The battle system was structured as an ""idle battle"" system with inspiration from games like ""Final Fantasy Tactics"" and ""Idle Heroes"".

The Axie team started development on the real-time card battle system and application in March 2019 and released an Alpha in December 2019. As of October 2020, the Application has amassed over 15,000 downloads with over 7,000 weekly active users.

Much like Pokemon has gone through numerous iterations and types of battle systems, we also expect Axie to have many variations of battles over the years to come.

 **Tournaments and Esports**

Due to its skill-based, competitive nature, the Axie battle system is a good fit for competitive play and Esports. We believe this is a critical aspect for future growth and we have seen how engaged the players become when there is money on the line. 

Axie players have already earned thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency through numerous tournaments hosted by the core team or 3rd party sponsors.

# Breeding and $SLP 

Like real-world pets, Axies can be bred to create new offspring. To avoid hyperinflation of Axies there is a maximum amount of times an Axie can be bred before it is sterile.

Breeding an Axie costs AXS and some Smooth Love Potions depending on how many times the Axies have been bred. The AXS portion is variable and subject to adjustment based on a myriad of economic factors.

* Axie Infinity does not sell $SLP to players directly
* Axie Infinity does not provide liquidity for $SLP

&amp;#x200B;

|Breed Count|Breed Number|Total SLP Cost|
|:-|:-|:-|
|(0/7)|1|600|
|(1/7)|2|900|
|(2/7)|3|1500|
|(3/7)|4|2400|
|(4/7)|5|3900|
|(5/7)|6|6300|
|(6/7)|7|10200|

 **Genetics** 

Each Axie has 6 body parts as well as a body shape. For each part, an Axie possesses 3 genes. A dominant (D), recessive (R1), and minor recessive gene (R2). 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/viam2obycnp71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7938d90db052616adc4fa214694f8f04dec8ae6e)

The dominant gene is what determines the body part that is physically present on the Axie. When breeding, each gene has a chance to be passed down to offspring:

**Dominant (D):** 37.5% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

**Recessive (R1):** 9.375% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

**Minor Recessive (R2):** 3.125% chance to pass this gene to offspring.

Then select an Axie to pair it with!

**How Long Does it take for an Axie to become an adult?**

Axies take 5 days to reach maturity.

After 5 days, you can morph your egg to an adult Axie and see the Axie's genes.

 

# Axie Population &amp; Long-term Sustainability

 

**Key Points**

* Axie is a new type of game that rewards players for the time and effort they spend both playing the game and growing the ecosystem.
* Axie has a 100% player-owned, real money economy. Rather than selling game items or copies, the developers of the game focus on growing the player to player economy and take small fees to monetize. Axies are created by players using in-game resources (SLP &amp; AXS) and sold to new/other players. You can think of Axie as a nation with a real economy. The holders of the AXS token are the government that receives tax revenues. The inventors/builders of the game, Sky Mavis, hold \~20% of all AXS tokens.
* Game resources and items are tokenized, meaning they can be sold to anyone, anywhere on open peer-to-peer markets.

Axie population growth is a major factor within the Axie ecosystem. At any given moment, there exists some ideal inflation rate that allows us to grow to our maximum potential. Too slow and Axie prices are too high for everyday people to join; especially competitive Axies. Too fast and you get unhealthy inflation. 

Long term Axie population management relies on:

* **Adding additional utility to Axies** through new experiences such as land, mini-games. This also adds utility to Axies beyond their effectiveness in fleeting metas. 
* **Adding vertical, rather than purely horizontal progression.** Right now in order to progress the main path that people take is by expanding the size of their collection. This dynamic is not optimal long term. In the long run there will be upgrades to both Axies AND Land that will require crafting ingredients. Axies themselves may be “released” to obtain these crafting ingredients. This creates a long term supply sink to the Axie population. Axie progression is coming in the future; and it promises to create a much stronger bond between trainers and the Axies they choose to upgrade.
* **Soulbound Axies,** aka non-transferable Axies, that are competitive in the arena will allow anyone to compete and have fun.  Earning potential for these soul bound Axies should be zero or close to zero; meaning that of course demand will remain for strong “real” battle Axies. Also keep in mind that demand for Axies is ultimately what also drives demand for SLP (and AXS), so creating more reasons to own Axies and making it easier for us to grow are important in a a healthy economy.

**Transitioning from Growth-Dependency Using Network Strength**

In the beginning, the Axie economy will be dependent on growth and new entrants. New players require Axies to get started, Axies price and breeding profitability will be determined by the demand from these prospective Axie players.This is much like any startup, growth is necessary in the early days.

However, as the size and strength of the Axie network grows there will increasingly be new sources of external capital into the ecosystem such as:

* **Advertising fees and sponsorships**. Many projects are already eager to distribute rewards and tokens to the Axie economy. So far MakerDAO, AAVE, and Kyber Network have done experimental token drops to Axie players. Axie is already the largest community of people who understand how to use Blockchain technology in the world; there is immense value in advertising to a community like this.
* **Nonprofit organizations** will be a major source of Axie demand and to pour capital from donors into Lunacia with no expectation of return; only the will to do good.
* **Government donations and grants.** Axie is well poised to become a laboratory for Universal basic income experiments. 

It's also important to note that many Axie players see Axie as a fun game and a social community to meet friends. More than 50% of Axie players prefer the gameplay and community to the economic aspect. These players value the fun and relationships that they make through Axie much higher than any potential earnings; these players make the economy stronger in the long run. 

There are other types of value that Axie players gain through their journey such as:

* Joy of owning a pet.
* Fun, rest, and relaxation.
* Making friends and finding business partners/mentors.
* Learning how to use an important new technology. There's no need for paid ""blockchain classes"".

 

# Land

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wx0x1qcldnp71.png?width=1502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=721b528494820b05a03201f90ef77e0ff7b1f9c3)

Lunacia,  the Axie homeland,  is divided into tokenized plots of land which act as homes and bases of operation for their Axies. Plots can be upgraded over time using a variety of resources and crafting ingredients that can be found when playing the game. 

In addition, land-owners might find AXS tokens on their land plots, or use the Axies that occupy the land plot to explore resource nodes on the map. When interacting with resources nodes Axies can find AXS and potentially other resources. 

**Resource Gathering and Crafting**

* Resources will spawn in nodes across Lunacia and be used to upgrade both land and Axies.
* Landholders will have first rights to any resources that spawn on their land.
* &amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gxz8vgundnp71...*

**Real-Time PvE Battles**

Monsters called Chimera are terrorizing Lunacia. Players will be able to take on Chimera in real-time battles either alone or in groups. Chimera will drop an assortment of resources, items, and blueprints used to upgrade land and individual Axies.

Additional details about land will be released in time.

Phase one is the gameplay mentioned above, and phase two will focus on turning Lunacia into a virtual world with a focus on user-generated content. Players will be able to create games using the Lunacia SDK and place these games on land that they own. 

**Lunacia SDK**

The Lunacia SDK will initially be a map editor where players can use Axie Infinity art assets to create games and other experiences. Once a game has been created it is saved as a Non-Fungible Token and can be traded. These NFTs can be placed on land and players will be able to click on them to enter the game inside."

1. I place 1500 USD worth of ETH into the smart contract as collateral, and then mint 1000 DAI
2. The ETH place plummets, such that now I only have 1450 USD as collateral. This triggers liquidation.
3. Assuming I get liquidated incrementally, 50 USD worth of my ETH is sold. Now I have 1400 USD worth of ETH left. This transaction however brings my collateral down from 145% to 140%. The liquidation however should bring my collateral back up to 150%.

As it currently stands the ether ceiling wont be raised for 2 days which is an eternity in this market! then when it is raised in will only be raised 150 million: with all the pent up demand that could be gobbled up in less than 24 hours.

What if we could print different global currencies, like EUR, YEN, GBP, and many others using a system on top of current Maker-Dai system?     

Making another collaterized smart contract system with Ether or WBTC for some other crypto just seems like too much trouble, plus, would there be enough Ether and crypto in general to guarantee these other Dai-like tokens to be collaterized in a healthy way?     

What about a system where we could put normal Dai in and print something like DaiGBP, or DaiYEN? These tokens would be indirectly collaterized by the tokens already serving as collateral in the current Maker-Dai system, and would be much easier to print, plus we wouldn't need oracles for every currency and every crypto pair, we would only require info about the USD-GBP/YEN/EUR rates, so the system would be simpler.     

I am bringing this up because I was recently thinking about taking out a Maker loan to buy some stuff in my local currency, but then I would have to worry about my local currency decreasing in value against the US dollar.

DAI marketcap below 4% of total crypto marketcap (currently 0.14%, USDT at 2%)

Up to 15 trillion BTC marketcap. 

0% DSR  (currently 0%)

Surplus buffer remain smaller than 1% of total outstanding DAI (currently 0.21%)

No major stability fee spikes, and maintain current spread with global dollar funding rate. (currently 2.5% for ETH-A and 6% for WBTC)

Note: the minimum quantity can occur any time between now and year 2026, a black swan in 2025 boosting MKR supply to over 1M, should not affect your guess.

I know that one of the main disadvantages of Dai compared to other stable coins (especially those which are pegged by fiat) is this liquidity problem. But I'm not sure to understand.

I'm trying to implement parts of the Maker protocol into my contracts and I use a proxy and the DssProxyActions contract as an interface. Unfortunately, I haven't managed to pass the following check in the VAT:

`require(either(urn.art == 0, tab &gt;= ilk.dust), ""Vat/dust"");` 

On the Kovan Testnet, I was trying to call the LockETHAndDraw function with ex. 1 Gwei as value (...after i called  openLockETHAndDraw with zero value, which  works out just fine). Additionally, I made sure to transmit the ether to the actions contract when calling.

Has much thought been given to whether DAI would be viable if this comes to be (especially if the currency was ethereum based)?

If instead of selling the ETH for the down payment, I borrow against it with the hope it continues to rise (minimizing risk of liquidation) then eventually I could pay down that loan and get my ETH back and boom, magic.  I would also have some additional ETH on the side in case the price goes down, thus, allowing me to put more in to again minimize the risk of liquidation.

### Increase the LINK-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQtn7UY?network=mainnet) governance poll, the LINK-A debt ceiling will be increased from 10 million DAI to 20 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Increase the MANA-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmSCLfXN?network=mainnet) governance poll, the MANA-A debt ceiling will be increased from 250 thousand DAI to 1 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Decrease the BAT-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmW4ei2M?network=mainnet) governance poll, the BAT-A debt ceiling will be decreased from 10 million DAI to 2 million DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-debt-ceiling-adjustments-11th-jan-2021/6005) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Decrease the TUSD-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXTGwq4?network=mainnet) governance poll, the TUSD-A debt ceiling will be decreased from 135 million DAI to zero DAI if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-manage-tusd-exposure-due-to-ownership-change/5821) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Increase the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfTU85J?network=mainnet#poll-detail) governance poll, a mandate exists for increasing the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling to the value of 500 million DAI. Given the risk posed by new code (even after audits), the non-Foundation mandated actors have been pursuing a gradual increase to this target value. That policy continues as a part of this proposal. If this proposal passes, the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling will be increased from 30 million DAI to 80 million DAI immediately, and it will increase linearly over the next 12 weeks to its target of 500 million DAI without intervention from Maker Governance. This gradual increase will be achieved by using the lerp  
 module developed by community contributors.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/road-to-the-psm/5353/85) thread for discussion and details on the development of the PSM.

### Increase the Debt Floor(dust) Parameter

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWPAu5z?network=mainnet) governance poll, the Debt Floor (aka dust  
) parameter will be increased from 500 DAI to 2000 DAI for all non-PSM vault-types if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increasing-dust-parameter/5963) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this change.

### Vault Compensation Working Group Payment

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQcXFeC?network=mainnet) governance poll, 12,700 DAI will be distributed to members of the Vault Compensation Working Group as remuneration for their work on the ultimately unsuccessful Vault Compensation Proposal if this proposal passes.

See [this](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-vault-compensation-working-group-payment/5562) signal thread for rationale and discussion relating to this action.

### Whitelist Instadapp on the ETHUSD OSM Oracles

As per the outcome of [this](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmNSb2cu?network=mainnet#poll-detail) governance poll, [InstaDapp](https://instadapp.io/) will be whitelisted on the ETHUSD OSM Oracle if this proposal passes.

I'm trying to understand why we need DAI? At the end of the day all Maker is providing is a collateralized margin loan, which is nothing new in finance. Cryptocurrencies like BTC, LTC, XMR, etc. solely exist in order to transact with other people. DAI isn't offering anything different or exciting to me in the way I transact with people. Why do I even want a coin that is pegged to a US Dollar when I see the inherent flaws in owning Dollars at all? What value is added outside of providing another token pegged to a fiat currency we all want to forget about in the first place? The only value I can find is it might provide a short term pathway for lazy people to gain familiarity with the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.

Please don't read this as ""FUD"" or some nonsense, I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something here.

2. . Can the (exact) DAI price be determined by an exchange like Coinbase on their own, based on Coinbase's internal suppy and demand?
3. Couldn't Maker DAO simply create their own exchange, where they would sell DAI for 1 Dollar exactly to all incoming customers, simply taking the dollar, and giving the DAI in return? Why is this not doable?"

Discussion: Making Maker Fractionally Reserved (a bit of a why and how),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/q8thdv/discussion_making_maker_fractionally_reserved_a/,samskiter,1,2021-10-16 01:41:44,2,/r/MakerDAO/comments/q8thdv/discussion_making_maker_fractionally_reserved_a/,,"I've been out of the Maker loop for a while now so excuse my ignorance (imagine I wrote ""IIRC"" in front of every sentence!) if anything here is out of date or just stupid, but here's something I've been mulling over in the shower for a few months:

**Why a fractional reserve \*might\* be a good idea**

The TRIBE showed a clear appetite for a fractional reserved stable coin - just the stability mechanism didn't work. And it now seems like they are proposing backing FEI with DAI... which seems... pointless. Well I had a look at MAKERs collateral stats and $3.5BN of $14.8BN TVL is other stable coins. Put another way: $3.5BN of $6.8BN total supply is backed by stable coins. 23% of Makers collateral is other stable coins and **51% of DAI is backed by stable coins.** It does raise the question - is DAI truly an algorithmic stablecoin is 50% of it is ultimately backed by real dollars somewhere?

The other point to add about all this stablecoin collateral is it has a constant cost on Maker/DAI - it all accrues interest through stability fees. I've posted before about viewing DAI governance as a PID (proportional, integral, derivative) problem. Through this lens you could see that over the long term, there is some stable ""base"" demand for DAI. The problem is the only control we have at the minute is the stability fee and we can't push that negative to inflate the base supply of DAI. (A PID controller would push the lever negative to 'integrate up' the supply of DAI). As a result we'll always have some cost in the system working against DAI...

**How fractional do you go?**

Following on from the idea of a 'steady state' demand for DAI I think there's a less scary way to look at fractional reserves - not as some endless pool of money that we keep printing, but as something we can algorithmically control. I.e. we embrace PIR control and think about what is the integral term? i.e. ""over the past 5 years, total DAI in circulation has never dropped below $2.3bn, so let's aim to have $1bn unbacked DAI in circulation so we have some wiggle room"".

I'm proposing that the proportion of unbacked DAI is controlled by governance votes and careful analysis of the historical demand for DAI.

**Options for a fractional reserve**

1. **Negative interest rates on loans** \- This is the most often talked and argued about system to decouple DAI from collateral. The problem is that the interest rate becomes both the stability mechanism AND the way we inflate or deflate how much DAI is fractionally owned. If we want to drastically change the amount that is fractionally held, we would have to drastically change the stability fee. Example: If the total DAI in circulation decreased and came close to some threshold, we would therefore want to decrease the unbacked DAI by increasing interest rates - this would bump up the price of DAI. Granted a decrease in DAI in circulation is probably due to a lower price - but with only one lever to pull we can only respond to EITHER price OR the fractionally backed amount at a time, not both.
2. **Don't destroy all repaid DAI** \- So here's my shower thought - currently the DSR is funded by interest on loans. When you pay off your collateral debt, you pay the DAI you borrowed back, which is destroyed, plus a little extra. This DAI is sent to pay the DSR pool and any excess is used to buy and burn some MKR. Rather than destroying \*all\* the DAI when you repay, we could keep some back and either put into the DSR pool or use it to buy and burn MKR - this would create unbacked DAI. We can remove unbacked DAI by doing the opposite - destroy both the repaid DAI AND the stability fee. So now we have a new lever to pull - how much DAI is destroyed when repaying debt and how much is kept around. This allows control of the fractional reserver that is separate from the stability mechanism. The ultimate backstop is still MKR, which could be used to buy up any spare DAI (provided the market cap of MKR is kept above the total Unbacked DAI).

I know unbacked DAI/negative interest rates is a controversial topic - but genuinely up for civilised discussion about this :)"

They are an interesting way to help the users who found crypto through NFTs but haven't made the leap into the ERC-20 ecosystem find their way.

Wanted to share that the WSTETH-A Vaults are live at DeFi Saver. [wstETH](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/wsteth/) is the wrapped version of stETH, Lido's liquid ETH staking token and this new Maker Vault type was voted in [last week](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-parameter-changes-wsteth-a-onboarding-october-22-2021?network=mainnet#proposal-detail).

We actually released this a few days ago, on Friday, but thought maybe some people are more likely to see an announcement here rather than on twitter.

Our support for WSTETH-A Vaults includes the options to:

* Create Vaults (borrow against wstETH)
* Create an instantly leveraged position/Vault (e.g. long ETH, but using wstETH instead)
* Convert any ETH-x Vault into WSTETH-A
* Automate WSTETH-A Vaults (so you can setup liquidation protection or automated leveraging)

We shared a bit about all of these in our [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DeFiSaver/status/1454159904651026444), but I'll gladly provide any more info and answer any questions in this thread, so please go ahead and @ me with anything!

For anyone looking to check or try any of these options, note that we also have a *Simulation mode* available in DeFi Saver, where you can either create a blank account with 100 ETH in credits or simulate your existing account to try out an ETH-A to WSTETH-A shift, for example, without having to commit any actual funds right away.

You can check out any of this at [https://app.defisaver.com/](https://app.defisaver.com/).

Educational - Liquidity In Decentralized Exchanges Simply Explained,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qmjimi/educational_liquidity_in_decentralized_exchanges/,sheetsjohn16,1,2021-11-04 20:31:38,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qmjimi/educational_liquidity_in_decentralized_exchanges/,,"Hi guys :)

I've made a video of one of the most important things to understand in DEFI, Dexes, and crypto in general, **Liquidity!**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vsg8P9Gq-0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsg8P9Gq-0)

In the video, I will explain what is liquidity with a lot of examples and I will simplify it for you so you can level up your DEFI understanding.

We will look at the biggest decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) which is PancakeSwap - in order to understand what it is.

The information in the video applies to any other DEX on any other blockchain (It works the same).

Liquidity is one of the most important things in decentralized exchanges and without it, the DEX's actually doesn't worth anything.

The more liquidity decentralized exchanges have, the better prices the users are going to pay when swapping tokens and they will suffer less from price impact and slippage.

That's why most of the decentralized exchanges are ""fighting"" for liquidity by offering Yield Farm and Staking programs.

Basically, the war is between blockchains and decentralized exchanges, the one with the most amount of liquidity wins.

Imagine a decentralized exchange like a robot that holds tokens in pairs (for example Cake-BNB). 

The robot in our story is a smart contract that it's is to preserve the same amount of BNB and Cake in the reserves. 

Anytime someone is buying or selling cake to the contract (robot) he changes the balance and therefore the contract is giving the user a ""worse price"" for the swap (Slippage).

The bigger the swap, the bigger the slippage is gonna be. The more liquidity the ""robot"" has, the lower the slippage will be.

In this video, I am going to explain to you all these kinds of concepts in an easy way, so after watching the video you will finally understand what does liquidity means on decentralized exchanges and why it's so important.

Hope you like it, and lemme know if you have any questions.

Johnny."

DeFi is exploding in growth. But there aren’t enough Solidity developers or whitehat hackers to go around. From a development perspective, the DeFi ecosystem is being held back from its true potential. And from a security perspective, devastating hacks keep obliterating projects.

Smart contract talent just does not exist to allow DeFi to safely scale.
It’s important for the DeFi community to contribute to the public good of upskilling smart contract whitehat hacking talent.

That’s why Immunefi is offering the community-driven Whitehat Scholarship to proven smart contract hackers.

   The goal of SafeShiba is simple, reward holders. We might have a memecoin name, but we have the best tokenomics in the game. We are a fair launched and 100% transparent project that are always putting community in front of everything else.

 Our Tokenomics are as follows:

 \- 2% BTC Buyback - 2% of every transaction will be used to purchase BTC to help back the SAFESHIB token and create a floor price. Once our lending app launches, token holders will be able to borrow BTC against their SAFESHIB at 0% APY

 \- 2% Dev/Marketing/Buyback Fee - 2% of every transaction will be used to support development efforts along with buybacks, burns and marketing to help show the world our project

 \- 1% Burn - 1% of every Transaction is burned to help remove supply from the system and create a supply shock. This further helps our holders benefit

   Roadmap: To make sure we always deliver cutting edge tokenomics and features to our holders, we've devised the following roadmap:

 Lending App (Q1 2022) - This is the pinnacle of our Tokenomics, 0% APY BTC borrowing against SAFESHIB. 

 DEX (Coming Q2 2022) - A state of the art DEX that will provide yield farming opportunities and additional ways for SAFESHIB to increase in value

NFTs (Coming Q4 2022) - Revolutionary NFT's that let you dive into the metaverse and experience Web 3.0. And of course, even more ways to spread value to SAFESHIB holders.

 CEX Listings - Tier 1 Exchanges are planned for 2022 and we promise to deliver big. This will help spread the word of SAFESHIB massively.

 Alongside all of this we will be hosting weekly competitions, buybacks, surprise announcements and much more."

What are the wider community’s thoughts on continued burn? My (tentative) thoughts are that a small, continuous or regular burn increases safety simply because it ensures that market participants are still ready to bid — testing the plumbing if you will.

For those interested in delegating their MKR, I also invite you to delegate to this contract (currently a Shadow Delegate until Wednesday): [Delegate Contract](https://vote.makerdao.com/address/0xf60d7a62c98f65480725255e831de531efe3fe14?network=mainnet)"
Cheapest way to send Dai to vault?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qujyae/cheapest_way_to_send_dai_to_vault/,pgarrity18,1,2021-11-16 00:14:45,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qujyae/cheapest_way_to_send_dai_to_vault/,,"I am in the U.S. and I am considering opening a vault and taking out a Dai loan using ETH as collateral. I want to understand the logistics for paying back the loan. I am considering a $100k loan. 

On Coinbase Pro I can purchase Dai at the market price with a 0.01% Taker Fee. Does it make sense to then send directly to the vault address from Coinbase Pro? Are there any smart contract related issues that suggest I should send to a private wallet first? If so, that is getting expensive if I am to pay this back monthly.

What is the best way to pay back a loan and minimize costs? I understand the tradeoff between a monthly payment and a quarterly or yearly payment (less network fees, but higher risk of triggering liquidation). I am trying to evaluate the best approach and I am curious how others make regular payments from USD -&gt; Dai -&gt; Vault. I do not see an L2 solution for this yet but maybe I am missing something?"

I think that it could potentially be a good idea to add as collateral ETFs that track Green Bond Indices, like [GRNB](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/green-bond-etf-grnb/) or [FTSE](https://www.ftserussell.com/products/indices/green-impact-bond).

Pros: ""Green bonds are mostly backed by the full balance sheet of the issuer, and not only by the cash flows related to the climate-friendly project financed from the proceeds"" ([page 56](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1909f.pdf)). They also provide the benefits of diversification.

Cons: The returns of some of these ETFs [have been pretty low](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/grnb/) imo. 

In general, I think they would be pretty safe from wild price fluctuations and they would provide investment in clean energy. but I'm not sure that they would provide enough yield. What do you guys think?"

Hey guys! Found quite a promising crypto project. They’re launching IDO at the end of November. Check this out token.wono.io,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/qwylcc/hey_guys_found_quite_a_promising_crypto_project/,myriality,1,2021-11-19 04:18:48,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/qwylcc/hey_guys_found_quite_a_promising_crypto_project/,,"Brief: Wono.io is the first freelance exchange, implementing cryptocurrency. Their token will be used to regulate financial transactions between customers and freelancers. Investors and token holders can earn on staking. Plus, there are some ways to earn on token sale or pre-sale. (Waiting list registration started at - [https://token.wono.io/](https://token.wono.io/)).

They promise to post a series of articles, explaining the work of token and how to earn on it.   
So, here's why invest in Wono:   
1) Idea. The token will be used as a payment between employers and freelancers. It's based on smart-contracts and aims to avoid fraud and scam in freelancing. Just to add, in 2021, out of 3.6 billion people's global workforce, 1.1 are [freelancers](https://www.ccn.com/38-of-freelancers-regularly-use-cryptocurrency-survey-reveals/). I guess, you see the potential.   
2) [**Huobi**](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/) **support**. The project is supported by Huobi exchange. It's the third cryptocurrency exchange in the world after [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). All users would be able to stake and exchange tokens on Huobi via a special crypto-wallet.    
3) Fast-growing [community](https://www.facebook.com/wonoworld/). For now, Wono.io is a freelance exchange for people mostly from Asia and Africa. It already has 518,000+ registered users from which 8,000+ are already paying for the subscription services. The Wono monthly turnover is $127,520. Average profit from one paying user: $15,94.  
   Of course, it's up to you to decide whether to invest in the Wono project or not, but you can see its advantages and potential. IDO's coming at the end of November."

These regulations seem to be more geared toward Tether and USDC which operate like money market funds or banks.

It seems to me though that bank-like regulations on stablecoins like Dai or Terra do not make sense. If the government said a stablecoin issuer has to be a federally regulated bank, how is it possible that Maker or Terra could comply? Does anyone have a good read on whether the proposals would apply? 

I can't tell if Dai / Terra would be exempt, if they would be banned in the US (and is there a mechanism to?), or what.

I can almost get it if we're talking about a model like Tether where you want to avoid blatant fraud and systemic risk. But are they going to stifle innovation by not including a framework for these tokens to live?"

But this Deco thing is a bit ridiculous to me. I read the forums about the proposal and so many good questions and counterpoints are made and reasons why we shouldn't be paying this much.. and yet here it is, exactly as proposed with no answer to the forums questions.

Did we find out about if revenue sharing comp structure will cause issues with the SEC?

Did we attempt to negotiate the deal? (sounded like we had ALL of the leverage as they already did the work and needed us while we didn't need them)

Did we test the market to see if 5.3m could buy a better product?

Weren't estimates for fixed rate borrowers low? When are we expected to break even on this 5m?

The problem that I seem to be having is that  transaction costs make it almost impossible to be profitable without either having massive amounts of funds to work with to make the fees negligible, which defeats the purpose of decentralized  finance or have an unacceptable degree of risk to the point of having no risk management at all.

Here is an example of what I was wanting to do. My business has access to a line of credit with a 2% interest rate and interest only payments for up to 3 years. I wanted to utilize that low rate to either purchase etherium put it into a vault to mint dai then use the dai over several platforms to take advantage of the higher interest rates or just buy dai directly to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities. The gas fees make it almost impossible. 

Do you have any helpful information to assist me in getting started and resolving this? 

Any information will be helpful. Maybe I'm missing a piece of the puzzle and I don't even know that I don't know. 

Thanks"

At 4.5M marketcap, a strong contract and an audit on the way, we can expect huge growth in the near future, many have already recouped initial investment in Polkadot reflections! If you’re the kind of guy that buys real tokens and not just meme coins, this is the project for you! The standard for pay-back tokens so far is flawed, with pay-back in the same token, taxes for all affect the price the same, redistributed taxes re-enter the market and cause drops. Which is why reflective tokens have become so popular in the past months. Taxes are applied in every transaction, which in turn purchase and drop a separate high value token to all holders with affecting the value of the original, giving passive income in stable high-marketap projects. For this reason and many other, InfinityDOT is a promising token, at the height of the bullrun, in a moment in which all chains are filled by meme-coins with no porpose that die within days, we have new token that provides actual value, and like it’s precedesor reflective tokens, it’s here to stay. As opposed to coins such as EverETH, or InfinityADA, InfinityDOT provides it’s reflection in Polkadot, a self-named etherum killer that has grown into a top 10 Marketcap coin with extremely dedicated development, community and an indisputable bright future ahead. Here comes InfinityDOT, while new tokens on Polkadot are still few in comparasion to the giants that are the Binance Smart Chain and Etherum, work for it’s future can start off-chain, with reflective tokens. InfinityDOT not only proposes as an investment opportunity it’s possible growth, but also the certain growth of a stable future token with a long history on the market. A future of the InfinityDOT token on it’s father chain that is BSC and a promising future on the parachain of Polkadot! The token has much work to do, the concept is promising, yet simple for anyone to understand, and compared to the majority of BSC Tokens, has a high survival chance. The team has just started going public, with a possible pre-sale to raise liquidity this week, a sale on DxSale to raise trust trough locked liquidity, a public open source contract to prove it’s security, and a perfect moment for a real project to start, in a sea of short-lived meme tokens, a real project is a real needle in a haystack. Of course DYOR, the project has barely started and has a long life ahead, the website is up and the contract will be published shortly, all we can do now is wait and verify it’s validity when the contract is published.

Dai circulation relative to MKR price,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/rb96gu/dai_circulation_relative_to_mkr_price/,adamdownup,10,2021-12-08 04:51:35,36,/r/MakerDAO/comments/rb96gu/dai_circulation_relative_to_mkr_price/,,"Hello all,

I've been around the forum for a little while and have been holding MKR  since July and was wondering what your thoughts were on the apparent disconnect between the number of Dai in circulation and the value of the MKR token. I have seen Rune mention a valuation model places the fair value currently at circa 6K (dollars) and have seen similar before (https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/maker-dao-investment-and-valuation-3f34a236b723) but we're more than 50% down from that figure as it stands and have bled significantly on the ETH pair since August. Whilst this is definitely a long term hold for me as provided regulations don't prove problematic (which I believe they won't for Maker DAO relative to other stable coin issuers), I see owning MKR as akin to investing in a bank, we're nearing 10B Dai but that success isn't translating into value accrual for MKR holders. I will be interested to see how things pan out with the proposals on burning, tokenomics and onboarding on more RWA (including greener assets) but do feel there needs to be a greater incentive other than voting rights.

Anyway hopefully this hasn't come across as a 'when my bag pump ser' post as it's definitely not intended to, just seeing if there's any thoughts in the community on this topic."

As far as I understand, you basically double (less since you need over 100% collateral) your assets for just 2.5% interest?


If you borrow DAI and buy more crypto with it, and that crypto falls in value, I know that’s risky since you need to come up with the price difference when reimbursing the DAI.


But if you borrow DAI just to lend it out, there is no risk other than liquation right? Hence my question in the title :)

Or do you just let it sit there and pay it to keep your colleralization ratio in line? Do people generally just keep it open and then pay it all back at once when they want their ETH back? Doesnt a lot of interest accrue if you do this? 

Its just weird to take a loan out when theres no one sending you a bill every month. If that makes sense. Easy to lose track and get liquidated etc."

That markets love variety, and if these coins offer different savings rates, governance etc., end users will flow toward those where they find value? Or will network effects necessitate a flow toward a single superior coin?

Put another way: (aside from being a crypto purist who is wary of legacy institutions -- sure, a reason in and of itself, but let's put that aside for now) why would one elect to hold Dai over USDC? What about Dai vs. DeFiDollar? Etc. etc.

I'm not trying to trade or anything like that, I'm 40 yrs old and run my own business so I'm looking at it as a kind of retirement investment but I'm also interested in crypto as a whole. I plan to invest more, and also I have small amounts in ada and bnb, and I'm looking to expand my portfolio. I'm not about to put my life savings (not that I have any) into it, but just want to see where it goes over the next 5-10 years.

My question really is yfi and how it is valued so much higher when mkr has a higher cap and volumes etc. Its quite remarkable how little mkr is talked about. And also where could mkr end up?

\---------------------------  
As I can see, you have sent MKR over a BSC network - [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x201239612ea27052aeb579c814dcb16fbe473bc58918c8a309777f7fe0e2e16b](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x201239612ea27052aeb579c814dcb16fbe473bc58918c8a309777f7fe0e2e16b). Atomic Wallet does not support BSC network, so MKR cannot be reflected on your wallet's balance.

In order to access your MKR, you can import your ETH private key to MetaMask. Here are the articles that can be useful regarding your problem:

1. [How to import Atomic Wallet private keys to Metamask?](https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/138-how-to-import-atomic-wallet-private-keys-to-metamask)  
2. [How to connect Metamask to the BSC network?](https://medium.com/@spartanprotocol/connecting-metamask-to-bsc-mainnet-23e434bc670f)  
\---------------------------  
I have gone through both guides and completed the first one and went on second one but when it comes to the SECTION ""BEP2 &lt;-&gt; BEP20 Bridge"" I am at a loss.

I would appreciate if someone explains to me how to proceed after that since it starts talking about connecting with a smart contract which I am not familiar with.

It would be ideal if there was a web wallet that already has these connections and bridges available so I can import my ehtereum private key or something else and access the coins ...

Through the Weak Hand Tax, market manipulation and other factors that may result in depreciation of value are deterred AND the IFY staking pool is fueled (self sufficient).

So like the title says, I made a rookie mistake due to multi-tasking and inattention. I was transferring DAO from one wallet to my Metamask wallet and, despite me telling folks to double-check the intended address, I pasted the actual DAO Erc-20 address instead. 

Why, you may ask? Because this was my first time interacting with DAO on Metamask and when you setup DAO on your Metamask wallet, you must add it as a custom token if it doesn’t show up. This requires pasting the token’s address in the custom field. 
I knew what to expect and did this in what I  thought was the most pragmatic, tested manner: I’d sent 10 test DAO to my wallet, and I expected to not see it in Metamask, so I went and pasted the DAO token address into the custom token field, and the 10 I’d sent were visible. 

THAT was the address stored in my phone’s memory when I pasted the address to send the remaining DAO I wanted to send to Metamask. 

Is there any way to retrieve these DAO tokens or are the lost to the wind? It’s around 31.7 DAO so not a king’s fortune - just expensive enough to be a hard reminder.

Price Feed Oracles Aren't Necessary,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/m0v8ti/price_feed_oracles_arent_necessary/,Jone951,1,2021-03-09 09:15:35,9,/r/MakerDAO/comments/m0v8ti/price_feed_oracles_arent_necessary/,,"Instead of relying on semi-trusted price feed oracles to determine the price of ETH (or any collateral asset), why not use an auction?

Of course the issue with using an auction is that an attacker could overbid to make the system think the asset in question is worth more than it actually is, but this is costly and could be detected and mitigated.

If you sell some DAI at auction for ETH, you will know with certainty that the value of DAI is less than or equal to the auction price, since an attacker cannot coordinate an attack that causes the DAI to sell for less than it's worth. This will give you an upper bound of what DAI is worth relative to ETH. You can then auction off the ETH (that you just bought) for DAI. For the same reason, this will give you a lower bound of what DAI is worth relative to ETH (i.e. an upper bound of what ETH is worth relative to DAI).

After both auctions you will know, with certainty, an upper and lower bound of the ETH-DAI exchange rate. If the spread between the upper and lower bounds is small enough, you could use their average as the price.

Problem is, an attacker could overbid on one of the auctions, causing the average of the upper and lower bounds to deviate from the actual exchange rate of the asset pair. But this will also have the effect of increasing the spread between the upper and lower bound, a clear indication  that an attacker has overbid in an attempt to manipulate the price.

If the spread is too large, indicating an overbidding attack, another pair of auctions must be held--one large enough to make an attack too costly to be profitable/feasible. A larger pair of auctions would of course have costs that must be internalized by the system (in the form of DAI inflation since, under normal circumstances, less DAI will be returned than were originally auctioned off). But luckily, an overbidding attack would be profitable to the system as it will end up with more DAI than it originally auctioned off. This profit could be used to offset the cost of the larger auction (by burning some of the excess DAI that were gained in the first auction). Hopefully this larger pair of auctions will result in a spread that is acceptably small. If not, an even larger pair of auctions must be held.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible questions/concerns:

But where do you get the DAI to auction off?     Just mint it. It shouldn't be enough to actually lower the price of DAI by very much, and even if it does, buying the DAI back in the second auction should drive the price back up to where it was originally. And because the market is aware that the selling pressure of the first auction will be immediately followed an equivalent buying pressure of the second auction, the price should stay pretty stable.

But the price feed oracles provide the ETH-USD exchange rate, not the ETH-DAI exchange rate. Won't this be an issue?     I don't think it will because DAI is pegged to the USD using the savings rate and the stability fee, which are both set by MKR holders, not by the system. The price feed isn't used in setting these rates.

Wont all these auctions take a long time?     If a small pair of actions is enough to result in an acceptably small spread between the upper and lower bound, I'd imagine it would be pretty quick. But if multiple successive rounds of larger auctions is forced to occur, it could take some time. It would pretty much be a very expensive DOS attack. In the end the price would be found, but the system would be without a price feed for a little while.

This is obviously absurd, and it's hard for me to believe that it would actually cost so much just to send a tiny small payment. Shouldn't the fees be based more on the amount of the transaction or something? Is this normal with all cryptos or just a few? Are there any currencies that I can send between wallets for free or very little cost?

I was led to believe that crypto was the way of the future and way better than the traditional banking process and online economy in general. So how is that the case when it's much easier and cheaper, even free, to send/exchange cash between people/accounts? Especially with newfangled services like CashApp, Venmo, debit transfers, etc.

The challenge is based on a strategy that I created based on my trading result calculator and it’s actually working out really good so far.

I’m 36 trades in and up +636% already. My vision is to increase my trading account by +80000% this year, going from 100 USD to 80k USD.

 Because DAI is only collateralized with other crypto (like ETH) , what would happen if these collaterals drop significantly in value?

Instead it's more like ""Maker is making x many DAI and pulling in y amount of fees"" therefore z Maker will be burned and increase the value of each Maker -- oh yeah, and it's also traded on an exchange (so speculators can speculate).  

It's a devilish asset to try and price, or to even try to predict how Maker's value will increase over time.

I’m thinking ill mint some DAI but a few questions or maybe just a question followed by more depending on the answer: am i right to think that the only real risk is either the price of ETH dropping or me simply not maintaining my ratio?

in regards to maintaining my ratio, I would only need to worry if I’m particularly over leveraged  and the price of ETH were also to drop drastically correct?

meaning if i borrowed at 100%, as long as ETH maintains its price or performs better, I should be fine from liquidation right?

also, can you borrow less than 100% of your collateral and still be in acceptable parameters?

Seems to be the biggest ICO 2021. It reminds me of 2017.


The project is unique in the crypto space and if it starts to get more attention it can become a very popular coin.

Anybody can create their own token on top of StudentCoin via a web interface. No programming skills required.
If you stake StudentCoin (STC) you earn from all transactions of the tokens on top of STC. Students are the future and bring innovation and proper use cases.


In two weeks they just launched their wallet, mobile app and announced 3 exchange listings.


The team confirmed that STC is going to be listed on 9 new exchanges from the top 50 (a few from them are top 20 and top 10) from May 2021.


Their presale is currently live and 109 of 150 phases are finished.


A review is nothing without negative points and criticisms:

  - Communication of the team could be improved

  - There is a lot of FUD.. The team could just clear this up better and comment on all the criticisms. To improve that they are planning to make a team interview series from next week to be closer to the community.

  - The 500 universities are not all real partners.. they just have students from those universities as supporter.. its not clear which universities are partners


The ico price is still really low with 0.018 USD.


A small portion of the circulating supply is beeing traded on Uniswap for 0.026 USD already.


StudentCoin is already on CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/


StudentCoin Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/studentcoinorg


There are three options to participate:

  - buy STC via Credit Card

  - send ETH from your MetaMask wallet

  - send any crypto to the Coinbase Commerce payment method


I just found out you can buy the coinbase packages but send more than the package price.. you will receive the correct amount of STC even if you overpay the package.


I recommend using Litecoin due to its low transaction fees.


Coinbase Commerce works also for US investors.


Use this bonus code to get 5% more at the purchase.

The ETH wallet I was using has a ton of other transactions so it's hard for me to parse out what is what.

**What is Student Coin**  
The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

  In a nutshell?
  

  This brings consumer protection to Crypto and Crypto to every PoS-Terminal.
  

  To every supermarket. To every shop and every store.
  

  This is the missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to everyday mainstream electronic payment adoption.
  
 
  ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum,
  Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583
  enabling crypto payments in standard terminals.""
  

  This is not financial advice, do your own research if you like the project, but check out this very interesting white paper:
  https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf
  

  To me this looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance
  in a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and with the potential to explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).
  

  The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱
  

  Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to BUY:
  

  Only 100 Million tokens total supply – still at only $0.75 each right NOW !
  

  Compare to 1 Billion DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion XRP !
  

  Best part? Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even heard of it yet"
What happens in a theoretical pure crypto future.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mr21th/what_happens_in_a_theoretical_pure_crypto_future/,SupahJoe,1,2021-04-15 06:49:42,6,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mr21th/what_happens_in_a_theoretical_pure_crypto_future/,,"What ways are there that could be used to secure the stability of Dai in a theoretical world where USD no longer exists, or potentially any fiat. Is there ability to migrate the peg in any way?

My initial thoughts are that in such a case one way to maintain stability is to establish a peg to an 'energy' and 'store of value' crypto exchange pair. The first example I can think of is a BTC/ETH pair using some form of inter-chain operability or decentralized wrap protocol for BTC.

From this article:

[https://medium.com/pov-crypto/dai-is-not-1-dollar-470c5e00abd4](https://medium.com/pov-crypto/dai-is-not-1-dollar-470c5e00abd4)

It makes sense that rather than the Dai being linked to some fluctuating value, its actually forming the anchor for the Ethereum ecosystem, currently the anchor is the central bank USD but I haven't thought of any inherent reason it must be a centralized currency peg.

In my view, in a theoretical centralized fiat-less future the value of something widely considered a store of value in terms of energy used to do work (i.e. EVM computations) ought to be relatively stable. The amount of energy per unit of store of value would fluctuate based on demand for energy, but the store of value itself being decentralized and held by individuals would stabilize that end of the ratio.

From there it seems like it would then essentially allow Dai to become a form of self-sovereign fiat trusted for the same reason as everything else on the network and so universally accepted on the network

One obvious problem is how to source the exchange values of the pair across a likely fragmented ecosystem of exchanges and find some consensus on ratio.

What do you think?"

- “Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.”

Imo I’m not totally on board with the idea of real world collateral because that’s not decentralized at all. Tokenized stocks and bonds being used as collateral would potentially be huge for crypto but that would rely on the government enforcing property rights on those assets. Not so with bitcoin."

"ENV Finance, a platform for fundraising environmental projects with cryptocurrencies and get rewarded for it. [new token / ICO till 18th April]",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mrujcj/env_finance_a_platform_for_fundraising/,jambasjl,1,2021-04-16 11:06:29,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mrujcj/env_finance_a_platform_for_fundraising/,,"Introduction
Classic crowdfunding does not work anymore, or better still, it’s working as usual but the concrete results are limited. It goes without saying that fundraising is a difficult task for every organization, because they ask people to trust them completely. Frequently contributors don’t even have the possibility to know how their money is actually spent and cannot follow the evolution of the projects they have funded. ENV Finance’s main goal is to give contributors total transparency of the money flow, from the initial donation to the final project reports; in addition, ENV Finance wishes to attract contributors by rewarding them for their donations, through a simple reward allocation program based on a ENV token, the new token introduced to Binance Smart Chain. Many big organizations like Greenpeace or WWF already accept donations in cryptocurrencies .
 
Pros
•	Transparency: all transactions are publicly registered in the Binance Smart Chain in real-time;
•	Traceability: every transaction, and every token transfer, can be tracked from its beginning, because all transactions and relative wallets are linked in the Binance Smart Chain.
•	Incentive: contributors are incentivized to donate tokens, so they can get a reward; it’s of common interest that funded environmental activities are actually completed.
•	Ease: for blockchain users it is very easy to use the ENV Finance fundraising system, it’s just a transaction from their wallet to the wallet of the project they want to fund.
Tokenomics
 
Max supply 123,000,000
•	Team 10% 12,300,000 (locked until 31-12-2021
•	Advisors &amp; Early partners 20% 24,600,000
•	Initial liquidity 10% 12,300,000
•	Token sale 20% 24,600,000
•	Ecosystem (rewards and bonuses) 40% 49,200,000
Initial market supply: 1,000,000 (circulating supply will be increased by reward mechanism and listing on exchanges).
 
Reward mechanism
 
Contributors can choose a specific project to fund, and when it’s completely funded they will get a reward, based on time they have locked their funds into that project and on the amount. Rewards are diluted over time to prevent dumps on the market. On the other side, the collected funds are given in many steps to the organization that has proposed the project.
 
Partners
ENV Finance is building the network of organizations managing the environmental projects and activities, and has already found some international organizations who accepted to be hosted on the platform.

Borrowing USD instead of DAI?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mrvna0/borrowing_usd_instead_of_dai/,felipecsl,1,2021-04-16 12:17:51,10,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mrvna0/borrowing_usd_instead_of_dai/,,"I was wondering if it would be possible to borrow fiat (eg.: USD) instead of DAI from a collateralized position (eg.: locked ETH vault)? Maybe there's a company that already offers this service? It would have to be non-custudial, though, just like how Oasis works.

Context: Imagine you have your entire net worth in crypto and want to use it for day to day stuff, like paying your credit card bill, for example.

You don't want to sell your crypto and withdrawal USD because 1. that means you're no longer HODLing and 2. that's a taxable event.

By loaning USD you can pay your mundane bills and then repay it over time using a stablecoin, eg USDT or USDC. 

Does anyone know if that's possible at all?"
Is there any way to borrow DAI in one vault and repay debt on another vault in one transaction?

  In a nutshell?
  

  This brings consumer protection to Crypto and Crypto to every PoS-Terminal.
  

  To every supermarket. To every shop and to every store.
  

  This is the missing bridge from crypto to the real world, the last puzzle piece to everyday mainstream electronic payment adoption.
  
 
  ""A solution that introduces consumer protection concepts from the traditional card payment industry to any blockchain with support for smart contracts like Ethereum,
  Cardano (ADA) or Solana. Created for Payment Service Providers (PSP) and EFTPOS devices with full support for backward compatible financial protocols like ISO8583
  enabling crypto payments in standard terminal protocols.""
  

  This is not financial advice, do your own research if you like the project, but check out this very interesting white paper:
  https://static.hips.com/pdf/white_paper/merchant_token_white_paper.pdf
  

  To me this looks like an undiscovered hidden gem. The missing piece for crypto payments to reach massive market penetration and mainstream consumer acceptance
  in a global mega market (PoS? I mean, EVERYWHERE!) and with the potential to explode as soon as this hits the exchanges (July 2021).
  

  The ICO started on 1 April and is scheduled for 90 days until end of June, but already sold out 50 of 100 phases after only 10 days 😱😱
  

  Very important additional aspect for my investment decision to BUY:
  

  Only 100 Million tokens total supply – still at only $0.75 each right NOW !
  

  Compare to 1 Billion DOT, 2 Billion Filecoin, 45 Billion ADA, 100 Billion XRP !
  

  Best part?
  

  Mainstream investors and even crypto influencers haven't even really heard of it yet"

Now he's never touched his, while I took out my Sai, upgraded to Dai, and put it back in. I'm going to be seeing him this weekend, so I was looking into what to do about his 100 Sai. 

We could just trade it for Dai on Uniswap, but I'm curious if there's a better use. Is there some feature that can only be accessed with Sai (liquidating an old CDP?) or something that would be a better use? For reference, right now Uniswap would give about 1270 Dai for his 100 Sai. I'm just want to make sure that's the best use before I help him with anything."

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**  
Oxford Student Token (OXF/STC)  
Melbourne Student Token (MLB/STC)  
STC LP Token (It seems to be for liquidity pools)

So, you have the money to pay back your debt within hands reach but if price of collateral drops heavily while you sleep (blitz crash) you still can still lose your collateral. 

Is there a service that you can pre-approve to be able to pull your stables from a farm and pay back your debt if your collat ratio drops below a given percent?

**What is Student Coin**

The [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) its an example of how blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance could revolutionize the world.

The main function in my opinion is the STC Terminal, a crypto platform that allows users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

Also they already develop a supporting wallet and an exchange system where users can swap coins and tokens are coming soon.

The most groundbreaking idea of [Student Coin](https://studentcoin.app/?ref=Sx1smylhz1) is to empower students to issue their own individual tokens that people can buy to invest in their education and thus finance the rising cost of tuition. In this case the investors will, in turn, gain a percentage of the future earnings of the student’s career.  
**Main Features**

**STC Terminal**  
The most interesting function in my opinion. as explained above it will basically allow users to easily design, create, and manage personal, start-up, NFT, and DeFi tokens.

**STC Exchange**  
This function will provide the possibility to exchange the coins that will be launched using STC Terminal and also existing crypto or tokens.  
**STC DeFi / Stacking**  
I don’t have much information about this but they will provide some options for stacking or even participate in liquidity pools.

**STC Crowdfunding**  
Possibility to join crowdfunding in university-based startups or students.

**STC Wallet**  
The wallet is already available for download at App Store or Google Play. For now it’s an earlier version with no functions like exchange, deposit, withdraw.

**Tokens Coming soon in STC Platform**  
Oxford Student Token (OXF/STC)  
Melbourne Student Token (MLB/STC)  
STC LP Token (It seems to be for liquidity pools)

I looked at the different coins, having very little knowledge of any of them, even bitcoin. I decided to use my $2 to buy 0.0004 MKR, as I saw it had been rising recently. So now I hold 0.0004 MKR and I know nothing about it!

Browsing this sub and a few others it seems there's some responsibility that falls to MKR holders, voting on things or something? Is there something I need to be doing? I feel like maybe I don't hold enough to matter.

I just turned 18 USD into 1369 USD in 2 months (76X),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mxt2c0/i_just_turned_18_usd_into_1369_usd_in_2_months_76x/,JoelOnCrypto,1,2021-04-25 05:10:02,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mxt2c0/i_just_turned_18_usd_into_1369_usd_in_2_months_76x/,,"Hey! First of all, I want to make it clear that i HODL Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so please dont hate on me for day trading as well. I both HODL, swing trade and day trade because I enjoy all of it. But 99% of my money is in HODL, ok?

But aside from the HODL portfolio, I am also doing day trading and swing trading because its fun and I am actually profitable in day trading as well. Right now, I am doing a day trading challenge on YouTube where I will try to 800X my money this year.

I started with 100 USD, then I lost a lot and went down to 18 USD (LOL)... But then I turned that 18 USD to 1369 after a small adjustment in my strategy, thats 76X the money. And I will keep doing this and hopefully I can reach my goal at 800X this year.

I am recording every single trade that I am doing and showing it on Youtube.

If you are interested to see that, here is a link to Part 1 of my Bitcoin Day Trading Challenge 2021:

Swapping to DAI during a bear run,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/mya96q/swapping_to_dai_during_a_bear_run/,AsteroidBeltTighter,1,2021-04-25 23:13:01,16,/r/MakerDAO/comments/mya96q/swapping_to_dai_during_a_bear_run/,,"Hello all, new to crypto and especially stablecoins. I'm looking for a beginner explanation of the benefits of moving BTC or ETH, eg, to DAI in a bear run. 

If crypto prices are going down, and the dollar is also going down but at a slower rate, is that what makes it a safer haven?

If the investment strategy is to HODL forever, what are the benefits of swapping to a stablecoin?

Many thanks for discussing."
My favourite trading strategy (aside from HODL),https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/myaho8/my_favourite_trading_strategy_aside_from_hodl/,JoelOnCrypto,1,2021-04-25 23:25:02,1,/r/MakerDAO/comments/myaho8/my_favourite_trading_strategy_aside_from_hodl/,,"Hey! I found a trading strategy that I really like and I am finally profitable with so I wanted to share it with you guys. But first, I want to make it clear that my #1 strategy is to HODL. But since HODL is 100% passive, I want to trade Bitcoin and other cryptos as well. Because I enjoy it, and its profitable for me.

So, my favourite day trading strategy is this:
- Taking profit at 3%
- Having a stop loss at 2%
- Using a 15X leverage (this is risky, so do NOT copy me)
- Using an exchange with super low fees
- Trading primarily Fibonacci golden pocket on smaller time frames

In my +80000% day trading challenge that I am doing on YouTube, I was able to 10X my balance in 2 months. I started with 100 USD and now it is over 1000 USD.

If you want to see my strategy in action, I am recording all trades and posting on YouTube here:

I just noticed that something happened with the surplus buffer on the Maker Burn site.

Yesterday it was just slightly more than one million DAI from the goal with an estimated eta of 4 days.

Now it is more than 30 days to go and 4,7 million DAI from goal.

I thought first that the limit was stretched a bit for some reason, but it seams that the goal is still 30 million DAI and I am almost sure it was the same sins some weeks ago when I first saw this buffer.

Can someone who has better understanding than me explain the purpose of this buffer and what I just witnessed? Or at least point in a direction where I can find an explanation.

Thank you in advance."

Surplus Auction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/n0vxno/surplus_auction/,ZenComanche,1,2021-04-29 11:34:07,10,/r/MakerDAO/comments/n0vxno/surplus_auction/,,"I cannot get my head around how the stability fees work and how they connect to surplus auctions.  

Do I have this right?

I stake ETH and I borrow DAI.  So, I now own as much DAI as I've borrowed.  

As a borrower of DAI, my ""interest rate"" is the stability fee.  This fee accumulates as a calculation.  

I only pay the fee in the form of more DAI than I borrowed.  So if I borrowed 100 DAI, and the Stability Fee is 5.5%, I will pay back roughly 105.5 DAI at the end of a year.   The vault gets 100 DAI, and 5.5 DAI got to the Surplus Buffer.

When the Surplus Buffer exceeds that amount, any additional Dai is auctioned off for MKR, and the MKR are burned.  


How'd I do?"

In these last year I started to invest in low market cap projects, like HBAR, ONE, HOT, BTT and in the last month I started to look to ICO/IDO to try to get projects in the very start.

First of all, ICO is much more risky than investing in projects in an advanced stage. That's why I decided to invest only a small amount of my portfolio on ICO generally. Always do your own research.

Here on the website you can find all the info about the ICO: [https://merchanttoken.org/](https://merchanttoken.org/?ref=YK5XR7MZ6)

Here the reasons will i decide to invest, i tried to resume much as possible:

1 - The project is amazing! In resume, they will provide consumer protection and concepts from the tradicional card payment industry to enable credit card terminals to accept any crypto with support for smart contracts, like Ethereum, Cardano or Solana.

It solves a real problem that is common to all merchants, the chargebacks. There are very interesting concepts like Automatic Dispute Management (ADM) and Community Dispute Management (CDM) you can find more about in details on whitepepper.

2 - The team behind the project is a Sweden company (Hips) and they work with POS terminals for payments using credit card, qrcode and others already processing payments for over 200,000 merchants globally. This gives the team the perfect background for the team!

3 - As the project is registered Finansinspektionen (FI), Sweden's financial supervisory authority under the number 80658. As it’s being registered in Sweden it will also be under Sweden laws, which gives me some peace to go sleep at night.

4 - It was already announced a partnership with The Payment House, to start in november this year to provide crypto as payment method for over 30,000 taxis in UK and Scandinavia.

5 - There are only 100,000,000 tokens as the maximum supply, with a fully diluted market cap only 120 millions! If this project reaches the market cap of only 1,2 bi it will make 1000% on the investment! As comparison some projects with similar market cap would be Bakery Token, Celo, Ankr, Kucoin and others around #87 to #93."

Is it just people willing to get leverage with their DAI, or to issue DAI to do yield farming?

What makes token price keep rising?

I summarized 3 types of logic for rising token price.

What is the rational token economy model behind token price? How can some cryptocurrencies’ price keep solid in the long run?

Vitalik once mentioned in his blog his valuation for medium-of-exchange token based on Fisher’s formula: M * V = P * T

Here:

— M is the total number of coins;
— V is the velocity of money, that is, the number of times an average token changes hands everyday;
— P is the price level, this is the price of goods and services in terms of the token, so it is actually the inverse of the currency’s price;
— T is the daily transaction volume, which is the economic value of transactions per day

To put it simply, if there are M number of tokens, each of them changes hands N times a day, then there’s a daily economic transaction scale corresponding to the value of M * N tokens. If daily transaction volume is T, then token price is T / (M * N), and the average price level P is T’s reciprocal: M * N / T.

If we simplify the analysis, let H = 1 / V, then H represents the average time span a user holds the token. Let C = 1 / P, so C represents token price.

Then M * V = P * T can be simplified as M / H = T / C or M * C = T * H

We can come to a simple conclusion, purely from a market perspective, that when other basic conditions (M and T) stay the same, the longer a token stays in user’s hands (H), the higher token price would rise.

Of course, the above is a static model. In reality, demand and trading volumes keep changing.

In fact, this is an important reason the U.S. stock market has prospered all these years. A large number of institutional investors and even individual investors in the US stock market are holding stocks for a long time. The holding time is often measured in years.

So in DeFi perspective, what could make users hodl tokens for a long time?

Now we can talk about our main topic: the logic behind rising token price.

On the high level, we all know that creating more token usage scenarios and increasing demand for tokens certainly help promote the rise of token

From a token engineering perspective, successful blockchain projects with good token economy design can be roughly divided into three categories:

The First Category is Tokens with the Mining Logic：

When the token has good fundamentals, the mining token provides a passage for rising token price：

The feedback process of token price growth：Found price of mining coins as A -&gt; price rises -&gt; more miners join -&gt; mining cost increases -&gt; mining cost rises to high level

With a good fundamentals, tokens with mining logic provides a good price support.

The feedback process of price support works like this: the price of coin falls -&gt; price falls to the mining cost -&gt; miners reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; coin price stop falling

The more miners, the more stable the system will be. With the mining cost continues to rise, coin price gets a high support and the bottom of the mining cost to rise.

In the long run, as long as the feedback loop continues to go on, Bitcoin’s price (no matter as digital gold or as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash) will have a higher and higher price support.

Of course, mining is not something that all tokens should take. In some cases, a 51% attack can wipe out the entire value of a project. Mining logic is valid only if the value of the blockchain project itself continues to grow.

The perfect thing about Bitcoin is that the more miners, the more stable the system, the more obvious the network effect of Bitcoin, and this fact itself raises the value of the Bitcoin network.

The Second Category is Tokens with Delegated Proof-of-Stake

To some extent, EOS’s supernodes are like miners, and in order to obtain mining rights, supernodes need to buy EOS tokens in the market to obtain mining rights; EOS will allocate a part of the additional issuance of EOS to these supernodes.

It is important to know that there is a capital cost to participate in the supernode election due to the lock-up of EOS tokens. Furthermore, some of the EOS tokens of supernodes are borrowed, the costs above are to some extent the mining costs. The hardware cost, operation and marketing costs can also be considered as fixed mining costs.

The feedback process of token price rise：price rises -&gt; more people join supernode election -&gt; cost for being elected as a supernode increases -&gt; cost for being elected rises from B to B1.

The feedback process of price support: token price falls -&gt; price falls to cost B1-&gt; supernodes reluctant to sell and selling pressure is lowered, believers provide support -&gt; DPOS token price stop falling.

During this process, it is more ideal for the supernode election to happen in real time. Since the DPOS tokens will inevitably need to have additional issuance, the demand for DPOS coins must be increased.

The Third Category is Platform Tokens:

By platform tokens we specifically refer to tokens from trading platforms that regularly distribute profits to token users. The most successful case is BNB from Binance Exchange.

Benefits of BNB: 20% of the quarterly net profit of Binance Exchange is used for BNB buyback, and the BNB tokens which got bought back are burned.

Now sitting at over 600, BNB’s buyback-and-burn mechanism is proved to be one of the most successful method for price-pumping.

The feedback loop of token price growth is that the buyback action will directly raise token price. Some people will buy tokens because they want to arbitrage, which will push up the price. So every time buyback happens, the price will be pushed up, which in turn will push up the cost of holding these platform tokens. In fact, a buyback program with token burn is very similar to a dividend program.

Another hidden logic for platform token is that: If platform token holders can enjoy the usage of the tokens, they will be willing to hold it for a longer time, otherwise the arbitrageurs will sell soon after buying. Similarly, platform tokens are not suitable for large-scale additional issuance.

Platform tokens perfectly conform to two characteristics:

The first is that all the holders of the token are protectors and even promoters of it.

The second is that the holders of the tokens are also the users of the tokens, so people will purchase platform tokens to use them.

It is obvious that the platform token logic is only valid when the value of the blockchain project itself has growth potential. In the case that an exchange can continue to prosper, the price of the platform token will continue to rise.

The bottom line of the price support for the platform token is provided by the value of the platform itself. If the exchange users are exhausted, the platform token might still drop to zero.

To summarize：

The three models above are summarized as follows: turning speculation into investment and allowing holders of the tokens to obtain stable return.

Of course, for methods like staking and mint-and-burn to successfully decrease the liquidity of tokens and increase holding time of tokens, it requires the support of the value of the project behind the tokens so that the tokens are actually used.

Team Missile Farm is determined to create more use cases for MSI so that it is granted an intrinsic value rather than a nominal value. Furthermore, we will adopt more of the buyback-and-burn mechanism to fully incentivize the market to hodl more of MSI. Last but not least, Missile Farm will develop more features to support its core feature-the farming aggregator such that investors will find MSI more valuable holding long-term than selling for speculative returns."

MKR owner and holder over here. And I'm very happy to be a part of this amazing opportunity to have two of these coins, as I'm a big believer in the future of the price of this coin.

So, I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and have a question I wanted to pose...I hope it doesn't seem complicated, but basically, my question I've been pondering is—I know there are only 995,239 in circulation out of a max supply of 1,005,577.

According to Coin Market Cap, you can purchase the coin on:

\-Binance

\-OKEx

\-Uniswap

\-Coin Base Pro

My question is, how do all these platforms keep an accurate amount of coins that are available. For example, could someone purchase this coin and the coin not actually be available? I know there is a saying, ""No Keys, No Wallet.""...But, how is the overall MKR database actually able to keep track of the ""995k"" coins?

Are there times when this coin is overbought and a buyer is simply buying into the liquidity of the certain platform at the time? 

I do know of the Maker Burn website and the coins that are burned being shown live. I'm curious if their website just has these platforms funneled live into their AI configuration? I am curious if anyone can provide any more in depth information on this. Thank You!"

On the other hand, Maker value accumulation is also a hedge against instability in the black swan event, and a higher priced Maker token would mean less Maker would need to be minted to overcome a short-term shock in the system.

We should set a blanket policy for buffer growth that is matched to the rate of increased DAI minting, and one that is not voted upon only when the previous buffer is filled. In other words, X amount of DAI is minted, Y% of DAI Buffer is created.  Something like that.

Buffer growth should be built into the Maker protocol, and no longer a matter of voting; same with the burn rate, which should be higher than 25% to sustainably increase value to Maker holders."

What kind of people will pay $300 to vote on something?  Only those people who can stand to benefit financially enough to overcome the cost.  But right now that's fewer than 50 people.

Right now we are just walking around Reddit, trying to see if there are people in coin communities who would be interested in loaning/borrowing specific assets.

So, the question is: Would any of you guys be interested in loaning MKR against USDT/USDC?

Even though we are a relatively young project there are some reputable partners working with us already such as ChangeNOW and Guarda wallet. Also, we continuously look for more great projects to work with!

Long story lead up to my question because I welcome guidance on my journey.

I think the concept works for my business investment strategy:

I want to invest $100k in my company and I have the asset now.

If I open a vault with $200k, I can withdraw DAI 100k and loan it to my business. 

Then my company pays back 4k DAI monthly for 50 months and the loan is repaid. 

In the meantime my vault is growing with the value of my crypto. I can continue to capitalize my business with the same asset.

My company borrows interest free, and if all goes according to plan my asset doubles or quadruples in value and my business operation turns profitable.

So on Oasis it says i can fund my vault with Ethereum, but how can I fund with MKR? 

Or is there a reason why I shouldn’t?

But what if I just buy my DAIs on an exchange, do I have to worry about collaterals’ quotations? And how do I know which crypto has been used as collateral for my DAI?

💵 xBTC💵 allows the use spot price to synthetically speculate on every single digital asset.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Did a bit of a deep dive on this one and wanted to pull out some parts of the white paper that kind of blew my mind:

&amp;#x200B;

xBTC is a brand new asset class that will revolutionize how individuals use digital assets. xBTC is completely synthetic and decentralized, it can be used without KYC, using a closed system, or providing collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

xBTC is an open market price on Bitcoin Dominance. Users can use this open market price to synthetically hedge against Bitcoin dominance rising or falling. 

&amp;#x200B;

They can also use this spot price to synthetically speculate on every single digital asset.  It’s like a synthetic index of every digital asset other than Bitcoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the underlying assets are never held and there is no collateral restraint. xBTC’s fully synthetic nature allows it to be used at a scale the market deems necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of tracking Bitcoin’s price, xBTC tracks Bitcoin market dominance. This type of hedge is much more responsive and adaptive than a price hedge. Bitcoin’s price could stabilize, or even go up, and not keep up with the rest of the market.

&amp;#x200B;

A Synthetic Dominance Hedge only takes into account how well Bitcoin is doing against other digital assets. xBTC also acts like a synthetic tracker (index) of all digital assets. 

&amp;#x200B;

It connects the price movement of every digital asset to xBTC supply. This is the most diversified metric a token can track in digital assets, sans Bitcoin. The simplicity and accessibility of xBTC are unmatched.

&amp;#x200B;

More information at our website.

&amp;#x200B;

Features of xBTC:

1. ✅ Synthetically access Bitcoin Dominance; 

2. ✅ A synthetic tracking of all digital assets versus Bitcoin;

3. ✅ A synthetic asset that rewards holders and community members;

4. ✅ An effective trading pair through a more stable spot price;

5. ✅ Simple one token access to all the above.

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi, Social Networks, Gaming, Smart Contracts – all blockchains and use cases are tracked with  xBTC.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin dominance will be much less volatile than individual asset prices. This means xBTC’s price will be less volatile. Rather than reward holders with price swings, they are rewarded with supply swings. With less volatility in spot price, xBTC can act as a more effective trading pair and transfer of value.

I think most of us who participate in crypto would agree that paying taxes on gains is appropriate, and that it is in our best interest to ensure that crypto remains an above-board part of the global economy, not some back-channel for illicit transactions and tax avoidance.

"An ERC-20 Token with Monetary Value, and NO GAS.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/nhulra/an_erc20_token_with_monetary_value_and_no_gas/,SkillDuel,1,2021-05-21 23:01:44,0,/r/MakerDAO/comments/nhulra/an_erc20_token_with_monetary_value_and_no_gas/,,"The **MILLI** token allows the **Kovan Test Network** to have ***real monetary value***. You can exchange each Kovan **MILLI** token for .001 **Mainnet ETH** at this site: [MILLI Token Exchange](https://www.tokenup.app)

(If you like the domain name **TokenUp.app**, then please like this post.)

Kovan confirms transactions in less than 15 seconds, with no gas fees. On the Ethereum Mainnet, transactions can take hours to be confirmed. Sites like Uniswap and OpenSea often charge more than $50 in gas fees.

The **MILLI** token has the following advantages over **DAI** (and side-chains that require DAI, like **xDAI**):

1. **MILLI** retains the same value as **ETH**. If you had exchanged your ETH for DAI or xDai a year ago (when ETH was $200), you would have missed the **2,000% increase in value** that ETH has experienced in the past year (ETH was as high as $4,382). **MILLI** is always worth the same as ETH, so when ETH goes up in value, so does MILLI.
2. To convert **ETH** to **DAI** (or vice versa), you must use a site like **Uniswap**, which often charges more than $50 in gas fees. To exchange ETH for MILLI only requires a simple ETH transfer, which currently costs less than $5.00 when the Gas Price is 50 gwei.

**Here is a Decentralized App that uses MILLI Tokens:** (Log into Metamask first.)

[Roulette for MILLI](https://predictionwagers.github.io/Roulette/milli.htm) lets you be the House that others play Roulette against. The House receives a 5.26% advantage over the player, since payouts do not compensate for the two additional spaces on the board (0 and 00). [Roulette for Kovan](https://predictionwagers.github.io/Roulette/) is the same app, except it uses ""play money"" (Kovan ETH) instead of MILLI.

**For Programmers:** You can add **MILLI** Tokens to your app, using the same technique as adding **DAI** Tokens. Here is the MILLI Token Contract Address: **0x4Eb71318c6260E95626cF0fD7886577252dC9523**"

advantages:

- fees from uniswap you earn
- 1:1 minting of dai that you can then lend out
- stability fee 1% easily can earn that back with loaning out dai on compound for e.g. 

disadvantages:

- high gas costs of opening a vault, it would take a large amount of minted dai loaned on compound at 5%ish to make up for this.

im wondering what peoples experiences have been using the LP tokens. particularly the use of stablecoins, you get the fees from uniswap as income, but are the fees substantial? and if loaning out the dai on compound for e.g. what kind of amounts of dai do you mint to make the gas costs worth it?"

I've been following the conversations around liquidation as I, too, lost everything. Nothing new to add to that conversation; the 13% liquidation confusion also caught me.

\*\*My issue is with the increase in minimum to $5000 DAI\*\*

I understood the risk that somehow all of my collateral could be lost in a freak event, but I had my risk managed at a level I was comfortable with. Then one day I have to more than double my collateral at risk to meet the new $5k criteria, or I can't transfer or manage my own available ETH or DAI. I do not find this acceptable as now I have lost more than I desired to risk.

&amp;#x200B;

What can be done to compensate?

For the past year the story has been USDC, BUSD, and DAI taking market share from USDT, but of course all four are growing at incredible rates.

DAI grew spectacularly in 2020 with the DeFi summer. This year DAI market cap has still grown incredibly quickly, but it hasn't kept up with USDC or BUSD. Furthermore, the rate of growth has dropped every month this year. In fact this last week during the crypto market ""dip"" the supply of DAI dropped, while other stablecoins continued to grow.

The following chart shows supply growth for each month in 2021.

DAI only has about 5% of the total stablecoin market cap, so it's important for it to keep up to stay relevant. Does anyone have thoughts on DAI's future growth? Maybe Ethereum upgrades and reduced gas fees will be the catalyst for more DAI creation relative to its more centralized counterparts?"

say I purchase some eth for 10$, the price of ETH rises so that it now has a value of 20$, I take out a loan in DAI for 13$, ETH drops to the original value of purchase, 10$. I understand that while this can be interpreted as me having sold my ETH for 13$ when it was valued at 20$, but I'm not sure how the DAI I now have is worth 13$, as after liquidiation there are no more assets backing it.

What I am guessing is that colatteral is bought in DAI, which is consequently burned to offset the original minting.

Is this correct?"

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

Does this sound correct? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all Cointracking has to say on the subject that I can find in their FAQs: 

Currently we recommend that you enter your Maker CDP Transactions into CoinTracking as follows:

1. Supply of ETH to the CDP should be a withdrawal from ETH wallet and subsequent deposit into a fictitious exchange account called ""Maker CDP"" 
2. DAI (or SAI) is then generated should be accounted for as a Trade where X SAI is bought for $0. This is because the SAI is debt and needs to be paid back before the position can be closed. Therefore it shouldn't be marked income. 
3. When SAI is returned, you will have to sell it back for $0. If it is transferred, traded, or otherwise used elsewhere, that should be treated as normal transfers/trades. 
4. In the event of collateral liquidation, underlying collateral (ETH) is sold for $0, realizing a capital loss. 
5. The stability fee payment (akin to interest on a loan) can be made by the user in DAI or MKR token upon closing the position. "

Actually stable coins,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/oea73h/actually_stable_coins/,masixx,1,2021-07-05 23:53:22,3,/r/MakerDAO/comments/oea73h/actually_stable_coins/,,"So, we use USD or EUR as a reference. Obviously: those are only as stable as brrrrrr.

Now few countries announced a central digital currency. While we don't know implementation details of course we know it won't share any of the properties we love from our decentralised tokens. BUT it's almost certain that those new CBDCs will most probably provide programmatic access to the actual supply. 

So I wonder if there are any plans to create a new DAI bound to the value of one of those CBDCs at a specific point in time. The decrease / increase of the supply of that CBDC can be used to build a actually stable coin as long as that CBDC exists, no matter how fast the money printer of that CBDC goes.

In those terms CBDCs could be the base for a new class of quality stable coins."

MKR Liquidation mechanism details in a market crash,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ol2puj/mkr_liquidation_mechanism_details_in_a_market/,geppetto123,1,2021-07-16 05:45:13,3,/r/MakerDAO/comments/ol2puj/mkr_liquidation_mechanism_details_in_a_market/,,"I have read some description about the bidding process and the old 0$ bidding bug. I couldn't really figure out from the functional steps and the working of the bots what the overall picture looks like. You know, not seeing the forest if standing in front of a tree.

So I have a few questions that are related to a collaterals (heavy) price crash and the mechanism.

1. Are large vaults liquations prioritized in some way to minimise the damage and potentially minimise the uncovered damage for last insurance MKR holders? Like use the free money in the market to focus on the big chunks first.

2. Given a highly collateralized vault (for example like the therefore designed ETH-C pool, or even anyone with 900% coverage) would all the ETH be up for bidding or just the necessary part? Sure with perfect bidding it should turn out the same. However given market dynamics I would find it suboptimal to liquidate 800eth for only 1000 DAI missing. If it's only the necessary, let's say, conservatively 6-7 ETH it seems more money efficient.

3. In case these large blocks are put up for bidding, how is it made widely accessible? Is it possible to split it up? Only few players could bid for a 6000 ETH liquidation, however finding 6000 bids for 1 ETH seems more efficient (to me at least). I can't bid for the Mona Lisa even knowing it's true value, it's simply impossible for me, but I could bid for a tiny piece and help with that part. Win-Win.

4. In case question 2. or 3. are a no, are changes planned? Are my concerns invalid and how come?"

I'm sorry in advance if the question is silly, I'm quite a noob to DAI ecosystem, but is there any single reason for an individual to borrow DAI at all, except supporting the global collateral?
I mean, by borrowing DAI you leave out a significant portion of your portfolio locked away from you (as collateral is bigger than the actual DAI you can redeem), you're even more dependent on volatility as now your collateral can also be liquidated with a fee, and you can easily get the same DAI on an exchange with none of these problems.

I’m a bit puzzled by something and hoping you can help clear it up for me;

We all know the only way to mint 100 Dai is by locking up assets in the Maker Protocol, but to unlock those assets again I need to buy extra Dai on top of that 100 on the open market. 

But at the beginning, surely there must have been more Dai than that which was minted from the Protocol? So people could buy enough to pay back the interest? How was this extra Dai accounted for if it wasn’t backed by assets? 

Many thanks!"

[Maker](https://sevenb.io/currencies/maker) (MKR) – is a decentralized open source platform, the main goal of which is to create decentralized stablecoins. The platform operates on the basis of the Ethereum blockchain and has two tokens: the DAI stablecoin and the MKR token. Since the project operates on the Ethereum blockchain, it has the same consensus mechanism – Proof-of-Work.

MKR organizes the management and operation of the Maker ecosystem, fixes the cost of the stablecoin DAI and acts as a tool for attracting investors. The DAI stablecoin provides a unique approach to ensuring a stable price. DAI depends on a system of smart contracts with Collateralized Debt Position (CDP), supported by ETH, to maintain its price in equilibrium. That is, each token is backed by a certain asset, which the client borrows from the system, and then gives back. Thus, the Maker project solves the problem that Tether is sinning – it is simply impossible to issue tokens uncontrollably on the platform. And this is also one of the reasons why the MKR token was created, because “fuel” is needed for the platform to function. Further in the review we will describe the main functions of the MKR token. 

https://preview.redd.it/v75sm4dl6rj71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e931a25bede0933106b7508ab3d9b098286d3b

## Why should I trade Maker? 

The key reasons for trading MKR are:

* DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins on the crypto market. In turn, the DAI rate is completely dependent on MKR. Along with the high demand and extremely limited emission of only 1,000,000 coins the price of MKR will only grow.
* In 2021, investors’ interest in the Maker platform increased significantly. MKR is one of those cryptocurrencies that have updated the maximum price of January 2018. At that time the price reached $1690, on May 3, 2021, the coin price was $6,012, i.e. almost 3.5 times more. Analysts’ forecasts are extremely optimistic, for example, DigitalCoin predicts growth to $5,477 by the end of 2021, and $11,155 by 2025.

As of August 17, 2021, the price of MKR is approximately $3,742, with a market capitalization of $3,712,812,337. The minimum price as of January 30, 2017 was $21.06, since then the coin has risen by 17,634%.

### What to know before exchanging Maker? 

Anyone who wants to exchange any cryptocurrency, probably wants to do it as safely, faster, and profitable as possible. To do this, you need to follow a number of recommendations:

1. Make sure that you have chosen a platform with a good reputation. You can use the monitoring services as BestChange.
2. Make sure that you are aware of the fees charged. You can find information about them on the platform’s website in the FAQ section.
3. Make sure that you entered the recipient’s address correctly. An incorrect address will lead to the loss of your funds.

## Maker token use cases 

MKR use cases:

* With MKR coins users pay fees for transactions and the redemption of collateral.
* MKR holders can play a crucial role in managing the Maker platform. Depending on the amount of coins held, the stakeholder can make important decisions, offer improvements, vote, and more.
* MKR plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable value of the DAI coin. The DAI rate fluctuates in the range of only 5%.

The main benefit seems to be voting rights to maintain DAI price, which is interesting, but sounds like work. The downside of owning MKR tokens is that if the DAI-USD peg slips, the financial responsibility falls on MKR holders to cover the difference. Not sure the potential costs outweigh the benefit of being able to vote. Is there some other benefit I'm missing? Is it the association with DAI and ETH that keeps the price up?"

How DAI / MKR works and why the system will fail.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/psannm/how_dai_mkr_works_and_why_the_system_will_fail/,HongKongAntiScam,1,2021-09-21 11:38:13,24,/r/MakerDAO/comments/psannm/how_dai_mkr_works_and_why_the_system_will_fail/,," I looked into how the crypto stable coin DAI works without any physical backing of dollars as well as its corresponding governance token; #MKR. I would like to point out some major issues with the system that is not solved and I don’t think will be solved.

Ethereum holders can collateralize it and receive the DAI token as a loan. The DAI token is one-to-one pegged to the dollar because the supply and demand of DAI can be controlled by MKR holders through two mechanisms. First, supply and demand for loan taking is driven by a stability fee that will be higher if there is more demand for leverage relative to demand for the stable coin. Supply and demand for the stable coin is driven by interest given on DAI that will be paid for through the stability fee.

Loan takers don’t receive margin calls, instead their locked collateral is liquidated through an auction where holders of DAI bid DAI for the ownership of the collateralized Ethereum, and DAI gets burned. A liquidation fee is retained in the system.

The MKR governance tokens are not a stable coin and what makes them valuable are their ability to bid for accrued the DAI that gets accrued in the system through stability fees and liquidation fees. The MKR used by the winner of the auction for DAI gets burned and the remaining owners get more concentrated ownership.

Some serious concern remains. If entities have a large enough coalition of MKR holders, they have control over the system and can change rules as they please. Based on my analysis, MKR holders are incentivized to dump their tokens if the MKR price gets overvalued relative to the possible income that can be earned through stability fees and liquidations. This means entities that are important for governance and knows the system are likely to be replaced by atomic MKR speculators overtime that cannot orchestrate meaningful governance voting coalitions.

This means eventually an entity is likely to become large enough to pillage minority MKR holders through hiring themselves as core development units that set their own salaries (in MKR) at an unreasonably high level, which sort of already has happened. Such an entity could also steal all the Ethereum locked in the vaults of loan takers. Additionally, it is easy for such an entity to appear as a multitude of decentralized units, when in fact they act in ordinance.

There is zero transparency for whether the Maker Dao is truly decentralized, therefore I think the system will eventually collapse and other stable coins will dominate it.

Additionally, there are series scaling issues as the availability of the stable coin is limited by demand for leveraged Ethereum or other assets that may be allowed to be used as collateral in the vault.

Given the risks I have already pointed out, the valuation of the MKR token seem too high with a current P/E of approx. 80, and even if the DAI supply 10x, the income will not be enough to offset the costs of the core units paid in MKR to make this a worthwhile investment."
