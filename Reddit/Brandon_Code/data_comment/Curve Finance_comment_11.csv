GrilledCheezzy,"My current favorites from the last two weeks include:

/
/Boring DAO - a gateway for other chain tokens to be wrapped on the ethereum network - most notably they are looking to bridge the BTC, LTC and Doge chains to ethereum. 
Website https://boringdao.com

Convex Finance - this project is well known now. It is using the so called “bribery system” of onboarding new pools and pairs to Curve.fi in which stakers can deposit CRV which are locked for up to four years which boosts the yield generated from fees on the curve.fi AMM exchange. It would be near impossible without being a multi millionaire to achieve the boosted rewards the convex app is able to create through pooling. It’s also a place to gather all veCRV (CRV stakers) airdrops in one locale and gauge the amount of boost applied to each curve pool on the app via DAO voting of CVX tokens. Lock some CVX for an extra reward boost and gain voting rights. https://convexfinance.com/stake

GRO Protocol - I’m still learning more about this one but I gather it a way to have a decentralized stablecoin where you also have an insurance mechanism against volatility I think. It’s very interesting with a great yield.
GVT is the gro voting token and GRO is the main token utilized the protocol. You can deposit stablecoins and other internal pairs to earn GRO token rewards which are vested over 12 months. You can claim early but the longer you wait and the earlier you are at staking in the app the higher reward boost will be. 

All of those projects generating an impressive yield at the moment - boring Dao is likely the most risky but a great use case and with major potential for gains. GRO and Convex seem to be similar concepts to me built around rewards from other projects. 

My DeFi Veteran Pick of the Month is ArcX Passports which is a project that is building an on chain credit system which uses your past transactions and your interactions with Defi to generate a credit score.  You are provided a passport NFT which will be like a physical passport in a lot of ways which will allow the members to have unique opportunities compared to those that are not holders of a passport. You can also purchase skins that show your support for your favorite projects like
Chainlink, Aave, Furucombo and more. Skins will come with extra perks on those apps I’m sure. You can stake ArcX now if you have a passport. Get yours today there are only 1000 being issued in this Second round at https://app.ArcX.money 

I want to hear what your favorite shitcoins are right now. Don’t post deflationary shitcoins and I’ll be checking to make sure. I’ll be weary of anything on BSC so be warned.",2021-11-01 04:02:36
Count_Icy,"First get some Dai from gemini. 
Then withdraw to MetaMask
Swap for busd using Curve finance. Or uniswap v3",2021-11-01 18:11:18
MajorasButtplug,"Providing liquidity for MIM (stablecoin) to stablecoin pairs on Curve is paying 27% right now. It's hard to beat opportunities like that

Another example is putting USDC in the Yearn vault, then using Abracadabra to leverage that like 2/3 and loop it 10 times. The result is ~20% APR right now and you only get liquidated if USDC falls to around $0.78

Even just dropping stables in Compound Finance gets you 5 - 10% right now

There's just no comparison for passive income, even just using stable coins. That said, gas fees make these options unfeasible for smaller wallets since there's a lot of contract interactions, so many are waiting for L2 to get more things ported over.",2021-11-01 18:11:35
LSAS42069,"&gt;There are more ways to coerce besides government. It isn't government that initiates corruption, it is private parties who want to profit

Government just happens to be the greatest coercive element in all societies, and handing it more power only empowers the people you hate even more. Why empower the ruling class?

&gt;They pay officials directly, offer stock picks, lucrative board positions after leaving office, finance their campaigns and fund direct lobbying for laws. None of these things are initiated by government itself.

All of these are mitigated by mitigating government, see the above reply.

&gt;That's the first part of this you need to understand.

As if I don't understand this to an extent well beyond you.

&gt;Then the second part, and walk slowly here because this is tricky and it's called ""deductive reasoning:""

I'm surprised you know the phrase. Let's see if you can actually do it.

&gt;If a private individual/company/corporation can coerce government officials to pass laws that favor themselves over others

Nothing you said above was coercion against the lawmakers, they're all bribery, voluntary transactions. Hiring a hitman isn't coercion (between the hitman and buyer), for a comparitive example. The coercion exists between the government (hitman) and the subject (victim). Remove government power and the rich (employer) must seek another route to coerce or must cease coercion. 

&gt;then it must follow that government itself is not the first or only coercive power. Just let that sink in for a moment.

I never said government was the only coercive power, or the first. I said it was the biggest, the primary agent of coercion. It is, in fact, the biggest tool the ruling class uses against the creating class.

&gt;Do you know what these all have in common? Plastics and electronics. Clothing, lumber, refrigeration, etc, are manufactured and shipped and itemized all with the help of plastics and electronic technology.

And before that, their productivity was improved via non-transistorized controls and mechanical systems. Hyping this specific technology as if its economic impact is unique in type is fallacious.

&gt;But these are hardly the entire economy. Cost of education, healthcare, housing, childcare, lots of foods and other services have been increasing dramatically.

In the U.S. at least, all of these things are ridiculously regulated and interfered with by government. In the past two years we've also seen unusually large amounts of inflation, which itself is directly caused by government fiat.

&gt;Technology inexorably improves over time, but the real economy is much more complex and privatization has failed to deliver consistent results while we can see success attributable to publix efforts and simply technological incrementalization.

You just blamed market systems for problems directly attributable to government action. Please stop pretending I'm beneath you in comprehension here, you just proved you don't even know what you're talking about. Technological improvement is heavily influenced by incentives, namely profit motive leading investors to develop new tools. 

&gt;There is a thing called ""diminishing returns"" because costs do no always go down as production goes up. It is not infinite.

""Productivity"" not ""production"", genius. Lrn2english

&gt;You're cherry picking micro-level observations and ignoring entire other subfields in economics.

I'm not the one pretending one tech is magically different than other tech insofar as it relates to improving productivity and efficiency.

&gt;Moore's Law is unique to electronics, because it is literally describing processing power and transistor size over time

Moore's theory describes a universal phenomena that he observed in a specific piece of tech. Increasing efficiency over time due to profit motive driving competitive development isn't unique to transistors. That was my point earlier, but you seem bent on ignoring it.

&gt;Few other things behave this way, or have been as consistently reliable over time as Moore's Law. You are doing a lot of lazy hand-waving here.

Not fitting a specific curve does not exclude other tech from being part of the phenomenon. Nothing was hand-waved, you're just projecting your hyper-focus onto me.

&gt;You contrived one example of how innovation worked to prove an argument that privatization always leads to innovation and improvement

I contrived nothing. I stated that market systems are associated more strongly than any other systems with improved quality of life over time. I used one specific example because I'm not listing every example.

&gt;You pretending as if this was simply about electronic ""information tools"" is disingenuous at best and obnoxious gaslighting at worst. It's all in text above if you want to go read it again. 

I explicitly stated that the focus of the comparison was on informational tools in the paragraph right above the one about the 80's. If you actually read what I wrote and weren't a dishonest person, you'd understand that.

&gt;I'm an electrical engineer you idiot.

An appeal to authority fallacy, color me surprised. Mechanical and controls here, with a generic tech attitude. Neither of us is a computer engineer though, even if that was relevant. 

I said it above, Moore's theory described the process of product improvement, and he did a decent job of estimating his constant. Product improvement is not unique to transistorized processors, and similar curves can be seen in all sorts of products in the development stages as computer systems are.

&gt;So absurdly disingenuous. I'm arguing that privatization is not the only source of innovation or improvement

Never once did I state as much. So what you're saying here is that you're strawmanning me. Imagine that from someone who hates markets. 

&gt;That is an often-used claim by capitalists and it's the implicit argument you've been making here regarding education in this thread.

Except I never implied it at all. Markets doing better because of incentive structure doesn't mean non-markets can't still DO at all. They absolutely can still do things, just often not as well as markets. The soviet union developed nuclear tech, computers, etc without stealing all that much info from market systems. They just generally underperformed acrosd the board compared to more free systems.

&gt; I'm not arguing that the internet could never have been devised by profit-seeking entrepreneurs, I'm simply stating that it wasn't invented by profit-seeking entrepreneurs.

What is your implication here, being that I never asserted that non-markets are incapable of development?

&gt;Is it a half-truth or is it a logical fallacy?

A paragraph can include both. 

&gt;If it's a half-truth then it is true that inventions (and very good ones) can and do occur through government-funded projects and otherwise non-profit-seeking efforts by engineers and scientists.

Never said otherwise.

&gt;The fact that private commerce utilized it later is a much more complex issue and does not prove that the internet was only useful due to private commerce, it only shows that its benefits are best realized with more participants. A capitalist market is simply the primary vehicle for most activity in a capitalist market. You are making all kinds of non-sequitors.

I made not a single one, but would be glad to rebut whatever silly misinterpretations you have.

&gt;Mate this is some sad, desperate misdirection. Quit moving the goalpost.

The goalpost wasn't moved. You strawmanned me and them got butthurt over the strawman you made up. My interpretation of your examples was you saying ONLY government could make those products. I apologize for not asking for clarification, and for unintentionally strawmanning your words in my response.

&gt;Just acknowledge the world of evidence that private profits do not hold a monopoly on human inventiveness or creative effort.

I have acknowledged it several times now, and never rejected that fact.

&gt;It isn't tankie propaganda to point out that the Soviets literally beat the US in every space milestone.

It is tankie propaganda to use that fact as justification for hating markets.

&gt;The moon landing was a stunt that the US invented because it was the only place the soviets hadn't already gone to.

Whether it was real or a stunt, the end of your statement is correct.

&gt;Nothing about this is support for the USSR, it's just a fact that governments and public funding can be very effective. That's all I've argued.

Please forgive me for misunderstanding your argument. It appeared to me that you were suggesting that markets were inefficient compared to coercive systems.",2021-11-01 22:38:24
Fake_Math,"Oh they do make up fake reviews. I worked for a company that brutally abused dozens of staff for years, and when they finally terminated my position, they made me sign an agreement not to disparage them. Several people who took over what I was doing and saw the obvious unethical and likely illegal  manipulation of data. They were all let go or quit. One of the VPs posted a negative review on Glassdoor.
Suddenly their Glassdoor positive reviews for the corporate office exceeded the number of staff. It was an absurd curve. Another finance guy wrote an email to Glassdoor to point out the obvious manipulation, and Glassdoor said they'd look into it. Three years later, nothing's changed.",2021-11-01 23:48:43

The paper also attacks the validity of aggregate production functions, which is how GDP is measured.

SwagtimusPrime,"the one burying his head in sand is you, because you are completely oblivious to what's actually going on with Ethereum scalability.

Rollups scale Ethereum. They are not a band-aid solution. EVM &amp; Rust Volitions will take throughput to 20k-80k TPS immediately in 3-4 months when they launch.

Moist_Lunch_5075,"The changes are really just to address criticism and people hyperparsing the term ""transitory"" to mean something it never really meant. In macroecon, ""transitory"" doesn't mean ""a couple of months"" which is how people misinterpreted the word. JPOW addressed this in the speech, but to those of us who understand that macro analysis takes place at larger timeframes, the misunderstanding that they were saying ""all prices back to normal in like a month"" never actually made sense. They kind of overestimated the intelligence of the average person in the finance industry, tbh. I've worked in this industry for over 20 years now and in many cases, it's not that high... in other cases people in this industry are very quick to replace rational interpretations with whatever they think serves their interests, so the Fed is just armoring their statements the same way I would in similar situations.

Nobody who understands how economic forecasting works thinks any of these statements are set in stone... adding ""expected to be"" is just saying something that is assumed to be true in any other normal circumstance among real, skilled economists.

Similarly ""supply chain issues"" weren't ignored before, but it's a very similar situation to the above... the virus causes trailing supply chain issues. We began forecasting what we're seeing now literally in February 2020... it's not a surprise to anyone who does economic forecasting and understands the relationship between socio-political situations like this and labor/supply disruption. What they're really citing there is that the supply chain issues are starting to alleviate, which goes along with a reduction in inflationary curve along with a small decline in GDP due to the delta variant and to some degree supply chain issues, but the two are and have always been attached to each other. They're not saying that there's some separate issue there, their language specifically cites ""easing of supply constraints"" which is a positive thing.

Wordsmithing to avoid opportunistic misunderstanding is something many nerds like myself had to learn early in our career. You'd think the Fed would be better at this but honestly, JPOW's pretty bad at it and you can actually match red candles on SPY when he's spending more time on things he shouldn't in his speeches. He's actually kind of tragically naïve when it comes to public relations.

This wording is just them learning to better wordsmith their statements... I wouldn't read anything further into it because they weren't really saying anything different in the meat of their reports before.",2021-11-04 04:20:29
ThisIsAMonere,"As promised above, here is a longer version of how this budget came to be below for those who might be curious:  
  
I began creating this budget in 2018. My sister asked me to create her a “simple budget” for her to use, and since I liked creating pretty spreadsheets for lots of things in my life, she figured I would be up to the task. I completed the first version in a few weeks, and she was thankful, but then she asked me for some more features: “Can I have it track my credit card and bank account balances as well?” Sure, done. “Can I enter a different budget every month instead of being married to the same amount every month?” Ok, a little harder, but I will make it work. “I started selling stuff on eBay and driving for DoorDah. Is there a way you can make it so that I never have to predict my income before I earn it, but rather, budget it after I earn the money?” Ok sister. You’re asking for a lot, but you’re my sister, and I love the challenge, so I will continue to work on it.  
  
Around that time, I started getting into FI/RE, downloaded Reddit, and joined some Personal Finance subs. I saw many, many, many other budget spreadsheets shared in lots of subs, and they all were cool in their own way, but… none of them were as \*pretty\* as I wanted my personal budget to be. I also never found one that didn’t require you to predict income. Even with a salaried job, I \*never\* earned the exact same amount of money every month (since I also had an Uber side hustle and a flipping side hustle), so none of them worked for me.   
  
Thus, a new goal was born: I wanted to create the world’s greatest Google Sheets Personal Budgeting Spreadsheet, and share it with the world on Reddit!  
  
This was no longer about creating a spreadsheet just for my sister. I wanted to create a spreadsheet that was different, intuitive, didn’t require any special formulas or copying and pasting, and any person with a basic understanding of how Excel or spreadsheet software works could use it.   
  
I created many, many iterations of this budget from 2018 - 2021, and I shared about 4 or 5 updated versions of them in another Personal Finance Sub here on Reddit. Each time, about 20-30 people would message me saying “Wow, this is exactly what I have been wanting to create but never could figure out!” One person even messaged me months later saying I had saved their marriage… WHAT?!? That was so cool. I really was just so excited to see people getting use out of this budget and it truly changing their lives.   
  
Once, I had someone comment “Oh cool, you just created YNAB in spreadsheet form.” I had never heard of YNAB, but I of course Googled it and was like “Wait a second…. These 4 Rules of YNAB are the same (unspoken) 4 Rules of my budget spreadsheet! How cool that me and someone else created budgets that are basically built on the same concepts but neither of us have either heard of each other?!”  
  
In the summer of 2021, I finally got the budget to a place that I said: “It is finished,” or, at least to a place where I felt like I could put my name next to it and share it with family and friends and not just strangers on the internet. I was also super pumped to share it again to that other Reddit finance sub that I had previously shared the budget with and had a great reception.  
  
So in July 2021, I shared it in the other sub, left to go on a quick errand, and came back to a crushing message in my Reddit account: “You have been permanently banned from this sub and there is no opportunity to appeal this decision.” I was shocked. I was sharing a free personal budgeting spreadsheet in a personal finance sub, yet somehow this was self-promotion? I messaged the mods to ask what had happened, and I had forgotten that I had left a link to my Etsy page buried at the end of the FAQ within the budget spreadsheet itself to give people the opportunity to purchase it if they wanted to. My bad. I promised to delete the link and never share a version of the spreadsheet with the link buried in the spreadsheet again, but they said no. I was permanently banned forever from that sub, period, since it went against their stated rules.  
  
And that was the end of my dream of sharing my Budgeting Spreadsheet with the world, so I just left it on Etsy without any fanfare and let people discover it organically. If I’m not allowed to share it for free on Reddit, might as well sell it for a measly $6, right?  
  
Enter November 1, 2021: YNAB changes its price, and I \*know\* that my budgeting spreadsheet could be so useful to people who like the YNAB principles and its way of treating money (since mine has a very similar principles and way of treating money, too), but given I had recently been banned from a different sub for sharing the spreadsheet, I was extremely hesitant to share it here without someone reporting me for self-promotion or getting mad at me for sharing a $6 budget that I sell on Etsy for free here. So I shared it under the guise of it being someone else’s sheet because I really, really, really just want people to get use from a budget spreadsheet that I’ve poured my heart and soul into.   
  
Enter November 2, 2021: u/BloomingFinances shares her YNAB-ish budget spreadsheet, and I am so so so thrilled to see that she gets a great response and isn’t banned! Yippee!! Her spreadsheet is AWESOME and I reached out to her thanking her for sharing her sheet, and she encourages me to share mine here, too.   
  
So, here we are! I have shared my sheet for free here because like I said from the beginning, I’ve only ever wanted people to get a better handle on their personal budgets with the help of the spreadsheet I’ve made. If it helps one person, I am happy. Feel free to reach out and ask any questions! Like YNAB, it has a learning curve, but in my experience, the HELP tab and the START HERE tab tell you everything you need to know to do the budget.  
  
Thanks, and happy budgeting!",2021-11-04 04:50:34
Ecstatic-Flounder-48,"I was finance/supply chain/accounting

The reason accounting is the hardest major is because it is a lot of information. One accounting class to me was worse than taking 5 other RBS classes at the same time. 

Another reason is that they have insanely difficult curves. Only the top 10% of grades get an A. That means you have to be on your shit 24/7. 

Some of the questions are also very tricky. If you can process large amounts of information and work well under pressure, then the tests aren't difficult, they're just extremely comprehensive. But to most people, accounting is nerve-wracking and those nerves tend to screw with you during the exams. Especially when exams can be 40% of the final grade.

Finance has professors that shoot for an 80-82 final grade average. They will curve to that. So there is no % required to get an A and getting a B is a lot easier. Exams are worth less (typically)

Supply chain curves to like an 85-86, typically. (Exams are worth way less, typically - you have more projects). 

Lastly, accounting is hard because the classes overlap and don't overlap at the same time. Advanced accounting is accounting regarding buying companies, and some government accounting (which shouldn't even be called accounting tbh). Tax accounting is just a bunch of simple math with rules that keep changing (but you don't use 'accounts'). Point being, there's a lot of variation in the types of thinking you need to do in accounting as opposed to finance where EVERY SINGLE CLASS IS LITERALLY: stocks, then bonds, then options, then futures (prove me wrong). Supply chain classes are mainly just memorization of facts and the tests have NO variation (T/F then MC then short answer - fill in the blank (with word banks sometimes)). 

Accounting is probably the most valuable degree I've gotten from Rutgers. But finance has the potential to give you the most interesting lifestyle (because you have a lot more job options with a finance degree than a supply chain or accounting degree).  

If you like accounting, do accounting. It's insanely rewarding. But if you need a high gpa for a grad program down the line and you don't really need accounting, don't do accounting.",2021-11-04 06:07:36

DailyScreenz,"In finance classes and textbooks you will hear academics talk about the risk return curve shifting when leverage is applied, maybe search around for William Sharpe, he's written a lot of textbooks and articles on MPT (even Markowitz might have something on it).   It is not that hard to figure out really with actual data.  If you want to test leverage get returns for the S&amp;P 500 each month and something that approximates monthly financing cost (like Fed Funds) and put it in a spreadsheet.  For 2 to 1 leverage assume you have $50, the formula looks like \[100 exposure\* S&amp;P monthly return - less the $50 leverage \* monthly financing rate\].  You then divide this dollar profit or loss number by your $50 starting equity to get your monthly return.   You can change the equity level to test different amounts of leverage, but that is basically all you need to test out the approach using real data!  Hope this helps!",2021-11-04 22:01:44
marcuscontagius,"Look at defi and crypto as a utility, not a security. Pick projects with strong fundamentals and a good team, no different than investing in a company. Go with projects that have good interoperability across a number of layer 1 protocols. Understand that utility cases for defi you want to invest in and what you are and aren’t comfortable with in terms of risk. There are some absolute insane returns to the point where it only takes a few hundred dollars to make real money on a short time horizon, understand the analogous use cases in the sphere of private finance and see which you like better. Be smart and do your DD.

An example I like to use is curve finance, they are a stable coin swap and liquidity pool app on a number of different layer 1 networks. I see it as essentially the forex for the digital dollars that will be present in a few years. They are fully decentralized (governed by users who vote with there DAO governance tokens - think shares - just like an AGM for a stock or company) and have superior protocol to competitors and because of this, offer better rates for stable coin swaps. I’m not shilling for this particular defi app and you must always have a strong fundamental understanding of where you’re putting your money. But I believe they are a good example of a blockchain utility with strong fundamentals. Check out “defi 2.0”.

Crypto is the real deal and it ain’t going away. People don’t want to be beholden to rich bankers or private institutions with no visibility of what’s really going on and what they’re money is actually doing, they’d rather have a stake in their money’s management and financial freedom that is usually only afforded to large net worth individuals. Yes there will be higher volatility until regulation comes into effect across the globe but let’s remember this is an incredibly young technology still.

red-tea-rex,"&gt;Social housing does increase private wealth because occupants pay no or far less rent so they have more money to spend on acquiring their own assets. Instead of a landlord getting the money to spend, they get to spend it themselves. The same amount of money is being spent in the economy, but the distributon of that spending is much more equal.

False. Government housing, rent control, and other housing ""price fixing"" schemes have been proven to drive up the cost of housing for those just above the bottom, since in most cities there are restrictions and limits on how much housing can be built. So essentially price controls distort the supply-demand curve by reducing market rate housing supply driving up demand for it and the corresponding price on entry-level lower- to middle-class housing. Take S.F. and NYC for example. More rent controls than just about anywhere, and they are two of the highest COL metro areas in the world. Guess who benefits? Landlords.

&gt;. Hyperinflation only occurs if money is continually printed to pay off ever increasing debts.

The current U.S. debt is nearly 30 trillion, a [33% jump](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/debt/trends/) in just four years. This appears to be on a fairly linear trend line. If we jump 10 trillion every 4 years we will be insolvent in a decade and a half with a 4 trillion annual tax revenue. But it doesn't accelerate all at once. Each 30 trillion or so will mean an additional 1 trillion in interest depending on rates, and that much less available to fund government, so that much additional per year to be taken as even more debt. So it'll happen even sooner.

&gt;If you print money to pay for labor to produce productive assets such as buildings and machines, then the money that was printed is essentially ""backed"" by those assets.

It's not. It's primarily paid out to bureaucrats and social benefits recipients who don't produce anything tangible, and tend to contribute the lowest level of production to the economy, so it's empirically  the least productive use of the money. So by your argument this is the fastest way to cause inflation.",2021-11-05 11:59:37
BroChapeau,"FDR ***extended*** the great depression. His [1933 gold seizure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) stole every American's gold, exchanging it for dollars which he soon after arbitrarily set at half of the pre-seizure value. Yep, he ***stole*** half of countless Americans' wealth.

He then set the price of gold differently every day, at a time with the gold exchange standard meant that setting the gold price was the same as setting the dollar value. The purpose of this was to shut down the private capital markets - since nobody could predict what dollars would be worth in the future when investments paid off. He then used this destroyed capital market as an excuse to create the FHA, farm subsidies, and many other paternalistic, central power programs.

Ever heard of the [crash of 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_of_1920%E2%80%931921)? It was more severe than 1929, but because there was no bail outs or new deal the debt was liquidated and the economy was back on track in a year. Recessions are supposed to be SEVERE and BRIEF.

Labor unions were not illegal; instead the Wagner Act created special privileges for them and thus violated freedom of contract. This is FDR centralizing power and buying the labor constituency (part of the construction of the corrupt power dealing political machine, which had theretofore never happened Federally).

Social security is a paternalist program of forced savings that functions as a piggy bank for politicians to raid as a kind of slush fund and disguised tax increase. This is FDR centralizing power and buying the elders constituency (part of the construction of the corrupt power dealing political machine, which had theretofore never happened Federally).

The FDIC puts taxpayers on the hook for deposits, removing the responsibility that banks have to lend wisely and thus protect their depositors' assets. It's a gift to banks, allowing them to freely speculate and lend nearly all of depositors' money, operating on a shoestring and juicing profits. It also discourages the poor from holding assets instead of fiat currency, and thus enables money printing. This is FDR centralizing power and buying the bankers constituency (part of the construction of the corrupt power dealing political machine, which had theretofore never happened Federally). 

Note that there were other giveaways to banks, because FDR came from a wealthy east coast finance family connected to the Rockefellers. One of these giveaways was the Accredited Investor Rule embedded in the Securities and Exchange Act. This rule even today discriminates against the poor, barring them from investing in private equity offerings, which represent the large majority of upside opportunities in the equity market. The legacy of this is represented today in the fact the Blackstone dominates even local real estate markets, local capital formation is a tiny fraction of the markets, and most folks' largest investment is their home because they can't invest in startups and new businesses.

Farm subsidies bought the rural landowning constituency, and so on, and so on.

FDR tried price fixing, threatened to pack the court which successfully intimidated them in to suddenly declaring laws constitutional 4 years after they'd declared nearly identical laws unconstitutional, and goaded Japan in to attacking Pearl Harbor.

FDR is worthy of unending scorn. Many people say if they could go back in time and rub out one person, it'd be hitler. I'd pick FDR; he destroyed American limited government and replaced it with a centralized corrupt welfare state completely unaccountable to the people.

As Garet Garrett says, the New Deal was utterly ineffectual if the goal was ending the depression. But it wasn't; if looked at for the power centralization project that it actually was, it all makes sense.

&gt;*There are those who still think they are holding the pass against a revolution that may be coming up the road. But they are gazing in the wrong direction. The revolution is behind them. It went by in the Night of Depression, singing songs to freedom.*  
  
*There are those who have never ceased to say very earnestly, ""Something is going to happen to the American form of government if we don't watch out."" These were the innocent disarmers. Their trust was in words. T****hey had forgotten their Aristotle. More than 2,000 years ago he wrote of what can happen within the form, when ""one thing takes the place of another,*** *so that the ancient laws will remain, while the power will be in the hands of those who have brought about revolution in the state.""*  
  
*Worse outwitted were those who kept trying to make sense of the New Deal from the point of view of all that was implicit in the American scheme, charging it therefore with contradiction, fallacy, economic ignorance, and general incompetence to govern.*  
  
*But it could not be so embarrassed, and all that line was wasted, because, in the first place, it never intended to make that kind of sense, and secondly, it took off from nothing that was implicit in the American scheme.*  
  
*It took off from a revolutionary base. The design was European. Regarded from the point of view of revolutionary technique, it made perfect sense. Its meaning was revolutionary and it had no other. For what it meant to do, it was from the beginning consistent in principle, resourceful, intelligent, masterly in workmanship, and it made not one mistake.*  
  
*...*  
  
*The end held constantly in view was power.*  
  
*In a revolutionary situation, mistakes and failures are not what they seem. They are scaffolding. Error is not repealed. It is compounded by a longer law, by more decrees and regulations, by further extensions of the administrative hand. As deLawd said in The Green Pastures, that when you have passed a miracle you have to pass another one to take care of it, so it was with the New Deal. Every miracle it passed, whether it went right or wrong, had one result. Executive power over the social and economic life of the nation was increased. Draw a curve to represent the rise of executive power and look there for the mistakes. You will not find them. The curve is consistent.*

Joker042,"&gt; What kinds of roles are out there

Go to an analytics meet up in your area, talk to people. There are so many different roles out there in so many different types of company.

&gt; as a CPA, how would one's path differ

Yeah, good question, as I said to someone else, I'd be looking for an FP&amp;A or similar job in a company with a really good understanding of data and a good analytics team. A good company will be OK with you saying ""Yeah, I'm signing up for an FP&amp;A role, and I'll do it for a couple of years, but I want to be learning from the analytics guys in that time, and seeing how I can use that knowledge the help the finance team, then eventually I'd like to apply for a job in analytics""

&gt; what is the typical department hierarchy

Really really depends on the size of the company and the size of the analytics function. Generally you'll have a CTO who will have someone under them with ""data"" and / or ""analytics"" in their job title. Could be ""insights"" also. Some companies will have one or two centralised teams of analysts. Some will have a couple out in the each of the functional areas of the company. Some will have both a centralised ""centre of excellence"" and analysts emended in functional teams. Additionally, you'll have platform support for the analytics platform.

&gt; is the nature of your work completely ad hoc or do you have recurring/cyclical work tasks

I moved from a job which was about 75% BAU tasks like budgeting and reporting to one that is 100% green fields projects. You'll see the whole spectrum, and 95% of analysts will have some repetitive component to their job. Learning to automate and streamline that component is critical to freeing yourself up enough to kick some ass and impress some people.

&gt; Do you have stressful deadlines?

Yes and no. I've certainly had a couple, but if I'd needed to I could have delayed a project launch, but there were some reasons not to. I chose to ""be a hero"", I burned out, I took some time off, and I learned a lesson. Dunno if I'd do the same again. Generally, I try to stay pretty far ahead of my deadlines.

&gt; how much responsibility do you have in gathering and vetting the source data you use? Or do you draw aone in the sand and say that the data is the data and it's only your job to analyze it?

I would never draw that line in the sand. I know people that would and that the key difference between them and me. If I'm on a project, people know that I will do 100% of what needs to be done to make sure there's a good result. That includes finding other people's fuckups and helping them fix it in a way that makes them look good (if they'll let me help them, if not then I can be an asshole when I need to be - if the project warrants it). I'm the kind of person that wants to understand how the sensors on the machinery which generated my data work, the ETLs which get them from one place to another and the potential weaknesses in the system. Even if we can't fix them, we can identify them and be honest with the stakeholders about them. Your stakeholders want to make good decisions and it's the analysts job to enable that.

&gt; can't perfectly predict the future.



Your work can 100% be wrong. The difference is people may not ever notice. I've taken over processes which were producing believable but incorrect results and had to tear them down and rebuild them in a hurry. You do get the odd exec with a fucking brilliant nose for ""that doesn't seem right, how can that number be higher than that other one in that month, when the moving average is...."" - and in those moments all you can do is smile and say ""You know what, it looks like you may be right, let's look into that"". Meanwhile you need to have checked and double checked your shit enough that even if the find an inconsistency, you're comfortable with the outcomes of the analysis to say ""but, I think that'll only move us a few percent and the advice will be the same, give me a few days and I'll confirm, thanks for that!""

Remember, most analysis is descriptive, only some is predictive and even then you need to be able to sketch out the basis on which the prediction is made.

&gt; you can't be penalized if actual results differ from what you told management a year ago. Instead you'll re-tool your model. 

Depends on the analysis. I think you've got too much of an FP&amp;A hat on here thinking about forecasting. But, even if your forecast is off, you need to be able to explain WHY it was off. ""We had a cooler summer than the average, so we sold less icecreams"" is absolutely fine, you're not a weatherman, but ""Ummm, that's just what the model said"" gets you replaced with someone who actually understands their models. This is why the comment about regression and decisions trees being more powerful in the real world than better higher performing models is there. You can communicate how they work, and that's gold.

&gt; So, what would a ""fuck up"" look like in your role? 

Dunno, I'll tell you when I find out :)

But the one I'm most at risk of every day is overpromising on timelines and functionality.

In my job, there's a set of mistakes I could make that would theoretically result in incorrect information being included in a release to the stock market. That would be a very big problem. But I'm not the only one who works on that, we all check each others work, and I calculate those numbers three separate ways and check them against each other. Other people calculate them too and check my work.

I've made small mistakes that weren't my mistake. I inherited a horrendously complicated model which didn't correctly implement an inflation curve we used. I didn't realise this till the budget numbers were locked in. It wasn't a huge issue, and it hadn't worked for 5 years before I got there and no one noticed. I pointed it out, fixed the model it was all fine. As long as you're good at your job and open and honest with your team it's not an issue. If it is an issue, you've got a shit boss / team and need to find another place to work.

&gt; Is there more gray area when it comes to your type of work?

Good analysis can be a discussion, can be a back and forth between you and the stakeholder. You're allowed to not be sure, you're allowed to explore and discuss an approach and succeed or fail as a team - as long as you KNOW when you've failed and don't push it into production. It's collaborative and creative when it's done right. It's a journey.",2021-11-05 22:48:40

But, the biggest hurdle in ALL these now is connectivity.  Unreliable connectivity is a huge issue.

And to me, if I can't connect to my banks and financial institutions, then why even bother with personal finance software to begin with?

I'm not that smart when it comes to programming or spreadsheets.  I'm really not.  But I can certainly create some worksheets to enter my transactions and create monthly/yearly reports that I can use with sorting options and filters.

In my case, I use Quicken Windows and Mac (don't ask why).  Either will do a really good job beyond the basics and their reports are top notch, including investment tracking.  The Windows version is really good, but complex and has a high learning curve.  The mobile app with the Windows version sucks.  The Mac version of Quicken is easier to use, more modern looking, but not as feature rich.  I use the mobile app with the Mac version and it seems to be stable and work.

But there are plenty of other fine personal finance products out there.  You just need to try them out and see if it fits your needs.  Your needs are probably different than mine and others.  Some are desktop products, some are web based, some are Excel based.

For example, if you have a Microsoft 360 subscription, you can use Money in Excel for free.  It's basically an aggregator where your transactions download and then the Excel part does the ""reporting"" for you.  And because it's Excel, you can create whatever spreadsheets you want.

Tiller is also a variation of this.  Google spreadsheet based aggregator and reporting.

all small businesses was forced closed in states that forced covid mandates by the government while corporate stores remained opened.

the moment those checks was passed to be given out, wal-mart lined their center aisles with TV's for the same price.

I respect real socialist, they band together and form a commune, they don't try and force it on others with guns.

the rest of you lot are grifters or lay abouts that want a free ride off other people.

here you are all happy world governments are pushing for a 15% tax on global corporations but everyone has to pay more for goods across the board.

those corporations will absorb those taxes into the cost of the products and services, which has a domino affect on everything, 15% to mine the iron, 15% to smelt the iron, 15% to form the steel, 15% to ship the steel, 15% to use the steel.

that is 5 taxes to 1 for an end product and 75% price increase the cost of 5 companies taking something from its raw form to a finished product to the consumer.

I kept it simple because in reality, between each step is shipping from a shipping company.

money is not something that poofs into the world from the ether.

money is stored labor, the more you tax it, the more it cost for labor.

the more you allow the government to print money, the more you dilute what labor is worth.

how about instead of trying to rob everyone of their labor, we keep more money in peoples pockets and put the government on a fucking diet.",2021-11-07 04:03:14
averag3student,"You're in for a world of fun. I would recommend the polygon chain and aave or curve finance. Both very easy to use. Put 10 usdc into a pool to see how interest compounds, borrow 5 usdc and put it into another platform so you get a taste of how lending and borrowing works on these platforms.  If you're really looking for high risk high rewards stuff, there are plenty of platforms (trying looking up Titan finance to see what happened to one of these in the past) that offer crazy APY for liquidity pools. If you get in and out fast enough, you could make a quick buck. 

But of course, at this point it's pure gambling and you could lose everything.

Personal finance is for everyone, not just those who have money. Everyone can benefit from financial literacy. Gatekeeping this kind of knowledge is just wrong.

**What is Euphoria?** 🤝, 🤝

Euphoria is an algorithmic reserve currency protocol that will initially start out as a fork of OHM &amp; Wonderland.

In the initial phase the protocol will very much mimic OlympusDAO:
There will be two tokens: WAGMI and sWAGMI (i.e. staked WAGMI)
Every WAGMI token is backed by at least 1 DAI in the treasury
When WAGMI is &gt;$1 the protocol will create new supply via direct sales into the market
When WAGMI is &lt;$1 supply will be burned by the means of direct purchases from the market

**How does it work?**

Given that the protocol is a direct fork of OlympusDAO &amp; Wonderland, Euphoria will work in the exact same way:

The protocol is the only actor that can mint or burn supply, in contrast to other algorithmic reserve projects or algo-stablecoins that allow market participants to regulate the supply via e.g. arbitrage incentives.
The supply isn’t expanded or subtracted based on arbitrary algorithms — it’s backed by actual market activities carried out by the protocol and its treasury:

- When WAGMI is &gt;$1 the protocol will create new supply via direct sales into the market
- When WAGMI is &lt;$1 supply will be burned by the means of direct purchases from the market
- As such, WAGMI will always be backed by real assets in its treasury

New reserves are acquired by the protocol by the means of selling discounted WAGMI tokens to market participants that decide to bond treasury reserve assets for WAGMI.
Another way to look at this is that participants can actively mint WAGMI at a discount by selling e.g. DAI or WAGMI/DAI to the protocol for a larger amount of WAGMI than what can be acquired via the open market.

Back when Viper launched in March we originally intended to airdrop 5,000,000 tokens to active users as well as governance participants of Yearn Finance, Aave, Curve, Yam, and other DeFi products that were popular in the glorious DeFi summer of 2020.

50% of this airdrop allocation was eventually allocated as rewards to the xVIPER -&gt; VIPER single-staking pool on ViperSwap.
What remains is 2,500,000 VIPER tokens, or roughly ~$2,500,000

- The (💎, 🙌) incentives program will start at the time of the Euphoria launch and will last until December 31st, 2022, roughly ~13 months.

- The program will reward certain desirable actions that will likely change on a month-to-month basis, or even more frequently if required by current market conditions.

- For the first phase that starts in November 85% of the rewards will be allocated to those who bond DAI, WAGMI/DAI, UST and/or WAGMI/UST with the protocol. 15% will be allocated to WAGMI stakers. The more you bond and stake, the more of the rewards you’ll receive.

ManagerSalt9523,"I have some knowledge in finance, limited in econ. I’ll hazard a response based on what I’ve pieced together over time, but no have qualms about being set straight.  
  
If you’re interested in the specific examples (ag and hospo), in theory ag would be a better inflation hedge by my reasoning. Commodity-driven sectors (such as energy and materials tend to be among the best performers in high inflation environments; although beware this is partly by definition). Needs (i.e. inelastic demand) tend to make consumer staples somewhat of an inflation hedge (consumers will pay what they have to). Depending on the exact activity you have in mind, ag companies often share commodity and/or staple attributes. Hopso is more discretionary in nature (i.e. inverse of staples).   
  
More broadly its possible to generalise somewhat (e.g. real estate tends to be a reasonable inflation hedge provided that rents are not locked in too far out – in which case it becomes more bond-like which is bad when inflation is high; ‘growthy’ companies with long duration cash flows are among those more likely to suffer, as future cash flows become less valuable in today’s terms). As a general rule, worry about inflation more when a company has limited pricing power (i.e. customers may balk if faced with the prospects of higher prices).   
  
Unfortunately there are plenty of exception to the rules because under-standing the pre-conditions for inflation is important to identify winners and losers during a particular bout (e.g. while staples are generally inflation hedges they tend to underperform when transfer payments occur or there is a savings glut).

Although, if inflation persists, over time the origins may become less relevant. If there’s enough inflation under certain conditions it can become self-fulfilling (at least when unchecked). E.g. steeper Phillips curve when inflation is higher (which is to say, if the labour force is tight when there are noticeable price changes people are more inclined to demand higher wages-&gt; more fuel).  

Implications of inflation are further complicated by the distinction between expected and unexpected inflation. The latter can be more damaging as prices/rates may begin to incorporate compensation for risk – this is where matters such as supply chain length (i.e. timeframe to produce and deliver a good or service) start to feature.",2021-11-08 17:37:32

rawlskeynes,"This article is misleading to the point that it borders on misinformation, and I'm disappointed that it was posted here, especially without context.  In fact, the latter may be worse, because the article was designed to talk about investing generally, whereas it was posted here into the context on personal investors usually saving for retirement, which mean that the assumptions of the article (particularly the use of iso-elastic utility and the ludicrous assumption that an investor is making a one time investment) are simply not applicable for the overwhelming majority of people.  But anyways, on to the article:

It's a motte and bailey.  The motte, as it so often is, is a true statement: that ""the standard deviation of the total return actually increases with time horizon"".  The bailey is suggesting that this somehow refutes the idea that young people should be more aggressive in their investing.  I can't challenge the motte, it's simple math, so let's focus on the bailey.

To be clear, this assertion that your asset allocation should be independent of time horizon flies in the overwhelming consensus of financial experts and advisors, including John Bogle, who thinks (overly conservatively, in my opinion) that an investor should hold somewhere between their age and their age minus 10 in bonds.  Not to start out with an appeal to authority, but I do want to emphasize how out of the norm for investing advice this article is.

Fallacy one: Iso-elastic utility

The thing that fundamentally separates the motte from the bailey is that using simple variance as a measure of risk is ridiculous, because in the case of compounding growth, so much of that variance happens at the upper end of the curve, where you are much less risk sensitive.  One of the primary assumptions of this article is that an investor's level of risk is independent of wealth.  This is not true for any real world investor.  And the defense of using this criteria, that you could come up with a hypothetical investor who could be risk neutral as their wealth increases and be ""not pathological"" is hogwash.

If you're reading this, the overwhelming odds are that you want to be more conservative as your wealth relative to your age increases.  This is simply because the ability of a dollar to improve your life falls as you have more money.  The author's only example to the contrary is a hypothetical investor who has so much money that she can absorb massive risk and still be totally fine (If that's you, feel free to stop reading here.  Congrats!  You've won capitalism, and what I'm writing here is not necessarily applicable to you).  That rare example aside, we know that the overwhelming majority of retirement investors are and should be more conservative as their wealth increases relative to their age, and that breaks the math that comes later in the article.

Fallacy two: Three years is not a long time frame

This article makes a lot of bad faith comparisons of one year and three year outcomes to try to obscure the relative safety that comes from investing over decades:

&gt;It's interesting to note that the S\&amp;P; 500 has never had a loss anywhere near as large as 61% in a single year. (The largest one year loss was 43% in 1931.) It took three years of smaller losses to add up to the 61% total loss over 1930-1932.

The reality is that for large economic downturns, it typically takes multiple years for them to develop.  If the argument being posited here was that an investor with a 3 year time horizon should not be more conservative than an investor with a 1 year time horizon because the returns of year X are so closely correlated with year X + 1 in worst case scenarios, I don't think anyone would be bothering to argue.  But the argument is that risk doesn't decrease over time, so there's probably the same 60% loss over a longer period of time, right?  Do 15 years!

&gt;consider the 15 years from 1968 through 1982, when **after adjusting for inflation** the S\&amp;P; 500 lost a total of 4.62%.

Oh.

Fallacy three: Bad faith understanding of probability of shortfall

The author bothers to point out that not all shortfalls are the same, and then stops there, as though you couldn't possibly quantify that potential shortfall.  The truth is that probability of shortfall is a simplified, imperfect way of approximating something that's going to be impossible to calculate for an individual investor: their expected returns adjusted for the impact on their utility.  But it's still a better measure of risk than what the author uses, which is simple variance which pretends (incorrectly) that a user is risk neutral relative to wealth.  But ultimately, probability of shortfall gets us to understand the underlying thing we should be thinking about: what are the odds that equities underperform the next best option, and by how much, in our time horizon.  Hint: if you have access to a risk free 6% return, either because you're maxing out T bills right now or because, like the author, you have access to the world's best bank account, it's a pretty reasonable decision to incorporate that into your portfolio.

Fallacy four: That you're only investing once

The thing that might be most egregious about this article is the unquestioned assumption that you're investing once, rather than continuously over time, as most of us are.  The latter is the key component of time diversification, because you get a portion of the relative returns for each point in the time period.  So yeah, the market might drop 61% in the next three years, but that also means that in 3 years you're buying stocks at a 40% discount from what you'd be paying now, at a time when they're more likely to be bouncing back.  1928 was a pretty rough time to try to retire based on your savings in equities, but it'd a good time to start investing (if you somehow had a stable, good paying job through the great depression) because you'd have gotten a 54% return on your money in 1933, a 48% return in 1935, and a 34% return in 1936.  This is the primary reason you have more safety over time, and it's completely mystifying that it was ignored here.

All together, utility is one of the messier concepts to integrate into economics and finance, because it's hard to quantify.  But that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, doesn't mean you shouldn't factor it in (indeed, it's the reason you'd be risk averse in the first place), and doesn't mean that you should pretend you time horizon is irrelevant.  If you're 20 and you're reading this headline and considering switching your portfolio allocation to the same one you're planning on having 5 years before you retire, I'd strongly encourage you to reconsider.",2021-11-08 22:44:59

harfyi,"The biggest surprise during the first two days of the pandemic-delayed UN Climate Summit in Glasgow came from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made a series of bold commitments to green energy. India already ranks third for renewable energy capacity; Modi pledged to quintuple India's current 100 gigawatts of renewable energy generation to 500 gigawatts by 2030. That number is higher than the country's entire electricity generation capacity today.

Modi also pledged to slash the carbon intensity of India's economy by 45%. He promised that steps like these would let India cap its greenhouse emissions by 2070 — pledging to a timeline he had long resisted — and eliminate a billion tons of carbon pollution a year this decade. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency said that India's commitment was a significant step towards showing to the world, for the first time, one available road map to cap warming below two degrees Celsius.

What made this grand pronouncement from the world's second most populous country possible? Modi could commit to such emission reductions for one reason: India is driving down the experience curve – perhaps the most crucial factor about the economics of clean energy.

Not only do wind, solar, batteries, electric vehicles and heat pumps get cheaper over time. They get cheaper faster if we just build more of them. This is their unique, almost magical property. If we want cheaper clean energy, we merely need to build more of it. This phenomenon – called the experience curve – has been demonstrated for solar panels, wind turbines, LED lights, and lithium ion batteries. And it has been occurring for decades.

It does not apply to mature technologies like coal-fired power plants, internal combustion engines, or gas furnaces and water heaters. The more oil we burn, the more it costs, as we are experiencing right now. The more solar, the cheaper it gets, as this graph from Our World in Data shows.

India is perhaps the best example of a country that has ridden the experience curve to cheaper and cheaper renewable power — in spite of the fact that it started later than rivals like China, and had to overcome high-cost domestic capital.

Indeed, India has doubled its renewables capacity roughly every five years – five-fold in the last decade.

India is probably the biggest renewables success story among developing economies. But it is not alone. The International Energy Agency reports that solar power is, in most of the world, already the cheapest electricity — far cheaper than new coal or gas plants.

And it's not just solar and wind that fall in price as they grow in size. The next crucial clean energy technology – advanced batteries needed to enable the shift in the transportation sector to electricity, as well as to manage the intermittency of wind and sunshine – also displays a steep experience curve. Deploying today's batteries faster not only makes tomorrow's cheaper, but actually pays for itself almost immediately.

Yet even with these examples and this data, even with the media focus on how desperate the climate threat has become, it's clear in Glasgow that advocates of effective, rapid climate progress must still wrestle with a persistent and crippling myth – that any rapid decarbonization transition will make us poorer. That myth is one of the major factors making it hard for the Glasgow COP to overcome the divisions among industrial and developing nations, carbon importing and exporting economies.

The new form of climate denial here in Glasgow is, ""Yes, let's get off fossil fuels – but gradually. That will be safer."" (You also hear it in the US, particularly from Senator Joe Manchin and the oil industry.) It won't be.

This myth is very dangerous. While driving fast down the experience curve is a reliable way to cut energy costs and carbon emissions, it is not an automatic market response to the need for cheaper, cleaner energy. If you want cheaper energy, you have to decide to grow your cleaner energy as fast as you can.

Why is it safer to decarbonize faster, rather than slower?

First, when energy costs start high — as they did with renewables — markets won't grow without policy intervention.

But making renewables cheaper is a game of scale. As the experience curve illustrates, costs go down not with time but with the scale of deployment: ""more is cheaper,"" not ""later is cheaper."" Waiting makes energy more expensive.

With clean energy technologies, the curve is predictable and stable. Each doubling of deployment cuts cost at the same rate as previous growth. 

Initially, the experience curve requires a country to buy costly renewable power. However, since market share is low initially, one doesn't buy very much of this costly clean energy. Only later, after a solid initial investment, do renewables become cheap. Steadily increasing volumes of this cheaper clean energy are sourced to replace expensive fossil fuel power, lowering the average electric bill. Moving slowly merely delays these benefits, raising costs in the meantime.

Likewise, early on, as the hard costs of technologies drive the experience curve down; these cost gains are global. China benefited from Germany's investment in solar cell efficiency, and India took advantage of Chinese cost gains.

Later, the soft costs of innovation – finance and regulation in particular – need to fall. Late arrivals to a technology still need to drive down their own local soft cost experience curve. India perfected its auction system to drive its solar prices below China's, even though it has not yet caught up in making panels. Vietnam lagged India in deploying solar. But in only two years of investing in solar, the country had increased its electrical generation capacity by 25%, and cut local solar costs in half.

Yet most countries are still refusing to either permit or finance sufficiently rapid renewables expansion. Indonesia has yet to emulate either India or Vietnam. Its renewable energy costs are 3-4 times higher than its neighbors. Australia rolled out a very simple regulatory model for deploying rooftop solar years ago. The US declined to adopt it. Hence, US rooftop solar costs 2½ times as much as Aussie consumers pay.

Cheap, clean energy is there to be had. But you do have to chase it. Not risk, but inertia and obstruction from special interests are the biggest barrier to getting off fossil fuels. Too much of the time and energy at Glasgow is spent arguing about the past – how we put ourselves at risk of climate catastrophe. Not enough is learning from the success stories that can still get us back on track.

What's not to embrace about a clean energy revolution that enables every country to be energy self-sufficient, ends the scourge of air pollution, rescues the climate – and drives the cost of energy lower than it has ever been?",2021-11-09 01:48:38
RICOVERTHEDREAM,"For everyone that wants some more info regarding Celer Network (CELR)  


*Holding CELR is a long term play. Celer Network is uniquely positioned to offer significant contributions to both the interoperability and DeFi spaces. By promoting seamless communication between different blockchain networks, interoperability is where the future lies. Blockchain projects that want to implement interoperability into their platform aim to create an ecosystem that will enable different blockchains to communicate with each other easily. We are moving in the direction where multiple block chains will cooperate and are used in unison for a particular purpose. As a trustless bridge, cBridge can take incredible advantage of this trend. Trustless bridges work on mathematical truths and are without any human errors or corruption. They enable the interoperability of tokens between different networks. For example, Ethereum can use this ability to offload its transactions to another blockchain. Also, trustless bridges help reduce congestion in blockchains with high volumes of transactions, providing users a seamless transaction experience.*    
   
*Let's also not forget the global problem of inflation directly addressed with the deflationary assets in the crypto space that are being more accepted worldwide each passing day. This is creating the scenario for explosive growth in the DeFi space over the next several years, and Celer Network is also poised to take advantage of the shifts to greater adoption of DeFi. Layer2.Finance is a DeFi aggregator with L2 scaling built-in, allowing people to use protocols such as AAVE or Curve and apply L2 scaling to them, rather than requiring them to build on Celer. Also, it doesn't just bring L1 DeFi to L2. It also aggregates other L2 and sidechains and allows liquidity to flow across seamlessly and cheaply. Layer2.Finance aims to be a multi-chain layer 2 DeFi platform. For it to achieve that, cBridge is needed for use cases that need to bridge liquidity across networks. Having cBridge also means that Celer does not have to call out to third-party services to bridge assets. With this said, Celer Network will have synergy across both of these products and their SGN to provide additional utility to the CELR token. These are only the plans the team has released so far and there is much more to come. The future is very bright for this project.*",2021-11-09 01:56:36

Mallardshead,"BTC's current market cap is half that of this single US company: Microsoft. BTC is currently 1/10th the market cap of gold (which is $11T). BTC my brother Devinaire, is still a ""speculative investment"" according to mainstream talking points, and one you should only ""invest what you can afford to lose"". The above explains how cheap BTC is currently and how much time we have left to accumulate until the global confidence curve of crypto flattens to a Nebraskan landscape. I'll add BTC has been around for 12 years, and in that time, when was the best time to sell BTC? 

Never.

$1M is a cute round number, but not close enough to the law of diminishing returns. $5M is better. Hyperbitcoinization also happens around this price. You see Devinaire, even I've become a victim of its tenacity, without any effort I might add. It happened like this back in the enlightenment period of crypto before exchanges: I quietly allocated 5% of my net worth to BTC. And by golly, a year later it grew to 20% and I didn't even buy anymore. Then 50%. Now it's 95%. This see, is what happens to companies with BTC on their balance sheets, nation states with it in reserve, individuals, etcetera. There's an asymmetric trade happening globally between fiat and BTC, and I'm pleased you've joined us. 

The *transaction phase* of all this is next. Composability can create some oddities. Consider UBER: they get the location info of a driver/passenger through Google Maps. They send data to driver/passenger through Tulio. They pay the driver through Stripe. These three unrelated companies *compose* to form UBER. Now, that might be a dumbed-down version, but consider the composability of these three factors in regards to BTC:

 - Satoshi Standard

 - P2P scaling solution

 - Law of diminishing returns where a doubling price would require more fiat than the entire M1 supply of western countries

These compose to annihilate volatility and most importantly, eliminate the US dollar peg. That's my vision. From there it's a slow rise to ♾/21M, the infinity symbol of course because new goods and services can always be added to the economy. 

Nation states will lose the ability to levy taxes, and this will lead to even more printing, and the militarization of tax collection agencies. But the vicious loop will make things worse. And government's won't be able to afford enforcement. They'll lose the ability to finance anything projects of value, and these will have to be incentivizing enough to open payment channels ({}).

sam-goodwin,"Yeah well if you want to judge something, it’s usually better to do research instead of writing it off as a failure with no knowledge (which most people on this thread seem to be doing). It’s a deep topic and I didn’t care to explain it while at work. 

Google tokenomics and read about how smart contracts enable developers to construct intricate, virtual economic systems, like banks, market makers, lending protocols, yield farmers, treasuries. Interesting projects include Olympus DAO, Curve Finance, AAVE, Compound Uniswap, etc. Then read about how all these algorithmic financial organizations interact with each other automatically on the blockchain, for example how Curve Finance lends out its investor’s assets on AAVE to earn them a yield. One difference about these organizations is that their profits are distributed to their holders instead of to the bankers - crypto is a bank without an owner (no bankers), so profits belong to all users. This results in higher yields for investors and also more interesting financial incentive structures. One data point is is how you can earn 10% yield on stable coins in Curve - that’s 10% low risk yield on cash. Wont get that from a bank right now. 

There’s too much to explain and I’m not the best person to explain it. Go read about it. It’s a massively important innovation for the world of finance and even beyond. If you just compare it to existing currencies and markets on the surface level, then you’re missing the Forrest for trees. Dismissing crypto is identical to dismissing electric cars.

jamhob,"Servant 100%. At least for the rest api And web sockets. If your page has a frontend, user something else in combination if you can

My justification for suggesting servant is that in finance, I'm guessing you want a lot of robustness. In servent, apis are typed, so you can't change the api or implementation without changing the other which is fantastic and has saved us a lot.

Next, there is surprisingly little boilerplate. You will think that there is some, but when you think about it, the amount of heavy lifting that it's doing on your behalf is quite incredible.

Its a winner if you are a slave to requirements. You definite the API definition separated from the implementation so its easy to see if it's compliant. Then how do you know that your implementation corresponds to the API definition? Type checking.

Finally, unlike other web solutions, the learning curve may be steep, but you just write a haskell application. No generated code, no config files, no other languages to learn. If you aren't used to webdev and the insanity that happens over there, it's a winner",2021-11-09 18:49:02

If you wanted to know about all the policy changes and the impact of those policies on the carbon production curve, you could find it.

Solar and wind are at grid parity in a large portion of the developed world. This is a HUGE change and means we don't have to make sacrifices in order to have a sustainable civilization on this planet.


But, what's happening now at COP26 and in infrastructure bills around the world? Well, the US just got $12 billion a week ago to keep open nuke plants and get new ones off the ground.

Getdownonyx,"I don’t think that customer service will get better naturally until there’s a plateau in delivery volumes. The issue is that when growing at 50% per year, growth is always the priority and some areas will be behind the curve and not able to keep up. It will probably transfer from different one geographic area to another until they stop growing manufacturing volumes.

With &gt;50% growth, they will basically be doubling the fleet every 1-2 years, and so service will have to scale and overtake manufacturing volumes in a sprint, then settle until deliveries catch up to service capacity, then another area will experience an unplanned rush of deliveries and fall behind until service catches up again, repeat until they start to reach steady state of deliveries and can plan a little more appropriately.

Sobaphoto,"Start with DAI -&gt; deposit into AAVE -&gt; mint camDAI using Mai.finance -&gt; open a MAI vault and mint MAI using the camDAI as collateral (leave LTV at 95% just to be safe)

Now, bridge the MAI to solana using allbridge and exchange MAI for USDC on the Jupiter aggregator 

You can also use MAI-USDT-USDC-DAI pool on polygon curve or polygon balancer, but usually Jupiter has better prices.

Now deposit USDC into the UST pool on mercurial.finance.

Now here is where the magic happens, we are going to leverage that farm. Go to parrot.fi and deposit the receipt tokens and mint PAI using them as collateral. 

If you want to play safe, you can deposit the PAI into mercurial’s PAI pool and end the setup right there (42% + 6% APY). But if you want to go a little further, you can deposit PAI into port finance and borrow USDC or USDT against it (whichever one is cheaper)

Than, deposit into mercurial and mint more PAI. Use PAI as collateral to get more USDC or USDT, deposit into mercurial, mint PAI and repeat.

You can also simply sell the PAI for USDC instead of using port finance to borrow, but you are taking on more risk by doing that. (The advantage of this is that you don’t have to pay borrowing fees)

Once this is all done, you will likely have around 2X-3X leverage, meaning that 20% apr is now 40%-60%, and you also have a 6% bonus from the camDAI at the beginning of the setup

laflammaster,"Holy damn, Criand. Been doing some more research on QES. 

Agreed on lack of data on quantos, but I did find some articles in Applied Mathematical Finance

&gt;Pricing formulae show that the value of a quanto equity swap at the  start   
date  does not depend on the foreign stock price level, but rather  on   
the  term structures of both countries and other parameters. However,    
the  foreign stock price levels do affect the swap value times between    
two  payment dates.

If I were Kenny, I'd do exactly that to last as long as possible. Until such time that we have major swings exchange rates, we may not see much of an impact.

&gt;Simulation  results show that the constant margin rate on average   
declines with the  tenor of the swaps and the magnitude of the constant   
margin rate is  generally smaller than the interest rate differential.   
Among domestic  interest  rate, foreign interest rate, third-country   
interest rate, and  exchange rate, we found that  correlations   
associated with the exchange  rate play a more important role in pricing  
diff swaps than correlations  among interest rates themselves.

Maybe we should have a view on the yield curve more closely.

MrQot,"Yeah, it's kinda wack to see the paradigm shift and all this innovation happening at lightning speed where even the most informed in the space thought stuff like Starkware would be ready in 3-5 years and they end up launching on mainnet (albeit in alpha) literally this month. And zkSync's gonna launch an EVM-compatible zkRollup soon enough, another feat that seems practically impossible.

For now eth fees suck and L2s are not quite there yet to compete with $0.001 fees offered by polygon and other sidechains, but they'll catch up soon and we'll eventually never look back. I'm also a defi degen and I'll gladly use what's currently the cheapest while still basically being an eth maxi long term lol

&gt;Didn't realize that the price curve for scaling was inverse of the norm. 

To be more precise, it's more that the size of proof batches scales logarithmically as the transactions they secure scale exponentially. (i.e. square the number of transactions and you only double the proof size). If/when that kind of global scaling happens, the limitation will become how much data is available to post these proofs, and that's the point of ETH2 sharding!

This little [starkware video](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1456256503157956609) explains the high level stuff well I think. The goal of any blockchain is to agree on transaction validity and state change, and these zk proof mechanisms are just infinitely better than the current model where every node validates everything by running code themselves, instead of instantly checking a single cryptographic proof about the result of arbitrary code execution that was ran by a single node.

The information asymmetry about the upcoming layer 2 ecosystems is crazy, it's probably even a bigger shift to the blockchain space than smart contracts were when eth first launched. Meanwhile crypto fans are still arguing over which L1 chain can scale the most when in reality none of them can. L2 is not just a gimmick!

The possibilities zkRollups open up are so crazy you can literally run an [entire physics engine on-chain](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1454657064555499522). This is how we'll get not just decentralized finance, but decentralized *everything*. Think some kind of decentralized social media where submitting a post or upvoting is technically an on-chain transaction but with a cost of a trillionth of penny, so low that it can basically be abstracted away by the rollup while still giving you full sovereignty over your data and identity, *and* burning eth on the base layer for posting the proofs for absolute, immutability finality of transaction results",2021-11-10 12:20:15
2PumpsAndASquirt,"Australian lawyers are being lured to the US and UK in record numbers by the promise of more prestigious work, overseas adventures and salaries that are more than double those offered by domestic firms, recruiters say.

Global talent shortages also mean overseas firms are headhunting Australian lawyers and professionals in growing numbers, and legal eagles with three to six years experience in transactional corporate law are the most in demand.

Local law firms desperate to retain staff are increasingly offering firm-wide pay rises in response, as 20 months of closed borders and pent-up demand for travel have made Australia’s version of “the great resignation” look more like a “great exodus”.

Jonathan Walmsley, owner of legal recruiter Marsden, said he had seen “more Australian lawyers going to the US than ever before” in recent months and this would only grow in the new year as eased border rules “open up a whole new category of lawyers who have been waiting”.

“These are the people who wanted to go over the past two years but waited because of COVID and the border restrictions. I think we’ll see a whole range of new people wanting to go overseas early in the new year,” he said.

The expatriates are driven by pay – junior lawyers in the US often earn more than triple their Australian counterparts – a desire for adventure, and, according to Mr Walmsley, the “prestige” of working in the New York, San Francisco and London markets.

Cutting-edge deals
“Deals in these locations are bigger, more complex, more cutting edge and deal flows can be stronger,” he said.

“Most significant transactions are governed by US or UK law. The work over there is more complex, so junior-mid level lawyers, in particular, enjoy an accelerated learning curve.

“There is also more innovation coming out of those markets in terms of how deals are structured and because of the availability of innovative financial products like NY and London. There is no better place to be a TMT [technology, media and telco] lawyer than San Fran or Silicon Valley.”

Ms Brown said career opportunities were one of the key drivers for lawyers and young professionals to head to the UK.


Deb Brown says Australians want to work in the UK for the travel, lifestyle and career opportunities. 

“One of the key questions we ask people when they’re looking to come over here is what are their drivers? Why are they making the move?” the London-based recruiter said.

“And definitely one of the most popular reasons [is] the access to greater opportunities than they can obtain back home.”

She said “travel and lifestyle” was also another factor, as “what we never fully appreciated” before COVID-19 was how important these drivers were for Australian candidates.

The work is tougher, though, and the hours are longer, and lawyers based in the US and UK say weekend work is the norm and weekday hours are consistently more than those in Australian corporate firms. Anecdotally, the hours are worst in the US.

For some, the combination of higher pay and big bonuses makes the time overseas worth it. A sixth-year lawyer’s salary in the US can be more than what a junior partner would earn at an Australian top-tier firm.

Mr Walmsley estimates that first-year lawyers at top-tier firms in the US earn about $US205,000 ($276,940) plus $US10,000 in bonuses, compared with $90,000 in Australia, with a lockstep progression structure taking that figure to more than $US300,000 in salary and $US50,000 in bonuses by the fifth year. Most US firms also doubled their bonus pools during COVID-19.

Jurisdictional differences
In London, lawyers with two years experience earn about £90,000 ($164,880).

The need to learn about jurisdictional differences in the law and pass the relevant bar means Australian lawyers heading to the US and the UK typically have one to two years shaved off their experience level, however, to allow them “a ramp-up period”.

Australia’s privileged visa arrangements with the US and the UK also added to their appeal for candidates, recruiters said, as they made gaining the right to work relatively easier than in other jurisdictions.

Australians can work in the US for a single employer for two years under an E3 visa, which can be renewed and which Mr Walmsley said was “very easy to get for professionals”.

They can also work in the UK for two years for multiple employers on a youth mobility visa, provided they take it up before they are 35 years old and claim it only once.

Ancestry visas are also popular, giving Commonwealth citizens who have a grandparent who was born in the UK the right to work there for five years.

Mr Walmsley said lawyers with three to six years’ experience were the most in demand, but candidates at varied levels of seniority were likely to find roles in an employees’ market.

This is also the most sought-after level of lawyer in Australia, where an exodus of corporate lawyers to in-house roles has lawyers with two to four years’ experience being described as “unicorns”.

“The most in-demand level is someone with three to six years’ experience from a top-tier firm with strong academics. They’d have a massive amount of choice in terms of firm and location,” Mr Walmsley said.

“But anyone with two years’ plus experience has a very good chance of successfully securing an international role if they have a strong background.”

He said transactional practice groups such as M&amp;A, private equity, investments funds, capital markets, tech transactions, energy and all areas of banking and finance were experiencing the biggest staff shortages globally.",2021-11-10 12:56:55

(Make sure you don't deposit all of your Matic, keep some in your wallet to pay for gas.)  You could stop here and you'd be earning about 2-4% on those funds.  Depositing into Aave will leave you with amTokens, like amWMATIC, and amWETH.  Then deposit these into Mai Finance under the yield tab.  This will leave you with camWMATIC, and camWETH.  You then use these to open up a vault under the Vault tab.  Once you have a vault, you can borrow Mai stablecoin against your vaulted assets at 0% interest.  You can use this Mai to buy other tokens, or deposit them into pools on Quickswap or Balancer, etc.  Or you can swap the Mai for USDC and deposit them into Curve.  You can deposit them into the stablecoin pool, or ever so slightly more risky you can deposit them into the tricrypto pool on Curve, which is what I prefer since im bullish on ETH/BTC right now.

If I get the job (job2) I would take it, as it meets salary expectations and would be a great learning experience where I’d develop skills that would help me throughout my career, but I think the learning curve would result in months of stress and difficulty. I think I could end up not getting job #2 due to lack of directly related experience. 

There is another job (job 3) that low-balled me by sooo much more than the job I posted about, and the recruiter (who spent 20 years in the field prior to becoming a recruiter) explained that my career change will make my job search incredibly difficult with my current salary expectations. Job 1 (OP) and job 3 are very similar, but the recruiter said something about 50-60k for Job3, which is absolutely out of the question. Job1 would be at least 70k, which is ~8% more than I make now (enough to cover public transport and MAYBE utilities, but not nearly enough to cover increase in cost of apartment by any means). He (Job3) kept talking about me changing careers within finance and not having direct experience related to that job. He labeled me as someone between a fresh college grad and a professional with experience in the role/field. I never had a college internship, so maybe he’s not wrong.

Does this change your opinion? Job3 guy is not lying; I’ve learned tons of actuarial-specific skills/software that would not translate over. 

Part of me feels like Job1 provides incredible opportunity to enter the field I’m passionate about, and both interviewers kept referring  to the job as a “stepping stone”. 

Does this change your opinion at all? Keep in mind that I have applied to 30-40 jobs with a similar title and have received rejections from 50-70% of those, not even making it through the HR screen.",2021-11-11 16:44:56
R-W-W,"Seriously through you’ve gotta love how people latch onto what they want to hear, I probably should have prefaced this with more detail and back story but I didn’t think it was necessary.

My mother and I had an arrangement in we’re she might have bought me the car, it was incredibly unlikely though, looking back.

I would have loved to had this car bought for me ‘who doesn’t want a free 60k car at 18?’ 
But I am not that blessed nor would i have taken any glee in posting an update.
I have been saving money since I was 13, for a car or college most probably college. But I’ve decided I’m probably not going to go because I enjoy welding.
So instead I finance the car I’ve always wanted since it debuted. I also struggled with severe scoliosis growing up (85 degree curve) and have surgery coming up in December, unfortunately it’s not going to be under insurance and will be in the 6 digits, I’m lucky to have a family who can pay for it. And since I’m getting the surgery I will get no help financially for or with the car.

A large portion of the ‘daddy’s’ money as mentioned by a commenter about my earlier post, from the divorce is going into the surgery that he (my father) refuses to help pay for. Not for a car and to be honest I’m glad it’s not, I would not be able to take pride in something I did not earn and would not feel right about taking that kind of money from my mother for a luxury, no matter how well off we may be.
I will always be thankful for my family’s support.",2021-11-11 16:53:41

Sgt_Smitty,"He's 100% right. I used to do financial sales and quit because eventually it started eating my soul. I do think analysts and traders have an important job (the engine isn't gonna run itself and someone has to move the money from Point A to Point B) but there are *so* many roles in finance that really don't need to exist anymore...the whole thing is a farce, especially once you turn your back on rampant materialism. 

I will say this: I think compensation for work is a bell curve. On the one side of the curve you have jobs that require minimal knowledge to perform, and therefore pay minimal wages. On the other side of the curve you have people who are well-compensated not because the job itself is difficult, but because the knowledge (ex: licenses, education, network, etc.) they bring to the table cannot be easily replaced. Like that comment about paying an electrician $100 to flip a switch. It's not the act of flipping a switch, it's the years of experience to know *which* switch to flip that you're paying for.\* In the middle you have most folks who are doing more work than the folks on either side of the curve while not being compensated as highly, because they're still in the learning phase.

Experts-say,"Hmm, this is more of a personal opinion than facts I could back up, but I would argue its because of the (current) true nature of ""crypto"". Monero is an amazing tool and very true to the core of what cryptocurrency is supposed to be, however ""Crypto"" (the combination of all coins and tools we see created, traded, and discussed daily) is very little about actual ""cash""/currency transactions. The relevance of privacy is particularly high in this domain, and crypto IS used as such, but that's probably a fairly small (but slowly growing) subset of current use. In my opinion most of it is about speculation / gambling / numbers go up. 

Depending on who you look at, you have the ""poor"" who like it for the rush of gambling and the ability to dream of getting rich, similar to why they like to buy lottery tickets (but probably with slightly better chances). Many of them actually do get some money out, or at least saw their paper-value bell curve for a short time. It's either a great dream, a great gain, or a great story... depending on when you get in and out. You also have the wealthy who like to ""diversify"" (read: ""add gambling"") and spice up their boring portfolios with some excitement, and they will indeed be able to extract significant value out of their ability to bet bigger, patience and staying power. And then you have the really rich, the""institutionals"", and the con-men-type (3 definitely not mutually exclusive categories) who will always attack new un/under-regulated environments with heavy manipulation and exploitation until the environment dies or matures and learns to protect itself (somewhat at least).

Where is Monero in all this? Doing a perfect job as a currency. Keeping you private and safe. Actually being used in very important markets, some of which were the trajectory for BTC in its early days. But Monero is a badger. It doesn't gamble, will not dance on tables when asked, has a ""rational / mature"" community, and will bite when people try to manipulate it. This makes the community and price very stable and grow steady, which again, is a highly desirable feature for a real cryptocurrency. If people are even 1% in it for true cypherpunk ethos and not for numbers go up, they will respect Monero. You however see, this doesn't serve the 3 categories above as well as other coins, because markets are easier to manipulate the dumber its userbase and the more data is available on how that userbase behaves. Queue in every transparent blockchain. 

And now you add that Moneros principles of sound money are rooted in privacy. It's basically and oxymoron to shout out how great Monero is. Its like wanting to show all your friends your invisibility-cloak. It defies the purpose. Mixed with a mature community that gives *less* fucks about NGU...that means less word of mouth marketing. However, don't be mistaken. What happens is that you HEAR less about use, but the use is most definitely there. Transaction counts are repeatedly breaking ATH levels and even in relation to BTC you see [where this is going](https://i.redd.it/ihiiwk6o9zy71.jpg) (courtesy of /u/ichver [here](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ichver)). 

Now because it is a very good tool, it is also a threat to some big actors, so we likely see some price suppression going on. I would however not concentrate on that as the main reason that it doesn't go in unison with BTC. In my opinion, the main reason is that XMR is less the speculative vehicle of abuse and true market value is a function of utility and real use; it takes its time to grow. Imho, many cryptos aren't worth their market caps. They don't provide value at their respective levels other than as a gambling chip or the argument that it has cost so much to produce (i.e. mine) them...But the argument of scarcity and the hype won't survive forever. Some will survive for their utility (even if its only gambling), others will not. Finance and Crypto are both somewhat out of control with regard to speculative estimation of future value. 

Back to the topic: More and more people are using monero. Its the only digital cash worth its salt and it's the value investment for a diversified portfolio... a long-term stable history might make it massive for both legal and illegal purposes (imagine some country with strong capital controls and massive amount of rich people suddenly has a lot of people flee because of the tightening grip and war mongering of its government... not looking at any particular billion+ country starting with a C... wink wink), and if bad comes to worse you can always spice up your life instead of your portfolio by blowing your XMR in the many markets that are now exclusively using Monero for damn. good. reasons.

take a $50000 MSRP vehicle where inadequate demand exists

one form of subsidy would be a $12500 payment to manufacturers to put towards COGS who would then be able to sell the car at $37500 in line with demand

a $12500 payment to consumers towards the $50000 to shift demand the curve

the nonrefundable tax credit is neither of those

the car manufacturer still bears the entire cost of manufacturing the vehicle and sells the vehicle at $50000

the consumer still has to pay for or finance the vehicle at $50000

later, when the consumer files taxes, they may or may not see their tax liabiliy reduced so they pay less to the government

neither the consumer nor the manufacturer receives any added amount of money relative to the absence of the tax credit, the consumer may have lower future tax liability, but that does not cost the government anything",2021-11-13 01:59:10

LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Shipping companies that transport the world's coal are in the crosshairs of some financial backers who are cleaning up their businesses in the absence of a truly global drive by nations to renounce the dirtiest fossil fuel.

In a sign of investors taking the initiative, six European firms collectively representing over 5% of the estimated annual $16 billion capital financing requirements of the dry bulk industry told Reuters they were either reducing their exposure to vessels that transport coal or were considering doing so.

Such carriers - titanic vessels stretching up to 270 metres (885 ft) long and able to carry hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cargo - are the cheapest way to transport coal and other commodities like iron ore and grain in large quantities.

Swiss Re (SRENH.S) told Reuters that from 2023 it would no longer cover the transport of thermal coal via reinsurance treaties, where it covers a portfolio of insurers' policies. It exited the direct insurance of coal cargoes in 2018.

""There is much more pressure on the insurance companies in terms of ESG,"" said Patrizia Kern-Ferretti, head of marine at Swiss Re Corporate Solutions, referring to the sustainable investment sphere. ""I hear from brokers they are having difficulty placing coal policies in the insurance market,"" she added. ""More and more companies are applying direct guidelines.""

Esben Saxbeck Larsen, senior portfolio manager at Denmark's Danica Pension, said it favoured greener shipping firms as they provided the best risk/return characteristics. The fund has ""close dialogue"" with firms about their ESG strategies.

""If we are uncomfortable with such answers, we will not invest in the company,"" he added, without elaborating on the specifics of the methodology.

Such pressures pose new challenges for the shipping industry, which hitherto largely hasn't been drawn into the centre of the coal debate by policymakers and investors focused on production and consumption rather than transport of the fuel.

Andreas Sohmen-Pao, chairman of BW Group, which operates a diverse fleet including oil and gas tankers, offshore vessels and dry bulk carriers, said ESG pressures on investors and banks – capital providers to the industry – were growing.

""How that plays out in terms of outcome is a different question. Sometimes, people shun a sector and the returns only get better as supply moderates,"" he added.

""Everyone has to do what they think is right. Sometimes, you can have counter-intuitive effects.""

There's good money be made from delivering coal, which broadly accounts for about 30% of cargo volumes and has hit record prices amid a shortage of fuel including natural gas to provide the power needed by a global economy recovering from a pandemic.

And demand beckons for decades to come after major consumers including China and India failed to join a pact to phase out coal power at U.N. climate talks being held in Glasgow this week; while Europe and the United States are retiring coal-fired plants, Asian nations are building almost 200 more. read more

Khalid Hashim, managing director of Precious Shipping (PSL.BK), one of Thailand's largest dry cargo ship owners, said investors should target the consumers and producers of coal.

""All we do is deliver it from the point of origin to the point of consumption, like a messenger delivering his message,"" he added. ""Coming after ship owners seems the easy cop-out route as we have no voice.""

CAPESIZE CARGOES

The six firms that spoke to Reuters about their coal concerns collectively own, finance, insure or reinsure more than $1 billion of capital in the dry bulk industry, based on the estimated value of shipping assets.

Leading shipping financiers more broadly currently provide close to $290 billion of lending to the industry annually, with capital requirements for the dry bulk segment accounting for about $16 billion, according to analyst and Reuters estimates.

The investor pullback, part of a wider shift in the financial industry away from fossil fuels, threatens to drive up the cost of finance and insurance for some shipping firms in the dry bulk sector, which carries close to half of global seaborne cargo volumes.

London-based specialist asset manager Marine Capital, which owns and operates shipping assets on behalf of institutional investors, said it anticipated that funders would not support investments in the largest bulk carriers that typically carry coal, known as capesize vessels.

""When it comes to small bulk carriers below panamax size the amount of coal they carry is relatively modest and our experiences suggest that certainly now institutions would take the view that the relationship with coal is, from their perspective, de minimis,"" said Marine Capital CEO Tony Foster.

Tufton Investment Management, another prominent investor in shipping, said it had been increasingly limiting its exposure to coal carriage, especially thermal coal, since 2018 by favouring charterers less likely to carry the fuel.

""For example we choose agricultural houses over miners and utilities,"" said Paulo Almeida, the chief investment officer.

Separately, at least two major ports are making big shifts; Antwerp has turned its back on coal, for example, while Peel Ports is redeveloping its former Hunterston coal import terminal in Scotland to be able to handle offshore wind, dry docking for ships, aquaculture and the recycling of energy.

'APPLYING LIPSTICK'

Some bulk shipping players are looking to get ahead of the climate curve by refocusing their businesses away from fossil fuels. Others, who have seen patchy profits in recent years, are loathe to the turn away from the returns on offer from coal.

Monaco-based Eneti (NETI.N) is in the former camp, and it has shifted entirely out of dry bulk shipping this year into providing specialist vessels for the offshore wind sector.

""An important consideration when we exited the dry bulk sector was thermal coal,"" managing director David Morant told Reuters, saying trying to clean up coal transportation was ""only applying lipstick"".

""As a publicly-listed company, renewable energy through offshore wind is higher growth, environmentally responsible and attractive to our investor base.""

Similarly Purus Marine, which has leading U.S. investment company Entrust Global as its founding shareholder, says it is focused on more environmentally friendly ocean industries.

""Our business model is to own vessels and maritime infrastructure involved in offshore renewable energy, seafood, ferries and the climate-aligned sectors of industrial shipping,"" said CEO Julian Proctor.

HIGHER SHIPPING PRICES

The impact of higher prices for shipping coal would be felt most in Asia, which consumes 80 percent of global coal supply and is more reliant than elsewhere on coal-fired power.

Even though emissions from burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change, the priority for many developing countries is to provide power to a rapidly growing population rather than converting to renewable plants.

An abrupt transition from coal would drive up logistics costs for producers and consumers, said Vuslat Bayoglu, managing director of South African investment firm Menar, which holds stakes in South African thermal coal, anthracite and manganese producers.

""The worst-case scenario is to see countries being plunged into darkness and manufacturing being hit hard, thus heralding a global economic crisis of sort,"" he added. ""This would be highly irresponsible, as many countries are crawling out of long periods of recession and COVID-induced decline.""

professor_jeffjeff,"Ok, the greeks are a series of partial derivatives of a differential equation.  That's it.  So what the fuck does that mean and can I even explain this after drinking 9 beers?  I'll try.  


So like 40 years ago, some smart fuckers created an equation to model option prices.  The equation has a few variables, specifically the stock price, the time to expiration, and something called a brownian distribution that you can think of as fitting the price of the stock to a bell curve (it's not, but think of it that way and the variable ""sigma"" is the same in both equations or at least sorta).  The thing is, you can't solve for the price because sigma, or the volatility, is part of the equation.  However, we actually \*do\* know the price of the option and the stock so if we fuck with the numbers, we can plug those in and actually solve for sigma which is how IV is calculated (there are a few ways so for those of you who are all ""but binomial blah blah blah"" can go fuck yourselves as of right now and come back.  Go ahead, go fuck yourself.  I'll wait.  Let me know when you're done fucking yourself and then try drinking 10 beers (yeah I just got another one) and try to do math and see how you do).  

Anyway, so we have this math equation that does stuff to price options that consists of basically 3 variables.  So what would happen if we were to look at how the effect of those variables changing would fuck with the output of the equation?  This is called a partial derivative, which is a thing that basically takes an equation with multiple variables and says ""fuck all these variables, let's just look at what would happen if we changed one of them and pretended that the others don't change"" or basically something like that.  So for theta, we say ""fuck volatility and fuck the stock price, let's pretend that those literally don't change at all"" and then figure out if those don't change, what happens if we move time either a lot, a little, or whatever.  It turns out that the option price in that case will decrease, but assuming that the stock price, the guaranteed risk-free return or whatever, and the price distribution are exactly the same until the option expires.  Now those things won't actually all happen, but who gives a fuck because we can now get an idea of how theta influences the output of that equation.  Delta is the same, except now we say that time decay is constant and the IV (sigma) is constant so what happens if just the stock price moves?  Well, it does a thing to the option price.  Same with the other first-order greeks.  


Now the other greeks that are second-order such as gamma, charm, vomma (yo' vomma's so fat she sat on the stock and crushed the price but the volatility still went up), etc. are just second-derivatives which means it's the rate of change of the rate of change.  So for example, delta tells you how the option price changes as the stock price changes, but how does delta change?  Delta also changes over time so we can calculate the rate at which delta changes and it turns out that this is gamma.  Same with vomma, which is the rate of change of the IV.  Now, none of these things really mean anything on their own because everything is changing constantly.  However, if one of them makes a huge change then it means fuck-all to the others because the effect of a change in that one variable will outweigh the effects of the others (sorta; I'm vastly simplifying things and I'm also drunk).  Still, this gives us an idea for each greek what's going to happen to the price if just that greek changes, because these are literally partial derivatives of the Black-Scholes equation.  


So what does this mean in practice?  Let's say you sell an option at some strike and some expiration and for the whole life of the option, the stock price stays exactly the fucking same and J-Pow doesn't fuck with interest rates and everything else.  That means that every day, the price is going to get fukt by a certain amount because the chance that the stock is going to move becomes smaller and smaller over time.  Same with sigma (IV); whatever the fuck the stock price does and time decay does, the expected move of the stock remains exactly the same so the odds of it moving in or out of your favor will change because we're still expecting the stock to move or something like that.  Same with delta; if the stock price moves in a particular direction and nothing else happens, then you can predict precisely how fucked or how profitable you are because options give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy/sell the stock at a specific price on or before the expiration, so if the stock goes above your strike price on a call then you can buy at a discount and immediately sell for a profit.  Gamma is kinda like delta because as the stock moves against you then you get more and more fucked over time, just like if the stock moves with you then the poor loser on the other end of your trade gets more and more fucked over time because gamma is the rate of change of the rate of change of the price.

joeg4,"Yeah basically just go in reverse when you want to get back your original underlying assets.  It probably sounds more complicated than it actually is.  So in my situation, I would withdraw my borrowed stable coins out of Curve(along with any tokens that I farmed), turn these stablecoins back into Mai and pay back the loans from mai finance, then withdraw my aaveTokens from mai, then I could withdraw them from Aave to get back my original assets.  I should be left with more of my original asset plus whatever tokens you farmed, minues the fees that you paid for each of those transactions, which would be a few cents on Polygon.

libramo0n,"Honestly debt finance is an extremely steep learning curve. I felt totally in the dark and had no idea what was going on until half way through my third year probably. 

My advice is to take an hour and read the credit agreement (and yes, this is billable time). You don’t need to read every definition or read the boilerplate stuff about amendments and defaulting lenders (can probably even skip reps and warranties), but read the sections that cover payment mechanics (read this section about 8 times lol), conditions (this is where the meat of the junior tasks are and where the checklist comes from) and affirmative and negative covenants (negative covenants is where all the “baskets” are). These are the four sections that the issues list covers.

georgeandtonic,"Let me repeat this back to you so I can make sure I understand it correctly. I have some questions too if that's okay -- I'd appreciate the help.

Curve has a dai-usdc-usdt pool that you can provide liquidity to. I'm on the polygon network, I'm assuming this is the aave aDai+aUSDC+aUSDT pool. This pool says it has 7.5% vAPY and around 5% tAPY. Does that mean total of \~13% or does one include the other?

Also, why the ""a""s in front of the tokens? I am lending with aave already, I have amUSDC in my wallet from lending USDC -- is that the same thing? Am I providing USDC to the curve pool or another token?

Providing liquidity to the curve pool gives LP tokens. Take those tokens, deposit them in the beefy finance DAI/USDC/USDT ""Uses: Curve"" pool. This pays out 13.56%. 

Is this in addition to the percentages on curve, or instead of? And what tokens does does it pay out in?

A lot of questions, I know -- appreciate any help you can give me.",2021-11-14 07:22:46
robb17_,"You're right on your assumption about the pool, it is aDai+aUSDC+aUSDT pool and it has a total earn of 13%.

The a in front the token I think is for just to indicate that the token is a wrapper token pegged to the real one.

So, as you said you are providing USDC to the curve pool, actually you can provide DAI or USDC or USDT, just one of the tokens in the pool, curve will equally split the liquidity.

The beefy finance reward is instead of the on curve.
When you deposit the LP token, beefy gives reward in the same LP token, so you will see the LP deposited quantity increasing (because beefy automatically reinvest what you earned, so you deposit liquidity in a pool, earn reward on that pool and beefy automatically use that reward to increase the liquidity in the pool, so increasing the LP token amount).

This is not a play for finance, we are about fairness and transparency in the market and we are #WINNING. Check out what the DOJ said the other day, meanwhile the Fed thinks meme stocks (.001 percent of the market) should or could be enough to break the system and wants to take away our first amendment right to speak freely. I’ve been working since I was 15 and was a roofer all the way through college where I tested so well in economics I’d fuck up the grading curve for every other student. I know you see this as a get rich quick and many surely do bu the vast majority is also here to hopefully instill some justice that is sorely needed. Remember what trump said about 4D chess? #WINNING

the only prediction that will serve when MOASS kicks is that most stocks will drop and negative betas will shoot. It is inevitably because GMEs as of yet UNANNOUNCED partnership with loopring (I can point to 3 indications of this) WILL allow for the NFT dividend and will allow GME to withdraw from the stock market becoming the worlds first completely decentralized corporation, but of course not before a share recall…

DOJ has I out for corporate crime and among other things will be handling corporations who have been afforded several resolutions very differently (citadel) among other things. Federal reserve just keeps buying up government debt and monetizing it internally, what is their end game? And why would the Fed call for an end to the first amendment? I know which side I’m on and it ain’t the federal reserve, it’s the DOJ.

Hopefully you can start to see the bigger picture here or you can just wait for the movie AMC will be showing it along with “mutiny on the bounty” (trump deep cut to the day liberals thought he had declared himself king). This entire thing was a set up from the beginning… they along with most every other governor failed to recognize the huge implications of the “second views and opinions clause” that was handed down the night before. These have been handed down by the forefathers for use at certain times, the first was during the civil war and kept the states “United” even at war, the second was to deal with covid and changed the roles of governors through the emergency declaration, some have still yet to realize the world they are in and the role they should be playing. This has to do with the 14th amendment and it has yet to be addressed and it will put corporations at odds with the federal government when it is addressed.

At odds over who should foot the bill for all this hazard pay, ultimately it should and will come down to tax credits. So just imagine that.. essential workers riding on tax credits for years while those who stayed at home are forced to work that much harder to keep up with what the cost of living becomes once the tax albatross is removed from the necks of the hardest working and best budgeting people in the country.",2021-11-14 21:12:50
johnnobro,"&gt; Looking into investing with ETF’s but not wanting to do detailed research and active following-up.

That's perfectly fine. Even investing in a single ETF like the ""VWCE and chill"" strategy will require some self-education and figuring things out on your side. Not everyone is interested in personal finance and wants to go through that learning curve. Some people are happy paying a bit extra for someone to take care of it all, and you may be one of those people.

&gt; Would it be wise to let bank help you out instead of doing it all by yourself?

No. Banks are probably one of the worst options in that sense. They will try to put you on active funds that are very expensive, and that will perform less well than index funds.

divyad,"tl; dr - start with Erich Segal's Love Story, beautiful story, simple language and easy to follow :)

some context would be helpful, are you getting into reading in general? I would suggest you to start with fiction maybe even chetan bhagat to get a hang of it.. I know the writing is no level to salman rushdie but his stories are easy to follow and english is basic for a new reader to adapt. I'm embarrassed to admit but his recent books like girl in room 105 and arranged murder is quiet decent whodunit, despite so many cliche otherwise his other books had been a plot of b-grade Bollywood movie.

if you're into mystery and suspense, do read earl stanley gardner's perry mason series or even race against time writing style of Dan Brown IMO at levels of sherlok holmes or agatha cristie. fancy diving into fantasy world? alice in wonderland by lewis carroll is a classic masterpiece. language has a learning curve but immersion is next level.

however if you're into reading not just for appreciating the beauty of language and go beyond philosophy and imagination. you have an amazing world of non-fictions. basically these are the pre researched works of the authors who invested their better part of life studying the subject in detail and presented their results in a compact package for the world to learn and take advantage of. (i'm not considering plagiarism stuff many of the writers indulge in and simply lift off content from the internet and publish it as a contraception called their book) there's all types of categories where you want to venture, history, business, politics, finance, psychology, even entertainment and self-help the choices are endless.

personality development i'd recommend two books from mark manson, models and subtle art of not giving a fuck (the third one i found it somewhat bummer) since his language is sharp and strike chord with many readers, its interesting. If you're into improving your creative writing skills try - writing badly is easy by amitava kumar you'll develop insights on your reading as well as writing skills. (they both go hand in hand since the more you read 😅 the more sources you know from where to steal)

Masala Labs is another simple to read no nonsense cooking book, its little bit repetitive at parts but there's lots of interesting things to pick and improve your cooking skills at same time, which in turn improves your interpersonal relations and overall makes your life better. Then there are biographies and autobiographies of the people you admire/look forward to. or just interesting personalities. 'Bad Blood','Polyester Prince', 'Elon Musk', 'Pablo Escobar' 'Dongri to Dubai' etc.

NPRjunkieDC,"I put this together with advice I never got but slowly discovered by myself or someone pointed me to .

There are many investment books you can read.

Here's another version:

Stocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My Stock Portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks a month but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 40 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for stocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a cheap stock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",2021-11-15 08:20:22

ShareYourIdeaWithMe,"God damn, can you stop going off on tangents and producing these monstrous walls of text that is barely relevant to the point on hand? Seriously, TLDR. You also write in a way that is just a stream of consciousness with no structure to your ideas, making it a head fuck to follow. 

&gt;Price of labour is determined by supply and demand

Yes.

&gt;there is always an oversupply of labour, so the price of unskilled labour is the price that allows reproduction of the labour force, i.e the minimum that allows them to not starve to death

No. This doesn't account for minimum wage, unemployment benefits, savings of the worker, enjoyment of the job (volunteering), learning opportunities gained on the job (internships) - all of which mean that wages can be above or below starvation wages

&gt;average unskilled labourer who already has zero bargaining power

I don't think anyone has zero bargaining power - as long as they have alternatives. Eg. Even a ride share driver can choose between Uber and Lyft. Therefore Uber and Lyft have to compete on rates. In the worst case, unemployment benefits is still an alternative. Starting your own business is another alternative.

&gt;The Phillips curve is correct

I have massive problems with the Phillips curve. Especially in an economy that is deeply integrated with the global market.

I won't go into it here because it's a tangent.

&gt;Not to mention the definition of productivity itself means you can simply pay workers less to make them more ""productive"", because input costs are now less.

The definition of productivity is output per unit of labour (time). Not output per unit of labour (cost).

&gt;The actual reason people move from farms in a fully developed capitalist economy to urban areas is because they are basically fuedal lords and you either subdivide the farm between children until it can no longer compete

This is such a confusion of ideas. There's no rule that says that the land has to be subdivided into many smaller farms. You can just have one large farm owned by multiple shareholders.

&gt;barter economies have never existed

Of course they have. Bartering has been in place for thousands of years before money was invented.

&gt;it developed through conquering and debt peonage, pay your soldiers in a scarce currency you control the supply of and impose taxes on the population so they are forced to sell their social production to soldiers to get coin to pay their taxes, labour was sold for coin to pay taxes and also because it was now required to access to social production

Yes that's *how* they used money, but that's not what gave money (in this case, gold) value. Taxes are not what gives money value. I can think of many currencies that have value but are not taxed. 

Use (aside from trading) isn't nessesary either. Bitcoin doesn't have a use. World of Warcraft gold doesn't have a use. If we had a nuclear apocalypse, we could be trading in bottle caps - no use there either

Money doesn't need to have universal valuation either. World of Warcraft gold is only valuable to people who play that game.

&gt;money has three facets, a unit of account (an IOU, or debt), a token of exchange (a use value), and a store of value (exchange value)

They are the same thing. Miss me with that Marxist terminology. He invented use value and exchange value to try to explain holes in his shitty labour theory of value. Our understanding of economics has moved on from LTV already - see Menger's theory of marginal utility.

&gt;Wrong, fractional reserve banking has existed for as long as banking has existed

Yes but banking isn't as old as money. Therefore you can have money without fractional banking.

Not all money is a promissory note either. I listed many examples above.

&gt;You're just buying a commodity, but what do you want gold **for**?

To trade for something else.

&gt;What happens if tomorrow some country found a buttload of secret gold somewhere?

The value of gold will decrease in accordance with supply and demand.

The currency is not stable, agreed. But that doesn't change what money *is*. Not all money has the same quality. For example tobacco makes a bad currency because it rots. But that doesn't stop people from using it as currency at some point in time.

I'm not sure why you spent so much time dissing gold in your post. My argument isn't contingent on gold being an ideal currency. By using gold I'm simply pointing out that not all money has to be debt based. You can have a perfectly good society that trades in gold coins only with no promissory notes

&gt;Supply of money is not what causes inflation, imagine if banks were giving out mortgage sized loans for people to spend on whatever the hell they want instead of houses, the supply of money does not change between each scenario but one causes skyrocketing inflation and the other doesn't?

If banks were giving out (more) massive loans then the supply of money increases. And hence the inflation is entirely predictable. Even if it was simply larger home loans, it still leads to inflation: inflation would first appear in rising housing prices and then spill into the rest of the economy.

&gt;This was ultimately why the gold standard was abandoned

The real reason gold was abandoned was because the US government wanted to print more money to finance WW2.

&gt;supply of money is actually irrelevant to inflation

Lol, so wrong. If it's so irrelevant to inflation why not just double our money supply? We would all be twice as rich!

&gt;The amount you can probably pay back with interest. The money being able to be paid back is predicated on new money being generated by the capital loaned, but where does new money come from? The banks, debt is being paid with debt. When money is paid back it's destroyed so banks interest rates are to target levels of inflation, if there's too much spending causing high inflation then interest rates go up to destroy money faster and prevent it going into spending. The pie not being fixed means new pie needs to be generated.

Argh what a jumbled mess. You need to read up on how a central bank works.

&gt;The rising of domestic price levels does not necessarily mean your currency is worth less on foreign exchange markets, currency price relative to each other is determined by supply and demand for that currency, 

The value of a currency domestically and internationally is one and the same thing (ignoring arbitrage). Just like how the domestic price for crude oil corresponds with the international price for crude oil (ignoring transport costs and arbitrage). That's because the price is set by total supply and total demand of the good. Total demand is the domestic demand plus international demand.

&gt;if the increase in domestic demand means there's an increase in imports with no corresponding increase in exports that means to make up the trade gap USD must be bought directly, Australian goods are not bought and sold in AUD, we trade in USD, because if USD is bought directly with no increase in demand for AUD then the value of AUD must be continuously inflated relative to USD.

Yes there will be a trade gap and if our trade partners continue to demand payment in USD then yes the value of AUD will decrease relative to USD. But that doesn't contradict what I said before. 

&gt;Domestic prices are related to international markets, the price of oil makes the price of everything else go up, supply of currency has not changed, but there is still inflation.

I never claimed that prices were only determined by the supply of money. The price of oil going up is due to scarcity of oil. Ie. Less goods chasing the same amount of money. The MV=PY formula already explains this: Y decreases and therefore P increases.

&gt;buying a single pre-built house has zero inflationary effect

Of course it would. Housing prices are still prices. 

&gt;rentiers hate it when you destroy their assets through inflation

High inflation isn't just bad for landlords. It's bad for the entire economy as it muddies price information. People are less able to make correct and efficient decisions about the future due to this.

&gt;Economists always had their first principles wrong, that money was simply a token of exchange with some intrinsic quantified value, and projected back on history a false inference of a double coincidence of wants giving rise to a universal token with an intrinsic value equal to all, and with it the ludicrous notion so humanity values gold for some reason

There's nothing universal about gold. It could have easily been another metal - silver or platinum. I don't think any economists ever claimed that there was a universal intrinsic value to gold.

&gt;price of money is the supply and demand of currencies on Forex relative to other currencies, it acts as a commodity, and like every other commodity prices change relative to each other.

Yes. Nothing I've said contradicts this.",2021-11-15 11:37:50

ReasonableSail1363,"&gt; ""Budgeting"" doesn't only have one definition which seems to be the focal point of many of your responses. Many of your responses seem to focus on a very rigid set of percentages that everyone should follow. In a perfect and responsible world, that may be true. In reality, budgets are fluid and cater to individual's/family's needs (or wants). What you may be saving for a trip to Italy, I would be spending on Jeep parts and going to an off-road park for the weekend. You may see my spending as frivolous and ridiculous because you're using your money to see the world which seems more important to you.

I think maybe that's what you're not getting, and maybe I'm communicating wrong.

I have basically no other priorities. I like cars, and want a nice one.

The issue isn't that. It's that I don't see how people can afford to make it happen. Not how they prioritize, but literally how they are able to afford to spend more on a car when they don't actually have more money coming in.

I appreciate that others have different priorities, and celebrate that fact. FIRE people love doing what they do. I dislike it greatly. I never, ever want to be super frugal.

I simply want to do the very minimal responsible amount, while having fun. The minimal amount that every single person does to set themselves up.

&gt; In keeping with the theme of the original question by the OP. 5 years ago, I bought a 20 year old Viper using a 7yr loan for 100% of the vehicle cost (no money down) and my interest rate is 2.3% through my local credit union. My justification...the car was pretty much at the bottom of its depreciation curve so I wouldn't be upside down for more than a few months if any (its actually worth more than I paid for it now). 7 years vs my normal 5 years loan term allowed me to keep the extra ~200/mo in my pocket or invest it. You're probably reading that and pulling your hair out wondering how I could be so irresponsible, but in my head, I weighed my options and came to an educated conclusion on the best path forward for me to get my affordable dream car while I'm young and can enjoy it.

I'm not stressed by it at all. I tend to look at car buying as something simple: you pay the cost of depreciation, not the full cost of the car. Obviously, you have to be able to manage the cash flow until you sell the asset, but over the entire course of ownership, you only pay the depreciation.

I often suggest, as long as you can get a good rate, that you finance/lease for as little as possible, because the whole goal is to own/use the asset without having to spend any money. The idea lease is $0 to use the car for 4 years... but obviously that's not possible, so you try to get as close as you can.

I just honestly, truly don't understand how you do it. How is it actually possible.

I have a superb credit rating (800+ in Canada, which goes up to a max of 900.)

I make a huge amount of money.

But I was just rejected for a basic $30,000 line of credit.

I mean I literally don't understand how people are able to do it. If I can't be approved, surely people with much lower income, more debt, and a target for a car that's not even approvable for a loan would not be approved, right?",2021-11-16 02:58:01

You can see how much use and what the actual value is for these blockchain orgs/tokens.

They say this is the model/protocol, this is how it works, this is how we’re doing…

For projects, you gotta look at the team and how money is made. Read the documentation. If the project can’t make money, what’s the point? Just the same as any company you would look to invest in. 

For chains you have to look at technology, the best chains will get more money to play with by nature of their likely adoption and the value will increase as more folks or organizations find use cases on that particular chain. Certain projects on certain chains will benefit in accordance with this principle.

Curve finance is an interesting place to check out as a project, they are a stable coin exchange and have a good model for profit sharing and pseudo decentralized governance. They do something real as the main stable coin liquidity provider in defi. They exist across many chains and have solid fundamental technology as a decentralized exchange. 

Then you have companies/orgs like abracadabra that offer loans on staked assets. They have a simple business model and an interesting ethos. They are doing what has mostly been a centralized player game (creating stable coin that is actually adopted) via an easily understood loaning/collateral mechanism which is very clever. 

I think right now, stable coins ecosystem is safest to invest in due to its impending regulation and also because that is where it starts for people getting into crypto. You need a way to reliably hold digital assets without the volatility of the chain tokens. I think when you look at the standard savings account interest rate (mine is 0.5% at TD lol) and then compare to virtually any stable coin staking it’s tough not to think it’s wasting away in the bank. 

Of course first things first, use good internet sense, be a skeptic with links or folks offering ‘help’ on the technical side of owning your own crypto if that’s the route you go and do the required reading. 

That’s my two cents. The way this tech is being adopted screams to me that it is here to stay. I don’t mind PayPal or venmo or what have you but there are super transparent blockchains that can match the performance of these private companies in their infancy.",2021-11-16 22:58:07

[The metaverse is still a long time off. Apple is mostly building the hardware for AR (and because of that implicitly VR). Apple is awesome at that, and Apple is awesome at hardware. It's easy to see where Apple leaves room. Look at their current iPhones, how many apps do you use that are of Apple and how many apps do you use that are from any other company? Sure, Apple has some but that's it. In the metaverse, I believe Apple will take a similar approach, which makes Apple mostly a vertically integrated hardware company.  Vertically integrated hardware company: hardware + OS + basic apps + ecosystem  There is definitely competition with Oculus on the hardware side. However, Meta Platforms is a social media company first and foremost and are therefore mostly existing on the software layer. This is the room that Apple leaves to other companies, so there is no competition there. Since there will be competition with Oculus, it means that Meta Platforms will be able to create premium software for AR/VR on the metaverse.  What I think will happen:  * Oculus will compete with Apple on the hardware side. This could produce two possible outcomes (IMO). One outcome that won't happen: there's no way Apple will lose. So the other two outcomes are:    * Oculus will lose and Apple takes all    * Oculus will be its own ecosystem and Apple will be its own ecosystem * The rest of Meta Platforms has virtually no competition on the software side from Apple, besides some utility apps, but Meta Platforms has socially generated content + apps. So Meta Platforms will expand on this and take the cake there.  It may be that Apple royally fucks up though, I do feel that since Jobs died they lost a bit of their magic touch. They're still mostly coasting on Job's awesomeness. I know it wasn't only Jobs, which is why a lot of their magic still remains there, but some of it is lost.  This is also assuming that the metaverse and AR/VR gets big. It may get big, but it also may be a 100 years from now that it gets big since it depends on AI as well, and AI is a finicky beast with all the black box neural nets going on that you can't debug. If AI becomes debugable, then mark my words: that's a new AI revolution that will revolutionize how we use information.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv6vfa/will_apple_eat_metas_lunch/hkyzlyp/)

I think it has more to do with education and understanding how finances work. I hate how coded financial things are because it makes the learning curve steep and seem less accessible to the masses. Like why 401k, 529, etc. 

At least Roth IRA the IRA stands for individual retirement account. HSA is health savings account, etc. If we used fewer acronyms and numbers and named things exactly what they are to remove ambiguity, (e.g. social security where people are less likely to call is SS unless they are saying SSDI or some) you might just improve access to the system. People don't actually want open access financial education. We all benefit from inequality. We just happen to be the winners. It's a hard pill to swallow.

c24289416,"Hey there,

I see a lot of great advice here, and I hope my information will be helpful to you.

1. I started my career as a CPA and never had any real real estate underwriting experience. I started learning about real estate finance around mid September using Justin Kivel's ""break into CRE"" online courses (I bought ~ 6 of his courses on Udemy during their sales event and spent less than $100). Long story short, I was fortunate to land an capital market analyst position at JLL all thanks to Justin Kivel's courses (it goes without saying.... good interview skills is equally as important). 

2. I never thought about looking for a mentor at this early stage because I know for a fact that I don't know what I don't know, so it doesn't make sense to get a mentor. If you are looking for a mentor just to break into the industry, I would suggest you look on LinkedIn to find someone who is somehow connected to you (via school or similar background) and ask for their advice on how they broke into the profession. 

3. I will be 100% in-person

4. Argus is important for the purpose of underwriting and valuation. It's definitely a plus to learn and get a certificate from them, but it is hella expensive ($1.5k if I am not mistaken). I actually asked the exact same question during my interview because I knew Argus is essential in the underwriting process, and none of them suggested me to spend the money as I will get hands-on experience and learn on the job. Nonetheless, if you don't have any real estate related experience on your resume, I think having the Argus certificate will help you tremendously because it shows that you have taken initiative to learn.    

5. My plan is to learn as much as I can and re-evaluate in 2 years to see if I want to move to the buy side. I know for a fact that buy side is more stable in terms of work-life balance. The only downside on the buy side is that comp is capped. At the end of the day, it depends on how much you value work-life balance, how well your team does (if you end up getting a job at a brokerage), and $$$.

Based on my research, I think CRE brokerage is a great place to kickstart a career in CRE. I am sure next 2 years will be tough for me with a steep learning curve and countless late nights, but I am ready because I know I am genuinely passionate about CRE and the experience will make me a valuable candidate if I want to switch to the buy side in 2 years. 

If I can do it anyone can do it. Best of luck to you.",2021-11-19 15:32:35

“A 95% loss in this space“ is basically someone who saw some celebrity shilling some rando coin, did zero research, and put all their eggs in one basket all at the same time. Or got suckered into a rug pull.

For an **average** joe, I personally don’t believe the **average** investor should EVER attempt “timing the market”. In any class, especially cryptocurrency. 

(Having said that, there are very “safe”, not-volatile places to invest in crypto, such as Curve finance, certain liquidity pools, and things like Nexus Mutual. But to do well, the investor has to do a some reading and legwork. Not huge gains, but when there are losses, they’re closer to a 10% loss, nowhere near a “95% loss.” They’re manageable losses, not like.. financial-life-destroying losses.)

 If an **average** joe who isn’t knowledgeable and NEW to crypto were to ask me right now how to invest… I would recommend they open a Schwab or Fidelity account, and sock away $200/mo into an ETF, or an exchange traded fund. I wouldn’t advise some risk-averse Newb to plunge into any coin.  
With an ETF, you gain exposure to crypto, indirectly. All the eggs won’t be in ONE basket due to the nature of ETFs. They probably won’t see some kind of spicy HUGE returns, but they’re much less likely to get smacked upside the head by volatility in one coin. By their very nature, ETFs have spread out their eggs into several baskets. Slow growth, but less volatile, and more likely to be consistent.

seemylolface,"They also go pretty overboard and will recommend you eshew all comfort in your vehicle and drive around in a clapped out 20 year old Camry until you're worth millions, at which point you could consider (but probably still not buy) a brand new base model Civic.

There's a balance.  People like different things and have different goals in life.  The personal finance guys are hardcore into saving at every opportunity and giving up a lot now for more later.  Others are all about living in the moment and want to experience everything before they get too old.  Others are somewhere in the middle.  It's all about what YOUR priorities are.

Generally speaking no new car is worth it.  The moment you drive it off the lot you take a huge hit to its value and if you're trying to figure out if it'll become a collectors item/appreciate down the line then the answer is almost definitely no.  It's very rare for a car to become something of a collector's item and actually end up worth more, or even what you paid for it new.  You're going to lose money on the car, that's the blunt truth of it.

To get around this, I transfer money to my Kraken account, buy Ripple (because of the low network fees), transfer the Ripple to my Binance and then sell it there for EUR. Far from ideal, but in since October last year I've accumulated more than 2 BNB in cashback which equates to a little more than 1k EUR, so worth it I guess.

Also, since I use a Curve card, I actually buy everything through my main bank's card and sometime throughout the month I will move all those transactions to my Binance card. This way, I can time my BNB cashback a little bit (which is a gamble of course - could be worth more or less than normal) and, in the case of a refund, it would go my main bank instead of Binance.

That 5K loan has effectively negative interest on it. Every year inflation will erase some of it, the dollar value will be the same but it’s purchasing power will be decreased. As such if you take that money and do literally anything with it that beats inflation you will be a net positive position.  If you’re okay with the idea of having debt you should max out your loan and take as long as you possibly can to pay it off.

hohonana,"Your resume needs a lot of work, but it's workable. It's a life skill. Here are some tips but honestly speaking the learning curve for resume writing is pretty steep. 

* Put work experience first. Your education is pretty obsolete as an adult if you have work experience already. You studied Finance yet you work in retail. That's a red flag, so better not highlight your education. 
* Work experience - grammar mistake right at the beginning. Increased sales by 5% by \[doing what\], resulting in $250,000 in additional sales. 
* Reduced customer turnover by 25%? Do you have proof of this? 
* What exactly did you sell? Furniture or appliances or cars, or SASS?
* For your jobs, tell me about your projects and your initiatives. Not just the base job description. 
* Languages: English, Hindi. Remove Arabic. If you can't use it in a professional setting, I don't care that you know it. 
* Other information: Are you applying for jobs in the US? If yes, then erase this whole section. It's completely irrelevant and actually hurts you. 

Anyways, a lot of work needs to be done. Then you'll be getting interviews on a regular basis. 

One thing you gotta do is **take your target job description and match your resume with it.** You're basically rewriting the employer's job description into your own resume and applying your relevant experience to it. Anything other than that, it's completely useless to the hiring manager, to be honest.",2021-11-21 20:46:53
FblthpLives,"&gt; When there are direct or indirect barriers to that - and limitations on social mobility like for example access to higher education, or a medical disability that prevents you from taking on the challenges of entrepreneurship

For some background, I work as an economic analys and have an MA in economics with a focus on public finance. Literally the greatest limitation on social mobility in the U.S. is access to education. The U.S. is currently in a reinforcing loop where a growing income inequality feeds into better access to education (and healthcare for that matter) to high income earner which furthers the growing income inequality. This is, in fact, harmful to economic growth. This has been studied extensively, for example here:

seamustheseagull,"The problem really was a culture of hiring from within the company, but without providing adequate training. 

About 75% of the staff working in head office had worked up through the ranks. Starting as back packers or till operators or shelf stackers, before getting promoted up to a junior position in head office, and eventually into a job that anywhere else would require a college education. 

A fantastic idea, I don't disparage it. But it needs to be backed up with relevant accredited education; send your staff to college. But it wasn't. In many cases they might get a six-month part-time course, but sometimes there was nothing more than a five day course with a cert at the end. 

And promotions/placements were based more on whether you had been in the company long enough and were liked rather than whether you had an interest or aptitude for the department. 

So you had senior people throughout the company - HR, Finance, IT, Operations - with plenty of company experience but not enough industry qualifications. And some who had no interest in the work. Which worked fine in the 1980s, but not the 2000s. 

The staff were fiercely loyal to the company and to eachother but lacked any ability to forward plan. The company was stuck a decade behind the curve.

Tax cuts reduce government debt
#Assumptions:

* People are rational

* People respond to incentives.

* All savings is consumed in the long run

* The labour markets are sufficiently elastic

#Argument:

Actually, when the government reduces taxes, it stimulates the economy in a way such that the cuts pay for themselves in the long run by complex mathematical analysis. In the short run they increase the deficit.

To finance the deficit, the US government has to take on new debt, which increases US debt.

[This is a chart of debt with time, accounting for tax cuts.](https://imgur.com/a/Am2zss7) The dotted line represents the curve after taxes have been cut. [This graph represents the growth after the tax cuts.](https://imgur.com/a/m2bcyaZ)

As we can see, the tax cuts cause marginal increase in growth rate due to increase in spending and investments. Clearly this growth is not enough to increase tax revenue. That is not the argument of this post.

We use complex analysis to prove that the tax cuts actually reduce debt.

As we can see from graph one, the debt exploded after the tax cuts. It is increasing, and will converge to infinity.

Another series that converges to infinity is the series formed by sequence of natural numbers, ie

1+2+3+4+ . . . . .

Clearly, this series is divergent, but converges to infinity. This is also the Reimann Zeta function at the -1, if we analytically continue the function for all complex numbers. But the value of Reimann Zeta function also happens to be -1/12. [More details in Appendix A]

So the series actually also converges to -1/12. Since it is divergent, and debt is divergent but converges to infinity, we have -

Debt = 1+2+3+ . . . .

ie. Debt converges to -1/12.

So given a sufficiently long value of time T, the tax cuts will actually reduce the US debt.

No proper Oracle. Chain Link was supposed to arrive in Aug. Still hasn't.

Compare the ecosystem and TVL locked with any of the closest competitor and you will see the stark difference. 

Harmony One announced the 300 million incentive program in early September. Name one project that managed to lock 50 million in TVL(except DFK) since then. I pick this small number in TVL because that's a good indicator of investor confidence in the ecosystem.

Food security:

This is one of my biggest concerns, especially after reading the Chatham House 2021 Climate Risk Assessment and learning about the long-term unsustainability of industrial agriculture. It only takes a few really bad years like 2018 or 2008-2009 a few years in a row to enter into a global caloric deficit. I have convinced my parents to stock up on a few months worth of food and water (I told them to think of it like health insurance), but I know that this will only be sufficient in the short term. I recently checked out some books from my local library about permaculture, which I think will be my primary food source once I can get some land. One of my concerns about permaculture, however, is the fact that permaculture crops are just as susceptible to failure as crops grown on an industrial scale. I suppose that permaculture has an advantage in that you don't have all of your eggs in the same basket, but I wonder whether even permaculture will be viable in a destabilized climate. This is why I am thinking of stocking up on staple foods and potentially doing some aquaponics so that if an extreme weather event causes crop failure, I have enough diversification such that the event is not terminal and I can recover the next year. I have a bit of experience growing food in my backyard, but I like your idea about joining a co-op to add to my (admittedly limited) knowledge base.

Community:

This is something I have also been thinking a lot about, especially after reading *Sapiens: A Brief History*. Individualism only works when the amount of resources available to be extracted far exceeds the maintenance cost of a society. For the entirety of the Industrial Period, this has been the case. Now, resources are being degraded due to environmental negligence and depleted due to collective shortsightedness. Individualism definitely will not work in a world where resources are more scarce. I am looking into joining existing communities, but I suspect that in the next few years, most eco-villages, communes, etc. will still be heavily reliant on industrial civilization. If I cannot find a sufficiently resilient community, I might just start my own. Some of my friends at school and my brother seem to be interested in off-grid living, so if we all chip in, we could get land for less on an individual basis. In respect to community, I think Deep Adaptation may be better than Industrial Civilization because human beings are evolved to live in tribes, and why so many people miss their college days. However, I am under no illusion that Deep Adaptation is going to be fun. It will just be different.

Skills/Career:

Thank you for the DIY solar resource. That will be very helpful for the THOW. I am planning to do almost everything myself, so labor costs will be low. My brother and a family friend both know a lot about carpentry, so I will consult them about my design. I want to gain more 'making' skills before graduating, but I am kind of swamped with work, school and homework, so I won't have a lot of time (in fact, I am procrastinating on my math homework right now by writing this long response). Right now, the plan is to use modular design principles so that I don't have to plan out everything all at once. I guess that is a complicated way of saying I'll make it up as I go.

For coding, I did not think about asymmetric collapse, but that is a good point. It is an excellent career for earning capital right out of the gate. Although there may be some accelerated pathways towards a career in software engineering, I will probably still do a 4-year university because a) I don't want to disappoint my parents, b) many schools have co-op programs where you can earn up to 70% of normal wages as a Junior and Senior, c) my parents are willing to finance most of the tuition (thanks guys), d) it allows for more career flexibility if I need to change paths later on (be water).

I don't want to be a wage slave forever though, which is why I am also thinking of founding a THOW/sustainable construction company if my initial THOW attempt is successful. I think housing costs will continue to rise into the foreseeable future, and a large portion of the population will be forced to make the choice between voluntarily downsizing or sleeping in a tent on the streets. Demand for cheaper housing will be high.

Coping:

Yeah, it does kind of suck. I also have a lot to be thankful for, though:

\- I live in America, which is not going to be as screwed as the developing countries in the short term.

\- I get to live in an interesting period in history.

\- I am young and do not have as much of a vested interest in the current state of the world than others who have already established their lives/careers. I cannot imagine the anxiety one would feel learning about collapse in a house in the suburbs with 2 kids and a partner. I can also adapt and learn more easily than people older than me.

\- Everybody is going to have to face up to the reality of our situation eventually. I'm just ahead of the curve.

\- If I am not ahead of the curve (I am aware of confirmation bias and biased assimilation) and the world will go on, then that's fine because going off-grid is what I would do even if it wasn't necessary since industrial civilization is really toxic.

\- When you realize how easily everything we know and love can disappear in the blink of an eye, it forces you to never take things for granted.

I have to admit though, it was really difficult at the beginning when I first started to realize how deep the rabbit hole goes. I struggled with depression last summer because of it. What makes things worse is when people try to assure you that everything is going to be just fine. Excessive positivity really is toxic. Or when they say something along the lines of, ""Yes, we are in deep trouble, but there's no point in focusing on how badly we've failed. Let's focus on the solutions rather than trying to live with the consequences of our actions!"" People tell me that I should study hard so that I can become a scientist and save the world, but by the time I've graduated college it will be 2026. We need ""rapid, immediate, large scale reductions in emissions,"" but this species is too short-sighted to implement those measures until it's too late. As far as I'm concerned, my focus should not be on how to save the world (since that's unrealistic), but to make a bad situation better. Incidentally, the same low-tech deep adaptation measures that will need to be implemented have much lower ecological footprints. So it's a win-win.

""These celebrants of 'progress' venerated the brief grandeur, the party time we have been celebrating for two centuries, without thought for the morrow, where everyone was out to jump about, to move and shout louder, to forget all the rest, to forget themselves. They always needed more energy, more objects, speed, control. They needed to have more of everything. Now, for them, it's hangover time: the party's over! Ultimately, modernity will not have died of its postmodern philosophical wounds but because it has run out of energy. And if amphetamines  and antidepressants were the pills of the productivist world, resilience, sobriety and low tech will be the aspirins of the hangover generation.""

Bort_Bortson,"Don't do bonds. Interest rate is basically 0. When interest rates rise bonds go down and being at the bottom there is only one way to go and it ain't lower. That's day 2 of finance, day 1 being the supply and demand curve.

Company X issues bonds at 2% and the value is the face value plus the present value of the annuity of the coupon payments.

Prime rate goes up tomorrow, Company Y issues bonds at 3%. Your vanguard bond has now lost value because why would I buy a bond with interest payments at 2% return when I can get 3%? A $1000 face value bond with 2% interest with 59 payments left is worth less than a $1000 face value bond with 60 3% interest payments left. Answer, by pricing the 2% bond cheaper, hence you lost money.

Going to the 80s when inflation and interest was stupidly high. I buy a 50 year bond at 20% interest. That bond today is worth a ton because if I want to get 20% coupon payment Im going to have to pay for that interest.

Stuck-step-sister,"I've been day trading whilst studying at university for the past 3.5 years and about to get into full time trading starting in a couple of weeks once I graduate. I guess I'll answer your questions in dot points in line with the order you asked:

1. Original life plan was to get into corporate to do something related to my degree (finance and economics)
2. Had a friend in high school who introduced me to it, but I didn't actually get started until I entered university 
3. Most appealing part is undoubtedly the money, and the fact that if successful, I would be able to retire early and live life according to my own plans without being restricted by a 9-5
4. In my 2nd year of university I decided this is what I want to do with my life. I had to sacrifice my grades and internships so I could focus all my attention on trading. 
5. As for specific books, the ones that were most influential to me are: ""Market wizards"". ""The new Market Wizards"", ""Trading in the Zone"". As for specific youtube channels, I watched a lot of SMB capital, Live trading by trader tv live, beginner trading. 

The best way to learn in my opinion would be to spend a few weeks just absorbing whatever information you can about day trading on youtube. Then after that, I'd highly suggest just watching the market and seeing live how prices move. Screen time is hands down the most important thing to spend time on if you want to improve. Some key words to search on youtube are: Price action trading, Support and resistance, day trading and volume, Level 2, tape reading. 

One thing that is important to know before you start is to throw away any unrealistic expectations you have of making money from trading because it is a very steep learning curve and it may take anywhere from 2 to 5 years before you truly grasp trading and are able to consistently make money. I went in with the expectation of making a huge sum of money within 1 year and I was immediately humbled by how hard it actually is to learn. Took me 3 years to really know wtf I am doing and gain confidence in my trading. 

To be completely honest, there are some days or even weeks where I just completely burn out and wish that I had never started on this journey in the first place. It's a bumpy road and it is highly likely you will go through many cycles of mild to severe depression. BUT despite all of this, there is nothing else I'd rather be doing as I've slowly learned to love and trust the process.

CAEatonLaw,"Neither. As an experienced family law attorney, the best advice I can give is that you should focus on a degree in accounting or finance. A vast majority of being a family law attorney involves addressing financial issues (both in divorce and paternity cases). The biggest learning curve I had after law school was learning accounting and business principles. Learning about parenting and children’s issues (call it social issues) was much easier. You don’t really need a political science or law background before law school. I had one. It did not provide me an advantage like I thought it would. Also, law school admissions are starting to give applicants with science and business degrees preference.

Degrees in political science and/or social work will not better prepare you for law school. Frankly, college in general will likely not adequately prepare you for law school. Law school is extremely different.  Generally, my classmates with political science degrees did just as well as classmates with engineering or business degrees. Plus, a knowledge base on financial issues is desired by family law firms, so it will be easier to find a job after law school.

Considering your stage in life, I would caution you about picking a career path now. College can be a very eye opening experience, and law school is an unbelievable time and financial commitment. The same goes for picking a specific practice area. My desired practice area changed many different times throughout law school, and I never wanted to be a family law attorney. Nevertheless, that’s what happened. In my opinion, it’s better to have an open mind. 

Live your dream, but you should be warned that family law is an extremely emotional and taxing area of the law. I am not sure what your motivations are, but I would warn anyone wanting to be a family law attorney of the same thing. If possible, I would recommend that you reach out to a family law attorney in your area and ask them what the practice is like. You may be surprised. Most people do not really understand what we do until they see it in person.

PeterFuckingGast,"I think you might have some misunderstandings. When one refers to ""unconstrained liquidity"" it refers to the problem with constant product AMMs such as Uniswap V1, V2 and the large majority of DEXs building on Cardano. The problem, as you highlight, is that liquidity is deposited for the entire price range, which renders most of it idle. When you provide liquidity in one of these DEXs, the formula is pretty much considering all possible trading scenarios on the price range curve as equally possible, which means only a very little amount of capital then you provide is actually being utilised, as most pairs trade within certain ranges. Thats simply whats meant as unconstrained.

Now, thats why Uniswap came up with Uniswap V3. In Uniswap V3, it is you, the user, that decides in which range the pair you provide is gonna be trading (you ""constrain"" it). Then you got stuff like Popsicle finance that optimises that entire process.   


What Maladex wants to do, basically, is the same thing, to give the user the option to deposit the liquidity in the range that they prefer. Regarding the eUTXO architecture, I am no expert here, but I know that with the fragmented model, each fragmented order is an eUTXO, which is more efficient than other models bridging from the account model and that need to include the liquidity pool information in the eUTXO and worry a lot about tx size.

ennuinerdog,"Now is a good time to think about exponential growth.

Obviously investing as much as you can early will lead to exponential growth, as will progressing in your career - these are over-emphasised in personal finance circles.

The other thing that can grow exponentially is your expenses. Lifestyle creep/lifestyle inflation is a real thing. Your stuff is a bit plain and you're tempted to buy nicer things. You now have money, so you buy them. A new baseline has been established and soon you repeat the process. Over a lifetime, this exponential spending on nicer things can really hurt you.

The best way I've found to avoid this is twofold:

1) Decide what is enough, so that you stop wanting more. An old couch and car and a cheap house and second hand goods and cheap hobbies are enough. 
2) Delay purchases and upgrades. Even if something should be replaced, stick with it a bit longer rather than impulsively upgrading or replacing it. In 6 weeks you probably won't even remember your impulse to buy an upgrade - if you do, that's a sign that maybe it really is necessary.

A bit of lifestyle inflation is healthy, but by deciding to be content with enough and delaying acting on the impulse to upgrade, you can bend the lifestyle inflation curve down. Even if you halve the pace of lifestyle inflation, you're making an exponential difference in your lifetime expenses and freeing more money up to invest.",2021-11-24 08:27:21
era--vulgaris,"Yah, sorry but there needs to be more posts like this out there. It isn't just ""following your passion"" that makes life suck for some people. It's a nice fantasy for moralists to beat creatives over the head with and blame them for their station in life. But the truth is it's hard to have a stable, secure career at all, and if you don't want to work 80 hours a week or get into so much student debt that you're leashed for life, those options are even narrower. 

Take STEM. 

The fact is most things besides the ""T"" in STEM aren't valued much either except in very specific careers. Oilfield for geology, finance for math, etc. 

Take the trades. A better option than retail/service by far, but also often plagued with incessant overwork, dangerous conditions, a high learning curve for non-mechanical/engineering-oriented people, a far-right social environment, more insecurity than they let on, and worst of all a total lack of work/life balance. On-calls, employers nickel and diming you out of hours, etc. 

I went into a trade because I had the prerequisite skills to make it easy to understand, and yet I often fucking hate what I do, and am bored with it when I don't. Even though it's way better than what I've done as a job previously.

Why? Because it's *not* one of my interests or passions. I don't give a damn about it. And it sucks to spend time making money for someone else while whiling away the hours at something you could care less about. I've met doctors who feel the same way; they did what they were ""supposed"" to do but they never wanted to be doctors.

alphaqu2twice,"&gt;Could you please let me know what value is being generated and how it's not just a speculation market.

A lot of it is speculation today, but this is building a new financial system that's barely 10 years old. It takes time, there are already projects providing financial services and billions of dollars of TVL is locked into them. Curve Finance, Serum, Eth ecosystem, Dot ecosystem etc.

I welcome regulation in crypto space too and I know it will arrive. Crypto needs regulation to thrive so I am not afraid of it.

Stock market is rugpulled and twisted at the whims of whales in wall st. The gamestop fiasco earlier this year is a prime example. Same things happen in Crypto if you put your money in shit projects. DYOR and back solid projects, there are several of them.

Good projects? ETH, SOL, DOT, ADA, LINK, ONE, XTZ, MATIC, LOOPRING, KUSAMA ... I can list many others. These projects have investor backing and solid development teams behind them, I know because I am on one of them. The applications for blockchain are enormous beyond just financial markets. Gaming, NFT, Identity Management, Security and the list goes on and on.

A word of advice, educate yourselves rather than simply parroting the popular narrative. Admittedly, I am biased because I am invested but I see a lot of good technology and work being done. People see cumrockets and moonshots and they think that's all this space is. It isn't.",2021-11-24 20:56:47

Puttix,"Firstly, if you're going to quote me, don't circumcise my statements. 

&gt;Investors or home owners?

Irrelevant. If it's a sought after place to live, it will attract investment, precisely because it will continue to grow or sustain it's value. You cannot stop housing from being an asset class.  Even if you scrapped negative gearing tomorrow, there would still be people investing in property as a store of wealth, particularly as we move into a period of high inflation. Additionally, you don't want it to stop being an asset class, because you will stifle the development of new housing and cause a housing shortage in the near future... (That's a fact backed up by history btw, it's the same reason why rent controls are have perverse outcomes).

&gt;What are the differences between needs of a home owner vs needs of an investor?

Not sure what you're asking here, what do you mean by ""needs"" and who do you think is responsible for providing those needs? I don't perceive this as an issue of ""needs"" but rather financial risk. Both an owner and investor are assuming risk when they purchase a property. It is entirely up to their own discretion whether or not their ""needs"" are catered to when they choose to make that purchase. Perhaps I've misunderstood you, can you clarify what you mean?

&gt;Should both have equal access to property no matter their circumstances, weighted solely to how much money/finance they bring to the table?

When you say ""equal access to property"" are you suggesting property ownership, or state housing programs? If the former, how can everyone have property ownership ""no matter their financial circumstances""? Property will always have to be purchased because it will always have a monetary value and must be purchased. Therefore financial circumstances of the purchasing party will always be relevant. If the latter, we have that in every state. For those who don't qualify but cannot afford to purchase a home, they have the ability to rent within their means.

&gt;How could current markets reflect a disparity of needs being met between these groups when viewed purely through a lens of supply/demand?

""needs being met"" is not a market consideration beyond the effect those ""needs"" have on the demand curve. If people need housing, that puts upward pressure on the demand curve. if investors need ROI or stability, that puts pressure on demand also. If the demand exceeds the supply, there is investment incentive for more housing to be built which eventually puts upward pressure on the supply curve as both investors and home owners choose to build new houses, rather than pay more to buy into established areas that are over capitalised. Additionally, investors may choose to buy into overcapitalised areas in order to create higher density housing developments, if the potential ROI incentive is there. (The clue here is that if you distinctivize  investment, you will hinder new high density development in popular areas). 

&gt;What kind of effects does housing insecurity have on society?

Irrelevant. You're trying to open the door to the idea that all housing should be distributed by the government in some way. We aren't going to agree and I have all of human history on my side and ready to throw at you if you try it on.

&gt;How do investors propose to mitigate the risks they bring into society by introducing greater rates of home insecurity and socio-economic risks that come with that, when home owners reduce that risk?

Your question operates the assumption that you are correct that investors are responsible for increasing rates of home insecurity. Which is not a statement of fact in the slightest. If anything, you want the amount of investment to increase in popular areas, to promote the development of higher density housing in those areas. Something that FHB can't afford to do and something you don't want the government to do. 

&gt;This is a greater issue than supply and demand. We're not trading bananas.

Cute, but no, this is precisely supply and demand. The problem is that supply and demand are not a simple concepts that can be easily managed by government policy or monetary policy... The failure to understand that fact is precisely why the situation is made worse by both of those levers.",2021-11-25 13:02:13

[Yes, but no. They design many of their own chips but they do not own a foundry to make them from scratch.      Tesla designs and develops a bunch of chips. The two you are referencing are the training chips (Dojo) and the inference chips (hardware 3.0/4.0 etc). So training chips are really a bunch of chips all linked together running parallel processing to chunk out large sets of data and generate algorithms for the inference chips to run. The inference chips just run the algorithms. There is no training involved so they can be a lot smaller and purpose-built.   So back to Dojo. It is a bunch of training neural nets to make sense of the world. What tesla is doing is taking it from looking at a single image over and over to making a chip that models and simulates everything around it over time like a video. That means it remembers what it sees from frame to frame and if a car is obscured behind a truck for 30 seconds, it remembers that it was there and does some best guesses as to if it is still there. Effectively they have made computer vision AI that is 4D instead of 2D. It is a big deal. Dojo is also much faster and more powerful than anything else out there. Eventually they will be able to monetize it to third party customers for big data research. They also already have a version 2.0 in the works that will be even faster. They also came up with a new way to store data that makes it 2-4 times faster/smaller by using variables at 8 bit or 16 bit instead of 16 bit and 32 bit. This all means faster and more powerful capabilities to train.  On the inference chips: they design their own chips and are working with Samsung to field hardware 4.0. Hardware 4.0 is probably required for the autonomous taxi due to how much data it has to process. They are currently using both chips in hardware 3.0 to gonkulate data and it was only supposed to be one chip. This means that while they can run FSD on hardware 3.0, it removes the redundancy and could result in failure if either chip craps out. Hardware 4.0 should be designed so that they have 2 cloned neural networks running at the same time as a safety measure. Whenever the NNs disagree then that should get fed back to tesla to figure out why. It could also let them run things more easily on shadow mode.     They also design several other chips for the vehicle. This allows them to update firmware significantly more easily than other OEMs, which is why you saw Tesla less impacted than other auto makers.. but they were still impacted. Tesla should have had enough chips and batteries for Texas and Berlin to come on this summer and were expecting to make up to 1.something million cars and will ""only"" make like 900K this year. The other companies were looking at make less cars than usual and made even less than that due to the chip supply.  When valuing Tesla it ultimate comes down to what is the respectable P/E ratio.. who do you compare them to and is it even fair to compare them to anyone or should you compare single business lines? Tesla is comprised of 17 startups, all of which are at least somewhat successful so far. They will be making as many batteries as the largest manufacturers out there. They will have real-time insurance updates to price in exactly to individual driving behavior. They can charge for 3rd party charging. Their energy storage business is about to S-curve with the latest factory. Their auto-bidder can potentially reap in massive amounts as more systems come in..even if they only charge a fraction of a cent for kWH use. Autonomy is the real known unknown though. It is a trillion+ dollar market that would be pure profit. If you believe humanity survives for than a couple decades then you have to realize we will have autonomy. I think Tesla is poised to capitalize on that the soonest and will get a large chunk of that addressable market. It also blows all valuation models out the window when you have \~40 million teslas on the road in 2030 with potentially $200 recurring revenue per month and robo taxis generating 30-50k each per year.  Back to the P/E though.. if the populace doesn't believe they earn a high multiple then they don't get one.. if they treat Tesla as an AI robotics and energy solution company.. maybe that multiple stays high.   What I will say is that comparing them to OEMs is a fool's errand. OEMs pay billions in advertising, pensions, fines, dividends on products that rapidly depreciate and most have no recurring revenue model outside of maintenance. Dealerships and horizontal integration also kill profits. OEMs have to evolve or they will fail and get bailed out.. which is what will happen. Ford's most profitable piece of income this year was investing in Rivian for $500 million and having that be worth about $14 billion at IPO. They made more money investing in an EV company than making their own products. It's just silly and people that take these OEMs seriously fail to grasp how unwilling they are to change habits, nor can they even do so in some cases. Tesla made enough in energy credits from it's competitors to build 2 giga factories for free.. and oh by the way, because Tesla is so efficient, every dollar invested in CAPEX is 1.4 dollars returned already and will dramatically increase as these new factories come online.](/r/stocks/comments/r0glgs/cathie_woods_arkk_death_spiral/hlxvirl/)

[Cathie outperformed for like 5 years straight and now you're writing her off for having a bad 2021. This is typical of retail to sour on investments based only on the recent returns and not fundamentals. I saw another post that compared it to the Magellan fund in that it may outperform while the typical investor loses money by buying high and selling low. As an example, AMZN has underperformed in 2021, should I not buy that either?   Truth of the matter is that Genomics will likely be huge over the next 10+ years. Whether Cathie's fund or a more passive fund wins out, it's definitely something I'd consider a mega-trend. I mean, unless you think AI and increased computing power is going to impact every industry besides the one that literally powers our survival after a major pandemic.](/r/stocks/comments/qzqye4/cathie_woods_genomics_fund_is_down_27_and/hlohx6l/)

b_lett,"Audio Technica ATH-M50x. Really solid closed back pair. I use this with SonarWorks Reference 4 Headphone Edition (now known as SoundID Reference) to apply an EQ curve to flatten the frequency range so I can mix in them better. SoundID Reference is on Black Friday sale right now, the headphone only edition typically starts at only $99, so consider spending on the headphone edition as an investment for your mixing along with the headphones.

One thing to double check for when considering some of the nicer open back headphones is the impedance. If it's high, like 300 Ohms plus, then it may sound a bit quieter unless you have a strong audio interface or headphone amplifier to buy to go with it. So if you don't have that level of gear to complement those headphones, may be best to stick with a lower impedance set of cans like the ATH-M50x.

Lastly, if you need, go through a retailer like Sweetwater, and finance your payments over a few months to stretch the payments out if you want to aim a little higher. Best of luck.",2021-11-25 22:05:27
wheredidallthesodago,"Unlike the other lad, I don't think so on the basis that Liverpool are one of the best run clubs in world football at the moment with a clear long term plan, defined style of play from first team to youth teams, a proper world-leading data outfit, a brain-trust alongside the manager, and despite covid-finance difficulties have grown themselves into a financial powerhouse.

Anyone would suffer from losing Klopp and replenishing a squad through a rebuilding cycle is never easy, but Liverpool have all the ingredients and structure to progress through that well. 

People criticise FSG but they know how to run a sports business. They've got through the operational learning curve of moving into football for the first time, and they'll likely be competent moving forward too. 

Lots of people are looking for things to moan about and wanting to be pessimistic. All signs point to Liverpool retaining their place as a top team for the foreseeable future while accepting varying results on a season-by-season basis, as is normal.

&gt;Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that democratic nations should work together so that crypto “does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth.”

The India Crypto bill: What You Should Know


1. The new rules stated in the bill will discourage marketing and advertising of cryptocurrencies.


2. Out of a total population of 1.4 billion people in India, there are an estimated 15 million to 20 million crypto users. Additionally, that population has total crypto holdings estimated at $5.3 billion.

3. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of India will likely launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by December.

4. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that democratic nations should work together so that crypto “does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth.”

4. However, those in opposition of the bill believe that if India bans crypto, massive consequences will follow. Among those potential consequences, some believe the country will fall behind the technology curve, miss out on potential blockchain innovations and experience potential brain drain.

5. Additionally, officials from India’s finance ministry are considering a framework that would treat cryptos more like commodities than currencies.

6. Finally, in March 2020, India’s supreme court overturned a blanket ban on crypto imposed by the central bank. However, this new bill may successfully ban all private cryptos.

itsnotrelevantt,"No one else is being helpful so I will chime in... I highly recommend you do some internet research before coming here btw. It doesn't take a lot of googling to learn that Law salaries have what is called a bimodal curve - there are 2 modes. Meaning, the majority of salaries cluster around 2 points and there are very few salaries above, in the middle, or below. One around 60-70k and one around 190+. No, you cannot make in the ""in between range"" (amd have a healthy work life balance) STRAIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL***. If you could, don't you think everyone would go for that instead of Biglaw? This is also why many law schools split up their average salaries to PI and private so you can see real salary medians. 

*Smaller private practice or ""midlaw"" is a possibility straight from law school, but there are a lot less of these positions, most likely start $ lower than you think BECAUSE there's no industry standard like in Biglaw (they're not competing, they usually have a niche in a community) and you'll need community ties or ties to lawyers at those specific firms. Less positions, harder to achieve, and absolutely no guarantee of better hours, every firm is wildly different. 

MOST IMPORTANT TO READ: **More importantly, the in-between in the bimodal curve (90-150ish or maybe even more) is probably attainable for most lawyers outside of Biglaw over the course of their career because in almost every field Law comes with built in salary growth. PDs don't make 60k forever and they will top 100k or maybe even 150k or more depending on how long they stay in the field and where they practice (in my jurisdiction, they make the same salary scale as the DAs!). Government lawyers especially have fast increases. Take a look at state salary scales - they are publicly available for most states. In california it only takes 4-6 years for the average staff attorney to hit $100k. One more note - for most people in Biglaw, they will leave within 2-5 years and if they don't then they'll leave when they dont make partner. The most common exit option is in-house counsels at companies and corporations - many people go into biglaw JUST for these exit options because they are not achievable out of law school for the most part. These jobs are usually starting in that 120k+ ramge you're asking about... people take a pay cut to go into them from big law, but they offer work life balance and specialization. Food for thought.

I say this all the time and no one listens to me, but if you want to make money, don't go into law. Go into finance or something else. If you want to be a lawyer, seriously appraise whether grueling work for a few years to jump ahead in salary is what you really want, or if you'd be happy just being a lawyer and letting your salary grow over time while actually helping people with the law (not to say that Biglaw doesn't have those opportunities, but much less than govt or pi work).",2021-11-27 15:16:23
XquaInTheMoon,"So, honestly there's a bit to learn like real finance, DeFi also has a learning curve. 
I would recommend looking at some videos on YouTube.

But to start, you can create an account on CoinBase/Binance/Crypto.com/Kraken or any other big exchange. 

What happens there is that they'll sell you coins for money, when you have those coins you can then remove them from the exchange to your wallet (kinda like having money at the bank, you can get bills whenever you want). 
You can trust them or not (like a bank) to hold onto your cash 

At minima, just buying the dip and setting a ""goal target"" is a base strategy's that would work (like finance) say you buy a coin for 100$, you set a target at 120$, you sell then (you can also make this automatic) and get 20% profits. Don't wait or hope for the coin to moon more, it might, or it might be 90 the next day, so take your profit, and reinvest 120 in the next dip.",2021-11-27 20:58:26
mistypee,"So, I’m part of that 5%, and I’ve been in crypto for quite a few years now. Crypto is an extremely high-risk speculative space.  It’s way easier to trade now than it was a few years ago, but there’s still a steep learning curve.  

Women are grossly under-represented in every type of investing though.  It’s not limited to the crypto space.  

From what I’ve seen, it seems to come down to a few factors.  Women tend to be more risk-averse, and generally have less disposable income than men.  There’s also a significant time investment required to research any type of investment other than ETFs.  With women carrying a disproportionately high percentage of home management and childcare responsibilities in cishet relationships, the average woman with a partner and kids simply doesn’t have the time to do the necessary learning and research.

Also, for whatever reason, a lot of women just seem to have a total lack of interest in finance and investing.  Someone with limited time and money isn’t going to dedicate already scarce resources to learning about something they have no interest in.",2021-11-28 04:23:31
doinwhatIken,"frankly, there are at least a few interconnected points that can start the process, but the interlocking of them all tends to make it a steep hill to climb. 

Off the top of my head I'd say federally mandated living minimum wage that meets the standard that allows a full time worker to afford a two bedroom, with utilities and and food budget. Funded by taxation that begins negative or at the very least zero at the lowest economiic levels and builds as a proper learning curve does. with the sustainable middle class level being the spot where anything above that requires more work and sacrifice to attain. and Much past the being upper middle class the taxation makes it so that only those who want to prove that they can do it will take the burden of the taxation level.

Also close some of the tax loop holes where somebody can gain a net worth of billions but have the annual pay they receive be small enough that the person can not have to file taxes or file in amounts that are less than their workers. Literally if you are a filing for disability or other benefits in this country you are asked about the value of your car, and any property you might have, as well as stocks or holdings. That needs to be on the plate for these wealth tax loopholes.

Institute a national health care system and state funded educational opportunities that include apprenticeships as accredited degree programs.

Rent controls. And empty property taxing (with allowances for food and forest property) such that we resolve some of this madness that is more than one empty house for every person in this country that is homeless.

Fix campaign finance and eliminate the legal bribery in the US lobbying systems. make any person going into public office have their pay be based on the median of their voters, and their healthcare is the exact same as the populations. Make it service to the people again, not a career path toward wealth.

and subsidize sole proprietor businesses, while cutting loose these massive corporations that build monopolies and have more than 6 million in annual profits earned from other countries (they are no longer just an american company at that point and thus shouldn't be getting subsidized by the US government)",2021-11-28 12:14:28

u/aofjosajops: Keep in mind a large number of 20s fresh out of uni have a **negative** net worth due to their education costs and most won't have as high of paying job as you do, so you're far ahead of the curve.  I doubt you're being literal with the term 'poverty' but just in case you're serious I'd encourage you to look at the US definition of poverty (hint: you're nowhere even near impoverished) at: [https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html)

To answer your question: I don't think ""being rich"" will solve any of your dissatisfaction with your current life, if someone handed you millions tomorrow you'd just move on to posting about how you're rich but still feel like you've failed life somehow and don't know why.  Net worth is a very easy thing to put a number so is probably why you are so focused on it, trying to put a pin on what makes you happy and satisfied is much harder and that is what I think you're having trouble with and need to work on.

My advice would be to take a step back and try to take an objective look at where the sadness is actually coming from, what brings you joy, and how to shift your focus over to doing things you enjoy first.  A 3rd party perspective could help here too (ideally friends or therapist, but whatever is comfy and ideally someone you haven't talked to about this already and **definitely not family**, they're too close and often with too many expectations which are theirs and not yours.)  They key is really to figure out what you enjoy in life first, then work out how to finance that lifestyle second, and at least from what I can read into your posts you still need to do the first step.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as ""becoming rich in a few years"", there is no such thing without getting super lucky, otherwise we'd all do it.  I wouldn't worry about getting rich yet; once you work out the happiness thing, as far as FIRE you'll be in good shape with your current career.

FraudCommission,"hi i graduated with a lot of excellent accounting and finance graduates (all of us were under government or petronas scholarship). among us, the careers that we branch out from the mainstream of b4, finance, bank and consulting is quite plenty. Some became youtuber, marketing agent, insurance agent, teacher, bar owner, shop owner etc. you are not bound by your degree. if you want to become a barista, go for it. but do remember, you will have hard time going back to the mainstream as you have forgotten all of the technicalities by then, and it is already a steep learning curve with those technicalities.  Bear in mind, im writing this in a not so serious mode, bear the tone, english and formatting. 

accounting is a shit job. that it the reality, unlike many years ago, during our parent times, it was cushion easy steady job with iron rice bowl. due to the number of accounting graduates everywhere churn out and its ease of access to acquire its qualification, the supply is too much. many corporations still deem ""accounting"" is support function under head office cost, if can reduce then reduce. many other factors, but don't want to go too much into that. i would say similar things happened to engineers, but less pervasive. 

For fresh accounting graduates:
high tier path like CFA and consulting are stressful. 
mid tier path like audit is stressful as well. 
low tier path like yours is repetitive and could be replaced by a well coded PYTHON script.
wildcard path is management trainee, you would need to be cream of the crop among the applicants. very wildcard, no joke. 

so what choices you have? 

in addition to the mainstream from above, i suggest you think about being a teacher (private or public), lecturer etc. good work hours, less stress and more fun.
