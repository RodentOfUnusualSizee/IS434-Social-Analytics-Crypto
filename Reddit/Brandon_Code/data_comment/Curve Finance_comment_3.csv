adamfuradam,Thanks a lot. The MAGI is a tad bit over the roth limit unfortunately. Not knowing finance and hearing to all the buzz about Bitcoin and seeing my IT friends checking on Robinhood multiple times a day makes me nervous as to my financial future and I am beginning to worry if I’m behind the curve. Simple calculations tell me that I should be OK in retirement at 67 but you know how keeping up with the joneses is like. Thank you! I will talk to TIAA soon.,2021-03-03 00:27:56

Same with 'good' news.  Retail reopening, stimulus talks going well, online retail holding strong, the recent $100B quarters of AAPL and AMZN.

chanma50,"**Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s First Year Report Card: High Marks for Not ‘Steering it Off a Cliff’**

by DIANE HAITHMAN | March 3, 2021 @ 6:30 AM

*“Nobody knew that the whole universe of entertainment, and business, in general, would literally be turned upside down,” one industry analyst says*

Bob Chapek’s first year as CEO of entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. is largely considered a success for leading L.A.’s biggest public company through a global pandemic without, as one analyst put it, “steering it off a cliff.”

“It was the calm before the storm, literally, when Mr. Chapek took over this role,” said Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Chapek, who replaced Bob Iger as CEO on Feb. 25, 2020,  just weeks before COVID-19 came to dominate the global conversation. “The stage was set for success, but nobody knew that the whole universe of entertainment, and business in general, would literally be turned upside down.”

At the time Chapek took over, Disney had just launched its streaming service Disney+, which had racked up more than 28 million subscribers by early February. Theme parks remained a profit center, and seven Disney films had earned more than $1 billion each at the box office in 2019, including “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” and “Avengers:Endgame,” which raked in $2 billion and is the highest grossing movie of all time (adjusting for inflation).

“And then the pandemic hit, and presented every executive, every leader in every company, with a new set of challenges, the likes of which we’ve never see before,” Dergarabedian told TheWrap. “I just have to say I think he has done an amazing job.”

Chapek addressed the issue of his first challenging year at a Morgan Stanley virtual conference on Monday, including the company’s pivot to an emphasis on direct-to-consumer content via streaming, as well as a decision to continue investing in new content despite a pandemic downturn that led to a 45% drop in Disney’s profits from Nov. 2019 to Nov. 2020, largely due to COVID-related closures of Disney theme parks, resorts and cruises.

“We essentially had to make a decision: Are we going to stay the course, (or) are we going to slow down?… but as you know, we stepped on the throttle pretty heavily and accelerated, figuring this was the time to really make a giant leap forward, if you will,” Chapek said.

When Chapek replaced Bob Iger as CEO, he was already a veteran Disney executive. He had joined Disney in 1993 and most recently had served as chairman of Disney’s Parks Experiences and Products division. At the time of his appointment, Chapek was looked on by some as an an odd choice, since his main experience was overseeing theme parks, not movie and TV content.  On the other hand, some observers pointed to the fact that parks and products represented a main driver of Disney’s success in 2019 .

Others just trusted that Iger’s track record ensured that he had made a good choice, even if it seemed counterintuitive to many: “I think it’s a smart bet; I just don’t think it’s an obvious one,” Tom Nunan, founder and partner of independent film and TV production company Bull’s Eye Entertainment, told the Los Angeles Business Journal when Chapek was appointed.

At that time, it was also announced that Iger, who had been chief executive since 2005, would remain with Disney in the role of executive chairman through the end of his contract on Dec. 31, 2021.  Along with that title, Disney said Iger would oversee “creative endeavors” in order to “ensure a smooth transition,” leading to speculation that in spite of the transition, the old Bob would be looking over the shoulder of the new Bob when it came to green lighting new movie and TV projects.

In fact, Iger never hid his intention to play a role in creative decisions. Iger, who had pushed off his retirement several times, said one reason for leaving the CEO post was to be more involved in creative affairs with Chapek on hand to oversee day-to-day affairs.  Chapek signed off on Iger’s plan, telling CNBC it was a privilege to have Iger remain on hand for guidance.

Iger’s lasting influence was apparent earlier this year. Sources confirmed to TheWrap that Iger flew to New York in January to help mitigate conflict between ABC News morning anchor George Stephanopoulos and evening anchor David Muir.

The day after the surprise announcement that Chapek would take over as CEO effective immediately, Iger and Chapek held a town hall meeting at the Disney’s Burbank headquarters. They assured the Disney team there would be no big changes in the magic game plan that had led Disney to a market cap that at that point stood at more than $221 billion, cementing its stature as one of the largest media companies in the world and the largest public company by far in greater Los Angeles.

Once the pandemic hit, however, Chapek found himself at the helm of big changes. One was restructuring the company around streaming, led by the October promotion of Kareem Daniel, former president of consumer products, games and publishing, to oversee Disney’s new media and entertainment group.

The other was massive waves of layoffs, mostly affecting the so-called “cast members,” as Disney whimsically calls the theme park staff.

In mid-November, Chapek said he was “extremely disappointed” in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision to keep Disneyland closed during a surge of coronavirus cases in California. In December, Disney announced it would add another 4,000 to its 28,000 layoffs by mid-2021 for a total of 32,000.

Chad Fitzgerald, a partner and entertainment litigator with Kinsella, Weitzman, Iser Kump,  said that given the “unfair curve” of the pandemic, Chapek should be given props for not steering Disney “off a cliff.” He added that the continuing success of Disney+ offsets what one might call the Disney minus of theme park losses.

As of mid-February Disney+ has nearly 95 million subscribers, compared with HBO Max’s 37.7 million subscribers (though still a long way from Netflix reported 200 million subscribers).

“Disney+ has been a beacon for them,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s been great for Disney economically.”

David Offenberg, associate professor of finance at Loyola Marymount University with an expertise in entertainment, also offered kudos to Chapek.

“What Bob Chapek walked into is, ‘Everything in the company except streaming is shutting down,'” Offenberg told TheWrap.  “What a tough start — but he was able to find the silver lining. He took the opportunity to restructure when nobody could fault him for restructuring.”",2021-03-03 22:45:23
Canadiens1993,"BlockFi is better than, say, Wells Fargo given the returns, but remains centralized.  I've become somewhat of a decentralized maximalist.  The problem with using stablecoins on BlockFi for me remains the regulatory risk associated with entrusting a centralized entity to hold my crypto such as USDC/Dai/USDT/USDG.  What's to say the US Gvt decides to crack down on stablecoins tomorrow and suspends BlockFi's ability to use them and then your funds are stuck?  Or worse, the US wakes up to the fact that it must have a controlling stake in BTC/ETH (and other crypto) in order to maintain some ""superpower"" relevance and seizes all crypto held by custodians and exchanges like BlockFi and Coinbase (not far fetched...remember what was done with gold).

I prefer DeFi options like Compound/Curve or even Harvest Finance to put my stablecoins to work.  Of course, the risk there is code (algorithms and smart contracts).  No risk, no reward - but it's a risk that advances the crypto space if it materializes and rewards you handsomely if it doesn't.

jcceagle,"The way to think about it is that a bond is a form of debt instrument. You the bondholder gets paid a coupon (interest payment) and the principal at the end of the bond (what you lend the first place when you buy the bond). 

The difference between a bond and a standard loan, is that bonds can be bought and sold, just like shares. In this example were looking at government bonds. Governments issue bonds to finance themselves. I've shown the bonds issued by three different governments i.e. Greece, Germany and the US. The yield you receive captures a mixture of both the coupon payments that you receive plus the price of the bond (if there is a capital gain or loss from the price when first bought i.e. par value). 

This yield will also differ depending on how long the bond has to maturity. Plotted together and you get a yield curve like the ones illustrated in this infographic. Economist look at these yield curves to get an understanding of the economic health of the country, inflationary pressures and interest rate risk. That's why the movement and the yield curve is interesting.",2021-03-04 15:47:45

Blockchain is more akin to a vox populi democracy - one voice, one vote. And it's taking off in Asia with Binance and BTC mining pools. GT is behind the curve on this one I think, possibly due to it's distance, cultural and geographical from the centre of finance in NY. JP Morgan, Citi, Goldman, Bridgewater, RenTec etc are all into BTC/blockchain now. Coinbase is probably going to be, along with AirBnB and Tesla, one of the lasting great companies from dot com era 2.

I’ve been a pretty good cook from cooking for myself when I was alone around 10+ after their divorce when they worked late and my first love is video games as an only child I spent most of my time playing. Now to the crazy part. That’s my dream! I’ve always wanted to make video games, I’m trying to push my little ones to see how to build in Roblox etc and to entertain the idea about learning to code. I always wanted to learn to code but I felt having kids it was too late to pivot having no idea how to code and the learning curve and so many languages etc

So .. do it for us both but mostly for yourself! Never give up on your dreams! Anything is possible even if it takes moving across the country or world to get a shitty job at a company you love, or living in a smaller place or with roommates or budgeting whatever .. it can be done! 

I’m not sure everything will work out as you said above with my wife etc.. we’ve grown apart because I decided to stop eating animals over a year ago and it’s been too much to process for most people around me. I’m just trying to evolve and be the best version of me to be someone others can look up to or pull inspiration from. 

Back to fmla.. your fmla has a specific length and even the idea of returning to doctors as necessary to stay on fmla was giving me anxiety, try to give yourself a really quality break and then try to find some new structure that you can implement to stay consistent with your target and goals. Be ok with leaving your job behind, in fact had I known better I would’ve taken fmla and started looking elsewhere or training while on it. 

I believe in you! Chase those dreams down and never look back!!",2021-03-04 22:34:13
tylersburden,"Article Text: 

For the past 50 years, the Tory party had believed that high tax rates, especially on income and profits, were bad for the economy and had strived to cut them.

Today, this is no longer true: Rishi Sunak’s increase in corporation tax is the first time the rate has been raised since Denis Healey’s demented Budget of 1974, shortly after the infamous Labour chancellor had promised to squeeze the rich “until the pips squeak.” It is also a straight lift from Jeremy Corbyn’s manifesto: he wanted to raise the rate to 26 per cent; Sunak opted for a near-identikit 25 per cent.

The Tory taboo on increasing direct rates of taxation, a key ideological differentiator with Labour since Sir Edward Heath’s days, is over, and the psychological and practical consequences should fill free-marketeers with despair. Britain will continue its shift to the Left on economics, sinking ever-deeper into a social-democratic, low growth, European-style model: our choice will be between a high tax and a very high tax party. Labour will be emboldened. We will benefit from Brexit, but not by as much as we could have.

Sunak would love to be seen as the next Nigel Lawson, but the latter chainsawed the headline rate of corporation tax from 52 per cent to 35 per cent in 1984 and the top rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 40 per cent in 1988; he also simplified taxes while Sunak is making corporate levies more complex. Geoffrey Howe slashed the top rate of tax from a combined maximum of 98 per cent to 60 per cent in 1979. George Osborne sliced corporation tax rates, and took the top rate of income tax back down to 45 per cent.

Yes, the Tories also put up a lot of levies in their time – especially VAT – but there was usually a logic to their actions. They felt that taxing consumption – or petrol, or tobacco – was less damaging than taxing income from labour or capital, and they were right. They understood that there is a hierarchy of taxes: some damage the economy more than others. It is this economic and philosophical understanding that has disappeared from Tory thinking, which is fixated only on short-term politics.


Instead, much of the party has fallen foul of the Manna from Heaven theory of economics: that growth is a given, that prosperity and jobs just happen, and therefore that people and businesses can be taxed to ensure “fairness” or “equality” with no economic consequences. In this nonsensical worldview, taxation is a purely political choice, a tool to buy voters or signal virtue, not a driver of economic success or failure.

In the past, the Conservatives tried to keep taxes down overall because they believed in a causal relationship between a larger private sector and faster GDP growth. Johnson, sadly, is planning to increase spending permanently by two percentage points of GDP and taxes by one. He is a big-government Conservative, who believes that much of his extra spending will directly make the UK wealthier, and that is the real reason – not Covid – that explains why Sunak felt obliged to go against his own instincts and put up the taxes he did.

Unless he has a change of heart prior to the next election, Johnson will be remembered as one of the few Tory prime ministers – together with John Major, David Cameron and Alec Douglas-Home – who increased taxes as a share of the economy. They fell heavily during Winston Churchill’s second term and under Harold Macmillan, Anthony Eden, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher. By contrast, Blair and Wilson dramatically jacked up the share of national income confiscated by the state, according to the TaxPayers’ Alliance.

Sunak at least defeated proponents of the magic money tree, believers in the idea that budgets never need to be balanced or that money can be borrowed indefinitely to finance unlimited spending. But this doesn’t mean that corporation tax hikes and stealth income tax rises were the answer: it would have been better to find savings in non-Covid current expenditure over time; or even to break the Tory manifesto, citing the emergency that is Covid to raise VAT. It bears repeating that the main problem facing the public finances longer-term isn’t the economic scarring from the pandemic, but the fact that the Tories are determined to keep increasing spending as if Covid never happened.

Sunak’s raid on big companies will take corporation tax receipts to their highest levels since the height of the Lawson boom, when profits were artificially inflated. This is the wrong signal to be sending to multinationals and entrepreneurs, most of whom are still spooked by Brexit. The super-deduction for capital expenditure will turbocharge investment but only for two years. The UK’s effective marginal corporation tax rate is already higher than the Brics nations and all other G7 members except France; after Sunak’s raid, our own rate will almost certainly be higher, giving Francois Mitterrandand Jacques Delors the last laugh.

The UK already raises far more from corporate taxes than other countries, as Douglas McWilliams of the CEBR points out. In 2018, Britain received 8 per cent of its receipts from corporate levies despite a headline rate of 19 per cent. France collected just 4.6 per cent of its total with a rate of 33 per cent and Germany 5.6 per cent with a rate of 30 per cent. Headline rates are psychologically important, but capital allowances and other exemptions matter hugely when it comes to the actual bill, and thus firms’ decisions to locate their operations in a particular country. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s verdict is damning: the cost of capital will rise, which will substantially reduce business investment when the super-deduction expires. That can only mean lower productivity and lower wages.

Reaganomics is over in Britain, dead and buried, as is much of the economic side of Thatcherism. Paradoxically, Johnson, who likes to quote Ibn Khaldun, the 14th century Tunisian scholar who was one of the real inventors of the Laffer curve, has felt it necessary to turn his back on the supply-side legacy of the 1980s. Until recently, the Prime Minister believed in increasing the threshold at which the 40p tax rate begins; now he is doing the opposite in real terms.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

interflux,"Caltech CS here. Took an indefinite sabbatical in 2019 after finishing about 3/4 of the program. Here are my thoughts:

**Academics**

*How are the intro CS classes and teaching for a visual learner?*

Pretty good. Coming in, I had very little CS knowledge relative to my classmates, and the introductory classes made complete sense to me. They were well-paced, the concepts were well-explained, and the assignments seemed reasonable. The CS classes were some of the best classes I took at Caltech.

*What was the initial learning curve compared to high school?*

Huge - borderline incomparable. In high school I could get away with studying for 15 minutes a day and still get straight A's...at Caltech, I had to concentrate for hours just to understand a new idea introduced in class. But the knowledge gains were well worth the effort.

To be fair, the high school I went to was pretty ""soft."" If you attended a STEM-focused high school that taught curriculum beyond the AP level, you might feel more at home.

**Stress**

*How big of a stress culture is Caltech?*

Depends. There's a LOT of work, and it's generally not easy. I think most students spend about 40 to 60 hours a week on classes, homework, and studying. But the grading is fair (at least for the CS and finance courses I've taken) and there's virtually no competition between students. The atmosphere is almost exclusively collaborative. 

Actually, if you try to one-up your classmates re: grades, you will be regarded as a tool and a douchebag. Don't be that guy.

*For any bay area students that went to a high school like Gunn, Monta Vista etc. What are the culture differences at Caltech?*

I grew up in the East Bay but I attended a summer program with a couple students from Gunn and they seemed like typical nice, hard-working, STEM nerds. I dunno, I think they would have fit in well at Caltech.

**Diversity**

*I have been at pretty undiverse schools most of my life. Think 95% white. I saw caltech is 60% male and 80% asian+white. Is this noticible on campus? Does it feel very homogeneous?*

Yes and yes. Racial diversity is one of Caltech's biggest weak points IMO. They're working on it, but they have a long way to go.

No strong opinion about the gender ratio. It didn't stand out to me when I was there, but this is coming from a somewhat-clueless cishet male.

**Career Outlook**

*I want to spend most of young years working on start ups, in a quant role, or at a Stripe, Uber type company. How is recruiting for places like Jane Street and other top firms? How is the start up culture and how much access do you have to blossoming companies at early stages?*

I think recruiting by the kinds of companies you mentioned is great at Caltech, both for tech and for finance. My impression is going to a top company is pretty much the norm - I knew multiple self-described ""bottom of the pack"" students who received Google offers their senior year. Here is an abridged list of companies that recruit from Caltech, either at the career fair or via tech talks (or both):

* Google
* Facebook
* Apple
* Microsoft
* Nvidia
* Palantir
* D.E. Shaw Research
* Morgan Stanley
* Goldman Sachs
* Citadel
* Jane Street
* Two Sigma
* TGS Management Company

You get the idea. That said, while I think going to Caltech will get you noticed by top companies, you still have to pass the technical interviews. I've seen great students have trouble getting offers because they didn't prepare sufficiently.

**Graduate-School Outlook**

*Can an average caltech student feed into top 5 CS PhD programs?*

Most CS students I knew didn't apply to graduate school, but FWIW here are the graduate schools of the eight students I know of who majored in CS as undergraduates and entered Ph.D. programs for CS as well:

* 4x Carnegie Mellon
* 1x MIT
* 1x Stanford
* 1x U. Mich.
* 1x Cornell

So...yes? But there could be an effect of students applying to top-5 programs, not getting in, and going into industry instead of attending a ""lower ranked"" graduate school.

*What is the law school potential for caltech?*

No idea...

**Final**

*If given the option, knowing my parents saved up 120k for college, would you go to Vanderbilt of Caltech (with my above goals and concerns)? Price difference I think Vanderbilt would be 11k (0 with parents money) for housing and food, Caltech would be 77k (47k with parents money)*

Probably Vanderbilt. I don't think tech companies care that much about what school you went to. If you have a B.S. or a couple years' experience in the field, you can get an interview at a top tech company. Once you have the interview, nobody gives a crap about your on-paper credentials. And I'm sure you'd receive a great CS education at Vanderbilt.

Are you really not receiving any money from Caltech, though? Caltech is quite generous with financial aid, even if your parents have a decent income. The financial-aid office is pretty friendly - I think it's worth reaching out to them and seeing if they can work with you on this one.

Good luck!",2021-03-10 00:58:46

MrSnagsy,"I'm sorry to hear that this happened to you and your post is very helpful but this is not a Swyftx issue, it's the nature of crypto currencies.

&gt;  I was warned not to leave crypto on an exchange so I bought a Ledger wallet as suggested

You knew this and still you left a large amount of funds/coins on the exchange rather than transferring to your hardware wallet.

&gt; I can't wait for some smarty to tell me the error of my ways as the lack of empathy on some sites is overwhelming. I should have known this or that - but surely that is not the point. 

Unfortunately this **is** the point. If you are investing then the onus is on you to perform your due diligence and understand the risks, both in terms of market volatility but also the risk of loss/theft/destruction etc.

&gt; Where are the protections - such as insurance? 

This is a great question. Welcome to the brave new world of anonymous, decentralised finance. We are way too early on the adoption curve for insurance companies to know how this all works. It's the wild west to them so they don't want to get involved.

Even saying that, I'm sure it would be possible for an exchange such as Swyftx to take out a policy with an insurer. However, they would then be completely noncompetitive due not only to insurance costs but the additional development and operational costs due to the constraints and requirements put on them by the insurer.

People invest in crypto because they want very high returns. The trade off is complexity of the market and the underlying technology as well as the risks involved.

&gt; DO NOT leave cash or currency on the Platform!

Great advice but true of every platform.

&gt; I had 2FA so I believe the Swyft systems are defective and do not protect their customers as they should

This is an interesting claim and one that I'd like to hear someone from Swyftx respond to. 2FA hacks are difficult and it would be unusual for some rando Aussie crypto investor to be targeted. I'm also curious as to how someone was able to validate a new withdrawal address. Was your account email changed? Or your email account hacked?",2021-03-10 06:31:01

sdpthrowaway3,"Sure. I got in by shooting out 50 applications. Got some bites. Ended up speaking to these 2 guys for over 2 hours during what was a 30 minute interview. They liked me, I liked them, rest is history. It also helped I audited some carve-outs and had M&amp;A experience as well as analytics reviewing.

TBH its hard to get more finance oriented analyst roles out of B4 if you're not TAS or FDD. I got lucky because my entire vertical is either B4 Advisory or CFAs. They took me because they had a NEED for an analyst and felt they could teach me anything I needed to know being ex-B4 myself. Learning curve is pretty fucking steep being an old auditor, but totally manageable. My individual work hours are way harder, but I work a fraction as much, and it's a much less stressful environment. They actually care when I say something needs to push or I can't do a task.

Best part: My work is always used by someone. If a BU President wants to see how the US branches are operating and which workers are doing good/poor and why, he comes to me. The other day I got to value a potential acquisition for a company and the SVP for the BU sat with me to ask how I came to my conclusions and thoughts on how their book can help Financials vs how much they'll cost, likelihood of 3.5x RoI, etc.

Worst part: There is no passing work to the next guy. I am the guy. I have to find a way somehow and I hold WAY more responsibility than I did as an Auditor. Its kind of a failure is not an option thing. Sure, my peers and managers are more than willing to help, but I have to nut up and do. There is no ""just existing"" or putting in years to stay employed and promoted. If I don't hit metrics, I dont get promoted. If I underperformed, I am replaced. I dont see thes etchings being an issue though.",2021-03-10 08:56:13
burdalane,"I graduated almost 20 years ago, so some things might have changed.

1. I'm not sure how Caltech classes would be for a visual learner. I might have done better if I were more of a visual learner -- I have trouble thinking in three dimensions. For me, the learning curve at Caltech was very steep. I did not feel prepared for Caltech, and I had taken and gotten 5s in AP-level calculus and physics, among other AP subjects.
2. Caltech was very stressful, but collaboration is encouraged. For the most part, Caltech students more likely to work together than one-up each other about grades. However, I knew some people who bragged about their grades and how much they were overloading and Caltech being too easy. 
3. When I was a student, only one third of the student population was female. The ratio is now closer to 50-50 among undergrads. Caltech is not majority white -- almost 50% of the undergrad population is Asian-American -- and there are international students, too, but many people don't consider this diverse in the typical sense.
4. Top companies in both tech and finance recruit at Caltech. The startup scene at Caltech is not huge, but there is an entrepreneurship club. Some of my classmates, after graduating, went to work for Silicon Valley startups that became todays' big tech. Since they were early employees, they cashed out and are now VCs or founders themselves. My own career hasn't been that great.

5) Some Caltech students go on to top PhD programs. However, one of the issues with Caltech is the relatively strict grading. Someone graduating from Caltech might have a lower GPA than someone comparable graduating from an easier but also prestigious school. I don't know how much graduate programs take difficulty into account.

It isn't uncommon for Caltech alumni to become patent attorneys. I know of someone who became a trial lawyer after working in engineering and argued in front of the Supreme Court.",2021-03-10 09:42:12

hollow_hippie,"&gt; It’s that time of year, Austin voters. The redbud trees have come out, signaling spring. Also coming out in time to remind us that we have choices to make in the May election are people paid to knock on our doors. So don’t be surprised when a block walker from Restore Leadership ATX knocks on your door to tell you that Proposition F “threatens the progress Austin made when we changed to the 10-1 district system which gave representation to all parts of Austin.”
&gt; 
&gt; The group sponsoring Restore Leadership ATX opposes Prop F, the citizen-sponsored initiative to change Austin’s current city manager-Council form of government to a strong-mayor system. The group that collected enough signatures to put Prop F and four others on the May 1 ballot will no doubt be campaigning any day now.
&gt; 
&gt; Ellen Wood is listed as campaign treasurer for Restore Leadership ATX and she also donated $10,000 to the PAC, according to the flyer the Austin Monitor received opposing Prop F. Wood, president and CEO of Virtual CFO, told the Monitor via email, “We think the consolidation of power in one person is regressive. It appears we are aligned with Austinites all across the city, including AFSCME, business leaders and members of the City Council, in opposition to Proposition F.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mike Levy, a civic activist and former publisher of Texas Monthly, contributed $25,000 to the PAC. He said he had heard that people “across the political spectrum say they’re against it because they’re afraid (Council Member) Greg Casar would be the first strong mayor.”
&gt; 
&gt; Asked to comment on that, Wood said, “Our PAC is very concerned about the idea of anyone becoming a strong mayor. It is hard to understand how diluting the voices of the 10-1 City Council and giving veto power to one person is ‘progressive.’ Words like that are being used deliberately in an effort to obscure the reality and avoid a discussion on the merits (or lack) of what this change would mean.”
&gt; 
&gt; Other major contributors to the PAC include Cumby Development, which donated $50,000; David Roche of Endeavor, who gave $20,000; and former publisher Chris Harte, who donated $10,000.
&gt; 
&gt; Bryan Cumby, the founder of Cumby Development, said late Tuesday, “I think it is one of the most important issues that has come before voters in a very long time. I’ve been in and out of the local political scene over the past 30 years or so and I don’t think this is a move that Austin should be making.”
&gt; 
&gt; Cumby added that adopting the strong-mayor form of government would negate the city’s recent move to the 10-1 system of representation. The city can have a strong mayor without overturning the current system, he said, pointing to former mayor (and former state senator) Kirk Watson as a good example.
&gt; 
&gt; East Austin activist Frances Acuña is the campaign treasurer for another political action committee, Austinites for Democracy Dollars. Acuña filed paperwork for the specific purpose committee on Feb. 28, appointing herself to the job. The PAC intends to support Proposition H, colloquially known as Democracy Dollars.
&gt; 
&gt; The ballot language for Prop H asks: “Shall the City Charter be amended to adopt a public campaign finance program, which requires the city clerk to provide up to two $25 vouchers to every registered voter who may contribute them to candidates for city office who meet the program requirements?”
&gt; 
&gt; Those who favor this proposition say it would give citizens of less affluent districts a chance to participate financially in their district elections. The idea behind this proposition is that people who live in more affluent Council districts are able to give money both to candidates within their home districts and in other districts. An argument against this proposition is that candidates should raise their own money and not depend on city dollars.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, there is a new filing from a group called the Protect and Serve PAC. Charles Gantt of Beverly, Massachusetts, is listed as the treasurer at an address for Bulldog Compliance. Bulldog Compliance is a division of Redcap Curve Solutions, which states that it provides “comprehensive treasury, budgeting, and FEC (Federal Election Commission) compliance services for political action committees and other fundraising-driven organizations.”",2021-03-10 22:50:23

Fake_William_Shatner,"&gt; ""I was born with very wealthy, educated, and well connected parents, so why didn't I get the opportunities I was worthy of?""

That would not sound odd. Everyone with that background is typically EXPECTED to succeed. It's the pressure that upper middle class people feel.

&gt;Maybe it sounds weird because of how you define being worthy? 

I didn't really define it. In an objective sense -- and through the eyes of my mother, I could say I ""might be worthy"" -- if anyone deserves things. But spiritually, I think everyone is worthy. Life however, doesn't care. And then my sense of self bounces around from feeling unworthy to owed. I pretty much think that's how it is fore normal empathetic people -- but not for about half the people who think they are owed and deserve and usually say; ""life doesn't owe you anything"" or ""bootstraps"" because obviously -- they got the stuff. Having the reward to most people is proof they deserved it and were smarter and harder working. Confirmation bias.

&gt;Well, what exactly was it that you did to be born with the IQ you have? 

I managed to have skills in certain areas that look good on tests and communicated at a college level at 9 years old. Possibly the age skews the results. However, I was also dealing with ADD, ADHD and and some dyslexia. I think I'm not as good as most people in common every day skills they take for granted -- like navigating roads or remembering names. But, I have a couple two areas where I might be world class that they don't have on a test. It's an ability to think in more than 4 dimensions and creative problem solving. 

But, talking about myself this way is never fun, and usually gets a lot of shit -- because people think you are bragging but really -- it's about understanding. It usually sucks being at the end of any curve.

&gt;Did you do something that required more effort and determination than the person born in the bourgeoisie family?

Hard to say. I might have struggled more adapting to normal life and feelings of alienation. Maybe the family dynamic was better or worse than others. But I also had advantages. At times I had it easy because of the brain, but procrastinated like crap and had little concentration due to allergies that affected these things. Then there was bipolar depression ups and downs that were not correctly diagnosed for decades. At one time I worked a few jobs and 70-80 hours a week because I wanted to get ahead - and I just didn't know how to get the functional basics of business to be an entrepreneur. Want to solve a problem? I can come up with a dozen ways -- and maybe one idea would work. But, in hindsight -- I was right about a lot of technology and how it would be designed. 

&gt;so they rely on your resume, which favors experience anyway.

Well -- employers also want someone who JUST DID what they want. Meaning; if you were doing technical manuals for medical education software, working in finance, or suddenly shifting to IT or the like -- they think you are unfocused. But I've never left a job -- they always left me. Of course, doing the normal things that everyone evaluates you on is extra work for me -- and I was never used for what I'm actually good at.

&gt;Sure, likely a lot of truth to that, so what exactly was your method to get a large audience, or at least the right audience to notice you?

Blogging. Tried creating a few websites early on but that got nowhere because I have a tough time staying with anything beyond figuring it out. Doing a photo realistic self portrait getting hung on the walls at the college -- and I'm done doing pencil sketches. I don't really enjoy much of anything and don't want to do it unless it's the best. Which made it a struggle to keep pushing with 3D apps that were mediocre. If I'd had some mentoring in anything where I was working alongside the best -- I might be at the top of many fields.

Everything I do, I had to come up with on my own. Other than school -- nobody showed me anything. And everything I've made a living at was not taught in school.

So now of course, I'm at a law office.

I think it's more of a positive feedback loop where you are born on 3rd base, and the scouts are there in the stadium, and someone who knows someone will praise you for tying your shoe correctly. I think almost everyone with the same conditions will excel. We just don't admit it to ourselves because we are taught exceptionalism.

I'm actually different and exceptional and I'm actually amazed I'm not insane and homeless. I figure most people who are without the right outlet end up that way -- NOT the cream rising to the top. They are more hot-house flowers, more sensitive, more intense and more obnoxious than average. 

&gt;&gt;If your sons were instead ugly, would that imply they wouldn't be worthy of affection?

You probably know the answer; attractive people get more likes on Instagram. Just the reality. My son now has a few and he is absolutely corny. But he just doesn't have the confidence and ""game"" to land the ladies.

The second son is deep and brooding and actually could get more relationships even though he's not seen as traditionally handsome. But, you know, it's complicated in relationships now. They are super empathetic and we all know that bad boys get the girls. Everyone says ""respect"" and yet every kid getting to 2nd base is playing the numbers as a creep. 

&gt;I will say though, I hope ""the system"" changes in a way that can better utilize the talents of those that posses them,

Better yet to give everyone all they need. I recognize that there are different forms of intelligence and they are useful in different situations. My brain would be awesome for a CEO at an innovative company -- but, there's really not an internship for that. CEO's son at Harvard will get a phone call from someone on the board of another company. It's more of a feedback loop than Hollywood stars getting on a Disney sitcom.",2021-03-11 04:09:20

aimixin,"Very good post. A lot of the people who claim China is not socialist in my experience just don't get historical materialism. They view Marx's descriptions of a socialist society as a prescription of what kind of laws you should implement. They think the abolition of private property is purely a legal concept and claim countries like China or Cuba which have legalized private property therefore aren't socialist.

They don't understand that Marx's descriptions of a socialist society were not simply prescriptions for how a society *ought* to be, but scientific predictions of how the society *will* change as the material foundations of society evolve through the development of the productive forces. Hence, immediately banning all private property would not make much sense from a Marxian perspective, as this is not simply a *legal* thing.

&gt;“What merits our attention here is that our socialist state was established by a proletarian party that has a grasp of historical materialism and is dedicated to communism. With such a party controlling the state power, it is possible for our country to promote changes in the relations of production according to its own will. If, instead of proceeding from realities, we try to change the relations of production according to our wishful thinking, the result may be that the relations of production will go beyond the requirements of the growth of the productive forces, which may thus be disrupted. In 1958, for instance, people’s communes, “large in size and having a high degree of public ownership” as Mao Zedong put it, were set up throughout the country, and there rose the premature “communist wind” characterized by the attempt to effect a transition to communism. All this made agricultural production drop greatly.”  
&gt;  
&gt;— Xue Muqiao, “China’s Socialist Economy”

That quote from Engels on how private property cannot be abolished immediately is very good. It also says the same thing in the \_Manifesto\_ itself. Somehow people read the part about the abolition of private property but then miss the part where Marx and Engels describes how they would actually carry that out in practice.

&gt;""The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, ***by degree***, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and ***to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.***""

I also tend to think one of the biggest misunderstandings is a categorical problem in how people define ""socialism"". They read Engels's definition of socialism and then believe that socialism can only exist in the purist of the pure form. To them, when Engels says socialism abolishes private property, they think that means socialism must completely 100% abolish all private property immediately, and that any private property, since it contradicts socialism, must prove the society is not socialist.

But as Engels said, contradiction does not mean absurdity. 

&gt;“…contradiction=absurdity, and therefore cannot occur in the real world. People who in other respects show a fair degree of common sense may regard this statement as having the same self-evident validity as the statement that a straight line cannot be a curve and a curve cannot be straight. But, regardless of all protests made by common sense, the differential calculus under certain circumstances nevertheless equates straight lines and curves, and thus obtains results which common sense, insisting on the absurdity of straight lines being identical with curves, can never attain…True, so long as we consider things as at rest and lifeless, each one by itself, alongside and after each other, we do not run up against any contradictions in them…But the position is quite different as soon as we consider things in their motion, their change, their life, their reciprocal influence on one another. Then we immediately become involved in contradictions.”  
&gt;  
&gt;— Friedrich Engels, “Anti-Durhing”

While it is true private property contradicts with socialism, it is also at the same not true that a contradiction between socialism proves the society is not socialist. This is not how Marx and Engels used categories. Categories are not absolute and unchanging things. There is no such thing as ""pure"" capitalism where there is absolutely nothing within that society that contradicts capitalism. There is no such as ""pure"" socialism either. There couldn't be. Marx's ideas of dialectical materialism would make no sense if categories were all completely pure, because how does a contradiction arise and develop quantitatively over time enough to eventually lead to a qualitative change, if contradictions are not allowed in the real world? What is important for the definition of a category is not that it exists in absolute purity, but what is the dominant aspect. Many things will exist in contradiction in every system, but the dominant aspect of the contradiction is what defines it, which is what puts it in the category of ""socialism"" or ""capitalism"".

&gt;“What is the method of synthesis? Is it possible that primitive society can exist side-by-side with slave-holding society? They do exist side-by-side, but this is only a small part of the whole. The overall picture is that primitive society is going to be eliminated…In a word, one devours another, one overthrows another, one class is eliminated, another class rises, one society is eliminated, another society rises. Naturally, in the process of development, everything is not all that pure. When it gets to feudal society, there still remains something of the slaveholding system, though the greater part of the social edifice is characterized by the feudal system. There are still some serfs, and also some bond-workers, such as handicraftsmen. Capitalist society isn’t all that pure either, and even in more advanced capitalist societies there is also a backward part. For example, there was the slave system in the Southern United States. Lincoln abolished the slave system, but there are still black slaves today, their struggle is very fierce. More than 20 million people are participating in it, and that’s quite a few. One thing destroys another, things emerge, develop, and are destroyed, everywhere is like this. If things are not destroyed by others, then they destroy themselves.”  
&gt;  
&gt;— Mao Zedong, “Talk On Question of Philosophy”

Besides not understanding historical materialism or dialectical categories, a lot just don't know facts. I've met several who think China is like the US, some even telling me it is ""the most free market capitalist country possible"" despite private ownership literally only making up 31% of employment with 50% public and 19% collective, despite the fact that most of this private employment is in urban areas where all land is owned publicly, alongside most finance capital, which both are essential towards building any enterprise. Or they just buy into all the anti-PRC propaganda they see on television and believe it is some giant prison complex or something.

Of course, all these kinds of people I mention are leftists who dislike China. Rightists also make the same claims about China being a capitalist country, but it usually isn't due to a misunderstanding of China but intentionally misrepresenting facts to try and make it look like capitalism is what turned China is a world power. I even saw a PBS documentary (US state media) where they tried to claim that Deng Xiaoping abandoned Marxism to embrace full capitalism, that collective ownership doesn't exist anywhere in China but in one small town, and that there was no growth and development under Mao and it was all famine the whole time, and today China is a capitalist society in a ""post-communist era"". Rightists also make these absurd claims on China and you see it in a lot of western propaganda because it helps construct a historically false narrative that Marxism destroyed China until they abandoned it to embrace capitalism. You won't change the minds of those kinds of people because they are intentionally trying to construct a historically false narrative to fit their agenda.",2021-03-11 21:49:37
PrincePryda,"Hey, I kind of share a similar experience so I figured I'd share it.

I graduated with a 3.98 GPA with a concentration in Finance. It was my second to last semester when I passed CFA L1 that my Portfolio Management professor went out of her way to mention my name to the partner of a firm where she does consulting work. She wrote me an email over winter break telling me she mentioned my name, and that if I was interested, to send in my resume for an internship. All this transpired without me knowing about it until her email, so I was extremely ecstatic and grateful. 

Fast forward to post-interview, I get the job and because this was May 2020, COVID forced us to begin my internship at home. At first it was nice and easy - I was in charge of creating a weekly newsletter highlighting major fixed income events and curve shifts (IG/HY spreads). As time went on, things got a bit more and more complex, and while I was able to figure out most of it (with A LOT of help from reddit's CFA subreddit), I felt like I was lagging really hard. I couldn't understand the big picture when we spoke about a lot of things, and I barely spoke during any of our meetings (it was a combination of nervousness and not understanding enough to make insightful comments). 

At the end of the internship, I got a part-time offer and management told me that they'd be more than happy to reach out to their network and help me land a full-time offer. In other words, I felt like this was an extremely polite way of telling me to screw. It hurt, but I feel that we're learning how to be more resilient. Working from home is ABSOLUTELY a way harder challenge then being in the office - especially when you're fresh out of college. Don't be so hard on yourself. I worked so many late hours (often into the early morning) and tried my best to impress, but in the end I learnt that quantity of work doesn't always improve the quality of work. 

I'm registered for L2 and am constantly reminding myself to focus on the bigger picture. What are we trying to do with this information? How do portfolio managers interpret and act on information? Where can I find articles that outline their line of thinking? These are all questions I ask myself because I want to be a PM, and I'm sure with enough time and hard work I'll get there. 

I guess my point is - don't stop trying. Focus on the CFA exam - there are so many intelligent people on the CFA subreddit that are more than willing to help you, and tons of people of this subreddit that are willing to guide you (I met an awesome guy on here who helped me through my Fidelity interview process and managed to get all the way to the final round)!

If your claims department has an analytics, operations, or finance department that supports claim i would start building relationships there to figure out how you can get data. If you have any connections to any actuaries that serve claim or reserving they can also be helpful. From there its about finding claim data for your line. Getting data exports to excel are a great way to start for early beginners to familiarize yourself with the data and try some rudimentary analysis. If youre able to find data from the line of business you support you can use your knowledge as an adjuster/claim handler etc to build analysis you think would be helpful.

andrew991116,"Good questions! I'm a finance/IS major, so the answers will mainly be from this perspective:    
  
1. You still have to go through the same weed-out classes, since they are the basic lower division classes, but they aren't really weed-out for you, since you are already in the major. You can still get kicked out if your GPA is too low, but the GPA for a normal Foster application is way higher (like 3.6 I think?) than the GPA threshold for Foster kicking people out (which is like 2.7 or something I think). There is a chance of being kicked out, but you don't really have to worry about it unless you slack off everyday.   
(Just as a tip though, just because you graduated with a 4.0 GPA in high school doesn't mean that you'll get straight 4.0s at UW...speaking from experience! It's pretty much impossible. Don't look at college GPAs like high school GPAs. You'll probably get a freshman bomb, like I did with a 3.0 in Econ 200. Learn from that experience &amp; you'll recover)  
  
2. Alright, here's the tough truth. It's super hard (but not impossible) to get into a Wall Street firm if you go to UW. They simply haven't heard of you. Most Foster students will probably end up in corporate finance or some other firms. Now, this isn't bad, and the pay is still good, but I just want to temper your expectations.  
If you want to get into the Wall Street stuff, you REALLY GOTTA HUSTLE and network early. Apply for sophomore internship programs, cold message on LinkedIn, etc.   

3.   It's overall pretty solid, but the department standard is like a 3.0 curve or something, meaning that median grades will get a 3.0 GPA. I don't think this applies to the lower division classes, but it's pretty annoying for easy classes, since you can get a 96% and still get a 3.7 or 3.8.  
Once you get past the lower division classes, you'll notice that the classes goes from 4 to 5 credits, and are generally offered in two 2-hour blocks rather than daily, like some departments. You'll also notice that most Foster students don't have classes on Fridays.  
Why is the course load so low? It's because the department really implicitly encourages you to build real-life experience via stuff like group projects, which takes up some time, but the free time really also opens you up for other opportunities, such as clubs, minors, double options, internships, jobs, etc. Really use your time well and you'll notice that a lot more doors will be opened for you.  
Business isn't a super technical degree. A lot of soft skills are required but aren't taught in classes. You'll build those skills as you pursue those extracurricular opportunities.",2021-03-12 14:46:22

NPRjunkieDC,"This applies to small and mid-cap stocks too 

https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

Kid_Cornelius,"Wasn't the Laffer curve one of the inspirations behind Reaganomics? That alone is a pretty scathing condemnation.

&gt;Laffer assumes that the government's revenue is a continuous function of the tax rate. However, in some theoretical models, the Laffer curve can be discontinuous, leading to an inability to devise a revenue-maximizing tax rate solution. Additionally, the Laffer curve depends on the assumption that tax revenue is used to provide a public good that is separable in utility and separate from labor supply, which may not be true in practice.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Laffer curve as presented is simplistic in that it assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex, and there is serious doubt about the relevance  of considering a single marginal tax rate. In addition, revenue may well be a [multivalued function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivalued_function) of tax rate; for instance, an increase in tax rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis)). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place. It is possible that if all  producers are endowed with two survival factors in the market (ability to produce efficiently and ability to avoid tax), then the revenues raised under tax avoidance can be greater than without avoidance, and thus the Laffer curve maximum is found to be farther right than thought. The reason for this result is that if producers with low productive abilities (high production costs) tend to have strong avoidance abilities as well, a uniform tax on producers actually becomes a tax that discriminates on the ability to pay. However, if avoidance abilities and productive abilities are unrelated, then this result  disappears.

The update known as “Schnorr/Taproot” consists of three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), new code proposals to improve Bitcoin Core, the reference client used to run the Bitcoin protocol. The BIP #340 adds so called “Schnorr signatures”, the BIP #341 adds “Taproot” and the BIP #342 adds “Tapscript”. As Schnorr signatures and Taproot are the most consequential parts of this update, we will focus on them here.

Schnorr/Taproot is the culmination of years of work. The idea of Taproot was proposed by Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell Taproot in January 2018. Another Bitcoin developer, Pieter Wuille, created the proposal to implement the idea in September 2019. It then went through an extensive review and test phase, with 150 developers participating in a 7 weeks long review process in November 2019. The code is going to be implemented in the next release of Bitcoin Core, in December 2020 – but it doesn’t even mean it will actually be adopted by participants in the Bitcoin network.

The Taproot proposal builds on top of Schnorr signatures. The main function of Schnorr signatures is to make “multi-signature” (multisig) transactions, which require multiple signatures to be processed, and traditional, single signature transactions (called P2PKH, for ‘pay-to-public-key-hash’ transactions), look the same on the blockchain. The function of Taproot is to extend this approach to other, more complex sorts of transactions (called P2SH, for ‘pay-to-script-hash’ transactions) and also make them look like traditional P2PKH transactions.

How does that work? The fundamental benefit of Schnorr signatures is that they allow for key and signature aggregation. This means that it becomes possible to combine different public keys into a new, single one. Say Alice and Bob’s signatures are required for a multisig payment to John: thanks to Schnorr, it is possible to combine Signature A and Signature B into Signature C. When Alice and Bob provide their (so-called ‘treshold’) signatures and public keys, only “Signature C to John” will appear on the blockchain. The transaction will therefore look like a traditional single signature transaction from C to John.

#What everyday users gain from the update: privacy and fungibility

What does the Schnorr/Taproot upgrade change for the everyday user? In a nutshell, it increases the fungibility and privacy of Bitcoin. For a currency to be ‘fungible’, all of its individual units need to be indistinguishable from any other unit. The US Dollar is fungible because any individual 1$ bill is worth the exact same. One dollar bill could have been used to pay for illegal drugs, another to fund a wedding, their past use will not change their value: they’re worth the exact same. Currently, because transactions are publicly broadcasted on the blockchain, and because different types of transactions have different digital fingerprints, it is fairly easy to obtain identifying information about specific transactions. Being able to identify the past use of certain coins can ‘taint’ them and make them less valuable than ‘clean’ coins. This is a significant threat to Bitcoin’s fungibility and to its prospects as a currency. With Schnorr signatures, and even more with Taproot, all transactions appear to be of the same kind on the blockchain. It renders much harder to know if a certain transaction was a one-to-one payment (from Alice to Bob) or a complex transaction, involving multiple signatures, time based conditions, or the Lightning network. It is therefore a net fungibility gain.

Schnorr/Taproot increases the privacy of Bitcoin in a similar way. By analyzing a multisig transaction, one can also identify the specific multisig set-up that was used, the ways the success conditions of a certain smart contract have been met, the type of wallet that was used, etc. Obfuscating this information is a great privacy gain for Bitcoin users. But the upgrade doesn’t benefit only the average user.

#What developers and exchanges gain from the update: efficiency and flexibility

The upgrade also benefits two other groups: Bitcoin developers and crypto exchanges. Bitcoin currently uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures, which usually weigh around 72 bytes, while Schnorr signatures weigh 64 bytes. So the switch from one standard to the other already comes with a 11-12% gain in efficiency. But there is more because, as mentioned above, Schnorr signatures allow for signature aggregation. Imagine that Alice, Bob and John need to sign a transaction, as it is common in multisig schemes which require 3 out of 5 signatures. This means that 3 signatures would have to be broadcasted to the blockchain: that of Alice, Bob and John. The more signatures are needed, the more the size of the transaction increases, the higher the transaction fees get. So, with ECDSA signatures, the more complex the smart contract, the more expensive it gets to run it. By allowing for complex smart contracts to be executed by a single signature, the Schnorr/Taproot upgrade greatly reduces the cost of running smart contracts. 

This helps developers because it means they can write more complex smart contracts on top of Bitcoin without putting a heavy burden on the blockchain. It also helps exchanges and other key actors of the Bitcoin ecosystem because it means they can run complex smart contracts, such as multisig wallets and timelock transactions, for much cheaper. **It is expected that the compounded efficiency gains of the upgrade could make the fees exchanges are paying drop by up to 30%.** The gain in flexibility and efficiency will help scale the different endeavours to bring DeFi (decentralized finance) features to Bitcoin.

#Cooperation towards adoption

The new version of Bitcoin Core implements the code for BIPs 340, 341 and 342, respectively Schnorr signatures, Taproot and Tapscript. It does not mean that this new code will be activated immediately however. First, the code will have to be activated on ‘signet’ and/or ‘testnet’, the Bitcoin blockchains exclusively used for testing. Such a big change, indeed, has required extensive review and will require further testing. Testing is absolutely key to maintain the security of the Bitcoin network, and is a central part of the work of Bitcoin Core developers. 

When the activation code will be included in Bitcoin Core, the miners will have to signal (or not) their willingness to adopt it. At the moment, the sum of the miners who control 91% of the hashrate on the Bitcoin network and have expressed a firm opinion are in favor of activating Taproot. There are different ways to go about the activation process, the two main ones are discussed on a dedicated website. 

Even if the upgrade is activated by the miners, it will remain necessary for wallet developers, exchange engineers and other key infrastructure workers to update their services too for the upgrade to be fully functional. Contrary to what happened in 2017 with the block-size limit controversy, this time it seems like miners, developers, exchanges and users all see the benefits of working together to make the most of this upgrade. What the Schnorr/Taproot upgrade shows, therefore, is also that the Bitcoin community at large has truly understood the virtuous circle of innovation and cooperation Bitcoin itself is based on.

I'd expand this point: Board members are herd creatures.  Now that the first corporate entrants (Saylor, Musk etc) have made loud purchases of bitcoin, and since their returns are very visible, I'd expect a new round of cash-rich companies to follow.  This is still the bottom of the S-curve though, and eventually the finance subcommittees of public boards will be asking CFOs ""Why don't we have a few percent of bitcoin to hedge inflation?""

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

- Ancaps saying that markets do not have and do not depend on any sort of formalism (ie...statism). Centuries of capitalist thinkers dating to Adam Smith himself are pretty clear on the need for formal property rights, contract law, competition policy, and other things that today's main capitalist markets have either enshrined in law, or otherwise formalized.

Also sick of them saying that its monetary policy that drives the business cycle, when anybody over 29 has lived through at least THREE major international economic downturns that had to do with external shocks (such as the Real Business Cycle Theory predicts).

- Sick of dudes on both sides of the aisle saying that empiricism and  and statistical analysis to predict market behaviour is not a thing. I can see how people 100 years ago theorized that. What makes zero sense is how people that live during the era of big-data, where Bezos is the world's richest man, and when capitalist markets are dominated by Amazon, Google, FB, and others try in earnest to pretend that this isn't so. It IS so. 

- Sick of socialists getting all worked up saying that our current economic order is based on historical exploitation, as if there were ever a period in history when that were NOT true. 

-  Also sick of socialists pretending that there is no value in the banking system or the financial markets. As if Y = C+I+X+G  were not a thing. As if investment did not drive economic growth, and as if regional / sectoral specialization &amp; expertise in investments were not a thing.

Then, I got an internship in a job that requires a lot of dashboard to be built and really sharpen my SQL queries. My proudest SQL query till date is building a cohort analysis curve through SQL. 

Now, my firm is using python scripts to pull data from Google analytics and sheets and then loading them into a data warehouse. I am supplementing this skill with a Udacity course called “data engineering” as it is exactly what I’m facing at work. And think discount ends today. Hurry up! 

Just as an FYI, I was never trained in analytics as I was from a finance major. The trick here is to learn the bare minimum then learn the most via implementation. You will improve leaps and bounds. I support studying but I see it as a supplement rather than a means to get the job.",2021-03-17 08:24:34

CreepyAssociation8,"When I was five years old, my sister and I were in a car accident. She was 16 and pretty responsible for somebody her age.  It was summer break in the 90’s and my mom needed my sister to take our van to get new tires put on.  My mom managed a finance office and did not like taking time off work because everyone always depended heavily on her.  Instead, My sister took me along with her and her boyfriend, now husband, to get the tires put on.  When we were done we took my brother-in-law home and headed back to our place.  My sister hates country music, but I talked her into playing Boot Scootin Boogie on cassette tape.  The highway we took to get home from her bfs was known to be pretty dangerous, a lot of bends and curves.  When rounding a particularly bad curve, a truck swerved into our lane and flipped the van over and into a ditch.  After the impact, the first thing I remember was looking over and seeing my sister bloodied from the face to her stomach. She was trying to unbuckle my seatbelt to help me out,but she couldn’t even hold her head up.  First responders found me in the back of the van trying to get out and screaming for help. They use the jaws of life to get my sister out and broke the radio because that song was stuck on repeat and it was starting to freak the first responders out.  I was taken to a local hospital for observation and my sister was taken my helicopter.  The family in the truck was moving and a little boy holding a lamp was killed when it broke and punctured his neck.  That morning, my mom had to get a ride to work for my aunt because we were taking the van. She hadn’t slept well the night before because she woke up to the sound of chanting in the side of her room. She said it sounded like three voices all talking in unison saying take a floater and do it yourself. At first, she didn’t understand what the voices meant.  Her job had the option to work a weekend shift and a floater was if someone took a day off during the week and took on a weekend shift.  Hearing the voices scared her and she couldn’t really understand the meaning of what she was being told. When she wakes up the next day she feels sick to her stomach all day and has a massive migraine.  Around 4 o’clock she calls my aunt to come and pick her up from work because she can’t function any longer and her illness is worsening.  She calls my dad before she leaves her office and asks if we are home yet. When he tells her that we had not arrived she tells him he needs to leave now and go look for us.  As he pulls up to the highway, he notices that everything is blocked off and there were first responders everywhere.  He rushes up to the sheriff and tells him that it was his girls in the wreck.  They hadn’t identified us yet and we’re still working on the scene, so they turned him away.  A few minutes later the sheriff comes over and apologizes, telling my dad that it was us and giving him an update on our condition. It took my mom a long time to forgive herself for not understanding that message. If she would’ve taken a floater that day, she would not have been on the same highway that we had taken home from the bfs house.  The boy in the truck may have lived and my sister would not have spent three weeks in the ICU.  

My family always has weird stuff like this happen.  My mom was always very sensitive to things like this and so was her mom. I had a lot of creepy stuff happen when I was a kid and when my daughter was younger also. My daughter would become even more sensitive when she would spend time with my mom.  Used to scare the hell out of me.",2021-03-17 22:33:56
FearlessShock,"Honestly, since I started I've been using TDameritrade. I know there's a bit of a learning curve but it's not too severe and once you learn the basics of reading a graph (which isn't too hard from learning the controls/gamely of a video game) it comes pretty easily. Plus they have at access articles about your investments. If you're really looking for another alternative I would do yahoo finance. They have very simple graphs and break downs and offer up articles that lack the over complicated bullshit terms and say things the way the average person will understand

KeythKatz,"It's really difficult, because the sector is always evolving. One really requires a understanding of computer science (or at least software engineering), how the traditional financial structure operates, a working knowledge on the history of crypto as a whole, economics and game theory to operate at maximum effectiveness. There is no single knowledge base for this, you just kind of gain the intuition for it with experience and try to follow current trends the best you can, by participating in various discords.

I only got into DeFi in in Q4 2020 and learnt everything through being hands on and doing a lot of thinking about how the pieces fit together and how individual projects provide value.

To condense the basics of what I've learnt (but not everything), using only Ethereum examples: (Google any unknown terms)

(a) The ""base"" of DeFi starts from lending protocols. People have crypto, they want USD, but they also don't want to sell crypto as they believe the price will go up. This is where lending protocols like Compound and Aave come in, they give USD stablecoin holders a relatively risk-free return (because all lending is overcollateralised), while people with stacks of crypto get to borrow USD and take on liquidation risk.

(b) Having lots of different tokens is useless if you can't trade them for another token without going to a centralised exchange, because people want freedom. Decentralised Exchanges (dexs), Uniswap being the top dog, allow anyone to be market makers by being liquidity providers. They provide two tokens in stacks of equal value, to a liquidity pool (LP), and people trade into it by providing one token and taking out another. This is regulated by a constant product curve xy=k that allow swaps to be computationally cheap, and thus cheap to transact. Looking at the math, the more liquidity there is in a pool, the more volume can be traded for the same amount of price movement.

(c) Tokenising of projects. Projects like Sushiswap (Uniswap clone) realised they can attract value from competitors by simply giving out arbitrary tokens that are minted for free by the project, because anyone can create a ERC-20 token. Utility of the tokens range from useless (e.g. Stabilize, STBZ), to governance, meaning each token represents a vote, which may or may not be implemented as contracts (e.g. Uniswap, UNI), to actually earning a share of protocol fees as dividends (e.g. Harvest Finance, FARM). In the end though, the tokens basically derive value from how popular the projects they represent are and how many centralised exchanges they are listed on. Whether the tokens should actually be worth that much is up to you to decide.

(d) People realised that a lot of the tokens are inflated and useless, but because investing your money with a specific project can have huge payouts (thanks to (c)), you do it anyway and just dump the reward tokens. In comes the farming protocols. Projects like Harvest Finance basically help you farm and dump tokens to automatically compound your capital, the advantage being that you aren't spending $50 every day to do that. This lets people with little capital effectively put it to work, in exchange for a performance fee.

This is a simple model of the base layer-1 and layer-2 building blocks of DeFi. New developments happen all the time and fads come and go, e.g. algorithmic stablecoins, which was trendy from December to January, and currently NFTs. There is also a current trend of looking to non-Ethereum chains, but it's a chicken and egg problem. Nobody wants to leave Ethereum because all the apps and liquidity (b, very important) are there, and nobody wants to build on other chains because no users are there. So far, everything on the Binance Smart Chain, the current runner up L1 in DeFi, are just clones of existing Ethereum projects, and it's too early to tell whether it will be successful in the long run in attracting users, since there's almost no innovation occurring.",2021-03-29 00:05:39

I think the best way for her to understand my side of the story would be for me to let go of my fear of money and encourage her to take more responsibility. Right now I’m the only provider so it makes some things harder. We usually spend about 2000 a month on leisure items like eating out etc but when the end of the month is coming close and she wants more sometimes I have to say no. It usually turns into a battle of “you don’t trust me” seems like victim stancing to me but who knows. Before we met she never really didn’t any personal finance stuff so it could just be part of the learning curve. I’m being patient but man it is tough sometimes.",2021-03-29 12:18:32
TreeHugChamp,"NOTY, I will not blatantly take money from family while I am constantly tuning in my investment strategy. Based on my current models, I have been gaining 1200% per 6 months with 1% of my portfolio invested per ticker and using self hedged positions. Getting higher risk does not mean higher reward if you don’t know how to handle the higher risk. Building your portfolio isn’t always about having the biggest numbers, but the most consistent returns. If I continue doing what I’m doing, I’ll have more than that in relatively little time. I’m not trying to have an investment strategy blow up and owe family 7 figures.           

When it comes to high finance, I understand that not all funds are going to make quantitative leaps, but it doesn’t mean I can’t learn from professionals. I have learned from other people’s’ mistakes, other people’s successes, and now I would like to look for the same keys professionals look for. I personally would like to intern for a market maker so I could learn from them. People have different expectations of finance, but I feel that the more you learn and know the greater you can expect your returns.        

Did they tell you how to compare bid/ask to the technicals and watch for which broker is buying or selling stock while in school to better understand if support or resistance is likely to be broken at that time? Imo that is one of the more basic parts of investing that will greatly steepen a learning curve when watching t2 charts.       

Personally, I feel that my expectations of returns are grounded, but my dreams are grand. I feel that I have a better understanding of the fundamentals and what it takes to make money on a consistent basis.            

Mr PhD, before you try to berate someone else’s expectations for themselves, why not go through my post history? You might find that I time markets pretty damn well and run into significant returns(even while staying hedged). Good luck with your returns, and I hope to see you at the top when I get there.",2021-03-29 12:50:49
