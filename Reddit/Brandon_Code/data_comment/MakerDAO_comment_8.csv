estrellaglamdl,"I wonder if that would cause folks to switch to everything based on the Blockchain. If we're thinking about the future and the imminent 'Great Finance Migration' we have to leave no stone unturned. Maybe we could bring Forex/Tokenized stocks in a manner that regulators approve while ensuring that they are decentralized and truly backed by a collateral.  


For example, the forex market is worth $6.6T market and could be massively improved if provided the rails to DeFi and that would also cause DeFi to go mainstream. Onomy claims to be doing this (not live yet tho), MakerDao is a good example but is restricted to the $ (I wonder if they could have stablecoins for every major fiat currency).",2021-08-01 01:15:18

r-2-eth-2,"**Money Reimagined: Can DeFi Stay Decentralized?**

&gt; There's a lesson here for the folks who built automated money maker Uniswap as well as for other protocol developers in the decentralized finance industry. For some time, DeFi advocates speculated that regulators who've found ways to impose anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and securities rules on centralized, custodial crypto exchanges and wallets such as Coinbase would run into a dilemma with decentralized exchanges because, supposedly, there is no one in charge for them to go after. In a blog post last week, founder Rune Christensen said the MakerDAO Foundation, which runs the lending system, will hand over control entirely to a decentralized autonomous organization, also called MakerDAO.As Christensen explained on our podcast recently, the founders quickly learned it was impossible to launch an entirely decentralized platform from the start.

But what it also allows is for Celsius to deploy a portion of their treasury into further yield generating efforts.

No governance proposals, no new tokens, no new collateral types (only ETH, forever) to taint the collateral pool like MakerDAO and DAI, and even there are already multiple frontends by third parties, making it one of the most decentralized protocols out there at the moment. DAOs are at this point just a buzzword that means you have a governance token that gives you the right to propose and vote on governance proposals, and you have a DAO treasury that token holders decide how to spend. Not every protocol needs a DAO and it's not always a good thing. RAI is a stable asset that is similarly only backed by ETH and isn't indexed to any single fiat currency in the world. It's minted by reflexer which dynamically changes interest rates for RAI collateralized debt positions. It also has a similar goal of requiring minimal governance and being only backed by ETH forever, and mostly beinganaged by code.

DeFi_ance,"Are you asking short-term or long-term? I wonder about MKR's future too, but here's why I still hold it, with a long-term (multi-year) perspective:

- The devs were always supposed to give up control at some point and for MakerDAO to become completely autonomous and decentralized. They declared this was accomplished months ago and returned their funding to community governance, the future of MakerDAO is now truly in the hands of the DAO itself. So them leaving leadership roles is not inherently a bad thing, it was the goal.

- DAI is the standout success story for a decentralized, automated stablecoin peg. Every other major stablecoin is backed by a company and a centralized form of asset reserves. I could just be ignorant here, but does DAI even have any capable/rising competitors to its fully decentralized stablecoin role?

- If you think DAI has a unique future, MKR must also. If you think DAI could easily be surpassed by a new decentralized stablecoin, and deprecates DAI - which is possible - then MKR will fade as well. The future usage of DAI in DeFi is, for me, the number one consideration.",2021-08-04 05:01:00

* MakerDAO: 2% Stability fee for ETH-A, minimum 150% collateralization ratio
* Reflexer: -0,5% Stability fee, minimum 145% collateralization ratio   
(with the caveat that you're borrowing RAI, so probably need to swap that)
* Liquity: no on-going borrow fees, just a fixed fee on your borrow amount, minimum 110% collateralization ratio\*  
(\*not really, since all positions under 150% can be liquidated if the protocol enters recovery mode)

All three of those are available at DeFi Saver where you can turn on simulation mode, get 100 ETH for playing around and try those out to see what kind of liquidation prices you get etc.

Also have a bit of a Maker - Liquity comparison in [this post](https://medium.com/defi-saver/liquity-is-live-in-defi-saver-should-you-consider-switching-fa3d4584b6d0), so might be worth a scroll through.

PoL_techtec,"u/daodao-governance from Alex

とても興味深い質問だと思います。DAOは最近注目のトピックですよね！

私はイーサリアム財団の将来について特別な見解を持っているわけではありませんが、イーサリアム財団の役割はMaker Foundationとは少し違うように思います。Maker Foundationは、基本的には現在話題の「コミュニティへのエグジット」を実現するためにMakerDAOのプロトコルとガバナンスを立ち上げました。コミュニティは、オンチェーン構造を利用することで、MKRを保有する際のリスクパラメータや投票など、将来の取り組みを調整することが可能です。

そうした意味においては、イーサリアム財団の目的は大きく異なっています。イーサリアム財団は、イーサリアムネットワークの持続可能性に貢献（主にリサーチ、開発、コミュニティサポート）していますが、MakerDAOコミュニティにおける上記の調整をオンチェーンで行うことやプロトコルを管理・運営するような立場になることを目的にはしていません。

そのため、将来的にはイーサリアム財団がコミュニティの取り組み、とりわけ公共財への資金提供を支援していくことに注力するはずです。ただしそれはあくまでも、支援先の一つに過ぎないということが重要になります。",2021-08-05 10:02:26
ArcadesOfAntiquity,"Been there. Let me tell you my story and offer a little advice. Advice first.

(TLDR the way to succeed with crypto is by setting everything up to allow yourself to ignore it)
 
**1) invest with a long time horizon**

Stay in a ""long-term"" frame of mind when it comes to investing.

5 years is typically considered long term in traditional markets. So treat crypto as a 5 year minimum hold. In crypto 5 years can feel like 20. This can be a surprisingly exhausting experience. You need to be psychologically well-armed in order to...

**2) prepare funds for the next long term downtrend**

Make sure you are positioned for the next long term buying opportunity, NOT, and this is key, so I repeat **NOT including money you would gain from selling your current crypto holdings!**

In other words the only way to be sane about crypto investing is to be able to ignore it so you can focus on building investable wealth in other areas of your life. Sadly for a lot of people this would mean staying away from crypto entirely. I'm not trying to say I'm immune to this. Quite the opposite in fact. Holding crypto and being addicted to checking prices has probably damaged my mental health.

There's no way a person can really apply their best effort to building wealth in non-crypto areas if they can't learn to forget about the current market value of their crypto portfolio. Another key to keeping it off your mind is to...

**3) plan your exit**

Whether you choose to enter the market via a DCA strategy, a one time buy, or some combination, make sure you choose your exit price. For ETH, anything under $10k is a reasonable (i.e. conservative) 5 year target in my opinion. Many in this sub forecast $20k or higher as you probably know. But with a five year time frame, you are entirely reasonable to set a $10k sell target.

(edit: if you are a real ETH believer, set aside a percentage of your ETH as ""never selling"". You can use this to e.g. stake or take out a loan to live off of or invest with. Search for the Double Logris for one fancy example of this strategy.)

**Story to put this advice in context:**

Like you I was also pretty down on myself for ""missing the boat"". I got in around May of 2017. If I'd been thinking more clearly I would have seen the scope of the opportunity. I would have just gone into monk mode, sold a bunch of stuff I owned, moved into a studio apartment, worked 50-60 hours a week, stopped eating out and drinking, and put every bit of disposable income I had into ETH.

I didn't do any of those things, and instead obsessively checked prices even while at work. I attempted to trade my way to more ETH, sometimes succeeding, more often failing. In winter 2017, despite realizing that I missed a big opportunity, I was still quite euphoric when ETH price was $1400. Then I watched it go down, down, down, until at $650 or so I figured this was a likely place for things to turn around. I used MakerDAO to take out a loan (collateralized debt position, aka CDP) using my ETH as collateral. With the loan I bought more ETH.

Over the months that followed ETH went to $80. I had to periodically sell my ETH at a loss on the way down in order to prevent my CDP from being liquidated.

I lost double digits of ETH this way.

The whole time I could have been DCA-ing more, but I didn't. By the time the depths of the bear had hit, I was depressed, feeling like an idiot. I still had that memory of feeling like a genius at the top of the bull run though. I held on to that memory and the hope of having it again a few years later. In 2020 I bought as much ETH as I could risk doing.

Today I'm feeling better but... numb. It's a hell of a drug, I guess you could say. In some ways it's been very negative for me, because I performed poorly at work and put my own plans for starting a business on hold so I could check prices. That improved a bit over the bear market but with the bull back it's a struggle for me to keep things orderly.

Anyway this comment got pretty long but I hope it is useful to you or someone else reading.",2021-08-05 11:33:42

I'd worry more that your bank has crypto-unfriendly policies and they'll randomly close your account or block funds because some internal algorithm flagged unusual activity and then it's a nightmare sorting things out - especially if it is your main bank account. You could try calling them I suppose, but whatever call centre person answers your call, you probably can't rely on their answer - they won't have the authority (or know about) to tell you how the compliance policies of the bank will be implemented - so they may say ""go ahead"" and the funds will still get blocked. Or the opposite - they may say ""not allowed"", but if you ignore them, it might work anyway. 

If you are rich enough to have a personal relationship manager - or some bank employee who you can contact directly by name (not a call centre), then you may be able to get useful information out of them.

Number of transactions gives no information about the value of the transaction. You could be sending a test transaction on some ghost chain, or you could be opening a million dollar leveraged position on MakerDAO using Ethereum.

Both of those are 1 transaction.

nikola_j,"&gt;The minimum issue can be solved by using the lending protocol directly rather than DeFi Saver

Just wanted to highlight that Automation minimum requirements at DeFi Saver are exactly that - they only apply for Automation specifically, which is an add-on service on top of lending protocols.

You can use any lending protocol through DeFi Saver and never use DFS Automation and still have access to advanced leverage options (e.g. boost, repay) while not dealing with any minimums.

On the other hand, there are also some noticeably high minimums in the MakerDAO protocol nowadays, too. Namely, you can no longer create a new CDP if you're borrowing/generating less than 10,000 Dai. And for ETH-B specifically that minimum is 30,000 Dai. But these minimums are at the MakerDAO protocol level and nothing specific to DFS.

Uniswap - brainchild of Hayden Adams and Vitalik, is in constant talks with Robinhood, Stripe, and others to implement this technology in their tech stack

Chainlink - deployed on Ethereum

Compound kickstarted yield farming with COMP rewards - deployed on Ethereum

MakerDAO - been in the works forever, has some of the biggest brains behind them and is currently onboarding real world assets as collateral

AAVE is testing a pool for institutional investors to use DeFi

In addition to all of this, Ethereum has now also captured culture through NFTs - artists are flocking to this space because they can sell their art directly and without any middlemen, build a social media following in the crypto scene, and flourish because crypto made a lot of people rich. The metaverse is also slowly happening but still in its infancy

Network effects too strong, supply crisis incoming due to the merge and EIP-1559, Layer 2 about to go crazy with apps we haven't even thought of because we now have instant finality and low fees.

There's so much to be excited about and when you realize that all of this stuff only got traction because some  gigabrain devs on Ethereum built it all, you quickly realize that other chains simply can't compete with this amount of mindshare and absurdly bullish tokenomics.

cryptOwOcurrency,"&gt; Assuming that’s right, can’t maker owners just never increase the USDC cap and only allow ETH / other assets to raise their limits? Thus chipping away at USDC dominance? 

It's a deeper systems design thing. Imagine that DAI is going above peg, say it's at $1.02.

Normally, governance reduces the interest rate (stability fee) so that more people will be incentivized to lock up ETH and take out loans, flooding the market with more DAI and bringing the price down to peg.

But the problem is that even with completely free borrowing, a zero percent interest rate, there still weren't enough people willing to lock up ETH (or other trustless coins) and take out the free loans. Thus no way to print more properly collateralized DAI to keep the peg down.

So more recently, MakerDAO invented the ""peg stability module"" which lets people directly trade USDC into the Maker contract for DAI, to arb the peg down so the peg doesn't get out of control, but obviously the downside to that is that whenever DAI price spikes, Maker keeps taking more and more USDC on its balance sheet from the arbers.

The problem is that there's no way for the money supply (DAI) to contract, only to expand. As more and more DAI gets lost and forgotten, there's no way to confirm it's out of circulation and take it off Maker's debt sheet, so the DAI tokens remain ""live"" and need to be collateralized, even if they're in an address with a completely forgotten private key. With Reflexer, they can slowly devalue RAI, emulating a negative interest rate and sucking debt out of the system (and out of dead RAI holders' wallets) over a longer time frame, where this value is accumulated to Vault holders in the form of depreciation of the borrowed asset (so, you get paid to borrow). But with a hard target of $1, Maker isn't able to do that with DAI.",2021-08-12 00:53:03

diego_DFN,"&gt;u/diego_DFN any chance you can provide clarificatiin on this thread as per what kind of

Certainly. 

First of all, we need to slightly change our words style because the nuance can creep into our words. The *NNS* is a mechanism by which the *community* performs its will. The NNS is not AI, it executes what proposals are voted on. This is important because sometimes it looked in the thread we were dangerously close to giving the *hammer* agency while diminishing the role of the *carpenter*.

Second, it's worth quoting from a [technical blog post](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8) on the NNS:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; For example, it \[NNS\] can upgrade the protocol and software used by the node machines that host the network; it can create new subnet blockchains to increase network capacity; it can split subnets to divide their load; it can configure economic parameters that control how much must be paid by users for compute capacity; and, in extreme situations, it can freeze malicious Canister smart contract software in order to protect the network; and many other things 

What this means is that the community of ICP stakers can vote through the NNS to update the protocol and also update canisters. This description of the NNS may at first glance seem quite powerful (I frankly did not get it its intent in the beginning), so it's worth describing ***the intent*** of community-driven NNS:

The Intent is to be able to upgrade the protocol with the times by the wishes of the community. Some of the lessons of the crypto industry are baked into the kind of t[opics that the NNS accepts proposals for](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8). These updates include crypto

I want to zoom in to one of those lessons/examples, and the basis of this conversation: T[he DAO Hack in 2016.](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-dao-hack-remedy-forks-ethereum) For those not familiar, the DAO hack was an event early in Ethereum's existence where a hacker exploited a smart contract to ~~steal~~ drain funds from a DAO. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In the meantime, the Ethereum community debated how to respond to the attack. The DAO’s failure would not only mean financial loss for investors, but it also bore dire repercussions for the nascent Ethereum network

The end result is what was more unique: The ETH community did a hard fork and rolled back the state to a time before the hack:

&gt;The hard fork effectively rolled back the Ethereum network’s history to before The DAO attack and reallocated The DAO’s ether to a different smart contract so that investors could withdraw their funds. This was extremely controversial — after all, blockchains are supposed to be immutable and censorship-resistant.

But it begs the question... HOW did they roll back the state without an NNS, well the answer  is messy: 

&gt;Though it was proposed by Ethereum developers, they did not have the unilateral power to implement the change. Miners, exchanges, and node operators also had to agree to update their software. After more heated debate in public forums, on July 20, 2016, at block 192,000, the Ethereum hard fork was implemented.

And now we get back to the NNS.

Notice which people were necessary to make a change to the network: Miners, exchanges, node operators. Notice who is missing: *Token Holders*. I am not criticizing ETH, but want to make a point that all networks agree on the state by some group. In the case of ETH, it is (mostly), the miners. **One of the design goals of the Internet Computer is that the nodes work on consensus and compute, but it is the token holders who get to make upgrade decisions**.

So to answer your question: Yes, if the community submits and approves a proposal for the NNS to remove a canister (for whatever reason), then the NNS will do as the community wants. The ""harsh truth"" of crypto is that no smart contract (in any crypto network) is *truly* immutable: they can be changed by enough node colluding (e.g. ETH) or by enough community members in the NNS. That is the whole point of ""consensus."" Entities can agree to change history if they want (they do not for game-theoretical reasons to not destroy their own network's value). For the NNS, the *intent* is that such a canister-removing proposal be used in ***extreme*** circumstances (indeed, the DAO hack was very unique in ETH's history, and nothing that dangerous has happened to ETH). 

You could make an argument that Canister removals should have a higher threshold of acceptance by the community than 51%, maybe 2/3 or 4/5. I would agree with that to be honest.

I hope that makes sense.",2021-08-12 12:35:18

cryptOwOcurrency,"Clicking a dropdown is easier than installing a new wallet.

I don't believe you're grasping that Arbitrum is a first-class alternative smart contract network just as much as Solana is. From solely a UX perspective, whether a network is Layer 1 or Layer 2 is next to meaningless. Every time you say that users have to move their assets over to a separate network, well, if they chose Solana instead of Arbitrum, they would still have to bridge their assets from wherever they currently are (maybe the Ethereum Layer 1, or BSC).

Take for example a user who owns ETH and wants to bridge their ETH to Arbitrum or Solana. I believe Solana is planning to gain a lot of their user base from Ethereum L1 users who get fed up with the fees and want to switch, so this seems like a reasonable example.

If the user's ETH is in their own wallet, then:

* To move it to Arbitrum, they use an Arbitrum bridge, then switch the metamask extension they already have installed to Arbitrum via the dropdown.

* To move it to Solana, they have to install a new extension, generate a new wallet, and use the Solana bridge (wormhole).

If the user's ETH is on an exchange, then:

* If the exchange supports tokenized ETH on the Arbitrum network, they can withdraw the ETH directly to Arbitrum. Otherwise they withdraw to the Ethereum L1 and bridge to Arbitrum.

* If the exchange supports tokenized ETH on the Solana network, they can withdraw the ETH directly to Solana. Otherwise they withdraw to the Ethereum L1 and bridge to Solana.

In all cases, moving ETH to Arbitrum takes the same amount of effort and cost, or less, as moving it to Solana.

If the user switches to Arbitrum, they can continue to use Metamask, the same tool they have always used and are familiar with. Then while on Arbitrum, they can use Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Etherscan, Loopring, and MakerDAO as they're used to using on the Ethereum L1, but with low fees. These are the Arbitrum launch partners when the mainnet goes public in the next two weeks.

Just as moving assets to Binance Smart Chain has been the obvious lowest friction play for Ethereum users who want lower fees but don't care about decentralized custody, Arbitrum will be the obvious lowest friction play for users who want lower fees but do care about decentralized custody.",2021-08-12 22:23:29
kalbhairavaa,"No. IMHO.

Sorry to say but STEVE from rocket cryptos video about DAO is his misunderstanding of what makerDAO is and what DAI is.

The value of a tradable coin is determined by its supply and demand. Hence buys result in price appreciation and sells in depreciation.

This happens outside of the coins code and in exchanges.

The coins code mostly has no impact on the coins price.

Whereas in the case of a A stable coins it’s value or its peg is controlled by code which can changed behind the scene.

A regular coin like SHiBs code cannot be changed as ethereum smart contracts are immutable.

A stable coins code would have a proxy/upgradable mechanism, which means the contract code deployed at an address which we use to add it to a wallet is not the code that actually controls the coin it is some other contract or contracts that do it.

A stable coin also does not have a max supply.  It can be minted or burned based on how it’s peg is achieved.

In case of USDC it is the Fiat and other bonds , in case of DAI it is their code based on the collateral(read crypto) supplied while someone borrows money from maker. Maker pays you money as DAI and when you pay back the DAI obtained as interest is burned 

To do this with SHIB we will need to be able to mint and burn SHIB.

But all of SHIB has already been minted. It was supplied as a whole (495T) to uniswap.

So there goes the chance of minting it.

Now we are left with burn. To burn we would still need the SHIB coin which are with ppl and exchanged at the moment and not with the devs .

Also as per the site the uniswap liquidity is locked and there are no keys so it can’t be withdrawn either.


Regarding SHI, it is most likely a new coin as with blockchains that allow mining the coin used is basically minted to pay the miners.

So… yeah",2021-08-12 23:51:37

JacobLambda,"Other people have dropped in but I will as well because why the hell not.

Short answer is yes. Long answer:

Ergo is a EUTxO model based PoW network with smart contracts. They are associated with EMURGO and IOG who also work on Cardano but the two projects are independent. There's a lot of shared brainpower and research efforts between the projects as well. Basically the projects are close to each other and like to trade ideas around. This has led to a general approach that focuses on them building complementary features to each other.

In the grand scheme of things Ergo is posturing itself as a major DEX and Oracle pool provider for the EUTxO ecosystem (of which Cardano is the largest network atm). These together lend well to crypto backed Stablecoin operation so there's been quite a bit of work building out an incredibly robust stablecoin system called the AgeUSD protocol (can be extended to any other fiat currency as well).

There are also projects currently building cross chain links from these projects on Ergo over to Plutus so they can run on Cardano as well and bridge between both networks. 

This positions Ergo to fill the role within the EUTxO model ecosystem that Chainlink, Uniswap, and DAI/MakerDAO currently fill in the Account model ecosystem.",2021-08-13 01:25:38

This would explain why Tether FUD is perpetuated so much. Tether is outside FED control, so naturally it would be nice for them to try and shut down Tether. Our FED would want ""FED coin"" to be the only one with money printing power.

nikola_j,"Hey, u/ilpirata79 and anyone else reading.

The Instadapp team introduced the INST governance token in June together with an airdrop for all Maker Vault owners at the point of their snapshot, but for anyone to be able to claim it - one had to migrate the Vault to their platform and their proxy, which is a migration that makes you lose compatibility with apps that stick to standard MakerDAO architecture based around the dsproxy, such as Oasis and DeFi Saver.

Initially, you could have manually done the process of migrating the Vault there to claim the airdrop and then migrating it, but in the meantime we also introduced a more convenient way for anyone who wants to claim the drop.

The new option you saw is a custom recipe containing multiple actions, including: migrating vault to instadapp, claiming  INST, migrating  vault back to dsproxy and (optionally) swapping INST and potentially adding it to your CDP as bonus collateral or using it to pay back some debt.

This kind person shared few bits on how the process looks for the user: [https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900](https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900)

By the way, a small curiosity - the Instadapp team made a snapshot of all Maker Vaults and then had maximum INST claim amounts set for accounts based on that snapshot. In case anyone's Vault balance went down after the snapshot, that also means there will be a decreased amount of INST available to claim. In order to maximize your claim, this custom recipe will also include a flash loan that tops up your Vault for the duration of the transaction, but only if needed. ([Here's](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3ff360362512fae1f6fbfe2073460c020182832b0440685214b02ffa7d3a930e) one example of such a transaction, too.)

There's been over 100 users who already claimed INST using DeFi Saver, so it's definitely legitimate and safe. If you do happen to get stuck (e.g. get a failing transaction warning) - by all means reach out so we figure it out.

FruitBeef,"FYI I barely know what I'm talking about but I'll giive it a shot: EIP 1559 was intended to make gas prices a bit more predictable. Take a look at this [graph](https://makerdao-forum-backup.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/b/b47a329672ecfee63fb872f4c50567daa8894c41_2_690x376.png) , it basically shows that as the amount of demand increases, the fees increase exponentially.

Before EIP-1559 it was possible for the gas prices to shoot up instantly if there was a lot of demand in a small space of time. With this model, as blocks are consistently full, the price to include a transaction in the block increases exponentially, thus people will wait for the gas to come back down unless their transactions are really worth it to them. When blocks are below target for how full they are, then prices go back down pretty quickly aswell (for simplicity let's will assume the gas limit, aka the amount of transactions in a block, doesn't change). We can see post update that the average tends to hover around 30-50 gwei, but also keep in mind we were much lower when the price of ETH was bottoming in July. Without EIP-1559 theres a higher risk of having transactions get stuck because the fees change too quickly. Meaning you could send the transaction with the fee at one level, but in that next block fees could be 2x as high and your transaction will likely fail if it doesn't come back down in time.

Unfortunately you have to pay the gas premiums to use Ethereum, or have a significant amount of ETH such that the profit you're making is worth the gas. But you're in luck, because the ecosystem is about to explode with 2nd layer solutions. Arbitrum is set to make big moves this month, and theres currently sidechains like Polygon that have a decent amount of dapps. Currently its a bit of a waiting game for Layer 2 solutions, as developers will needd to port over apps (as simple as the click of a button in some cases), but more importantly liquidity will be in high demand when assets start to migrate to the Layer 2's.",2021-08-14 02:37:07

uh0h-itsfine,"I think dot &amp; ksm could be nice hedges but I'm w/ eth &amp; interoperability projects for the long run.

from what i hear BSC has no longevity soo not overly concerned w/ what their short term run does if they burn out or cant scale. not sure

polygon is the only scaling solution I've used so far and it's been nothing short of great in comparison to being completely priced out of defi on eth mainnet. i wait 20mins to bridge to polygon and mostly 1.5hr tops to bridge most assets back to layer 1. not perfect but I leave most my assets there in pools to mature anyway.

layer 2s are still early days, clunky is expected before it's smoothed out and that's why native users are rewarded for their early adoption &amp; studying. other protocols are already building to expedite the several day delays when bridging between chains/L2s to eth mainnet. (makerdao bridge, hop, deversifi)

far from mass adoption, hell regulation isnt even in place, but that doesn't mean innovation and onboarding wont still happen + got VCs and angel investors funding crypto start-ups + tradfi adoption (for better or worse). 

learning curve w/ all tech is usually a pain - see dial up internet, scratched floppy discs &amp; damaged external HDs, even driving a manual vehicle, etc. those who want to learn will learn, others will have their assets managed. either way we'll hit critical mass",2021-08-14 14:10:39
paoa08ce,I think tokenisation of all sorts of fiat cryptocurrencies are the next boom. That could blow up for sure. Forex is a $6.6T market and integrating that to the Blockchain would not make CeFi more efficient but also allow DeFi to go mainstream.

You can use MakerDAO, Curve, Flamingo, or any other DeFi project. Since Balanced is the newest, you'd earn the most rewards there though.

However, to downvote someone for answering the question is disingenuous. You would have likely been downvoting people for mentioning NFTs just three months ago, and those people could have made 1,000s of ETH for creating some NFTs or just buying some in the early days for cheap.

Can't even answer a basic question with a simple answer and a link to the actual project so people can investigate themselves without getting downvoted here these days. Then people wonder why it's so difficult to find information about crypto.

It's because any of the veterans that have been here a long time get downvoted or called a shill for simply answering a question and linking a project's website for others to review.

It's why I try not to be too informative anymore here. People only wanna talk about meme comments, and regurgitated the same ""coinbase sucks"" or ""not your keys not your coins"" posts every day.

civilian_discourse,"There's a concept called the blockchain trilemma, which refers to: security, decentralization, scalability. It's a trilemma because you only get to pick two. So, Ethereum's solution is to pick security+decentralization while accomplishing scalability by creating an ecosystem of blockchains that inherit all of their security from Ethereum. These chains are called rollups and can be effectively thought of as transaction compression.

This does mean however that there will be a major shift that takes place over the next few years, which I like to think of like this... In traditional finance, all non-cash transactions you make run through the federal reserve and typically take a week to finalize. For instance, sending money from your Wells Fargo bank account to your Robinhood account. Robinhood might cover up the week delay by crediting all or a portion of the amount you transferred, but it still takes a week for the actual transfer to finalize. Alternatively however, you might open a brokerage account with wellsfargo and send money to that! This transaction is instant because it's within Wells Fargo.

This is a strong analogy to the future of DeFi. Replace Wells Fargo with say Arbitrum One, Robinhood with say Loopring, and the Federal Reserve with Ethereum. In a very real way, the way things are setup today is like if everyone in the US was dealing directly with the Fed and everyone's individual accounts were handled directly by the Fed. Over the next few years, people will switch from dealing with Ethereum directly to dealing with rollups that finalize teansactions within themselves instantly and between each other over a period of a week. In some cases, this week will be covered up by a credit system, MakerDAO already has something in the works for this. But better yet, the technology will improve and that week will turn into hours. maybe less.",2021-08-15 20:35:57

Tenobrus,"In case you aren't aware, Dai/MakerDAO is a recent innovation that utilizes a complex collateral mechanism to back a stablecoin at fixed dollar value (1 Dai : $1) through entirely decentralized smart contracts. It requires the existence of ETH/some other more volatile crypto market to use for that collateral, but the end result is a technology that you can use just as conveniently for transactions as existing cryptocurrencies, but with nearly 0 volatility from the $1 peg. This bypasses both the centralization concerns about existing stablecoins like Tether, and the volatility concerns the average person would have, while being fully verifiable by anyone who wants to read the smart contracts.",2021-08-16 03:58:27

cryptOwOcurrency,"I'm going to ignore the parts where you accuse me of trolling and BSing and assume you may still want to engage in a good faith argument.

&gt; Any logical person would say that this trade-off is obviously not worth it when comparing mass complaints about ETH tx fees for a year to a random person who might have found a problem on a month old smart contract testnet based on what a handful of other developers have produced so far. Nobody wants that choice. It's a huge stretch trying to argue that somehow failing transactions is a good thing.

Just choose not to use shared state.

&gt; Prove it. You claiming that ETH can scale better based on a guess and that Cardano will have similar problems based on nothing means absolutely nothing.

These are fundamental blockchain scaling problems that underpin *every* chain. Do you know what state growth is? Again, Ethereum has a plan to tackle it, I haven't seen any plan from Cardano.

&gt; IOHK claims Cardano can scale much better and when Ouroboros is optimized they can theoretically reach 1000 tps. Besides that the eUTxO model (which is very different when it comes to scalability) is easier to scale and Hydra will reduce fees to near zero.

Ethereum team says all sorts of nice things about their scaling methods too. Anyone can get pie in the sky if they look far enough into the future. The rollups + data sharding roadmap can bring Ethereum to 100k+ TPS according to Vitalik.

I contest that eUTxO is easier to scale in practice, even though it may be more parallelizable in theory. Fact is that Ethereum team is scaling too.

&gt; The thread you linked shows it will be much less of a problem. But oke.

It shows that Cardano and Ethereum are on level ground, because all the arguments in the thread apply to both.

&gt; And you are again assuming nobody can build a DEX without a centralized matcher based on experience of a handful of devs on a month old testnet. That's quite an assumption.

You assuming that an architecture breakthrough will come out of the radio silence is bold.

&gt; Lol. Are you trolling? Here, so everyone can read for themselves what Vitalik says and not be fooled by some bs language you are using

Adding key rotation, which isn't inherently related to delegation but allows delegations systems to be built more efficiently than they can already be built today (without the exit delay), is totally different than hard-coding a delegation system into the protocol. But I think we are too far into the semantics on this point.

&gt; I really feel like you are just trying to bs people. Stoner Cats buyers just lost $800k in failed transactions because of an issue with the minting contract. OBVIOUSLY this doesn't happen on Cardano because it has native assets and that makes it superior. You have less complexity and risk. An ERC20 (or others) smart contract can fail, native assets can't.

ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens cannot fail if you copy-paste a highly audited OpenZeppelin library and use that. The reason they failed was due to custom logic. On Cardano if you want your token to use custom logic, that is just as prone to failure as if you write custom logic on Ethereum.

&gt; Ask the many people who complain. The last complaint I randomly saw was someone trying to buy an NFT and didn't have money to pay a $80 fee and therefor missed the opportunity to make $1000 with the NFT.

That's how the fee auction market works. The chain is at FULL full capacity. A luxury that Cardano doesn't have to deal with right now.

&gt; When EIP-1559 was live transaction fees also went to ridiculous levels and everyone was complaining about it on social media.

Due to price volatility increasing transaction demand, unrelated to 1559.

&gt; People have been saying L2 solutions are here and solve all ETHs problems for a year now, yet I see complaints everywhere.

People complain about things. The big boy L2, Arbitrum, is launching in 2 weeks.

&gt; If it is all so easy and convenient then why is not every project switching immediately.

They are.

""Operationally, with over 250 teams requesting to come online for the developer mainnet, it’s going to take us into next week before we can onboard everyone, but this process is underway.""

The big ones, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Etherscan, Loopring, and MakerDAO, will be there at launch among others.

&gt; The inconvenient part is that they are all on different L2 solutions and it becomes a mess.

For the most part they are all on *all* L2 solutions, survival of the fittest.

&gt; They are obviously prioritizing the merge over sharding because sharding is much harder than they thought and they fell back to rollups to make things easy for them. ""Developers are focusing their efforts on this transition, and minimizing additional features that could delay this goal."". What a shitty philosophy you can blame all your mistakes on.

We'll have to disagree on this one.

&gt; Only 5% is staked.

And due to slashing protections, it's enough.

&gt; And stakers lost about $150M because they were forced to use a 3rd party to stake and stake keys were lost by these parties.

This speaks to that pool's architecture, not the Ethereum chain. It's perfectly possible to have a noncustodial withdrawal scheme at least since recently, see Lido.

&gt; you are obviously very biased

Good expository writing tries to present as many facts as possible and let the reader draw their own conclusions. What if I say I'm not biased and you're the one who's biased? Either of us can say anything, all that matters in the end are facts and opinions, which I am doing my best to present.

&gt; most of your criticism is based on very little experience with Plutus/eUTxO

On the contrary, my criticism is based on knowledge of eUTxO. I have an admittedly smaller amount of experience with Plutus, but nothing we've talked about has really brought Plutus into the conversation.

Lets say it is via eth.

So. Do you just sell most of it and pay tax? Or do you keep your eth and let it act as collateral so you can realize your gains a different way? Here is another quote I have saved below:




""When you're rich, you use other people's money to start projects. If your project kicks off, you end up not spending anything and only pay interest on the loan you took with other people's money. If your project fails, you just owe the money. Here's how:

Lets say you want to create a new marketing agency in New York City next year. You plan on staying there in your yacht. The office will cost $1M for the year. What you do is you go to Dutchbank and say, ""Hey I need a $1M loan. I will use my yacht as collateral. My yacht is worth $45M."" They actually say yes under the condition that the boat isn't allowed to leave port from near NYC, and you have to pay it back within 10 years. After 10 years they can sell the yacht and get back the $1M loan if they need to, pay you back $40M, and pocket $4M. You agree. Why? If your agency generates more than $2M, you can pay back the loan and pay next year's rent. At the end, you start you business and you didn't spend any money at all. You just couldn't move the boat.

These are called collateralized debt obligations. This is how MakerDAO works. The only difference is instead of a boat, you collateralized ETH. MakerDAO gives you Dai and your Eth gets parked. If you borrow too much without paying it back, it will sell your Eth. If you pay back the Dai you borrowed, you will get back your Eth. Because each Dai was created with an overcollateralized obligation, there's strong confidence that your Dai is at least worth $1 worth of Eth. The other nice part about MakerDAO is it's a robot bank. Anyone in the world can get any amount of a loan like this as long as they pay bank the Dai.""",2021-08-20 00:28:04

nikola_j,"Hey, u/TheCryptosAndBloods. I'll copy over a reply that I posted in the MakerDAO subreddit a few days ago for someone asking similar questions:

The Instadapp team introduced the INST governance token in June together with an airdrop for all Maker Vault owners at the point of their snapshot, but for anyone to be able to claim it - one had to migrate the Vault to their platform and their proxy, which is a migration that makes you lose compatibility with apps that stick to standard MakerDAO architecture based around the dsproxy, such as Oasis and DeFi Saver.

Initially, you could have manually done the process of migrating the Vault there to claim the airdrop and then migrating it, but in the meantime we also introduced a more convenient way for anyone who wants to claim the drop.

The new option you saw is a custom recipe containing multiple actions, including: migrating vault to instadapp, claiming  INST, migrating  vault back to dsproxy and (optionally) swapping INST and potentially adding it to your CDP as bonus collateral or using it to pay back some debt.

This kind person shared few bits on how the process looks for the user: [https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900](https://twitter.com/ncerovac/status/1422212747681488900)

Here are some random example transactions that complete this process:

* [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71b1d7a12a46ef875de217243e9342a9f67e11ad3e52a43bbb91cc78b52954ed/advanced](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x71b1d7a12a46ef875de217243e9342a9f67e11ad3e52a43bbb91cc78b52954ed/advanced)

* [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bb750540ab466b29d293f1ae94511a2e8a4d37a026c95680be6852f90eb2b0e/advanced](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bb750540ab466b29d293f1ae94511a2e8a4d37a026c95680be6852f90eb2b0e/advanced)

By the way, a small curiosity - the Instadapp team made a snapshot of all Maker Vaults and then had maximum INST claim amounts set for accounts based on that snapshot. In case anyone's Vault balance went down after the snapshot, that also means there will be a decreased amount of INST available to claim. In order to maximize your claim, this custom recipe will also include a flash loan that tops up your Vault for the duration of the transaction, but only if needed. ([Here's](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3ff360362512fae1f6fbfe2073460c020182832b0440685214b02ffa7d3a930e) one example of such a transaction, too.)

There's been over 100 users who already claimed INST using DeFi Saver, so it's definitely legitimate and safe. If you do happen to get stuck (e.g. get a failing transaction warning) - by all means reach out so we figure it out.

In terms of the number of unique CDPs in MakerDAO - that's currently at \~25,350 (can be checked at [https://defiexplore.com/stats](https://defiexplore.com/stats)). And some of them are empty and/or abandoned already, of course.

Also, just to clarify this a bit:

&gt;my ETH in a DefiSaver CDP

That CDP is still in the same MakerDAO protocol just as any other. You're just accessing it through DFS and you're potentially using automation services which are built to work on top of the Maker protocol. But if you go over to Oasis, Zerion or any other app supporting Maker CDPs you'll see your position show up just the same.

Instadapp also builds on the Maker protocol, though their modifications go a bit further, since there CDPs sit on their DSA2 proxies where only Instadapp functions can be executed (it's not permissionless as the standard dsproxy that Maker uses by default).",2021-08-20 01:08:55

cryptOwOcurrency,"&gt; They probably meant algo stablecoin.

They should have said algo stablecoin.

&gt; By the way, have you looked into how their stablecoin works? I took a glance at it and it seems like they are backing $1 stablecoin with some amount of volatile crypto (like ADA), and if ADA crashes they sell reserve tokens to make up the difference or something.

That's spot on. It's like if MakerDAO were to skip the whole part about trying to always stay fully collateralized, and go right to the part where they mint more and more MKR as the price of the collateral drops. Really naive stablecoin design based on what I know about it, to me it looks like some of the failed attempts to create stablecoins before MakerDAO ([like Nubits](https://medium.com/reserve-currency/the-end-of-a-stablecoin-the-case-of-nubits-dd1f0fb427a9)), but time will tell.

&gt; Algo stablecoins are like trying to break the rules of physics in my opinion. You simply cannot back $1 of a stablecoin by &lt;$1 of assets consistently.

Back before MakerDAO (so, 2016-ish), I used to vehemently believe that stablecoins were impossible without being backed in a direct custodial way by the same asset they were tracking. MakerDAO's design showed me that you can back a stable asset by a volatile collateral through a system of debt positions. So since I know there can be breakthroughs that I'm not expecting, I haven't completely ruled out the possibility of a viable undercollateralized stablecoin, especially since that's basically what most fiat currencies are and it seems to work for them. Something bond-based, I remember reading about one attempt at one point but I can't remember what it was called.",2021-08-20 01:51:50

JacobLambda,"The implementation has them crypto-collateralised which is minorly different from but similar to being crypto-backed.

What this means is that with MakerDAO you put down a collateral for a DAI loan while with say SigmaUSD(one Djed impl) you instead trade your crypto for SigRSV (the reserve token) which generates ERG (Ergo's base currency) and the protocol then uses those reserves to back SigUSD's exchange value.

The explanation used to compare the two in the paper I think summarises it best:

&gt; Crypto-collateralized stablecoins, of which DAI is currently the most prominent example, are similar to crypto-backed stablecoins, with the subtle but important
difference, however, that cryptocurrencies are used to provide collateral for stablecoin-denominated loans instead of reserves. Similarly to how a house that serves as collateral
in a mortgage does not count as reserves in the bank that is providing the loan, the
collateral provided for the issuance of a crypto-collateralized stablecoin does not count
as reserve. Due to the lack of reserves, pure crypto-collateralized stablecoins resemble
an extreme form of fractional reserve banking (with a fraction of 0%). Unlike commercial bank money (i.e. money in a bank account), which can be exchanged at any time by anyone holding it for central bank money by withdrawing cash from the bank’s
reserves, crypto-collateralized stablecoins cannot be exchanged for anything by withdrawing from the stablecoin contract’s reserves, simply because there are no reserves.
When interacting with the contract, users can only use stablecoins to repay their own loans and recover their own collateral or to bid in auctions for liquidated collateral from others.",2021-08-20 03:47:28

I already posted a quote I found and saved.... but I will drop it here because I am confident many will DCA through the Crypto Winter and next Bull Run may have truly life changing money. We may not need to just sell to realize our gains. Maybe some will feel this is the best course but there are other ways.




**These are called collateralized debt obligations. This is how MakerDAO works. The only difference is instead of a boat, you collateralized ETH. MakerDAO gives you Dai and your Eth gets parked. If you borrow too much without paying it back, it will sell your Eth. If you pay back the Dai you borrowed, you will get back your Eth. Because each Dai was created with an overcollateralized obligation, there's strong confidence that your Dai is at least worth $1 worth of Eth. The other nice part about MakerDAO is it's a robot bank. Anyone in the world can get any amount of a loan like this as long as they pay bank the Dai.""**",2021-08-20 04:37:22

JacobLambda,"The short answer is that they have some pretty cool tech and are positioning themselves to serve the role of Chainlink, MakerDAO, and Uniswap in the EUTxO model ecosystem.

The longer answer:

Ergo is a proof of work smart contract platform using the EUTxO accounting model. There's a lot of brainshare between the teams that work on Ergo and the ones that work on Cardano so you'll see a lot of similar features and design choices between them. Additionally, since most of IOG's and EMURGO's research starts with PoW assumptions before moving to PoS and since Ergo tends to follow a bit more of a fast moving approach than Cardano, you'll find that Ergo gets used as an experimentation bed for a lot of cool projects that ultimately end up making their way into other projects in the EUTxO space.

As for what is positioning Ergo to fill those aforementioned roles:

Ergo has a rather interesting Oracle system called Oracle Pools that provides inbuilt governance mechanisms, improved resilience, and better resistance to certain types of attacks. This is one of the ""killer features"" of Ergo and I don't think I can sell it properly here so I'd recommend doing a proper dive on it.

The recently released Djed protocol paper used SigmaUSD as its initial implementation. SigmaUSD is a properly crypto-backed stablecoin. This differs from MakerDAO/DAI in that DAI is crypto-collateralised (crypto is used as collateral on DAI loans) which provides SigmaUSD some nicer security properties and provides a greater incentive for maintaining the peg.

Finally, the Ergo team is building out ErgoDEX which is a fully fledged multichain DEX with AMM and Order book support. The main chain will be Ergo of course but there is a full Cardano Plutus integration in progress as well.

TLDR: There's a number of cool projects being built on Ergo that have the potential to cement it as a key member of the slowly forming EUTxO model ecosystem.",2021-08-20 23:08:06

VandyILL,"I had been following the MakerDAO subreddit back in 2016-2017, and sometime that winter someone came in to ask about Radix’s proposed stable coin (old project priority) vs the DAI, and some queries about whether they could work well in the same ecosystem.

Checked out Radix and what appealed to me was how Dan was so focused on identifying exactly what problems need to be solved and what it’ll take to solve them.  It feels like the team is considering and solving problems that aren’t on other people’s radar, so the ability to think with that much foresight and dedicate so much planning (8+ years) to get it right was very appealing.  Since then whenever I see a new project I try to ask “what problems are they trying to solve” and that really helps me. I think this causes me to undervalue a lot of the actual DeFi projects as it’s more an evaluation approach for L1’s etc, but I’m okay not putting more $ into crypto just to be in more projects.  On the other hand, there are some projects that look like they’re solving an interesting problem but I’m just not technical enough to understand and their average user marketing is worse than Radix’s (talking about TRIAS specifically)",2021-08-21 00:06:16

ArcadesOfAntiquity,"&gt; collateral ratio

The RAI smart contracts use much of the same logic that DAI/MakerDAO does, so like with DAI, there is a risk of having your collateral ETH liquidated if the price of ETH falls.

Some differences with DAI:

1. You can use a saviour, a special smart contract that must be called before your collateral can be liquidated. This means you could have a contract that deposits more collateral and/or repays your debt in order to prevent liquidation.

2. RAI is not pegged to the price of USD

crypto-devk,"If the price of $ETH instantly drops by 10%, the price of $ETH2X-FLI will drop by 20% (although it would likely never be exactly 2x, since ETH2X-FLI is constantly re-balancing itself).

So essentially, each $ETH2X-FLI will be worth less $ETH if the value ETH/USD goes down in value. And vice versa if ETH/USD goes up.

If the price falls quickly enough (black swan event), there's also a super unlikely chance that the position doesn't re-balance fast enough (e.g. MakerDAO ""Black Thursday"" on March 12th 2020), but the creators of ETH2x-FLI claim they have protections from that, so it might be fine.

Other costs are:

  - interest, ETH2X-FLI is uses Compound to borrow USDC, so has to pay interest on that.
  - 2% streaming fee per year
  - [Volatility decay!](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/why-leveraged-etfs-are-not-longterm-bet.asp). Rebalanced leverage funds or constantly buying high, selling low, so volatility will kill your returns, especially when they compound! This is a big one in crypto.

Personally, although I think $ETH will go up in value in the long term, I'm not sure about the short term.

cali_dave,"Alright, I'll bite. 

&gt;Not only will Cardano's price dump tremendously on the day that their smart contracts ""release"" (let's see if they get delayed again), but not a single prominent and actively used dApp that actually has known, respected developers and hundreds of thousands of active users has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano.

I'll refer you to [this link](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oBUiOLBrBg). The first link is to a fairly comprehensive outline of the Cardano ecosystem - everything from its partnerships to NFTs to oracles to DEXes and so on. It's massive. You may just find some familiar names in that list. The video is a clip of Charles himself talking about dapps on Ethereum and just how many of them are looking to migrate. The long and short of it is that all of the top 15 dapps on Ethereum have looked into migrating to another blockchain, and several are actively pursuing it. Also, only 31% of new dapps are deployed on Ethereum as opposed to other ecosystems. I think most people are tired of the high gas prices, and they are looking for an alternative. In my opinion, they're just waiting. They'll let others test the water then decide if they want to migrate or not afterwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Furthermore, none of the dApps that Cardano touts around in their ""ecosystem"" have working products or any hope of pulling developers or users from other networks. Who even uses anything that Cardano has in its ""ecosystem"" anyway? I'd love to know how many users and transactions occur on those dApps. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.

As you've pointed out, there are no dapps yet on the Cardano mainnet, so there are zero users and transactions as of yet. Can't argue that. However, there are a number of promising DEXes and liquidity providers (ErgoDEX, Liqwid, SundaeSwap, and others) that are building on the Alonzo testnet as we speak. They may not be the same names you mentioned, but they do have the support of the Cardano community, and there is a good deal of excitement surrounding them. In addition, there is a budding NFT ecosystem growing on Cardano. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I would be willing to bet that after a few months of smart contracts being live on Cardano, there will be scant activity on the network and Charles will be forced to bridge, and kneel to Ethereum, just like the rest of the ""Ethereum killers"" have.

There are already plans to bridge to (and from) the Ethereum network. One of the goals is cross-chain interoperability. There is an ERC-20 token converter in the works that will allow for easy migration to the Cardano blockchain, as well as a KEVM that will allow Solidity smart contracts to run on Cardano. In addition, projects like [occam.fi](https://occam.fi) are already building cross-chain liquidity protocols between Ethereum and Cardano. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While Cardano was sleeping during the bear market and selling off their holdings to their bagholders who they promised a ""world changing protocol"", the projects I listed above continued to develop real, functioning applications

I disagree that Cardano was sleeping during the bear market. The academic approach you have so quickly dismissed has allowed them to build an insanely robust and correct system from the ground up. Each step has been meticulously peer-reviewed and scrutinized. Much of this work was done during the bear market. Ethereum historically has taken a ""move fast, break things, we'll fix it later"" approach.. hence the move to PoS with ETH2. Cardano has done the opposite - build it once, build it right. There are pros and cons to each method, but at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether you want your financial system built quickly or built correctly. 

For the record, Charles doesn't care much for the phrase ""Ethereum killer"", and neither do I. I think, as in all things, a balance will be found. Once people discover that smart contracts can run on Cardano faster and cheaper than on Ethereum, some will migrate, and some won't. The ones that do migrate will take some of the pressure off the Ethereum network and gas prices will fall. 

I'm not entirely sure why you're so hateful towards Cardano (if you don't like it, don't use it), but I'll say that the blockchain space is big enough for everybody. Right now, at a time when governments across the world are seeking to embrace, regulate, or destroy crypto.. there is no room for tribalism amongst the larger crypto community.",2021-08-22 13:53:27

SwagtimusPrime,"&gt;It's clearly a very big and active community which you can easily see if you looked but you clearly don't care and just want to shit on ADA and it's community.

It's a very active and big community of retail investors looking to score the next big thing. Developers? Barely any.

&gt;It's a community that controls $80B vs communities that control about $5B. These people can use their ADA to provide liquidity or use it in many other smart contracts or trade it for tokens of other projects build on top of Cardano. This is basic knowledge. Do you also think that a company with a huge market cap doesn't have more resources than a company with a much smaller market cap?

Maybe you need to work on your writing skills because ""using a marketcap on projects"" sounds very idiotic.

&gt;You don't even understand what I am talking about. It's a decentralized treasury build into the Cardano blockchain which token holders control and which funds new projects every six weeks. There are only a couple of chains who have something similar and on a much smaller scale than Cardano.

I know exactly what you're talking about, I was just commenting on the war chest's size.

&gt;Or Avalanche spending it on bad marketing strategies like paying DeFi protocols to boost their adoption.

I'll come back to this comment once Cardano decides to do the exact same thing when it's struggling for relevancy. Looking forward to it.

&gt;I said, there are no other projects, projects that you compared to Cardano, who have this kind of traction.

Except for millions of users on Ethereum, and not some shady deal with a third world country that's about to be involved in a civil war.

&gt;You conveniently left out mentioning the outrageous transaction fees and people losing money on failed transactions which is just flat out bad design.

I actually have mentioned this, talking about the gas limit. Perhaps you need glasses?

&gt;So what? It's now far ahead in every aspect except adoption

You should become a comedian, seriously. It's behind in

1. EVM compatibility
2. smart contracts
3. oracles
4. adoption
5. developers
6. scalability (Hydra is years away)

&gt;except adoption which Ethereum has very little of in the grand scheme of things.

Ah yes, Ethereum has very little adoption. Looking forward to r/cardano celebrating the first dapp deployed and touting the massive adoption of Cardano. Wonderful!

&gt;No not for good reasons. Ethereum governance is heavily centralized around the developers

The EIP process is open for anyone, research is entirely in the public domain, core dev calls are public and anyone can attend.

&gt;and on-chain governance is easily a lot more decentralized and fair.

on-chain governance means whales dictate what happens because they own most of the coins. Want to see how bad this is? Take a look at the Uniswap governance. It's a hot mess. Vitalik will never warm up to on-chain governance on the base layer, and neither will anyone else in Ethereum.

&gt;Whatever floats your boat in your delusional magic world. Rollups and similar L2 solutions have been in development for years on Ethereum and everyone knows about them and is researching them but nobody is adopting them in the way Ethereum does (most likely because they were build on Ethereum as bandaid solutions while PoS and sharding was in development hell) and they are all looking into other L1 or L2 scaling solutions.

You have a severely distorted view of reality. Other L1 chains have been in ""development hell"" for years - no adoption, no users, no devs, no nothing. We are currently in year 6 of Ethereum killers trying to kill Ethereum and they all miserably fail.

The reason for why only Ethereum is adopting rollups is because Ethereum has some of the most brilliant minds in blockchain history working on it, who realize that it's simply the best solution out there. Want some examples?

the founder of Arbitrum - professor at Princeton, EFF Pioneer Award winner (arguably, there's no greater prize in computer science), and his last job before founding Offchain Labs was Dy. US CTO at the goddamn White House. Or the founder of StarkWare - research doctorate at Princeton, Harvard and MIT, inventor of STARKs, founder of Zcash - the first practical implementation of zero-knowledge proofs. Not that any of this means anything whatsoever. I'm sure Cardano has got this all figured out much better.

&gt;You can't fork Uniswap and deploy it on Cardano because Cardano uses a different ledger model, the Extended UTxO model. Maybe you can in the future when the KEVM sidechain is finished.

Please, dude, I know all of this. I was referring to the ghostchains that have done this before. And this btw doesn't bode well for Cardano - no EVM compatibility is just a death sentence. And a sidechain for EVM? A sidechain? Really? Sidechains are horrendously insecure and centralized. This is the best Cardano could come up with in all these years?

&gt;Just because Ethereum has a few, relatively speaking, succesful protocols that barely anyone uses means nothing at all. That kind of basic 'DeFi' functionality with very little users and without regulation is really not as hard as you try to make it out to be.

I can't take you serious. You have clearly not been into crypto for a long time. DeFi wasn't even a concept 2 years ago. It all started with MakerDAO figuring out a collateralized stablecoin tied to ETH - then Uniswap happened - the brainchild of Vitalik and Hayden Adams - then the rise of Compound by Robert Leshner, which at the same time introduced liquidity mining and governance over protocols. Just because you now know how to do all this stuff makes it easy, doesn't mean it was easy right from the beginning. Ethereum wrote history, Cardano wrote some papers in academia.

&gt;Roflmao. I just gave you tons of reasons why it's not working well. People lost millions if not billions of dollars because of Solidity bugs and bad protocol design. Everyone knows about this so you are not fooling anyone. ETH 2.0's design without delegation functionality (which was too difficult to implement from the start according to Vitalik) forced people to use centralized 3rd parties to stake with and people already lost $150M in 'rug pulls'/lost stake keys. If they just staked on Cardano they would've never even been in that position to begin with and they could move their tokens whenever they wanted and not get slashed because a staking service made a simple meaningless mistake during an update without any bad intentions (yes that also already happened).

&gt;Yeah right, it's just principles. Great principles forcing people to pay thousands if not tens of thousands in fees. Great principles designing a protocol so that when your transaction fails you still lose the fee for no good reason. What a joke, just like the ""it's feature not a bug"".

Transaction fee issues and failed transactions will be a thing of the past with rollups. While Cardano was doing.. what exactly? The giga brain researchers of Ethereum figured out how to build a trustless, decentralized second Layer protocol to fix all of the shortcomings.

The staking criticism is actually one I can understand to some degree, Cardano's staking is way more user friendly, but it relies on staking pools. Ethereum chose not to trade UX for decentralization, which in the long run is the correct decision.

&gt;More derailing. Why don't you figure it out if you care so much. All this information is publicly available.

This was an honest question.

EWdirtbag_MX,"First, I will say that I don't believe that cardano will become an ""ethereum killer"" atleast not anytime soon. There simply is too much industries already backing and building on the ethereum network. However, I do believe cardano has plenty of room to thrive and prosper and adds real value to the world. 

&gt;I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.
&gt;

As a matter of fact, cardano is also building a ERC-20 bridge. Also, I think you seem to place value on a ecosystem solely on how much backers are already building on it. I will explain more below.

&gt;Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.
&gt;

They don't need to migrate, two or more ecosystems can coexists especially when they provide solutions to different problems (Atila Prism Identification Solution) and cardano has many dApps of their own. Personally I think it will be a long time before we reach a point of 1 world currency (if we ever do), the race is still close amongst many and there is still much innovatiom to come, Not to mention approx. 1% of the worlds capital is in crypto at the moment. (plenty of room for growth.)

&gt;I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.
&gt;

Ok so in regards to getting sick of cardano manic threads asking ppl to buy, I'm not on this sub often but I would be sick of it too. It's an investment, they should learn the skill of patience. You're right those developers will have to make a decision to just continue on the etheruem network or branch off and expand their platform with bridges to other viable networks. What makes you think they have to choose one only? I mean certainly, they can but they will be behind thier competition when they start expanding out to other viable strong networks.

&gt;To all of the people about to yell at me for making another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about ""Ethereum killers"" and how ""great"" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?
&gt;

Yeah I agree, it's not an ""eth killer"" nor do I think any blockchain will kill eth in the near future. I havevnt used any defy but i assure you I have researched on how to use them and how they work, specifically, lido,curve,yearn, blockify, opensea, etc. You don't need to use a platform to see how great its value is or can be. Instead it requires creative/critical thinking.

&gt;Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same ""academic scientific approach"" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.
&gt;

Atila Prism Identification Solution is honestly enough to be bullish on cardano. Much of africa has a problem of not being able to provide simple birth certificates to their citizens and other documentation. This allows people to essentially have a virtual ID portfolio on the blockchain that governement offices and services can lookup and verify. Birth cert., Drivers Lic., Diplomas, Title of houses,. All you need is a smartphone, which surprisingly enough, a good portion of the populace has. The rest can access via a cheap computer at some government location. This is a much cheaper alternative to the traditional infrastructure that would be needed in place to do such tasks and more secure considering the high crime rates in some parts of africa. Ethopia has ALREADY partnered with cardano for this solution. If this is successful, I predict many more african governments will follow suite. Do you know how many people will be forced to interact with the cardano network now? There is no other blockchain branching out to africa, (which is honestly an insane blunder.)

Lastly, keep in mind cardano as of right now, can handle 266tps vs etheruems 13tps, its gas fees are a fraction of etheruems and its based off a PoS system which offers far more scalability and energy effeicency. Yes etheruem 2.0 is on the way, but cardano also has updates on the way to improve even further.

It seems to me the big advantage ETH has is being ""first come first serve"" so they have more backers. ADA has the advantage of being in a better position on network effiecency and usability. when ADA has smart contracts release there will be apoint in time on paper where ADA is the superior platform. TPS, GAS, SCALABILITY, while offering smart contracts. That is until eth 2 comes out then it evens out again. Plenty of developers will see value in that.

Personally,, I hold both ETH and ADA and am bullish on both :P

Timetraveler4000,"From Vitalik Buterin:

But for application-layer projects, and especially defi projects, we run into the problem that application-layer smart contract systems often directly control external assets, and that control cannot be forked away. If Tezos's on-chain governance gets captured by an attacker, the community can hard-fork away without any losses beyond (admittedly high) coordination costs. If MakerDAO's on-chain governance gets captured by an attacker, the community can absolutely spin up a new MakerDAO, but they will lose all the ETH and other assets that are stuck in the existing MakerDAO CDPs.

Beechbone22,"""DAI maintains its value not by being backed by U.S. dollars custodied by a company""

LMAO my fucking sides

DAI is just USDC with extra steps. When 60% of the collateral backing your decentralized stablecoin is a centralized and custodial stable, your decentralized stablecoin might not be as decentralized as you think. Any sort of USDC peg failure will result in the failure of DAI and MakerDAO. It's literally an existential problem for the protocol. DAI is no more decentralized than USDC and holding DAI is even more risky IMO due to the added layer of smart contract vulnerability risk + protocol insolvency risk. The worst of both worlds, yay! Centralization risk due to being collateralized by a custodial stable and the added risk of smart contract vulnerability + the risk that MakerDAO may become insolvent due to their incredibly inefficient method for liquidations.

I like DAI and I don't have problems with custodial stables like PAXOS or USDC, but let's not pretend that DAI is anything resembling decentralized. If USDC fails, it takes down DAI and MakerDAO with it.

If you want to experience much greater capital efficiency, true decentralization and zero interest rate, you might want to give Liquity a try. LUSD is much more decentralized than any custodial stablecoin, more stable than algorithmic stables and other decentralized stables due to more efficient liquidations and how it can allow immediate arbitrage opportunities. All fully backed 100% by ETH and NOTHING ELSE. The protocol can never change and add more options to the collateral pool because it's a finished product and there is no governance. The protocol token gives no governance right and only generates cashflow.

If you want to go even further down the scale of decentralization you can use RAI. Still backed by ETH and decentralized but not pegged to any single world curency.",2021-08-23 23:01:07
UglandHouse,"Copy / paste from one of my earlier posts that explains what DAI is, quite brilliant.

&gt;For example, MakerDAO aims at replicating a traditional lending platform.  
Here's how it works: you send your ETH to a collateralised debt position (referred to as a CDP)—it's just a smart contract. The MakerDAO protocol locks up your ETH, and creates (out of thin air) something called Dai, the protocol's stablecoin; soft-pegged 1:1 against the USD. The peg is maintained by|from the ETH backing all of the minted Dai. The collateralization rate is currently 150%, meaning that you can borrow up to 66% of your locked up ETH in Dai. Once you send your ETH and receive Dai, interest is generated on the amount borrowed—referred to as the stability fee. The only way to close the contract, and get back your ETH is to pay back the Dai generated, plus the interest. The Dai is then burned, as is the governance token on the interest accrued.  
Why would you want Dai? Leverage, stability, payment for goods and services, tax scenarios, etc.  
The Maker token (MKR) holders are individuals who retain rights to vote on certain parameters in the MakerDAO protocol (i.e., the stability fee). It is very similar to how the federal reserve controls the USD, and conducts monetary policy; namely through the Federal Funds Rate (FFR). There are also certain covenants in the MKR token to ensure that the protocol runs smoothly, very similar to the ""lender of last resort"" concept.  
Bitcoin isn't useful in any capacity whatsoever, it was just nascent technology.",2021-08-24 00:26:00
justgolife,"Bankless have been pushing the DAO narrative over the last week... Interview with Kain from Synthetix and some others were pretty insightful, like, they are claiming that Synthetix wasn'T really a DAO in the beginning, neither was MakerDAO... That blew my mind.

Onomy has a even higher collateral ratio of 1.5:1 and it's also crypto collateralised but not restricted to only the $. Its sorta minting your own stablecoin if you can back it by collateral.",2021-08-25 01:25:16
BraveNewDeFi,"If you purchase Protocol Cover for Anchor on Terra, your deposits on Anchor are protected against a loss of funds in the event that:

* Code is used in an unintended way (e.g., a hack or exploit) 
* Assets are liquidated due to economic design failure (e.g., like the [MakerDAO Black Thursday event](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/black-thursday-response-thread/1433))
* Assets are liquidated or lost due to severe oracle failure or oracle price manipulation
* A governance attack occurs that leads to a loss of funds within the protocol

With Protocol Cover, you get cross-chain protection under one policy. You can read more about [Protocol Cover](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/users/types-of-cover#protocol-cover) in the Nexus documentation. 

The cost for cover is 2.6% per annum, but 10% of your premium is reserved for claims filing and can be withdrawn 35 days after cover expiry. Because members can file claims for up to 35 days after a cover policy expires (for a loss within the covered period), the 10% reserved for claims filing can be withdrawn on the 36th day after expiry. This means the real cost of Nexus cover is 2.34% per annum.

Members often ask how they would file a claim in the event a loss of funds within Anchor's smart contract system occurred. There is a guide within the Nexus documentation that walks through the process of [How to File a Claim](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/how-to-use-nexus/how-to-file-a-claim-1). If you file a claim, the Nexus UI guides you through the process, and to provide proof of loss, the Nexus UI will direct you to sign into your Terra wallet and sign a transaction or send a 0 value transaction to prove ownership of the wallet. From there, the UI will direct you through the rest of the claims process as detailed in the How to File a Claim section. 

If you'd like to read about past claim payouts, you can review the [Claims History](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/claims-assessment/claims-history) section of the Nexus documentation.

To date, the mutual has paid out $2.5mm in successful claims. The last claim payout was for the Yearn yDAI hack in Feb 2021. Amount paid out: $2,410,499.26 USD (1,351 ETH + 129,660 DAI).",2021-08-25 05:17:07
berryeatknicks,"I know not many people believe in Ethereum. But my recommendation is to learn how to wrap your BTC (WBTC or RenBTC) and use it as collateral (MakerDao) to create a stable coin (Dai, USDC).

ethereumflow,"Banks are insured by a corrupt system. Crypto exploits are not insured (except centralized exchanges and Thorchain). 

Exploits point out flaws or issues that need to be corrected. That’s how we end up with new blockchains. 

Different blockchains will do different things and appeal to different people. That’s why sovereignty is so important. Applications may not want to build on one blockchain because of protocol decisions that may affect their application (Aragon pending migration from Ethereum for example). Polygon itself is an example of a multi-chain world. Moving from Ethereum to Polygon to use the dapps that prefer the features available on Polygon that maybe don’t require the security of an app like AAVE or MakerDAO. These applications (Aavegotchi, Axie Infinity among others) can run on a “less secure” chain that fulfills their specific needs. 

Why more smart contracts platforms? Solidity is one of the main reasons. There’s a reason other chains aren’t launching written in Solidity. Developers want to write code in languages they are familiar with using tools they’re comfortable with. Many of the alternative smart contract platforms are using common languages known by more devs from outside the space. JUNO smart contracts will be in Rust, CosmWasm and Go; Agoric smart contracts will be written in hardened JavaScipt, the most popular programming language out there. Why would a new to blockchain developer spend time learning a new, complex language when they can code in languages they know? 

Blockchains empower communities with the tools need to create local economies. Any community that wants to run their own blockchain can do so and connect to an interconnected network of independent and sovereign blockchains. 

Checkout this post, it gives a much better explanation than I can about a multi chain world and how it can work.

You may be able to influence the 50% nonuser coins with creative governance like, “10% of moons will go to a cause every month decided some decentralized governance/vote”. In this way, you could pressure the other pools of coins to contribute otherwise they would get some bad press. “The ‘public’ set aside $50k and you couldn’t match the required $10k”, for example. 

This unfairness you’re feeling isn’t a new concept. It literally underpins corporate cap sheets, the stock market, and is nearly ubiquitous across crypto. The silver lining is we have the tools, and projects that have lead by example, to pave a path toward a more fair future. MakerDAO, and how they’ve been working to shed responsibilities from their foundation onto the distributed community. Fairlaunch.capital, and the model they provide for funding: in our example, the admins and mods would have received 0% token allocation and would have had to make a proposal for a % of tokens they thought were fair, AFTER launch. 

There’s more, that can help this technology permeate our cultures around the world. Distributed governance and fair launches are so amazing. Retroactive public good funding, public good and crypto in general, quadratic funding and voting are very interesting concepts to limit the power of whales.

You're more likely to see regulations from the Treasury (if they become registered as an alternate currency) or the CFTC (if it becomes regulated as a commodity, similar to bitcoin). 

The thing that makes me feel better is that Circle (backer of USDC) is trying to go public and become a regulated bank of sorts so it's very transparent and trying to be compliant. DAI is operated by MakerDAO (DAO = distributed/decentralized autonomous organization). The Maker foundation (the governing organization) has disbanded in its attempts to become more decentralized and Maker is governed by holders of the Maker token. Since DAOs dont have a normal hierarchy like a traditional business and being that they are such a new type of business I don't expect congress to pass serious laws on them for sometime. 

The few places that have passed DAO laws (Wyoming is one I believe) are very pro innovation and I see these state laws being used as a foundation by which fed laws will be based upon kind of like how prior rulings in a court system influence future rulings. This makes me hopeful that DAOs wont get hit nearly as hard as other cryptocurrencies that could absolutely fall into the unregistered security section of the law which the SEC oversees. I believe the Ripple vs SEC case that's going on right now will really set a lot of precedent going forwards of how the SEC determines if something is a digital security or not. And finally, please stay away from USDT, there's been waaaaaay too much sketchy stuff that's come to light recently that raises some questions of the overall liquidity of it. 

FYI, you can also move cash (dollars, pounds, and euros) into nexo but u have to wire transfer them and it's so much easier to use stablecoins IMO.",2021-08-28 04:52:41
nikola_j,"&gt;For one thing, as far as I know, there is still no user-friendly way to do this.

We actually have an interface available where you can take flash loans from Aave or dYdX and utilize them for whatever you see fit in combination with other defi protocols.

We called this the ""Recipe Creator"" and you can try it out at: [https://app.defisaver.com/recipes](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes). The introduction post is here: [https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-the-defi-saver-recipe-creator-34d4c26630c](https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-the-defi-saver-recipe-creator-34d4c26630c)

What's this useful for and what you can you use a flash loan for?

Well, we use flash loans in a bunch of leveraging and refinancing actions for defi lending positions. Here's one example how you can, for example, move a position from one protocol to another using flash loans.

Let's assume you have a MakerDAO ETH Vault and you wan't to move that whole position (a position with ETH deposited and DAI borrowed) to Compound. This is how you can do that:

* You flash borrow DAI (e.g. 50,000 DAI, if that's your current debt)
* You pay back debt in MakerDAO
* You withdraw ETH from MakerDAO
* You deposit ETH into Compound
* You borrow (50,000) DAI from Compound
* You pay back the falsh loan with this Dai

Voila! You have successfully refinanced your loan and moved it to a completely different protocol with a completely different set of conditions - something you'd never be able to do in traditional finance, or at least certainly not in one, single transaction taking you potentially under a minute :)",2021-08-28 05:42:37

nikola_j,"I would hate to come across as an illegible defi-elitist or anything like that.

Here's an attempt at an ELI5 of this process:

A flash loan is a new concept introduced by defi that allows anyone to borrow potentially unlimited (or at least tremendously huge) amounts of funds for whatever operation, as long as all of those funds are also returned by the end of that same transaction.

One use case for flash loans is moving an existing long-term borrowing made in DeFi from one protocol to another. For example, if you have deposited ETH into MakerDAO and borrowed DAI, you can utilize a flash loan to move that loan from the Maker protocol to the Compound protocol, for example.

This is done by utilising a flash loan to clear debt in the first protocol, moving funds from the first to the second protocol, and then borrowing the same amount of funds from the second protocol to pay off the flash loan.

Why would you want to do this? Well, maybe the second protocol is offering lower borrowing rates on the asset you have borrowed. Or maybe the second protocol started offering liquidity incentives - token rewards given just for using the protocol and having your funds in it. There could be a number of reasons.

Still not an ELI5, but hopefully works as an ELI15. Let me know if I can clarify a specific step more!",2021-08-28 18:28:29
nikola_j,"Well, what I mentioned earlier is an interface that allows users to create custom combinations of actions, including flash loans and what not. A UI where users are expected to put together the puzzle for their transaction, so to say, is defintiely not a mainstream thing. That's meant for highly advanced users who have unique combinations of actions in mind.

But for the mainstream, we're always working on 1-click/1-transaction options for all sorts of things.

For example, what I described earlier is also available in our Loan Shifter interface at DeFi Saver, where one can just select an existing MakerDAO position on the left and the target protocol on the right and just click ""shift"" - the frontend handles everything for them and that single quick transaction gets their position across to a completely different protocol

There are other teams working on similar things, too, of course. And the UX available to DeFi users is getting better by the day, really. If we compare any defi app from 2018 or 2019 to somethig that's been updated regularly or launched recently... The improvements are very noticeable.",2021-08-28 19:04:42

Plus-EV,"Spoke to a guy a week ago who made early retirement money during the 2017 run. Reason why I take his opinion seriously is he made the bulk of his money during the 2018-2020 period when it was a bear market. He cashed out long before this bullrun really got going and still came out with 7 digits. This was his take on the current cycle:

* SOL, not ADA will be the Ethereum of this run. He said this as it was crossing the $40 mark so seems like he's right short term.
* A lot of people clown on ICP because of the name, centralization and it's massive dump but it is actually a very good project tech wise. It's kinda in the same situation that /r/CC thinks ALGO is in, once people stop dumping it will rocket.
* Speaking about ALGO, doesn't really follow it. 
* If this cycle can extend into late '2022, then BTC will top out around 250K. At that point he'd sell and wait until it dumps to around $40-50K. If you are heavy into alts, you sell around that mark and rebuy in later.  
* He is an Ethereum guy. I wouldn't say he's a maximalist but he has said many times over the years that he was most bullish on Ethereum because that's the only coin he sees a real world use case for besides just hodling. He was talking about defi as a concept really early before things like MakerDAO were a thing so this was surprising to hear from him: The longer Ethereum goes without addressing the fee problem, the better it will be for the overall ecosystem because the ETH alternatives this time around actually have large userbases, ecosystems and use cases ready to go. The last time around alternatives like Neo and Stratis but way less users and no real use cases. Now that coins have lots of users plus DeFi and NFTs are a thing there are reasons to buy other coins. 
* 1 BTC will not be enough to retire but it puts you in a very good position when you do decide to retire in ~30-40 years. Everyone should aim to own at least 1BTC. Ironically he himself owns 0 BTC. He says ETH is in the too big to fail category now so he's fine owning ETH but he also has a larger stack than most people due to earlier adoption. If you're getting in now, 1BTC should be the goal. If you wanna do it with ETH, 32-50 ETH should be the goal. 
* People are overly focused on technical issues. Tech for the most part can be solved even if it's late. Moderna's stock price has exploded this year for instance, nobody really remembers all the issues it faced while developing the vaccine, just that it was delivered and it worked. This is why he isn't worried about ETH in the long term. The real issues in crypto are economic, intergration into mainstream society and regulatory risks. You can address one of them with tech but the other two are largely social and political issues.",2021-08-28 22:58:56

nikola_j,"Why not? Here's a few examples:

* A car bought with a loan made with MakerDAO: [https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aume7m/interview\_with\_the\_makerdao\_dev\_who\_took\_out\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aume7m/interview_with_the_makerdao_dev_who_took_out_a/)
* A car bought with a (self-repaying!) Alchemix loan: [https://twitter.com/iqbalmatyaakob/status/1414053017439989762](https://twitter.com/iqbalmatyaakob/status/1414053017439989762)

The process, as it is now, would have to involve depositing crypto to make a loan (in stablecoins) that you can then convert to fiat if wanted.

And the main reason to do something like that being that you remain exposed to a potential value growth of your crypto assets. If you make a loan against your ETH and ETH grows 10x in a matter of a year or two - you can either pay back the debt and get your full ETH amount back or ""self liquidate"" and clear that debt with a fraction of your initially deposited ETH.",2021-08-29 03:47:43
nikola_j,"Ah, ok, I see what you mean.

In terms of fees, two types of fees should be considered:

* Transaction fees - these don't have anything to do with the falsh loan specifically, but they are mandatory and cannot be avoided. A transaction fee is usually paid no matter whether the transaction fails or not. And as OP mentioned, these kinds of transactions are complex, which means that they are gas intensive, which again means that they can become very costly. If we're talking about Ethereum, this can easily be in multiple hundred dollars worth of ETH (so 0.1 - 0.5 ETH or maybe even more, really depends on the number of actions in the transaction).
* Protocol fees for the flash loans - these will depend on the protocol from which the flash loan is being taken. Some of the options include:
   * Aave - which currently has a 0.09% fee on any flash loans (and they have the highest variety of assets available for flash loaning)
   * MakerDAO - which currently has a 0.05% fee on flash minting Dai (but DAI is the only available asset)
   * dYdX - which had flash loan fees at no fees whatsoever (with ETH, DAI and USDC available for flash loaning)
   * WETH10 - not a protocol per se, but the latest WETH (wrapped Ether) token contract allows for flash minting any amount of ETH at no fees whatsoever

In order for your transaction to complete successfully, you need to return the full amount required by the protocol from which you took the flash loan or where you performed the flash mint, and that amount will depend on whether the source used has any required fees.

Arbitrage is one of the most obvious use cases, but certainly not the only one as OP originally suggested. To complete a successful arbitrage in defi you have to find a noticeable price disparity in some assets on multiple dexes and hope that you make your play quickly enough. This is a field that's largely dominated by bots nowadats, as OP mentioned, and it's usually a game not worth playing, as you could quickly end up losing funds on failed transactions.

In terms of other use cases, I mentioned loan refinancing, but then another use case is for what some call ""self liquidation"".

For example, let's say you have a collateralized debt position with 10 ETH deposited into Compound and 5,000 USDC borrowed. What you can do is self liquidate that position using a flash loan: you make a flash loan of 5,000 USDC, you use that to clear your debt in Compound, you take out your 10 ETH, swap \~1.5 ETH for 5000+ USDC and then use this USDC to pay back the flash loan. This way you can clear your debt without having the borrowed funds and you walk away with the remaining \~8.5 ETH. This is especially useful when leveraging (longing/shorting) assets using lending protocols (as described [here](https://medium.com/defi-saver/how-to-long-or-short-any-asset-using-defi-lending-protocols-812300c9a640), for example).

I know it may sound complicated when explained like that, but the cool thing is that some apps have this available for users at a click of a button. For example we call this feature ""Repay"" in DeFi Saver and it's available in the dashboards of all defi lending protocols we have supported (Maker, Compound, Aave, Reflexer and Liquity).",2021-08-29 04:05:29
Optimal_Store,"True. To add to that I would diversify my Dai holdings into 3 sections:

I wonder how big Cardano can become on speculation alone. I had no freaking idea how hollow and faulty the network is. After learning about Cardano more in the last week, I would say that Cardano has no business being in the top 10 coins.

Cardano as a Smart Contract platform looks like it is doomed to fail, Its supposed to break EVM supremacy but it has so many systemic problems and ontop of that Plutus/Haskell and a seemingly uninformed community. I dont see how they can possibly succeed.",2021-08-30 05:28:44
TragedyStruck,"Mine is BPRO: B.Protocol. A backstop protocol for the DeFi ecosystem which e.g. recently passed a proposal with MakerDAO for a new collateral type. Promises to bring lower collateral demands to DeFi lending platforms to improve potential leverage and/or reduce liquidation risk.

Well known, doxxed, founders. Currently around 10M market cap. Recently integrated with Liquity and passed proposal to be integrated into Instadapp. DYOR, but personal opinion is that this could be huge over time. Not a 100x over night, but could become a long term building block for DeFi lending platforms, which should bring considerable value to the ecosystem and the token.",2021-08-30 18:23:26
15kisFUD,"For me it's just the next step in decentralization. History has proven that a free marketplace and competition between teams is the fastest way to achieve innovation and progress. 

We already saw this happening on the application layer where anyone can their own application / defi protocol.Some will work and some won't. This lead to so many great innovations, MakerDao, Uniswap, Defi, NFT's. Imagine if the Ethereum foundation had to create all of these apps by themselves.

I'm actually way more bullish on different teams trying to compete for the ultimate solutions, rather than a centralized top down approach",2021-08-30 21:27:59
