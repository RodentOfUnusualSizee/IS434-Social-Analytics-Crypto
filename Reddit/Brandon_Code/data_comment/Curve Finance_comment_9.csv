Zone_boy,"&gt;I rather take this life lesson with a good laugh though, if you don’t mind ;) Glad you only made good investments and didn’t lose any money yourself!

Yeah, it's hard to lose money with ETFs and index funds. The gains are nothing to screenshot, but I ain't losing money either. 

If you want some investment advice. Put half your money into safe investments, like ETFs/index funds/bonds. They're slow growing, but you don't have to worry about daily candles. You're basically getting 8-9% annually with ZERO effort.

But the other half should be in risker investments, speculative growth stocks. I like trying to get ahead of the curve by predicting treads. For example, the GME/AMC bullshit got a lot of people into stocks. And many of those people found the fun in trading stocks. So I looked up popular stockbrokers to see if they're publically listed. And many of them are publicly listed. So I invested into fidelity, MS, and few others. Turns out many stockbrokers are also banks. And banks are on the recovery right now with higher interest rates. So it was smart covid recovery play. And I made a decent return on those plays.

Making plays like that requires effort. You have to keep up with the news and have gut feelings on treads. And you have to be able to valuate securities yourself without relying on finance news outlets telling you what to buy. You can't fully trust them.",2021-09-01 01:45:04
neofelius,"Bit of a long answer but hopefully this helps:
The Malaysian job market is extremely screwed up (due to multiple points of failure but let's not talk about that) and there's no one ""useless degree"". A STEM degree for example allows you to practice your chosen STEM route, or if you fancy, you could hop on over to business/finance/arts etc. provided it doesn't need a mandatory qualification i.e. ACCA, IFoA etc. They give you flexibility but in return it might take longer to complete (occasionally 4 year bachelor programmes).

The way I think about it is if one day a crisis (could be a health crisis -wink wink-) hits the world and the economy goes south, who is more at risk of being considered ""unnecessary"" to the economy?

Pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, consumer goods etc. are definitely at the top of the priority list and these need a workforce with STEM skills. What comes next? The people who does the selling, marketing, fulfilling purchases, supporting customers etc. So, business, finance, admin personnel.

One thing that I don't see in this hierarchy is someone who could play the 24 Caprices or make Chopin jealous. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on the performing arts and music degrees but merely analysing from a practical point of view, not accounting for people's needs from an entertainment and leisure point of view.

To sum up, there's no ""useless"" degree but it just depends on what you're thinking of using it for. Actuarial science has been a popular choice for the past few years but seeing as massive amounts of grads get pumped out, I'd say it'll most likely end up like the IT boom or biotech boom...



My 5 sen on how I see a degree (I'm a recent graduate with about 2 years in the workforce, holding a Masters degree):
A degree can be thought of as an ""Insurance"" and a ""Ticket"" to your chosen career path

Why ""Insurance""?
Let's say you wanna be a pilot, so you went to flight school and got your flight hours to be qualified to fly commercial planes. You don't need an aeromechanical degree to fly a plane (not that I know of anyway). A mysterious virus suddenly hits mankind and BOOM you lost your job and you might need to consider other ways of making a living.

Glove sales are shooting up because of this virus, glove companies are mass hiring business/finance/admin personnel BUT the prerequisite is you need a degree, whatever the degree may be. So, in this case you could see it as a safety net if shit hits the fan kinda...

You could also think of it in other scenarios i.e. you're planning on a startup and it doesn't work out etc.

Why a ""Ticket""?
As we've discussed above, the degree is like a ticket, ""no ticket, no hire, sorry""

Important note:
We've talked about it being a ticket but please note that the ticket got brand and quality levels too!

I've been fortunate enough to work with some MNCs and for some, their hiring criteria is to only hire the from the Top 3 public universities. This is where the ""brand"" factor comes in, you bring Imperial College London ticket, everyone also interested. You bring Universiti Mangkuk ticket, even if it's super high quality, people also think twice before hiring.

Now, what is ""quality""? Quality is the skills you get from the degree. Malaysia style always like to spoon-feed, memorize etc. We're very good at repetitive tasks but when we're suddenly thrown a curve ball, half of us cry and the other half shit their pants. For example, you could have an Electrical Engineer from MIT who can do all the calculations but when the fuse in the plug burns, he/she stres cuz tak tau macam mana nak bukak plug.

It's much harder to determine the quality of the degree because you need to look into their curriculum and learning materials. People often say ""I don't use even 20% of what I learn in uni"" which in some ways is true BUT it's also better to have 19.9% of the tools you need for the job rather than 10%",2021-09-01 09:47:47
Greenappleflavor,"&gt;&gt; Well, I'm thinking right after I graduate I might start working at a hedge fund or private equity. I feel like working as a hedge fund trader, or possibly an investment banker.

This is more specific, thank you. Most people start off in IB and then they move onto private equity or start their own hedge fund. It’s not impossible to do so skipping IB, but unless you are in that field (networking), good luck doing so.


&gt;&gt; What I meant by that is that, more specifically, the stock market is prone to crashes. Just like in 2008.

What happened in 2008 was black swan and there are many pple in the finance industry specifically in investment, that can attest to having live through that from a professional stance—and they were not canned.

&gt;&gt; However, the times have changed and we may not be seeing another crash for some time, but I just felt like brining it up. Even if, hypothetically, there was some instability, it would be temporary.

There was just one in 2020, the brakers went on several times in fact. There are always market corrections but a crash is less frequent.

&gt;&gt; You were in the finance industry? Would you say your salary is good?

In, and yes, for what I do.

DeFi is a subsection of the crypto industry that allows more complex financial services than simply buying and holding an asset without the need for a centralized intermediary.*

Judging by SingulariyNet's migration to Cardano as soon as Cardano is ready to accept it, I reckon that most of that ""$95bn Ethereum business space"" is slated to fork over to Cardano within two years max.

I'd favor the latter given rock bottom interest rates and a structural shortage of treasuries in the markets (especially at the long end of the curve) due to Fed asset purchases. Some of the issuance will be purchased by those who you owe assets to so your essential just swapping actually debt (bonds) for effective debt (SS obligations). 

The taxes collected on income from retirement accounts would defease the debt. 

Alternatively if you wanted a centrally managed portfolio (similar to Canada) you just sell enough bonds to buy the non-treasury assets requires to support current retirees. Again this could help the Fed unwind it's balance sheet and provide additional long term Treasury supply. If you had a good deal of faith in the central portfolio manager (again like Canada) they can purchase income producing infrastructure assets financed by the issuance of debt.

CandleThief724,"Alright, so while waiting for Arbitrum dapps to roll out (heh), I needed some quick liquidity so I turned to AAVE *on Polygon* to open an ETH-backed CDP for some DAI.

After taking care of meatspace business there was some DAI left, so I figured: lets try to generate some yield on it! Feast your eyes on the DAI/stablecoin LP options I could find on Polygon (descending profitability):

1. IronSwap: a DEX part of a protocol (Iron Finance) that is famous for an incident where its undercollateralized stablecoin (IRON) lost its peg, and in order to compensate the protocol starting printing and selling so much of their native token (TITAN) that all investors/LP were brrrrrr-ed into bankruptcy. [Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUokre-szPg). (40-20% APY, \~$18M TVL).
2. Something called 'ApeSwap'. (25% APY, \~$1.30M TVL).
3. Wault Finance. Could not find much info on this one. Claims to be 'connecting all the DeFi features into a *Wault* ecosystem'. Apparently it's audited. Most of the Reddit posts about it (outside of their tiny sub) are from people trying to establish its legitimacy. (20% APY, $0.45M TVL).
4. Curve. Big household name from Ethereum mainnet. Coincidentally also the first dapp on the list where, after depositing the DAI, I would be confident that it's still going to be there tomorrow. (12% APY, $6.59M TVL).
5. SushiSwap/QuickSwap. Trustworthy, but with a yield barely above AAVE's DAI interest rate. (7% APY, $1M TVL).

The sheer degeneracy of some of the protocols just brings a smile to my face. Reminds me of the early days of the 'DeFi Wild West' on L1. Sketchy protocols, absurd APYs, rugpull could happen at any moment. Even better that they hold the majority of the TVL.

MachineTeaching,"&gt;So, then, the inverted yield curve has lost validity since 09' because of larger government and Federal Reserve's counter-cyclical stabilizers, resulting in false postives since 09'? Is this correct?

Well, the yield curve never was a reliable indicator at all. Ultimately what the yield curve boils down to is investor sentiment about the future. Essentially just a guess. A guess guided by thousands of people who watch markets closely and all those things, but still a guess. They can't look into the future any more than we do.

To make a stupid example to prove a point, an asteroid could crash down on the US and destroy California, no yield curve is going to predict that. Or the severity of the current pandemic for that matter.

&gt;The survival analysis was new for me and again proves the point of the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy, is this what you would say? This would imply that fed policy is effective if done correctly, but there has to be an argument against that on some level. I'm not going to argue that. I do think the fed has a much harder time fighting deflation than inflation, which makes sense why we have the policy we do today.

Yes, especially the fed is a very technocratic institution with lots of very smart people dedicated to the fed mandate as well as economics research. They by and large do a good job and get better every day. And the government as well. The extend of stimulus programs during the pandemic for example was in part based on lessons learned from the great recession and the sluggish recovery.

&gt;Taking the final citations, I take it ABCT is at best incomplete or out-of-date for an economy like today. What strikes me is the enormity of investors and businessmen, however, who use an Austrian point of reference based on sound money. but in academia maybe it is the opposite. What is the disconnect? It seems to me there should be a synthesis. Of course thinking in terms of a single firm and in terms of aggregates are totally different. I'm not sure if you have thoughts on that, but it has bugged me.

Finance people are not economists. Of course they know some stuff about the economy, but they don't have the same tools or knowledge. They work with money as well, huge sums at times, and I think that leads to overconfidence. Coupled with a lack of knowledge of what their blindspots even *are*, you at times get weird or at the very least very incomplete views. 

Ray Dalio is a good example of this. He tries to explain how the economy works and gets some things perfectly right but misses key points of other areas:

High failure rates at the beginning of life (within the manufacturer's warranty), a long period of very few failures, and high failures at the end of life - typically outside of extended warranty coverage.

That's part of the reason why they're experiencing such a profound shortage of chips right now, it's not profitable for chip fabs to spin up such old technology just for car OEMs.

2. I wouldn't invest in liquidity pools or farms without understanding impermanent loss. These are very complex investment instruments.
3. If you're planning on holding these coins for a very long time, interest rates for reputable instruments are usually highest on Ethereum mainnet. You'll pay significant fees to move the money around, but if you leave your money in for 5 years, you should easily get those fees back in interest.

Here's what I would be doing with those coins:

1. BTC: On Ethereum mainnet, Convex Finance has a Curve-based PBTC pool that's currently yielding 15.66% APR. This pool exposes you to pBTC, renBTC, sBTC, and wBTC. All these coins are pegged to BTC, so *in theory* you shouldn't experience impermanent loss in this pool. However, there's always the risk that one of the coins comes unpegged, the protocol gets hacked, etc. Disclaimer: I'm not invested in BTC at all. It's not that I don't think it will go up--I do think it will. I just think other coins (particularly ETH) will go up more, without more risk.
2. ETH: Again on Convex Finance, the ankrETH pool is currently yielding 5.99% APR. You can probably find higher APRs, but Ankr is a very reputable project in my opinion--your risk is lower here than with the BTC pool because you're only exposed to one other coin besides ETH and the coin is more reputable. Unlike the other two, I AM invested in this one pretty heavily.
3. BNB: [Venus.io](https://Venus.io) is currently yielding 4.66% on BNB. Disclaimer: I'm not personally invested in BNB and I've actually removed most of my money from the BSC ecosystem. In my opinion, the entire reason BSC was worthwhile was that it had low fees and a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. Now that both Polygon and Solana have much lower fees, there's no reason to be on BSC. Even if you're okay with BSC's fees, the Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism networks all have comparable fees, are actually decentralized (which BSC is not), and have faster-growing ecosystems. When I was involved in the BSC ecosystem, I always viewed it as a short-term investment, and the term of that investment has passed for me: I'm overall pessimistic about the possibility of Binance revitalizing this ecosystem when there are so many alternatives that are just clearly better.",2021-09-06 01:28:01

crypto-devk,"If you put stETH and ETH into a Curve pool, the stETH/ETH will no longer be yours, it will belong to the pool.

However, in return, you'll get a token crvstETH, which represents your proportional ownership of the pool. E.g, if the pool was 999 ETH/stETH, and you deposit 1 ETH, you'll get 0.1% ownership of the pool, including any future profits.

As long as 1 ETH = 1 stETH, and Curve's smart contract doesn't have any bugs, this means you'll never lose more than you put in.

You still get the staking rewards for stETH, but be aware that since the pool tries to be 50% ETH and 50% stETH, you'll only get half the rewards. So you have to make sure that the LP income from fees, and any yield farming rewards make up for that.

You can also stake into convex finance for additional rewards.

If you're only depositing a small amount (or if in your jurisdiction, capital gains tax is lower than income tax), I'd recommend depositing into a yield aggregator like yearn, pickle, or harvest.

Moonriver is currently at a sub $250mill marketcap. It's layer 1 season right now with pretty much every major layer 1 going to the moon right now. Luna, Solana, ETH, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony etc all are layer 1 blockchains that have had a massive run up due to defi being built on top of them. Now look at their multi billion dollar marketcap compared to the sub 250 mill of Moonriver. 

They're already listed on exchanges that do decent volume such as Kraken, Gate, and Kucoin. It's just a matter of time for these 200+ projects to deploy and drive up the value of Moonriver. Wouldn't be surprised to see AAVE, Beefy, Curve, balancer(may of already announced that they're deploying I'll have to double check), and other big name defi players to come on board not to mention new projects. 

Am I saying that MOVR will instantly blow up to the level of layer 1's such as Solana or Luna? No, it's at such a low marketcap that it doesn't have to. Even getting to a 1 billion marketcap is a 4X from here",2021-09-06 08:22:16
rampage1998,"Thank you everybody, you are amazing people and your advices are very helpful. Appreciate all the helps. Maybe this topic is also useful for the newcomers. I surprised how helpful and friendly this community here and the crypto ecosystem is. (Except for some obvious scammers).

I read several guide/tutorials about Defi. Watched several Youtube videos.   
  
Then I tried some practice and tried the following:  
On BSC chain:  
1 unit to (manual) CAKE pool on PCS and farm on autofarm at 90.45% (it seems to be a little better than the Auto Cake pool on PCS);  
3 units to WBNB-CAKE LP on PCS and farm on autofarm at 50.69%;  
1 unit to  WBNB-BELT on PCS and farm on autofarm at 137.65%;  
1 unit to WBNB-CAKE LP on MDEX and farm on autofarm at 74.35%, however their website is constantly error time out for me so maybe I should take it out. 

On Polygon chain:  
Tried to add 0.5 unit LP to the WETH-WMATIC on Quickswap and farm at autofram at 28.57%, but their website seems to be rather slow for me, and I just saw actually WETH-WMATIC on Sushi can give 35.61% at autofram, I think I'll move to Sushi instead.   
For my ETH deposit on AAVE on Polygon, I tried to borrow around 30% of the value for DAI,  bought some MATIC with it, then redeposit on AAVE. But the interest is rather low now. 

On mainnet:  
I looked at staking at Lido then maybe farm/yield at Curve finance, the rates seems to be just the same or even less then staking BETH at Binance (I got around 8.59% I think). 

Looked at stETH vault on yearn.finance but the cost is insane it's like $431 / 0.11ETH just for deposit, not to mention I heard withdraw fee is even more. Guess I need more crypto holdings to use that. 

Will read and watch more stuff to decide what's the next move. Defi has its risks also comes with high return. It seems to be interesting and has helped crypto reach the new top and even higher for sure. 

Thank you everyone.",2021-09-06 09:30:18
Jake_FromStateFarm27,"California you'd make that much and more except the cost of living is through the roof so it's really the equivalent of alot less. 

I would reccomend NJ and NY state. Cost of living is also significantly increasing there as well and the market is competitive but if you're getting a masters you'll be promising in NJ and meet the state standards requirement in New York. 

Alot of NJ schools especially the sciences pay starting 55k (I'm history and make between the 50-60k for reference in a declining subject) you will scale very well in NJ and it will be easier to find a position as well. Unsure about NY scale but it's a state law for teachers to obtain their masters within 4 years I believe so you'll be ahead of the curve and they may even help finance it.

If you want to increase your pay scale you can do what's called a plus 30 and that can increase your pay between 5-10k (usually only 5) it's essentially a 30 credit program in education/admin/leadership studies. Or other more intensive PD programs and research can add a bit to your pay scale. Most of all is really time and whatever you choose to contribute and add as an educator.

But, yeah as other people said, the best litmus test is contest math. 

Statistics is important. Honestly, a textbook covering simple statistics, and teaching how to use excel for regressions etc would easily be within reach of a somewhat mathematically inclined 13 year old. I think I actually used this one:

Javascript and html5 canvas can be an easy way to get into making cool things with programming.

Dave-1066,"A reasonable time frame is two years. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’d have to wait two years to be profitable, but it does mean that the learning curve for forex is long. And it needs to be long- it’s a vast field. 

The major areas you need to cover are fundamental analysis, technical analysis, the varied styles of trading, the nature of each currency, and finally the *process itself*. 

The latter is a very big subject and covers everything from time frames to risk management to leverage and spread and the many set-ups. A person can have a strong understanding of trading theory, but it’s the actual process of trading that so many newer traders mess up. Small issues like simply checking spreads or making sure to not blindly jump into the most volatile periods of the day - stuff that books often don’t even bother to discuss. 

A few are fortunate to have had a previous background in finance, but it’s not the colossal advantage that some think it is. Even with significant financial experience in the institutional setting you find that retail trading is a very very different game. 

The simplest answer, for your purposes, is to just start a demo account and trade it while doing something like the babypips course and reading Kathy Lien, Brent Donnelly, and Adam Grimes. The vast majority of all other forex authors are frauds with no formal market training or education. 

Keep the demo account going, watch some quality content, keep studying, and six months later you should be in a position to go live and start losing money. Kidding. After six months you ought to be ready to stick some money online and start trading a hyper-cautious style. You could go live sooner, but I don’t recommend it- arrogance is the downfall of a massive percentage of retail traders who simply got lucky in their demo environment. 

If you can bank lots of small profits and grow your account slowly then you’re ahead of the 80%+ who lose it all.",2021-09-06 14:24:32

Companies that are using the ledger tech for purposes other than crypto are the ones I'd keep an eye on, specifically those in network management and cybersecurity if you want my opinion.  When we make the switch to IPv6, DNS is going to become all important and DNS is going to become too great a liability to keep in it current form.

yes_no_ok_maybe,"This isn’t actuary math but did involve a lot of algebra - I recently updated the dynamic lapse formula for our company’s retirement business.

It ended up of the form y = ae^(bx) + c, with the parameters calibrated to run through key points on a lapse vs rate differential curve (the rate difference is our crediting rate vs a competitor’s rate).

There was also an adjustment for termination provision (example: market value adjustment) and I had to find equivalent adjustments for two other exit provisions based on the time value of money. And then actually for one of them we didn’t go with pure mathematical equivalence, we introduced an “irrationality” factor because of feedback from our sales team, and justified it using concepts from behavioral finance.

What else? Oh also as part of that project we updated the competitor rate proxy in our model which involved finding rates from a real competitor over the last 5 years, then back testing market rates that would have served as good proxies. It needed to be fairly simple so I tested treasury and corporate bond yields at different tenors &amp; credit qualities, and the test was trying to find the lowest standard deviation of the difference between proxy rate and actual rate (in other words, which one had the most similar shape).

The Citadel is a physical symbol of the capitalist system, like Wall Street. But Rick-C137’s scope of power is not just in the citadel. 

C-137 Rick made a Central Finite Curve (metaphor for the centralized financial system) that captured all the universes in which Ricks were the smartest person in their respective universe, and built a closed off system within the infinite universe where these powerful Ricks abused Mortys and other Ricks as expendable resources like labor and energy. 

Like a founding father, Rick C-137 assumed that everyone else would be stuck in this system forever. Until Evil Morty became President of the Citadel, he realized the only way out of the whole system was to escape the Central Finite Curve. 

Even the protagonist Morty wouldn’t escape the system (leave his Rick) because the system makes him feel dependent on it. Evil Morty is the only Morty smart enough to understand why Mortys think they need Ricks, but he’s built different (kinda like Apes) so he leaves the system behind and warps out.

KoolAid90,"I pursued an advanced degree in finance at a school whose MBA is T25.  As such I took many classes that had MBA students in them. All the professors I interacted with had PhDs from top schools, with many from the M7. In reference to an underprivileged background and having to essentially grow on my own, I came to many realizations. Some of them are below.

1. Schools get a lot of funding for research.
2. My professors (PhDs) increase their standing by publishing and researching.
3. A lot of professors don't want to teach and would rather just research instead of teaching. I honestly don't blame them. Even if I am getting paid $150k - $200k, I don't want to deal with students.
4. Professors don't like office hours because people interrupt their research. Not to mention they probably ask why this student didn't get the material the first time I verbally glossed over it?
5. It is easy to simply regurgitate very, very basic concepts than useful, substantive material that can be practically applied. Further, to use the same powerpoint, semester after semester created by a third party vendor or previous course. Then when exam time comes, ask for the application of the very basic concepts to very theoretical situations that frequently do not really happen in the real world.

Case: Learning about the spot rate / forward curve. I had to watch youtube, read the textbook, and peruse online PDFs / E-books from the university library. Now as a finance professional, I realized that back then I didn't even know what a Par Curve was and that the notation itself which was presented in class was not industry standard.

TLDR: Yes, you have to learn almost everything by yourself. In my experience the very basic of the basics is presented in class. The homework is a stretch. The exam then often asks for the basics of the basics to be applied to very unique, theoretical situations making it extremely difficult.",2021-09-07 21:32:29

SCATesteR,"I made this transition about 4 years ago, was a systems administrator now working in risk management.


First thing to call out based on your post above, when you switch to a GRC role, you are not necessarily going from a ""IT Guys supporting computers"" to a ""Guys supporting IT guy's"" role, your transitioning to a ""Guys protecting the company through direction"" role. As a security focused person, there will be times that based on regulation requirements, risk assessments, audit findings, etc. that you will dictate that changes are needed that may not jive with the teams who are ""hands on the keyboard"" supporting the systems, but ultimately hoping putting the company in a more secure position. 


That being said here's my list of pro's and cons':

Pro's:

* Your technical background will help drive security conversation, both through driving policy/controls and (if you go the audit route) testing of controls. 
* your going to see more of the business then you normally would have in your tech role, because of what GRC roles require. 
* While (and this is personal experience) I do have to work later then I would like to, I'm not on call/rotation. 
* Financially,  one of the best fields to be in

Con's/Tough area's:

* You are going to look like the ""bad guy"" in some scenarios to tech teams, because ""you don't understand what we are actually doing"". This is where your tech background will really help drive and make that conversation more digestible. 
* Your going to be expected to be confident in your choices and justification behind them. Something simple as changing a password policy requirement can have a huge impact on user experience, helpdesk calls, etc. all for the belief that you think it will make the company more secure and is in alignment with best practices. 
* Be expected to speak and relay information a Director+ level who is not technical what so ever. Not everyone that is involved with security is techy (HR, Finance, etc.), you need to be able to relay well formulated information to them in a manner they can easily digest to get the full picture. 

As far as the rush hours and hard times, I think your going to find that, depending on the role and company, that will be pretty typical. I work at a financial institution and work roughly 9-10 hours a day just to make sure I get everything done and ready, but I also am in charge of risk management for one of our BU's. Could I stick to an 8 hour day, sure, but I also like to not stress about deadlines and stay ahead of the curve. 

All in all, is the transition difficult, no its not. If anything it'll help you because now your on the opposite side of the fence and rather being told do x because policy y, your now helping ensure / develop / test against policy Y. I know this post is somewhat ""vague"" but until you know exactly what you want to do in security, getting to those finer details of what to expect can be a little difficult to pinpoint.",2021-09-07 22:34:48

Coal could spiral to USD 200/t this winter

Nathan Witkop

3-4 minutes

Benchmark coal prices have tripled off last year’s pandemic-induced lows to scale 13-year highs approaching USD 180/t in Asia and USD 170/t in Europe. 

Energyscan highlighted a combination of supply and demand pressures heading into the peak consumption season that risked extending this year’s rally in both basins.

Inventories in key regions including China, India, Europe and the US were at multi-year lows on the back of a strong recovery in power demand. 

Demand has surged thanks to Asian economic recovery, as well as record high costs for gas and carbon in Europe that had priced more coal back into power generation, said Energyscan.

Its analysts noted a 41% year-on-year rise in coal-fired generation so far in 2021 across France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the UK. 

German coal-fired generation had jumped to a EUR 20/MWh advantage over gas-fired competition by September, reversing a slight advantage enjoyed by gas up until summer, according to Energyscan estimates of lower efficiency coal and gas plants. 

“Despite record high CO2 prices in Europe, coal-fired power plants are running baseload in several countries as they are largely more competitive than gas-fired ones for spot and short-term delivery, a situation likely to remain relevant this winter with rising gas demand for heating purposes.” 

Chinese restocking needs
A similarly tight situation was unfolding in China, the world’s largest coal user responsible for more than half global consumption.  

Chinese thermal power demand – overwhelmingly met with coal – was up 15% year on year over the first seven months of 2021 even as the country’s own coal production has weakened since June to begin falling below the output of the past two years amid regulatory mine closures.  

This has opened a gaping need to restock, with Chinese total coal inventories of around 100m tonnes standing at their lowest level in at least five years and less than half where they were in the pre-pandemic year of 2019. 

“In the short term, restocking activity at Chinese coal plants is likely to provide support to the Pacific seaborne market,” Energyscan said. 

“The USD 200/t mark could be hit for spot coal prices in both basins in case of further unplanned constraints on the supply side.”

Exporters hampered
Global seaborne suppliers have struggled to meet import needs due to a combination of poor investment in new production, Covid disruptions to workforces as well as unfavourable weather conditions in major producers like Indonesia and Australia. 

China’s ban on Australian coal has additionally reshuffled typical supply routes, adding to congestion and freight costs in a shipping market already stressed by rebounding demand for other commodities. 

“Looking at the forward curve, we can see that this tightness is spreading through 2022 maturities on the back of growing reluctance from Western banks to finance coal upstream assets,” said the report.

The main downside risks to coal this winter would likely come from a retreat in gas prices – via an increase in Russian gas exports to Europe – or from a significant improvement in Chinese supply, it added.",2021-09-08 12:16:50

Definitely find a new job, and be open to what's out there but do not jump ship with rose colored goggles right into the next thing available.I learned that big salary increases tend to come from switching jobs. Even a small increase could help relieve some stress.

I also reevaluated all the things I thought I wanted and started talking/journaling my way out of wanting those things. I committed to using up what I already had (skincare, food) and not trying new trendy things. I saved a ton of money this way. I made a pinterest board about minimalist philosophy, about things like saving time cleaning, easier time moving, saving money. When I wanted something, I wrote it on a ""wants"" list and gave it some time. I ended up not buying most of the things because I was obsessing over something in the moment but it didn't stick.

TL,DR: Blair was instrumental in increasing private sector involvement in the economy (especially the finance sector). The labour party also started to question the welfare-consensus of the post-war-era. The fall (and perceived failure) of the eastern bloc was used to discredit state intervention. The rhetoric of solidarity employed during the election campaigns never translated into policy and Labour kept sticking to the economic model laid out by the Tories.

I have to admit, that calling him an outright Neoliberal is somewhat polemic and probably not entirely accurate. But one would have expected a social democrat to reverse the Thatcherite reforms of the prior governments, but that didn't happen. Blair was slightly ahead of the curve but consistent with a broader shift in European social democracy that accepted the neoliberal consensus instead of pushing back.

doducduy96,"So you have a paid off Nissan, you pay what $30/tank? Now you want to finance a $45,000 Model 3 at lets assume a 4% APR for 60 months for the amount of , that’ll put you at $829 per month and the total cost of the car including all interest will be $49,725. So that’ll be a $46,725 upgrade from your $3000 Nissan. Assuming it costs you $30/tank for the Nissan and $5/full charge for the Tesla, it’ll take 1869 full tank of gas or 467,250 miles @250 miles per full tank for the gas saving to offset the upgrade cost. If taking into account the repair cost it’ll also take the Nissan 10 engine replacements or 10 transmission replacements to offset the upgrade cost to a Model 3. 
Not to mention the hidden cost of insurance, you can pay $30/month liability on the $3000 paid off Nissan while you’ll have to pay full comprehensive coverage on the Tesla which can cost $100 on the low end to $300+ per month. At this point you are paying $1000+ just for the car per month. 
Here’s the final point. The Nissan has already reached the bottom of its depreciation curve, as long as it drives and has A/C you can always sell it for $3000. The Tesla, while they are remarkably excellent in holding their value if they only have modest mileage, the mileage you rack up while doing delivery gigs will 100% depreciate your car just like any other cars. Nobody wants a 80k mile Tesla. 

If you want to buy a Tesla AND CAN COMFORTABLY AFFORD IT just buy it. Don’t try to rationalize the decision with the delivery gigs.

mvw2,"College is a light peppering of the basics but also a lot of stuff you'll probably never use.  It's good for fundamentals, for understanding, and building the skill set to research and problem solve.  However, most of what you'll know is learned on the job over years of time.

Depending on your scope of work, engineering can be wildly different.  Your engineering experience will be mostly based on the employer that hires you.  They will be the biggest driver in what you do, the scope of work, work-life balance, etc.  Everything good and bad about engineering will almost entirely depend on who employs you.  This also means it's pretty easy to change said good or bad experience simply by changing employers.

Personally, I've aimed for smaller companies and companies that are turnkey manufacturers with a wide range of products (say 50+ unique products).  This means my work is broad in scope.  The engineering department will be small.  Engineering as a function is basically everything under the sun.  And one gets to have their hands in just about everything.  The downside is much of it is trial by fire because you will do it all and be expected to do it all.  Want to know how a punch turret or laser works?  Don't worry, you'll learn.  Want to know more about welding?  They'll teach you and tell you when you've messed up.  Want to get better at DFM and DFA?  Don't worry, it will be hands on and intimate.  Hey, can you find an alternate vendor for part X?  The press brake is being goofy; go take a look at it and see if you can fix it.  There's a customer on the phone for product Y looking for tech support; do you have free time to help him out?  A customer's asking for a custom quote similar to product Z but they want these 7 changes; can you get me a costed quote for the new design by the end of the day?  We have to redesign product Q due to new UL requirements.  You have one month to make the design change and get the product recertified through UL for production scheduled next month.  We're introducing new product T, and we need you to lay out and set up the new production line.  We want this up and running in two weeks. Oh, and we also need SOPs and test procedures made.

Now depending on the type of person you are, that either makes your nether regions feel funny in the special way or frightens the hell out of you.

The ""what"" of your work almost entirely depends on the employer.  It's almost to the point where your title doesn't matter.  I'm a manufacturing engineer by degree.  I was hired on as a manufacturing engineer by my first employer.  I did not do manufacturing engineering.  Heck, I've almost done zero manufacturing engineering my entire career.  90% of my career has been design engineering, product development, design spec through full scale production stuff.  But I've also been manufacturing support for the factory floor and personnel.  I've been vendor sourcing.  I've been tech support.  I've done some aspects of finance.  I've worn a lot of hats, usually all at the same time, and much of it has absolutely nothing to do with my degree.

What about the romance, the joy, the passion of engineering.  What about the fantasy of it all?

Well, that depends.  Much of what makes engineering actually great is finding an employer that can give you the experience you want.  Half of this is just you knowing what you actually want and like doing.  The second half is finding an employer who can actually give you that experience.  I've been pretty lucky.  I spent 10 years in college figuring out my half.  I lucked out with my first employer on the type of work, although the pay and work-life balance was terrible.  Regular 60-65 hour weeks was the norm.  Several 15 hour days a week was the norm.  ""Optional"" (mandatory) Saturdays was the norm.  I learned a TON, but it was only a temporary good.  I moved on.  My current employer is 40 hours a week, and it's almost hard to get more.  I have the same huge scope of work I like in a much more relaxed environment.  I just go to work and play every day.  I haven't really actually ""worked"" a day in 10 years.  I just play and they keep paying me. It's a good place.  The company has a good blend of people and culture, and the size and type of company gives me the work scope and roles I personally like and seek out.

If you want to fulfill the fantasy, you need to spend the time to know yourself, what you want, and what you enjoy.  Then you need to spend the time seeking out an employer that can give you the work experience that meets your desires.  Both can take time, and you will need to be flexible.

What about the actual engineering.  What about the actual work?

Well, work is an entire pizza.  College is the small scattered pieces of parmesan you sprinkle on top.  College is tiny, bite-sized pieces of stuff, but you never really experience the whole thing.  You are never tasked with a 400 hour project from start to finish.  Even a capstone is like two weeks of actual work, which is effectively nothing.  8 hours today, 8 hours tomorrow, 40 hours this week, 40 hours next week, this entire month, and all of next month, 300 hours solid all spent on one task.  You'll feel this for the first time once you're in your career.  The scale is relatively huge compared to anything you've done, and the time is immense.  You might be on and off again on the same project over an entire year or two, the same project for 2 years straight through various stages of development and progression into production.  That's half your time at college, just working on one thing.

Another aspect is rapid learning.  Early on, you are not expected to know everything.  They expect this.  However, they do expect you to learn rapidly.  Write everything down.  Fill notebooks with stuff.  Make spreadsheets.  There will be a lot of content coming to you in order for you to be competent at your job.  You will need to learn this stuff, memorize it and/or record it.  You shouldn't have to be taught twice.  You will be hands-on with a LOT of new stuff, and there's a huge learning curve.  It's also often steep.  You will be overwhelmed.  You will feel overwhelmed.  This is normal.  You will also make lots of mistakes.  You will, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Mistakes are education.  Each and every one of them teaches you something new. Do not feel bad about making a mistake.  Only feel bad about repeating that mistake.

Impostor syndrome is real.  One crazy part about being an engineer is everyone has an expectation of you as a smart problem solver.  They have this tendency for you to know everything, to fix every problem, and they will demand it from you all the time.  Early on, you will very much not feel like this person.  You aren't.  For the most part, you just fake it.  You rely on your skills in college to research and problem solve.  You both learn and solve their problems at the same time.  And you get better.  You keep getting better as more problems come and more solutions are found.  You will often question their sanity as they blindly trust you.  You will find it unsettling and weird for them to so willfully accept your solutions.  You will just be winging it for years and years, but they will be happy that you fixed their issue every time.  And you did.  You did fix every single one of them.

What you don't often realize is exactly how much you grow over time.  Over the years of feeling under skilled and bewildered by their blind trust in your ability to basically Google their problems away, you will get good.  You will have accrued a wealth of knowledge and skills, and you do grow into that perception of what an engineer is.  You might not be that at first, but holy hell you will be in the end.

It takes about 2 years to get comfortable in a job.  It doesn't happen overnight.  By about 10 years, you will be highly skilled at what you do, exceptional in your talents.  

How good you are depends on your employer and scope of work.  Much of your early years will be learning.  You will want to work for employers that are devices of continued growth.  If you are stagnant, if you are not learning anything new, and if your scope and responsibility remains small, leave.  Don't waste your time being some place that doesn't help you grow and hone your skills.  You NEED to be able to do this in your early years.  It will help you immensely later on when you start hunting for a more permanent home.  If they are not adding value to your career, change employers.  In conjunction, I also suggest asking for more work, more projects, to be taught new stuff, to get hands-on experience with machinery, operations, etc.  The more open and eager you are to your boss and company, the more opportunities you have.  It often does mean more work and more responsibility, but this is where growth happens.  It's paid off for me twice though.  I learned a ton and have become highly skilled in my craft.  I become the one guy the entire company goes to for help and answers, and I've been promoted into management twice due to this character.  I'm only 10 years into my career, and I've gotten to the point where my boss is the CEO of the company, twice.  I regularly work on multi-million dollar projects and think nothing about it.  And 10 years ago, I was a wet behind the ears, green kid who was freaked out about his first task.  Within the next 10 years, I expect two things.  I expect to own my own business, mainly just to have fun, and I expect to be CEO of a company that's not my side business.

You build your empire.  You build it on effort, hard work, and dedication.  You build it on positive attitude and no mental walls.  You build it striving to be better than you can image today.  You become something better than what you are capable of idealizing.  It all starts at the beginning and defined by the path you take.",2021-09-09 12:05:44
FourFourFakinTwo,"SS: El Salvador’s bitcoin gambit has heaped fresh pressure on the country’s debt market after investors began selling its bonds earlier this year on rising concerns about the government of President Nayib Bukele. On the first day of El Salvador’s trailblazing adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, the cryptocurrency’s global price slumped by more than 10 per cent. Undeterred, Bukele tweeted that his small central American nation had increased its holdings. “Buying the dip. 150 new coins added. #Bitcoinday,” he wrote, adding a winking emoji. Bond traders were not impressed. A fresh round of selling this week pushed the yield on long-dated Salvadoran debt issued in dollars close to 11 per cent while shorter maturities were offering up to 14 per cent. Prior to Bukele announcing the crypto move in June, Salvadoran long-dated yields were around 8.5 per cent. In a further sign of market stress, the yield curve on El Salvador’s bonds inverted on Tuesday, meaning that short-dated debt was priced below long-dated debt. “That in itself is never a good sign,” said Dean Tyler, head of global markets at BancTrust. “It shows people are starting to question the viability of the shorter end of the curve.” Investors were not convinced by the risky and expensive bet on bitcoin by what is one of the poorer countries in the western hemisphere with an annual GDP of $25bn. The coin’s value has swung from $10,000 to $64,000 in the past year, and is back down at $46,000 now. Bukele’s rushed plan to introduce the volatile digital asset for everyday transactions made headlines around the world. “If I told you I’m now going to pay your salary in bitcoin, you’d have a lot of questions,” said Michael Schlein, chief executive of Accion, a non-profit that invests in tech for financial inclusion. “The notion of poor people keeping savings in crypto is absurd. It’s wildly volatile and you’re talking about the most vulnerable people in the world.” Weekly newsletter For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click But traders said the latest slump in Salvadoran bond prices was not only down to nerves over what could prove to be a reckless crypto gamble; money managers are also troubled by the president’s attempts to increase his power. Late on Friday night the Salvadoran supreme court ruled that the president could seek a second consecutive term — a decision condemned by the US. It comes months after the Bukele-controlled congress fired five supreme court justices and replaced them with loyalists. “The market had priced in the bitcoin news,” said Kevin Daly, investment director at Aberdeen Standard. “The news that really shook the market was [Bukele’s] gerrymandering things to run for re-election.” This, he said, had pushed the risk premium demanded by investors for holding Salvadoran debt to the highest level of any solvent emerging market. Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Amherst Pierpont, said the court ruling had complicated the chances of El Salvador agreeing a new IMF programme and securing access to much-needed external funds for its dollarised economy. “It’s all about the Bukele risk premium,” she said. “It’s all centralised decision-making and he’s not surrounded by a top-notch team of technocrats.” The IMF has opposed the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, citing risks to financial stability, consumer protection and the environment. “The most direct cost of widespread adoption of a cryptoasset such as Bitcoin is to macroeconomic stability . . . Monetary policy would lose bite. Central banks cannot set interest rates on a foreign currency,” it wrote in July. “Without robust anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures, cryptoassets can be used to launder ill-gotten money, fund terrorism and evade taxes,” it added. Recommended The FT ViewThe editorial board El Salvador’s dangerous gamble on bitcoin El Salvador needs $3.5bn-$4bn in foreign funding a year to finance its deficit, cover the costs of coping with the pandemic and roll over existing debt. The government has said that the introduction of bitcoin as legal tender would cost around $200m initially. It last issued a bond in July 2020 but has not been able to tap the market again since, Morden added. “Bukele is still running a fiscal deficit of about double the pre-Covid level and debt is 90 per cent of GDP.” With a large debt repayment of $800m looming in January 2023, Bukele has limited room for manoeuvre. Morden said a recent increase in the country’s IMF allocation of special drawing rights — a reserve asset that allows the lender to supplement member countries’ official reserves — would provide short-term relief but after that, the government might be forced to turn to its own citizens to fund itself. “The locals are the lenders of last resort,” she said. “But if they aren’t willing to lend, there may be a shift towards coercive lending” such as potentially nationalising private pensions, or even capital controls. Or, as Daly put it: “There’s a real risk this all ends in tears.”",2021-09-09 17:16:04
gorbachevshammer,"
&gt;I actually don't care a great deal about defending austerity, my point was just that you can advocate for the rights of social groups and at the same time support fiscal policy that won't necessarily benefit them, it's called the doctrine of double effect.

It's not that austerity doesn't benefit them, it's that austerity does disproportionate harm to them, while providing no significant benefit to society. The principle of double effect requires that an act do good while doing harm unintentionally. This both misrepresents the overall impacts of austerity, and the typical underlying notions behind it.


&gt;I would rather live in a country in which most people can eat than one which is more strictly equitable on which most people can't eat. 

No clue why you're saying this as if they are the only two options.


&gt;It's not really rocket science, they nationalised everything they could, overspent on their fossil fuel industry running up to a glut and then printed an obscene amount of Bolivars in an attempt to dog their way out of their crisis. This wouldn't have happened if they had an economically conservative government. 

This is a gross oversimplification if Venezuela's situation. No amount of austerity would have fixed the impact of plummetting oil prices on a single resource economy, it just would have hastened it's downfall. The inability of the Government to undertake relaxed fiscal policy is one of the factors which exacerbated the Great Depression in the US.


&gt;Not necessarily, have you ever looked into Ireland's economy? They weren't far off a few third world countries in the 90s and now they're one of the greatest success stories of the last 20 years. They have stronger welfare programs than many countries with higher corporate tax rate paid for by tax revenue created through jobs in the finance sector. Super common in tax havens aswell. 

I'm not sure what your argument here is, Ireland's economy isn't conservative by any means. Furthermore, Ireland's national debt per Capita is the highest in the EU. Unless you're attempting to make the laffer curve argument, which has been debunked repeatedly.


&gt;When I said market socialism I meant State Socialism which is very much an ML philosophy.

You're making yourself look even more uninformed. China is explicitly not a state socialist nation, it's a heavily regulated state capitalist nation by design. The goal of revisionist china is to exploit capitalism in order to develop to a state where a transition to socialism is feasible.

&gt; Trying to argue that the CCP isn't ideologically left wing because they have markets is definitely a no true Scotsman fallacy. 


The issue isn't that the CCP has markets or that the CCP isnt ideologically left wing. A market socialist society has markets and is still left wing. The issue is the ownership structure of capital in China, which is certainly not socialist. A governing party can be ideologically left aligned while not currently undertaking socialist reforms.",2021-09-10 00:26:37

illram,"As far as getting everything off RH, I’d do that ASAP in whatever the most cost effective manner is for doing that.

As far as exchanges vs elsewhere, my quick explanation: (Tl;dr, stake your ETH yourself then use your liquid staked tokens to earn more ETH) 

1. As far as exchanges go, I like Gemini. I used Kraken in the past, they were fine too. Honestly I haven’t used a centralized exchange in so long I can’t comment on how they currently stack up, but if this is what you want to do, pick whatever one has the best eth staking\earning options (I believe Kraken and Coinbase have staking, while Gemini has an “earn” interest account) and whichever has the smoothest cash deposit options for you. But you will be limited to whatever their APY is and if you stake on Coinbase or Kraken I believe there is nothing else you can do with your ETH during the lockup phase. Safest option, probably, but also least lucrative.

2. For other non exchange options, you can either lend your ETH on a centralized platform like Celsius, a decentralized one like Compound, or you can stake in a service like Lido or Rocketpool and earn whatever their APY is. Lending to Celsius is straightforward and definitely a set it and forget it thing, but I’d use a staking service that provides you a liquid token, rather than just lend your ETH. Staking supports the network and with services like Rocketpool or Lido, you can use your synthetic ETH tokens that they give you to represent your stake elsewhere in the defi ecosystem, like Curve or Yearn or Pickle finance to earn additional yield. 

Personally I’d go with option 2 and do something like Rocketpool. Then when you get more comfortable and learn more about the defi space that is built on top of your synthetic staked ETH (among other things), you can put your rETH or stETH or sETH to work.",2021-09-10 14:45:50

**Quirks:** Hard to Pilot, Difficult to Maintain, Bad Reputation (Inner Sphere), Accurate Weapon (LRM 10)

**Overview:** Product of a long and (questionably) distinguished design philosophy, the 49th iteration of the odd discus-shaped Avrocar was originally developed by the Rim Worlds Republic as a fast scout and harasser.  While only just entering production when Kerensky conquered the Republic, the first production run was discovered in a mothballed semi-concealed factory centuries later.  While sourcing parts to resume production is difficult in the Periphery, the original production run is being offered for sale to finance the operation.

**Capabilities:** Lightly armored and fragile as most hovercraft, the Avrocar relies heavily on its high speed for protection.  The turret-mounted LRM 10 provides respectable firepower with plentiful range, but leaves the craft heavily dependent on ammunition for its effectiveness. A single turret-mounted medium laser provides backup, but crews are generally warned not to get into range to use it.  The designers plainly intended to make use of advanced Star League technologies, the turret includes mounting points for an Artemis system, and a large empty electronics bay in the hull would easily fit an active probe or ECM system, though no such systems are installed on the production model.  In more impressive, and difficult to repair, terms, the turret is on the underside of the craft, the entire under-curve of the hull is suspended from a magnetic rail, allowing it to whip about to any angle with shocking speed, though the system is a power-hog and vulnerable to terrain as much as enemy fire.

**Designer Comments:** I used a slightly different load-out (2 LRM 5s instead of LRM 10, Medium Laser forward instead of turret mounted, added TAG &amp; armor) in a MegaMek/MekHQ campaign.  Other than MegaMek's cheating in favor of the bot to disable any/all of my vehicles upon looking at them harshly, it performed fairly well.  Fragile as all get out, but usually able to find cover and hide, with fast VTOLs as spotters for indirect fire.  Moment of glory was mission-killing a Timber Wolf with a single LRM volley to the back... 2 LRMs through armor into an ammo bin.  Conceptually its based on its namesake, the Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar.",2021-09-11 09:23:19

TigerInKS,"That EdgeHD 8 will certainly be more stable on the EQ6 than the C11 you were asking about before.  But now you're not getting any more light grasp for DSOs visually (assuming that's still your interest) than the 8"" dob you have and you're still trying to get into AP with a long focal length scope.  Were you planning on getting rid of the dob to finance this endeavor, or are you planning on running two separate rigs?

Everything I've read and been told about getting into DSO AP (and I'm guessing since you're doing research you've read the same things) is that starting out at long focal lengths is a recipe for frustration (guiding tolerances, polar align tolerances, seeing effects, mount stability, etc.)  They are issues that can be overcome, certainly, but you're giving yourself the steepest learning curve.

If you're only planning on doing planetary AP, this would be fine (heck, go for the EdgeHD 9.25 if you've got the $$).  If you really want to get into DSO AP, and it were my money, I'd keep the dob for visual and change the scope in this list to something like an 80mm triplet.",2021-09-11 20:56:35

Usmonster,"copying from one of my older comments because it goes deeper:


The Citadel is a physical symbol of the capitalist system, like Wall Street. But Rick-C137’s scope of power is not just in the citadel. 

C-137 Rick made a Central Finite Curve (metaphor for the centralized financial system) that captured all the universes in which Ricks were the smartest person in their respective universe, and built a closed off system within the infinite universe where these powerful Ricks abused Mortys and other Ricks - using them as expendable resources like labor, energy, or partners for adventures.

As a founding father, Rick C-137 assumed that everyone else would be stuck in this system forever. 

Until Evil Morty became President of the Citadel, he realized there was no way to fix the whole system since it was rigged against him. Evil Mortys only option was to escape the Central Finite Curve entirely. 

This might be the only time in the series that I can remember Rick getting outplayed. 

Even the protagonist Morty wouldn’t escape the system (leave his Rick) because the system makes him feel dependent on it. Evil Morty is the only Morty smart enough to understand why Mortys think they need Ricks, but he’s built different (kinda like Apes) so he leaves the system behind and warps out.

My take: The episode is a metaphor for GameStop leaving the fiat financial system (possibly even destroying it knowing there’s an infinite risk potential) and entering the world of decentralized finance. Wen GameStop NFT?",2021-09-13 00:12:12
csasker,"But then you again miss the point why people have a growing amount of argument against ETH, because they want to use, lets call it ETH/EVM style applications(or just blockchains, as seen now with Solana)  without much problem or cost, decentralization is not so very important for them. They see it from their perspective of what they want to use, not as some philosophical technological goal, and this is really not addressed by many ETH users or developers either in a good and friendly understanding way

And like I wrote in this several times and never got an answer to, decentralization is a range and not an absolute and this is another point that is widely ignored that good enough in software is usually what wins.

And it is solving things, since users like it more so it both solves scaling problems and solves how to onboard users who dont want to pay 100-200$ for a simple trade or even more for something like unstaking on Curve finance. This is in a way the same BTC maxi mindset, that they don't just realize how someone might be equally happy about using USDT or some XRP token for payments vs BTC, because its 100 vs 93% decentralization but in the end the user gets his product or service.",2021-09-13 04:23:59

I think you are going to have to decide if you are willing to take on the responsibility of providing for the both of you or not. It sounds like you guys are polar opposites from a finance perspective and that might not be a bad thing. Money is a necessary evil, be careful not to be ruled by it.

Being single with a fat bank account is also a very lonely place to be.

I am very thankful to my partner as she will always push the envelope and the budget and 95% of the time I am thankful for it, maybe not immediately but I always come round. Its about the journey and not only the destination, someone with different views and goals will provide you with balance. A partnership is exactly that, both people's needs and wants will need to be considered, not just the ones or the others.

Try not to plan to far ahead and if you do be a little more flexible. Plans seldom work out exactly the way you want them to, that is just life. This does not mean you should not plan, just don't get too upset if everything does not go according to said plan.

I think you are still fairly young, and you are still going to receive crazy curve balls, trust me on this one. They will make you feel like your plans are completely derailing. The main thing here is always remember, life is the thing that happens while we try and execute our plans and you don't get a 2nd chance.

pupuupup,"They are supply-demand APY.

When too many people put their liquidity in, but few people use it (swap the USDC to/from USDT), the APY will be very small.

But on the other hand, when few people provide liquidity and too many people use it (using swap on USDC-USDT pair), APY become big.

Sorry for bad English.

But it is all about supply-demand principle, usually newer LP pair will have high APY because the LP pool is still small.

And in addition to regular LP token, you are talking about Solfarm, which is a yield optimizer. It gives even more APY due to its strategy possibly auto-compounding strategy (I'm not sure what Solfarm do, but this is just basic concept of yield optimizer).

This means the 30% is not sustainable, but you can take advantage of it if you are early LP provider. But once Solana is more established and mature APY will start to look like the OG Defi on ETH (Curve Finance - Yearn Finance).

probabletrump,"So I'm going to attempt to give some answers. Please be gentle, if I leave something out or skip something I'm going to blame it on this being a less than ideal format (typing it out on my phone). Also, obligatory, this isn't tax advice or legal advice for anyone in particular, just a discussion about strategies that are typically attempted.

Alright so when we're talking cap gains we've got three types of folks. Those who are high wage earners (think 7 figures and up, athletes, execs, creatives), business owners, and real estate developers. Each have their own specific issues and strategies.

The high wage earners are the most straightforward. For them, if they work for a corporation I want to know their entire comp and benefit package. I'm usually looking for ways to avoid capital gains assets to begin with, Roth 401k are excellent places to out really risky assets, same with section 162 plans (cash value life insurance policies that the company funds at least partially). Both grow tax free and as long as you don't break a few rules, come out tax free. Getting a few $MM in these types of vehicles puts you way ahead of the curve. I personally make very good use of my Roth 401k. My riskiest investments go into it. My plan upon retirement is to use it to purchase a portfolio of vacation rentals and spend the rest of my life receiving that income tax free.

Beyond that, these folks tend to have a lot of liquid assets, strategies like tax loss harvesting and shifting around dividend reinvestment can prevent the need to sell assets and trigger a tax. In a year like this where we expect the capital gains tax to increase we tend to advise taking some strategic gains now while the tax is lower. The step up on basis and 1031 exchanges (also 1035 exchanges for the life insurance) can come in handy as well but I'll talk about those in the other categories.

For small business owners we're typically looking at very low basis and hopefully a much higher sales prices. If they sell the business to a third party there isn't a whole lot you can do about the capital gains. As with the previous example in a year like this there is a rush to get a deal done this year at a lower tax level but there will almost certainly be some tax owed. For those who want to sell but don't think they'll be able to this year they can look at taking out a large loan (think 100s of $MM) and paying a dividend out to all the owners. The first part of this cash would go to the owner as a return of their cost basis but anything over and above the basis would get taxed at this year's rate vs next year's. Then when the business is sold they'll recognize whatever gain is achieved over and above the dividend recap rate.

They could also consider transferring a portion of the company ownership to a charitable entity if they know they have charitable intent and they know they are going to sell the business. This allows them to avoid capital gains on the shares transferred to the charitable entity and also get a charitable deduction for the donation. This has some risk though in that it has to be done before a buyer is ""waiting in the wings"" and an S Corp isn't going to be able to have charitable ownership very long. If a sale doesn't materialize the business owner may need to come up with cash to buy the shares back from the charitable entity.

If they aren't selling to a third party they could create an ESOP and sell to their employees. If done correctly this could defer or eliminate capital gains tax for a seller. This is a big if though and shouldn't be attempted without a team who specializes in ESOPs.

There is also a transfer to family members. In this case the owner of the company keeps it their entire life and upon death leaves it to their family. At death the company gets a step up in basis meaning no capital gains tax owed. I've seen a business started in the first generation's garage that 40 years later had a cost basis of $20MM sell immediately after the first gens death for $750MM and the heirs paid no capital gains tax. Couple that with some aggressive life insurance planning earlier in life to cover the estate taxes and the business owner can get away for only the cost of the interest on the life insurance premium finance scheme that bought the life insurance. Typically a tiny fraction of the cost of the tax avoided. Especially at the interest rates we have now.

Finally for the real estate guys the 1031 exchange coupled with the step up in basis I mentioned earlier is a pretty sweet deal. RE guy buys a plot of land and develops it. This land is now worth significantly more. If he sold it he would be paying capital gains on most of the sales price (think gains of $40MM - $50MM). If instead he develops the land and then sells it and elects to do a 1031 exchange, he can find his next development target, maybe do multiple projects, and pick up new properties with those funds without having to pay a capital gain at that time. The gain is deferred and rolled over to the new property. The idea being that eventually it will get sold and a lifetime of gains from real estate development will come due. If this guy dies though with that property in his name it gets a step up in basis. His heirs can sell it and avoid taxes on all of the gain on all of the properties going as far back as the original developer was able to keep the 1031 exchanges rolling.",2021-09-14 06:35:05
hooliganb,"The ROI on brand is challenging to measure because it’s a long game. Brand isn’t marketing, and if you find an agency that treats it as such, then you’re going to be going with the wrong agency. 

The benefit of brand is attracting more customers to come back more often for more money over time. It isn’t the immediate results of marketing. You need to create a tribe of believers, and that requires nurturing your audience.

Then timeline as well. If you enter into the process deciding you’re going to measure success based on who will do it the quickest… again, you’re going to fail. Timeline isn’t a metric of who will do it the best. It is a metric for who is willing do abbreviate their process the most to hopefully get you something viable to launch with. 

Someone else had it right when they said the best way to understand whether someone is the best is the questions they ask. You want them to know who your audience is, what your goals are, what your metric for success is, your challenges, where you envision the business going, and what would it mean for you to achieve success.

Likewise, I believe you also want to connect with the people you meet with as humans. You’re going to find greater success with an agency is interested in who you are as people and forming a connection with you. Brand strategy involves a lot of discovery and they’ll likely want to perform research and interviews. If you don’t choose an agency that “feels” right, that could be a tough process. 

Lastly, depending on your industry, there’s something to be said for niching down. Some agencies have specialty in specific industries, and it may be significant to you that you work with someone with relevant experience. It doesn’t mean a generalist won’t do amazing work for you (and someone with an outsider perspective might be able to innovate more easily), but there are some fields (healthcare, finance, investment) where there’s a bigger learning curve if you don’t have previous experience.",2021-09-14 07:42:09

Mista_3_14159,"Permettez moi de m'exprimer en anglais, je suis plus a l'aise.

The Bank of Canada (BoC) has been, and continues to be one of the larger net buyers of Government of Canada bonds in the secondary market through it's quantitative easing program. In normal times, the BoC intervenes in the front end of the yield curve through repo and reverse repo operations to keep the overnight rate at the target rate, adding or limiting supply of reserves in the banking sector. In normal times, the bank controls rates out to roughly 2yrs through the conventionally policy, however with QE, the Bank was able to control rates out to Long bonds, thus artificially keeping rates low and allowing governments to issues large amount of longer term debt, which will help grow the number of dollars outstanding

&amp;#x200B;

In March 2020, the BoC unleashed a suite of unconventional (yet necessary) policy tools to help easy the financial markets, notably, Quantitative easing, but also notably and also likely of a much consequence, the purchase of BAs, and offering up term repos. The reason for this was that in March 2020, the Canadian bond market was broken, notably, Ontario had a failed Tbill auction, (Quebec as well if memory serves) and other provinces were completely locked out of short term funding markets.

&amp;#x200B;

The BoC thus stepped into funding markets to get it going again, and also offered up Term repos and allowed the banks to issue covered bonds that were purchased by their own treasury then put out as collateral for term repos, and a large portion of the proceeds were then used to buy provincial bonds as carve outs, and really get funding markets going. The secondary impact of that (besides making hundreds of millions for the banks in their AFS books)  was the rapid growth of our monetary base (M2). 

&amp;#x200B;

So to an extant, /u/Bewaretheicespiders is correct that the BoC is responsible for the availability of dollars. The purchases of government bonds have an strong indirect linkage to the growth of our monetary base. However, as seen in the US and in Japan with multiple QE programs, QE doesn't necessarily imply M2 growth. What blew up M2 was the combination of unconventional monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would further highlight that the BoC is not an issuer in that the bonds are the liability of the Government of Canada. The BoC does facilitate the auctions of the behalf of the Minister of Finance. Furthermore they are only a seller in the way a banking syndicate is the seller of a cooperate new issue. They do not sell into the secondary market, only the primary through the auction process. It is thus disingenuous to speak of the BoC as a buyer and a seller.",2021-09-14 09:24:17
BloodyAlien243,"I don’t think the idea is a good one. Rebellions are almost always small, so they lack the logistics and resources to research, finance, build, train, and deploy more advanced technology than the much larger government they are fighting. If they could, then they wouldn’t be small, and wouldn’t really be a rebellion. 
In modern war, it’s not quite about who has the fanciest toys, though that is a very big advantage. War is mostly about being able to produce enough adequate stuff to fight back the enemy. 
The Nazis in WW2 were in many ways more advanced and ahead of the curve in WW2. Better tanks, more advanced tactics, jet aircraft, advanced in weapons technology, and even nuclear technology. However, they lacked the resources to keep the war effort growing. Metals like iron, chromium, and tungsten were all gathered from neutral nations instead of Germany itself. Oil was also a big one. They also were losing key industrial sites, while the Allies had a secure industrial machine in the US. 

Despite the Nazis being way ahead, especially in science, they lacked the logistics and resources to use the tech they developed. And you know what happened to all those nazi scientists? Operation Paperclip. The US and USSR scooped them up as fast as they could. Werner von Braun, one these scientists, played a key role in the moon landing. 

So I don’t think the idea of a rebellion having more advanced technology that an Empire they are fighting is all that accurate and probably  isn’t a good idea.",2021-09-14 10:43:24
Throwaway2874637,"This is actually a tough question...

Investing itself I think anyone can do. Anyone can put their money into an index fund and earn 8-10% annually without having to do anything (Which I'd actually highly recommend. If communism means that all property is owned by the community, then that's about the closest you'll get for now as you'll be part owner of a whole basket of companies)

As for trying to actively invest... the thing is, I do think that anyone could.. but then there's a reason why most people don't. 

If they don't have enough money to invest in companies, I would suggest using real estate to build the wealth first as you can really leverage your dollars. Save enough for a down payment, buy a rental and as long as it cashflows you're good... And then once they have enough wealth (It doesn't even have to be that much, $300k could do it if they can live below their means) then they can go into stocks if they want.

It does require a lot of patience and emotional control. There is a learning curve and it'll require a lot of reading financial statements and listening to boring conference calls. They would have to be comfortable with putting their money into limbo and not touching it for an extended period of time. Jeff Bezos is currently worth $200B but he doesn't have $200B to spend.

There's no way I'd have the willpower to learn to code like how most people just wouldn't have the willpower to learn about finance.

That makes sense because these people often don't have the time to learn to code.

But for a leaving cert student or an undergrad, learning to code is still very good advice because it opens up a wide range of decent career opportunities.",2021-09-15 19:02:46
Willing_Fig_9235,"Hi OP,

Its wonderful that you're developing an interest in finance. An actuarial path is considerably different from a finance pathway (depending on where you land up).

At your age i would focus on keeping up with the markets, yields/yield curves, macro. Leave the portfolio formation for a later stage. The more you focus on those 3 factors, the more likely you are to receive an answer to your question. 

Try to google what a yield curve is, how it looks and why. 
What is convexity? (Fucking magic trust me)

At such an early stage i would consciously push you away from the complexity of derivatives, but thats what got me interested in finance in the first place. So you look like you have a mathematical bend, google the following and try to understand what they mean

-Collateralized Debt Obligations
-Collateralized Loan Obligations
-Mortgage Backed Securities
-Synthetic CDO

PS this topic is a rabbit hole. Dont get too deep yet. Stick to these 4 and try to visualize what they mean for 1) lenders 2) economic policy 3) regulation 4) retail investors (such as yourself). You also need to consider institutional investors. But skip that for now, thats a beast you can tackle another day.

Keep your eye on the macro end of things for now, i know a few forums might be pushing you towards understanding hedge funds/fund of funds/alternatives. That is knowledge that is fairly easily graspable. First decide if you want to do this, because its considerably more competitive than actuarials. 

As for the CFA, extremely useful, dont worry about study guides and the nay-sayers. Head up to their website and check out what they teach, its fairly detailed knowledge about things you would certainly need in a career in finance.

Hope to see you in the jungle old sport.

SlyTrout,"Since your car payment is already more than you invest, I do not recommend taking on another car payment. Here are some good thumb rules for buying a car.

1. Put at least 20% down.
2. Finance no longer than 36 months.
3. The total of all car payments should not exceed 8% of gross household income.
4. The total of all car payments should not exceed the amount you are saving for retirement.

Rules 1 and 2 keep you ahead of the inflation curve so you don't fund yourself upside down on the car if something happens to it. Rules 3 and 4 keep the car payment from being a financial burden and throwing you off track for retirement.

Lifeisagarden_Digit,"I agree, and the user experience on bitcoin certainly has more work to be done in both usability and security for the average person. The capability is there, but it is definitely still easier to use the dollar currently due to it's entrenched position. However, the competition between them is not about what one is more convenient but what one is more functional as a monetary communication medium from a fundamental perspective over long periods of time without requiring trust in a third party.

1. The selling point is not that if you use bitcoin you will magically be able to secure it with no effort. the selling point is that it is the single asset that is MOST securable. No other asset or currency even comes close to the security of bitcoin, they do not even have to potential to in the first place. No matter how sloppy people in aggregate are, it will still be more secure than anything currently being used with the optionality to individually increase security to approach the mathematical limit if one so chooses. This optionality does not exist anywhere else
2. All financial activity is already required to be reported when dealing in assets and currencies, it's already a pain in the ass. The only reason it's easier for the dollar system is because the system is already built not because it is easier in the absolute sense. The open nature of the block chain and the ability to securely and instantly audit anything on it at any time programmatically will allow for much easier tax reporting. there is a company called TaxBit already pushing in that direction.
3. True, very few are tech savvy. they won't need to be though. People don't know how any of the tech they use works and most never will. The capabilities the tech provides are still present though, and as the ecosystem develops all the features will be simplified and knowledge of possible actions will spread to the general populace whether they know how it works under the hood or not. The internet and cell phone adoption trends show this, the same will occur in the evolution of cryptographic financial networking. Many bitcoin wallets already have a bigass ""Privacy mode"" button or other things like it. No understanding or knowledge required at that point and it's only going to get easier and more capable over time as adoption continues and development advances.
4. Again, this argument stems from the user experience. The uneducated, the trusting, and the foolish alike are all already extremely vulnerable in the dollar system. Using bitcoin will improve this and reduce vulnerability even if it doesn't eliminate it. As this value becomes more pronounced more will use it over the competition and eventually social pressures begin the S-curve adoption trend seen in all technological change. Finance in general has fraud and some are vulnerable, but there is less as a percentage in bitcoin if you look at the raw statistics and the trend is only going down. The simple acceptance of bitcoin is the thing you need to worry least about as a vendor in fact, public key addresses are meant to be broadcast. Tesla's bitcoin stance is something I have kept an eye on, I was formerly an investor in them as well. They stopped accepting it as payment because BlackRock, one of their largest shareholders, was concerned about ESG requirements. that's a whole other can of worms, but suffice to say it has nothing to do with its reliability or worth as a mechanism for accepting payment. Additionally, Test did not sell any of their $1+ billion dollars in bitcoin so clearly they still think it has a future. Institutional adoption trends are currently rising exponentially. Even if Tesla and Elon Musk came out full swing and said bitcoin is the worst thing ever it wouldn't reverse this trend. the banks and hedge funds are arriving and they don't give a fuck what the news says.
5. Bitcoin has many purposes and solves many problems, if none spring to mind for you that does not imply they do not exist. Block chain is not the most useful part of bitcoin, ask anyone that knows the tech itself instead of the narrative in the mainstream. block chain has been around since the 90's and so has all the other tech that makes up the protocol like Elliptic curve cryptography or the SHA256 hash function. The breakthrough is in the solving of the 'byzantine general problem' in computer science and applying that to a public ledger based monetary system to eliminate the need for trust in reaching consensus on the state of property rights within the economic system. It's finite supply backed by proof-of-work eliminates the cost of inflation which destroys an estimated %12 of global wealth creation annually. It completely disintermediates most of the rent-seeking institutions that scrape wealth off the top of everything in the economy. There are others but I don't want to write an essay here, least not anymore than I have already lol. The government can do what they like and take what ideas they like, but the core problems that bitcoin solves are ones that benefit them and that they perpetuate. so anything they invent from these technological elements will be fundamentally different in form and function from bitcoin whether it uses block chains or not. Nothing any public entity says or does will do anything but temporarily slow bitcoin down and cause that government to miss out on an opportunity to actually serve it's people instead of exploit them through monetary manipulation. When an alternative like bitcoin exists the contrast will force competition like has never happened before and they cannot stop it like they did with physical assets such as gold in the past.

This is true, though I don't much care for the sheep analogy personally I know what you mean and generally agree with the sentiment. However, like with all other technological transformations bitcoin does not require that every person that uses it understand why it's useful or how it works. It only matters that it IS more useful and that it DOES work better. Wealth stored in Fiat and assets denominated in Fiat constantly lose value over time where as bitcoin is the opposite. It's literally just supply and demand. Over time those that hold finite scarce assets like bitcoin or land will win out over those that hold their wealth in the dollar ecosystem where there is no supply cap and its always increasing exponentially in volume and depreciating in purchasing power as a select few abuse the power of seigniorage, whether they understand why or not.",2021-09-17 02:32:47
AwesomeHatManNZ,"The idea that everyone should pass university...

It's not that a certain percentage must be made to fail because ""the curve"" or anything silly like that. Some people shouldn't get a pass because they just can't do it

If you're on a plane, you're going to want your pilot to know how to fly.
If you have a legal issue, you'll want your lawyer to know how to practice law.

And yet many universities (and to an extent high schools) are happy to give qualifications to people who can't do what their degree says they should be able to do.
E.g. if you can't understand basic finance/accounting, you shouldn't get a finance/accounting degree

BoxerRumbleEJ257,"Two considerations need to be made here:

1. Interest rate. Longer term loans typically means a higher rate. Depending on the difference, that can not be an issue. Some manufacturers offer 0% financing for 60+ months at times (not sure how many are doing it now with the vehicle shortage). There's something to be said about investing the ""extra"" money saved on shorter-tem finance payments in a higher-yielding avenue. You might get burned if you have to pull out at a bad time (e.g., you're investing in equities and there's a market decline), but historically, you're going to be better off assuming the interest rate on your loan is low enough.
2. Vehicle depreciation. Typically, vehicles with long-term financing can end up under water in terms of the value vs remaining loan balance due to the depreciation curve. This only really comes into play when it's time to buy the next vehicle (e.g., total insurance loss, personal choice replacement, etc.). Assuming you wouldn't be floating this underwater balance onto a new vehicle (and continuing / compounding the issue), this isn't a major concern. In your situation, you mention you could pay for the vehicle in cash, so I'm assuming you could cover the balance, but this is more meant as generic advice for anyone in the situation.",2021-09-17 11:39:08
deeseabee,"So many reasons why it's unlikely to shake out at $75/lb. And I say that not to be a dik, more that it's an incredibly opaque and complex market. Four things I'd add.

""What if every utility company inks their long term deal now, causing the price per pound to go to $75 as everything shakes out."" - it takes two to tango. For every buyer there has to be a seller. Some producers might be willing to sell some of their future lbs at that price, but certainly not all of it as they'd be putting a ceiling on their profitability. Most I'd argue will see how it's ran to $75, think to themselves the price can still run higher so hold out longer. This is a major concern some investors have with holding the producers - that they'll ink deals too early.

The other thing is the way the contracts are negotiated. No deal between between a buyer (utility) and seller (a uranium miner) is a simple deal for X lbs at Y price for Z years. They have floors and ceilings, where say 40% will be sold at an agreed price (say 75 bucks as per your scneario) and the remaining 60% at prevailing market spot price. Structuring contracts this way gives utilities some safety with the 40 and the miner the potential upside with the 60. (This is of course a massive over-simplification and it will differ for all the producers and developers, I hear some of these contracts can run into the hundreds of pages lol)

Thirdly, as others have said there's not only enough uranium in the short term with SPUT and the like gobbling it all up, but there's a structural deficit at play that means there's still very little lbs for years to come even once the mines on C&amp;M come back online. Producers who can get back to producing in the next 18-24 months - and that's a best case scenario - still can't come close to meeting the demand in 5 years let alone ten. And LT contracts typically run 3-7, up to ten years. The whole sector needs new supply to come on. DNN and others like GLO might be able to get finance to build a mine with $75/lb offtake agreements, but if you believe the modelling, the sector needs developers at the higher end of the cost curve to come online also. And they won't be producers at $75, more like $90 or $100. 

Finally, what happens when sovereigns like CCP or India or possibly the French or Russians acquire these developers so they can ensure supply for their own nuclear programs? The US utilities need far more than they can get domestically and KAP is running out and under the Russian sphere of influence. So this'll put further pressure on utes to hopefully pay more to developers so the developers can resist takeovers from sovereign buyers (not that many developers even want to become producers who manage a mine which only complicates the situation further)

Or of course, the Taliban could attack a pakistan nuclear plant to try and trigger another regional conflagration and the nuclear sector goes into another freefall and the price plummets back to $30/lb. There's just no knowing some things!",2021-09-17 16:40:49

ArcadesOfAntiquity,"I used Pickle a while back and I don't plan on using it again.

Point 1. Ask yourself: ""Where exactly are these super high APRs coming from?""

The answer is, from the liquidity of people who lock less (or no) PICKLE.

Pickle takes a cut of your yield every time it auto-compounds, and you'd better believe they have an incentive to use some of that cut to buy PICKLE on the open market in order to make sure its price stays at the point that it makes the PICKLE rewards high enough to retain and attract liquidity to fuel their future cuts.

Another factor that contributes to ensuring that the price of PICKLE stays high enough to incentivize jar deposits, is people who lock PICKLE, thus removing sell pressure from the market. Those who lock more PICKLE are rewarded with a greater share of the total PICKLE issuance.

Here's where the problem becomes clear: imagine if everyone using Pickle owned enough PICKLE to get the max advertised APR. In that case, ~~to maintain the present APRs,~~ one of two things would have to happen: either 1) the rate of PICKLE issuance would have to increase or 2) APRs would have to go down.

The only way both of those are avoided is if there is a sufficient amount of liquidity in the jars from people who are not locking much PICKLE.

Point 2. Check the math on just how much PICKLE you'd have to buy/farm before you could get the max advertised APRs. It varies depending on the jar, but it's usually in the neighborhood of six figures (USD) worth, and that's only sufficient to get the max APR if you're willing to lock that PICKLE for four years (!).

Okay, so people who got in early (by farming PICKLE) or with higher initial outlay (to buy PICKLE) are getting more rewards, sounds like pretty standard stuff in crypto or in finance generally right? Notably, Curve's incentive structure seems at least fairly similar.

The thing to ask then is, ""What's the reward difference between people who are locking no PICKLE vs people who are locking the max APR amount?""

Compare with the reward differences on Curve. In my opinion Pickle's is just too big. That gap is a measurement of how much large PICKLE holders are profiting at the expense of small/no PICKLE holders. Remember that regardless of how much PICKLE you hold, Pickle takes its cut of your yield and uses it to buy PICKLE on the open market. Are those buys supporting the value of your bags? Only if you're already a large PICKLE holder.

My explanation might not be the clearest but hopefully you can see there's a slight hint of ponzi. It's not really a ponzi because the autocompound does provide an actual useful service and as far as I know you can profit from this service even when you lock no PICKLE. I just think it's weighted too much in favor of current PICKLE holders. I think maybe they can adjust this via a vote, which leads me to...

Conclusion: does an autocompounder, which is after all a simple financial concept, really merit the kinds of APRs that are received by large PICKLE lockers?

My answer is, maybe, but only while defi/blockchain is new enough that autocompounders aren't seen as basic perks.

There will come a day when services like Yearn and Pickle look like dinosaurs because they ""only"" do autocompounding--and for a hefty cut of your profits.

A few other little notes:

1) Look in the discord and search for something like D4 lower return. There are people complaining that the actual return of the D4 saddle pool jar is significantly lower than advertised.

2) The site is a bit janky, and not in the hiccup-y way that is common on web3 sites (though of course it has that too), but in a more basic, ""not using best web design practices"" way.

3) Watch out for a ridiculous withdrawal fee. 0.1 ETH and gas wasn't even that high at the time. (More knowledgeable Pickle users, is this an early withdrawal penalty?)

4) They got hacked a while back, but they are doing the right thing and devoting a portion of their profits to paying back users who suffered losses.",2021-09-18 12:16:38

SwagtimusPrime,"&gt;Cardano is designed as a groundbreaking blockchain platform, comparable to ETH 2.

Only after Hydra goes live or you'll be stuck with 100-200 TPS. In its current shape, Cardano is everything but groundbreaking.

&gt;That the IOHK team research and spent countless hours just to build another ETH 1?

This is a very narrow view. Do you have any idea how many people can now permissionlessly lend and borrow assets without having to rely on banks? Do you know how many people in third world countries can now earn 3-10% on their crypto or stablecoins without middlemen or corrupt governments? But I'm sure it's all just one giant scam and Charles Hoskinson has the magic ability to build some actual useful stuff. Sit down, be humble. You don't know shit.

&gt;You can literally count the real world valuable projects on ETH and its rollups in one hand. Projects that can actually be used for real world transactions and not just a giant scam operated from their home by programmers.

May I introduce you to the baseline protocol: https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/

https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/08/26/boring-is-the-new-exciting-how-baseline-protocol-connected-with-600-corporates/

&gt;The protocol has seen prolific adoption since its launch in March of this year. Wolpert said some 20 or so companies a week are joining the 600-plus firms now using the protocol, with big names like Coca-Cola bottling group Coke One North America recently joining. 

Coca Cola, EY, and many more already use it, it's spearheaded by Microsoft, Ernst&amp;Young, Accenture, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, ConsenSys, Chainlink, etc etc. Due to EY's influence, it is poised to be used by **a lot** of Fortune 500 companies.

EY is also building a zk rollup on Ethereum for their business usecases: https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/07/ey-contributes-a-zero-knowledge-proof-layer-2-protocol-into-the-public-domain-to-help-address-increasing-transaction-costs-on-ethereum-blockchain

&gt;“Based on EY experience, ZK-Optimistic roll-ups are currently among the most effective in balancing security incentives and mathematical efficiency for running private transactions on the public Ethereum network.  As we have in the past, we are again contributing this code into the public domain to speed up enterprise adoption of this technology.”

And this is just one of many usecases. People in the Philippines play Axie Infinity for a living due to the Play2Earn model. Axie Infinity is among the biggest discord groups **worldwide**.

Edit: May I also introduce you to the Gamestop NFT project? https://nft.gamestop.com/

There are lots of rumors floating around what it could be, but one thing is for sure: They are building their business on Ethereum and NFTs have the power to completely revolutionize how games are sold and resold - it has the potential to unseat Steam.

I'm sure it's all just scams and ponzis, and Charles will descend from the heavens to save us from decentralized finance, NFTs, games and enterprise adoption to strike another deal with some third world country so the Cardano maxis can laud it as a huge sign of adoption and success. No. Adoption happens organically.",2021-09-18 20:22:24
Glass_Win_2724,"People need to stop calling crypto gambling, because it's simply not. A gambler making stupid decisions is gambling. Crypto, is a marketplace, just like any other - and has it pitfalls, but also huge advantages. If you understand the science behind crypto and it's cultural impact, you'll know. I know people that are total idiots when it comes to investing but also a lot of people I really look up to. Put simply, it is a legitimate tool to make money &amp; you can make some ape returns right now since it is a hot market. Crypto trading, in essence, takes the power away from traditional ""money"", that's why we see NFTs and meme coins generating millions and millions of dollars. We are evacuating consumerist bullshit. I don't think I want to see the world go in any other direction, because in essence Corporate giants (especially traditional banks, which are just giant tech companies in disguise) have been fucking people over since the beginning of time, and now, the pendulum is finally swinging the other way. We've created our own financial marketplace, and it has almost zero to do with bureaucratic banks or giant public companies. In the end, it is a philosophical fight, the young world is more interested in digital rather than physical. Less consumerism, less waste, less cars, less commutes, less overall bullshit that society implies on us.

Whether or not it's gambling, is entirely dependent on on you and your own strategy - you can say anything is gambling. And there are a lot of gamblers that win too. I'm not recommending this, but in crypto it's never been easier to win as a gambler. I'd say in a lot of scenarios, a young person with no direction getting into crypto is the best possible thing to happen (if you are in the right mindset) being smart, disciplined, and having some balls - can pay amazing dividends. And the crypto community is not only so huge but also helpful to beginners, it really feels like everyone is winning, especially when you see someone go from a shitty, dead-end job to living a comfortable life without having to clock in or put up with bullshit that they don't deserve in the first place. It is really levelling the playing field for everyone. After the long learning curve and hours of study, you don't need to put too much time into it, your most effective trades, ideally only take anywhere from 15 mins to half an hour once you get a hang of the market and how/what you want to trade (your niche, so to speak). It's not about getting rich bro. It's about becoming free from the chains of society as hippy and bullshit as that sounds. If you can make the minimum amount of money to sustain yourself on your own, I think everyone would take that over employment - and I think it's actually what's best for everyone as human beings. The less you do, the more you do. After this, it's up to you if you wanna be rich or not. but at least you'll know, that you'll be good - and have enough money to buy things you want, enough time to spend for yourself, if you want you can stay at home 7 days a week and watch anime, but most importantly financial freedom (actually, the lack of pressure from it, the word financial freedom shouldn't even exist because it implies we need intrinsic monetary value to live freely, but I also understand that freedom comes with responsibility) will enable you to be more of a kind and empathetic person to yourself and the world instead of submitting to rat race work culture and consumerist bullshit. This is the important shit, change the finance game so a young kid growing up poor with all the odds stacked against them doesn't have to feel like shit looking at people who have always had it better than him, but actually has an easy way out. hard work and ""pulling yourself up by the bootstraps"" is an extremely overrated sentiment. sorry for the long tirade but I'm passionate about this stuff",2021-09-19 00:37:29

vinn_47,"I did the same course for my bachelors from DU and appeared for multiple Masters entrances, including the ones you mentioned. For IIT JAM, there are coachings in which you can enroll from 4th semester onwards. If you are good in problem solving and statistics, you can crack it without any coaching too. Regarding ISI M.Stat entrance, they don't ask questions from too advanced or difficult topics; they ask questions from general topics only, but they are tricky and good problem solving skills are required to solve those. Same goes for CMI entrance. You don't need to focus on these exams right from the beginning; just study the college syllabus for now, and start focusing on these exams from 4th or 5th semester. 

For MBA, you ideally need to appear for CAT. You should start preparing atleast one year in advance. Most of my friends started preparing from 3rd or 4th semester. Whether you'll need coaching depends entirely on you. If you start preparing well in advance, I don't think there is much need for coaching; just buy some good mock test series (IMS or TIME will do).

For abroad, it depends a lot on whether you get some scholarship/funding or not, and also on which country you go to. It's better to get some counselling for that or directly ask someone who went abroad for masters.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than Masters, you can go for a job in data science or analytics, although competition will be a bit tough since generally B.Tech or Masters candidates are preferred for such jobs. But if you have good skills and a good profile, it is definitely possible.  

Other than data science, you can go for jobs in fields like marketing, consulting or finance if that interests you.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, don't burden yourself with multiple internships. Only do an internship if you find it interesting; many of my batch mates did sales/marketing interships just for the sake of doing an internship. Such internships are of little use, and I don't think they are worth it. Even one internship is fine if it is good and has a steep learning curve.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, you can start learning some machine learning and deep learning (from online resources). Start making projects (they will help you later on) or maybe participate in Kaggle competitions if you find them interesting. Also, read research papers once you are comfortable enough with ML/DL theory. But apart from these do focus on basic statistics concepts you are taught in your syllabus; they are important if you want to clear these Masters entrances. 

Apart from this, I would suggest to do some extra curriculars and explore what interests you; you won't get much time for that later on.",2021-09-20 01:00:37

throwaway474673637,"Excuse me for not being able to see the future when I replied to you about your original point on LTTs. Of all the many mistakes I’ve made talking to people here about finance and investing, that one is probably the worst.

You’re right that bonds are generally non-correlated to stocks (though credit tends to be positively correlated to stocks because stocks and corporate bonds represent claims on the same corporate assets), but your original point was that LTTs are the *only* non correlated assets to stocks, which is just plain wrong. I’m not sure why you’re trying to make a big deal about 0.02 difference in stock market correlations between LTTs and STTs. You can play around with the start and end dates of these backtests and get small differences in either directions (ie look at just the last 20 years and the results slightly favour STTs) but they really don’t matter. As my original comment stated, Treasurys all along the yield curve (short, intermediate, long) have similar correlations to stocks.

I studied molecular &amp; cellular biology &amp; have one bio stock I’m pretty confident in long term growth &amp; price stability. But I follow it closely &amp; not married to any stock bec any dominant company can always be overtaken by new innovation by its competition. If you are not an expert in any industry, Subscribe to an industry specific publication (ie auto, logistics, biotech, finance, oil, aviation, real estate magazine, etc). Know statistics, &amp; memories important statistics. I for one know 1 in 10 jobs is directly related to car industry, 1 in 20 jobs is directly related to oil industry, virtually ALL jobs are related to housing industry (hence the world housing financial crisis). Know the big players in each industry. Knowing profit margins will let you know who will outlast a crash &amp; who will default first (Saudi Arabia had highest profit margin for oil, Venezuela had lowest profit margin for oil, hence the collapse of highly un-diversified, oil dependent Venezuela) And FOLLOW &amp; UNDERSTAND the YIELD CURVE!!! Prices of Bonds vs Equities tend to be affected by changes in yield curve in significant ways (the fear injected by wallstreet of steeping yield curve has turned out to be wrong so far but the fear still lingers in retail investors bec they don’t follow bonds or the yield curve, they primarily follow equities(stocks)). I watch all speeches made by the fed in real time &amp; remember that the fed’s 2 primary directives are #1. Price Stability &amp; #2. maximum employment. I Determine how much the world trusts the fed chair &amp; how much I trust the fed chair. So far seems world generally trusts Powell. I will keep my opinion of Powell to myself, but I will say Yellen was a better communicator. There is a lot of money that can be made by investing in renewables &amp; going green. (Dems talk about it but I don’t trust they actually want to do it) Mostly bec 1 in 20 jobs is linked to oil &amp; it would be hugely disruptive at first but anyone investing in renewables would see their bank accounts soar &amp; bank accounts of oil industry tank after dust settles. And Manchin is in a coal dominated state &amp; big coal has strong ties to big oil. Oil companies hire the best, so these people would switch to work for renewables industry. Like I said , it would be highly disruptive to markets &amp; particularly disruptive to oil dependent counties Iike Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia. Same people shorting AMC &amp; GME are also the one’s shorting renewables has been my conclusion. Hedge funds must be highly invested in oil &amp; banks that fund oil.

&gt; Do you think CSUN is the place for at least [any finance job in LA]?

To directly answer your question, yes - CSUN can get you to that goal. There are many CSUN alums working in ""at least any finance job"" in LA and elsewhere. So the trends of ""at least getting a finance job"" is favorable, especially since there is campus recruiting for a variety of back-office finance roles at banks, finance-oriented compliance roles at the accounting firms, and FP&amp;A roles at companies.

If I were to leave any sort of advice, don't feel like there are jobs at any role, at any company, no matter the competitiveness, the prestige, the barriers, etc. that you feel you cannot get. I truly feel that if you want to strive for the best, and if that best for is IB/WM (or even Private Equity, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds, Management Consulting, etc.), you shouldn't settle for anything less because of attending CSUN or any other factors (i.e. first generation, low income, etc.). While I do think students should try to prioritize going to target schools to minimize the barriers of entry to these roles, that's not to say CSUN students cannot break out of what is the norm at CSUN and pursue their dream careers. You too can make the 150k out of college moving markets working in New York City/Wall Street in high finance and equally as deserve it than any other student from a ""better"" school.

trimtab28,"2020 and 2016 are a bit of a curve ball given the polarity of Donald Trump, and thus down ticket races. Look at the state level elections though- Texas state level seats have increasingly gone to Republicans since the early 2000s, with a dip once Trump came into office. That speaks to the polarizing power of the man, not really demographics. Not to speak of the reality that Trump did in fact manage to garner more Republican votes than his predecessor. Whether or not Texas goes blue begs the question of how the GOP positions itself (more Trumpist or not), working class minority voter patterns (which actually start skewing conservative when the Democratic Party increasingly caters to the college educated), and the extent to which outsiders are assimilating into the political culture of their adopted states (which I pointed out- many people go from California because they don't want to be in California, outstayed though the exodus may be).

https://ballotpedia.org/Texas\_House\_of\_Representatives

The snowbird mentality, ""moving to a state because we like the political culture and thus will reinforce it"" actually is pretty illustrative of my point. And it's similar to Texas demographically insofar as you get conservatives from blue states consciously moving in due to the political culture. Plus the gravitation of Latinos towards Republicans due to social conservatism is present in both Miami and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, if you're unaware of the latter. The two states actually did have voter shifts that roughly mirror each other (and inextricably do when you start looking at specific groups like Latinos). And countering your point on the tech companies, Florida has for some time had a reasonable tech scene due to defense contractors, plus there's been a shift due to low taxes there of tech and finance companies. Not to the same clip of Texas, but without a doubt it exists.

Link from my blog [The Rise of the Professional Class](http://greyenlightenment.com/2021/09/02/the-rise-of-the-professional-class/)

Due to a combination of strong asset returns, low interest rates, low inflation (which magnifies real returns and increases purchasing power), and high wages, the past decade has been especially good for for professionals compared to earlier decades, possibly ever.

Wages for professionals, such as in law, medicine, tech, finance, consulting, etc., have really surged over the past decade, since 2008 especially, even after accounting for student loan debt and inflation. 

https://d1x7qj5rlh2e19.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/09154235/Chart1_Prior-to-COVID-median-earnings-for-recent-grads-reached-record-highs-1024x715.png

(this was plotted before Covid, but there is no reason to expect it has changed, and if anything Covid has only widened the gap between the professional class and everyone else)

Even after accounting for student loan debt , college grads still come out well-ahead of non-grads. Although high school grads have a four-year head start in terms of employment compared to college grads, this is probably offset by the worse job prospects and high unemployment for high school grads compared to college grads (college grads have 50% lower unemployment rate compared to non-grads).  It's not like companies are clamoring for high school grads unless they can pay them very little.  Trades work pays better than service work, but also has a steeper learning curve, and also credentialization/certification is required, which can be expensive and time-consuming. 

I think what has happened is, increasingly competitive economic conditions and winner-take-all markets  has created an environment in which individual talent is more important than ever, so employees with highly sought after skills are paid more than ever, as the stakes are higher. There is an arms race between the major tech companies ,  Google, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon over 2-4 billion potential consumers. Bigger   companies means bigger cases, hence higher salaries for lawyers too, and also higher salaries for accountants and consultants. A wealthier population overall means more demand for healthcare and top doctors to treat rare diseases and conditions once thought to be incurable or untreatable, hence higher doctor and specialist salaries.",2021-09-24 08:47:26
VelveteenAmbush,"&gt; Last time I checked (admittedly ~15 years ago), there was zero pharma R&amp;D in Canada. And that's not a coincidence.

It would be very strange to say the least if the chief impediment to founding a successful pharma R&amp;D company in Canada were having *too many* white collar workers around who were willing to work for *too little* money... is this your theory? It brings to mind Yogi Berra's famous restaurant critique -- ""nobody goes there anymore because it's too crowded.""

&gt; So it's not due to naturally occurring supply &amp; demand curves.

Doesn't an outward shift of supply curves result in more, not less, aggregate wealth? In an opportunity cost sense, isn't failing to undertake a simple and free intervention to shift out the supply curve of a valuable input equivalent to artificially constricting the supply of the input?

&gt; These are Canada's most valuable companies:

KaiSosceles,"No one is waiting for Eth2.0. Ethereum users just value different things than competing L1 smart contract chains like Harmony. In the US, the SEC has officially fired the warning shot and projects like Harmony may be rendered illegal, whereas projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have already been cleared as decentralized enough to not be securities.

Then you have network failures like Solana and we see that decentralization has merit, not just in censorability, but in uptime. It’s a running joke that traditional finance markets are only available 20% of the week, whereas crypto markets are 24/7/365…except if they’re down. ^.^

No Ethereum users are waiting for Eth2.0. Maybe people who don’t know what Eth2.0 actually is, or people who just sit around and hold bags of coins without actually using them, but people using Ethereum are using Ethereum. Using uniswap, sushiswap, lido staking, aave, curve, and the thousands of mainnet dapps out there to secure long term yields rather than chase down every new “Eth-killer” that has yet to ever actually kill Eth.

For mainnnet users, this means putting a lot of money on the table. People using mainnet with less 10k are basically just lighting money on fire. People who still want to use Eth for smaller fees have options through L2’s like Optimism, Arbitrum, DyDx, and about a dozen others. People who are okay with centralization might opt for Polygon where the fees are cheaper than anywhere else.",2021-09-25 17:22:51

Snoo72742,"Hello

My name is Thomas, I'm a 17 year old freshman in college, but currently I don't pursue any tech related degree. I'm majoring in finance. However, months ago I started watching coding tutorials and learning the basics of web development (html, css, javascript) in scrimba. I did my research and found that ruby on rails is quite popular in the startup world and begin doing Michael Hartl's ruby tutorial. 

I looked at your resume and github and your experience looks impressive. I feel I'm not advacing in my learning curve and haven't done any projects. I would like to become a RoR full stack developer, front end with react to be able to code web apps to solve people's problems and I think I would be a good mentee, I can commit to learn every week. Because of my college email address I have resources like orreily, frontend masters for free but I'm overwhelmed with what I need to learn

MoriSummers,"From your response, I don't think you truly understand how IPFS works. IPFS is a way to store your files in a decentralized way. You don't need to rely on any specific host, instead financially incentivizing nodes (in a similar way to blockchain) to store your data for you. You don't need to specify a host. In the crypto world, this solution is already used to create frontends that can't be tampered with and will live on for eternity. (Curve Finance, Tornado Cash, 1inch, AAVE, etc..)

You can think of this as similar to how bittorrent works. As long as there are enough peers, you can be quite sure that your file will be available and not tampered with using modern cryptography techniques. The problem is incentivizing peers to actually host your data, which is something that protocols that build on IPFS try to solve.",2021-09-27 05:29:12

jumnhy,"Excellent post from u/benido2030 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pwz2p9/daily_general_discussion_september_28_2021/helji9q) passing along some potential alpha from Darren Lau on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1442836788939083777).

Basically, Darren has listed projects that don't have a token yet but have some degree of clout in DeFi. I went through each of the projects listed, found a frontpage and did the barest of summaries. From my minimal reading on each protocol, I simply looked at what it was and if his claim regarding it being without a token so far/possible for an airdrop was worth looking into.


If you're interested in getting the next big dYdX airdrop, these are some options. No guarantees, but hey, I'll at least save y'all the trouble of clicking through these folks Twitter profiles.

See below.

Here's the list of airdrop-hunter target projects thrown out by Darren Lau in this thread 
(https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1442836788939083777?) along with links and a very brief take from doing the rounds myself. 


Paraswap (paraswap.io)
Aggregator a la 1inch. Not sure what their competitive edge is, haven't looked much to find out.


Defi Utilities/Portfolio Tracking

Defi Saver (defisaver.com)
OG CDP automation provider, now does so much more. u/nikolaj is always happy to help out with any questions. Staunchly mum as to any token launch plans, however...

DeBankDeFi (Debank.com)
Come along way in portfolio tracking since I last checked them out--serious competitor to/maybe even edging out Zerion, which had been my go-to for the last ... however long. In-house exchange should be tried out.


Zapper
OG portfolio tracker, lots of integrations for ""zapping"" into and out of various defi protocols. Has an in-house exchange you should use if seeking an airdrop.

Zerion.io
My go-to portfolio tracker, did an NFT drop a while back; has mobile support which I appreciate.

MetaMask
Just use the in-wallet swap function, guys. Everyone has had a Metamask wallet at some point, use it.


Stable swaps:

Saddle Finance (saddle.finance)
VC-backed Curve Finance clone (ported from Solidity to Vyper, I believe?). VC money = greater desire to cash out = greater chance of token creation.

Shell Protocol (shellprotocol.io | shells.exchange )
Similar to Curve, constant-sum market maker calling LP tokens ""shells"". Nifty idea, not sure what the differentiators are.


Yield Aggregators:

Gro Protocol (gro.xyz)
Tranched yields--""protected"" deposits. Liquidity bootstrapping pool going live on Balancer ASAP. 45% GRO allocated towards mining and future airdrops.

Unagii (Unagii.com)
Vaults a la (largely cloned from?) Yearn. 


Savings:

Orion (orion.money)
Kinda pyramid-schemey front-end to leverage a Terra-based stablecoin backed by future Terra transaction fees? Idk, but they do plan a token launch for ... very soon, theoretically.


**Yield Futures/Interest Rate Markets:**

Element Fi (element.fi)
derivatives of locked capital positions allowing leveraged yield and/or fixed rate savings

Horizon Fi (beta.horizon.finance)
Same deal as Element, different mechanism. Whitepaper is very... legal-esey.

Liquidity Underwriting:
KuuFinance (kuu.finance)
AVAX-based. Backstop protocol for liquidity/liquidations.

Goldfinch Fi (goldfinch.finance)
Uncollateralized loans--blend of trad/decentralized finance aimed at emerging markets

Fuji DAO (fujidao.org)
Borrowing/Lending Aggregator a la Defisaver, but not nearly so mature. 

Ribbon Finance (ribbon.finance)
""Structured products"" ie automated options and futures strategies? Not a finance guy, myself.

Hop Protocol (hop.exchange)
Interrollup/L2/Sidechain Bridge (ETH--Polygon--Optimism--Arbitrum--xDai)

EthBlock.Art
Deterministic/generative art--everyone can participate whether in creating a style or generating art itself. Kinda nifty NFT platform.

Party DAO (partyBid.app)
Fractional bidding on NFTs (""PartyBid""). Form a party of bidders, get NFTs together

Fractional (fractional.art)
Fractionalization of NFTs (want to make your non-fungible asset liquid?)

Aztec Network (aztec.network or zk.money)
Private decentralized transactions. 

Beta Finance (betafinance.org)
Lending/borrowing/shorts -- blog post confirming that a retroactive distribution will happen went live yesterday, but no details on snapshot date. Likely pro-rata for participants per blog.


A couple Solana based lending protocols:
Solend Protocol (solend.fi)

Apricot Finance (apricot.one)

Jet Protocol (jetprotocol.io)


And Solana based options protocols:

PsyOptions (psyoptions.io)

ZetaMarkets (zeta.markets)

Solana based perpetuals/futures/derivatives:

Drift Protocol (drift.trade)

01 Protocol (01protocol.com)

Others:

pStakeFinance (ATOM staking)
Cosmos based sidechain, airdrop already happening for various Defi folks

Composable Finance (picasso.composable.finance)

Crowdlending campaign for Picasso Network (Polkadot parachain? I think?) is live now. Really running out of attention to read more today.


Charm Finance (charm.fi)

Auto administration of Uniswap V3 LP positions

Apollo DAO (apollo.farm)

Terra-based yield aggregator

Other ""maybe there'll be a native token"" options-- a handful of secondary networks worth using for a variety of reasons.

Optimism
Arbitrum

BobaNetwork --if you've got OMG and you put it on Boba, you'll be eligible for BOBA shortly. 

There were actually a handful more options within that tweetstorm, but I checked out at this point. Hope someone else finds any of this useful!",2021-09-29 07:45:31
bluewalletsings,"Yes, especially taxes. I don't mind memorising formulas like Taylors Rule or something. 

Like in the other comments, CFAI has a habit of doing this. They don't derive stuff and just blurt out a formula. They really should make good use of the optional section and at least SHOW how certain conclusions are made; i.e. convexity effect on long term bonds, barbell vs bullet in yield curve changes. I don't have a higher education in finance, but I guess that if you show some derivations and mathematical proof, the whole thing would make a lot more sense and concrete rather than looking like some crazy magic.

Not to mention, their textbook is written like cypher text, I gave up reading their stuff. My strategy is to read as little of the text as possible and use MM notes whenever I have to. My opinion is MM's notes is clearly written based on the text. He dealt with all the nonsensical manure so that I don't have to.

Well. Back to something more relevant to you OP. I just sat for the exam in Aug. The first question was taxes. I can't remember what the question is and it is a question that you can only solve with their formula. I left that session blank because I hate memorising formulas. It was 3-5 points.

You don't have to worry yourself with the insane formula. My local Kaplan instructor has this saying ""CFAI doesn't test you on anything with more than 2 variables, it's mostly involves only sums and multiples. Never mind the crazy formulas""

I find that to be quite true. Especially with the private wealth section. For examples, The inheritance tax formula, don't worry about it.",2021-09-29 10:22:39
littlemssunshinepdx,"Non-profits are more likely to take a chance on you, because they’re more lean organizations, but the person in the level you’d be qualified for would require a lot of tactical knowledge in HR processes (e.g., benefits admin, onboarding, HRIS management, leave admin, workers comp, etc), and not having that experience might be a hindrance to getting a position as well as a learning curve for you. Another option is to look into an administrative position in a non-profit or smaller business, and then crawl up the butt of whoever IS HR and offer your help. Trust me, they’ll take it. 

I have an ops coordinator that does not report to me, but she’s always asking how she can help, and I say “well, if your supervisor believes you have the capacity, it would be helpful if…” and give her tasks. She now helps with our employee orientation process, does filing, collects policy acknowledgments, etc. Small, non-confidential stuff, some reporting, but now she can put on her resume that she assists in the employee onboarding and training process, that she has assisted in coordinating hiring events, etc. If she didn’t report into Finance I’d consider having her do more stuff, but I don’t like crossing the finance/HR divide — too much access to too much sensitive information. 

Anyway — that’s my best advice. Look for the side door using the experience you do have, and then get experience the experience you need to move into the role you want. 

Best of luck!",2021-09-29 12:27:22
Junior_Lead232,"I’ve recently been offered a senior consulting role at a big 4 in finance strategy and performance. Salary is low $100k aud (excluding super) I am coming from corporate banking (have been looking to get out of the industry for awhile) what is the largest learning curve for someone new to consulting? I am located in Western Australia is the salary offered considered market salary? My largest concern was the working hours known in management consulting however the partner that offered me the position (after single interview and sit down coffee catch up no case study or further interviews) reassured me that the hours aren’t 12-13hr days and if they were he would not offer me the role as it would be a poor result for the firm and for me, can anyone firm hours at big 4 (kpmg, PwC, Deloitte, EY)",2021-09-29 13:46:35
CohenReport,Compound annual growth of interest on debt is a reality pushed on us by the finance oligarchy. Too bad economic growth trails off into an s-curve when interest on debt accumulates at an exponential rate.,2021-09-29 15:28:32
no-favors,"This is pretty much the state of finance these days. The level of knowledge our TSgt’s have is on the same level as our SSgt’s of yesteryear had and it goes down from there. I’ve got MSgt’s that are technicians instead of leading their flights. We’ve tried to automate a lot of functions and processes and while automation has helped curve the impact of manpower cuts we’ve incurred over the last 20 years, it’s also removed that institutional knowledge we once had and more importantly it’s made us lazy with understanding policies and regulations and it’s affect on the pay and accounting systems.",2021-09-29 18:57:55
