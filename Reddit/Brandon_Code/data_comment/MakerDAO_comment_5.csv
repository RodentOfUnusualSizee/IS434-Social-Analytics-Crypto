augustofretes,"My experience with rollups is that they solve one problem (low tx/s) and replace with a bunch:

* No more composability. The system is entirely broken into independent silos, with essentially independent funds. If you're on Loopring, you can't interact with MakerDao, try new lending protocolos like Liquity, or even buy all that many tokens (you can't even send funds to an L1 address without withdrawing them first). Interacting with any other L1 contact requires you to whitdraw from Loopring to L1, then if the contract you want to interact with exists on a different L2, you need to deposit to that L2. L2 bridges will make this easier from a a user's perspective, but the underlying issue is still there.

* L2s are not censorship resistant, and the L2 owner can refuse to do what you want. This is true even in advanced zk-rollups like Loopring's. L2 solutions are just not really decentralized, best-in-class rollups ensure that your funds can't be stolen, but that's about it. 

* Future Ethereum solutions like sharding won't run the EVM, so they don't scale the capacity to run smart contracts as much as looking at the raw number of tx/s suggests. 

* Side chains (really independent chains), don't rely on Ethereum for security, and are really independent beasts with their own pros and cons. You can't recreate the entire history on chain using Polygon, so if the Polygon was compromised in some way, or shut off, there's no way for you to move your funds back to the Ethereum network. In essence, you need to trust Polygon, not Ethereum to use it.",2021-05-01 02:19:20
Neophyte-,"thanks thats a great answer

&gt; There is actually not a real problem with the UTXO model, in fact, it is better in many ways and enables critical solutions to some of the issues the blockchain industry faces today. 

my thought about the utxo model potentially breaking down in hard cap blockchains was constant dividing of utxo into smaller and smaller chunks leading to tx bloat. is that not the case? if so why not?

&gt; Because of the parallelism we get from UTXO processing, which isn't available on an account based system, we have solved the miner extracted value issues in DeFi as well as front running, since all currency conversions in a single block are processed simultaneously with all others, resulting in all participants in that block getting the same conversion rates in all directions with no spread.

can you expand on what that means? i thought defi had nothing to do with miners, just people mostly loaning/ borrowing money where loans are collateralised in smart contracts. there are other cases like makerdao and liqudiity mining LP tokens.

&gt; will allow anyone to create their own connected blockchains, launch currencies with kickstarter-like fund-or-refund blockchain participation that have their own bandwidth, their own ability to issue IDs, their own independence, in-spite of interoperability with the rest of the Verus network (and others including ETH), and can be automatically discovered, connected to and merge-mined by anyone on the network

this sounds a lot like polkadot or cosmos, would that be accurate? if so how does it differ?",2021-05-01 04:29:19
Gladfire,"&gt; DARPA funded the research 

DARPA is the most well known reasearch agency of the USDoD.  


&gt; It was really the university network that drove adoption. 

When developing non-sensitive technologies the DoD historically always works closely with the universities then allows usage of the tech.  


&gt; I *am* sure that the military never used public networks for their communication in those early days. 

The military funded it's development for their own eventual usage, ARPANET wasn't used by the military to my knowledge, it was the proof of concept.  


&gt; I assume you mean $1.5 MM or something? 

Yeah, typo. Fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; So no, it doesn't put control back in the hands of the banks--exactly the opposite. 

If there's a high cost for entry, banks and financial institutions can leverage their vastly higher resources to gain controlling stakes effectively, no?  


&gt; Enough demand might incentivize new entrants into the GPU market, which would be a huge boon to everybody. 

And in the mean time the average consumer will be priced out of the market completely.  


&gt;You threw an environmental argument in there, too. But you can use that argument against basically *anything*. In fact...if we have limited resources to create GPUs, would they be better spent creating a new, public, distributed financial system available to everyone in the world, or helping first-world gamers get from 90 FPS to 110 FPS in their video games?

You're implying that this is a case of either or, if regular consumers didn't buy these, they wouldn't be made, you're implying that the alternative is a new financial system which doesn't currently exist. You're also making green = no happiness argument, we're talking minimization with minimal impact on QoL, not utter minimisation, no one's suggesting to send humanity back to the stone age.  


&gt;  But it's not *entirely under the control* of government. 

You're implying that any direct influence by companies is beneficial, it isn't. Companies want what is best for companies, governments want, or at least pretend to want what they, at least pretend, is best for their people.  


&gt; You're half-right. It is pinned to the USD, but it's not controlled by a company. 

In terms of financial markets, companies, banks, and other financial institutions controls significantly more capital than regular investors. DAI is voted through MakerDAO, and the amount of DAI you put into you vote controls the weight of your vote, no? Now, either the groups with more capital can take over and do what they collectively want and so you're controlled by the company, or they can't do this and the currency is at the whims of a company, namely whoever are the executives of MakerDAO.  


&gt; You think Microsoft is going to...*buy* Bitcoin or something? 

If cryptos become recognised, global currencies, then companies are indeed going to work together to buy them and gain control where ever they can.  


&gt;Historically that hasn't worked; the best they could do was fork it (BCH &amp; BTG). And with the market cap growing quickly, it's becoming less feasible by the day. 

Historically, these attempts have been done by relatively small groups with little capital compared to multi-trillion dollar companies, or countries.",2021-05-01 04:52:09

Neophyte-,"&gt; 1) UTXOs are constantly merged, so if two, three, or four UTXOs are needed to send an amount, there will typically be one output for change.

thanks i didnt realise this, hence the blockchain bloat isnt really a problem.

on point 2) ive read that the UTXO model makes writing smart contracts more difficult since you need to pick out the UTXO you need to fulfil the transaction e.g. sending some money. in the account model its easier since you just deduct the balance. Do you think thats a valid criticism? or can the contract framework hide those lower level details from the user, much like how bitcoin wallet software works? 

Wehn you talk about integrated defi, what does that mean exactly? defi is usually just a dapp built within a chain e.g. makerdao on eth. can you give me an example?

Centrelized development: that is usually required for projects that aim to do more than transfer one token from one wallet to another. They all end up as DAOs where the community can vote on changes (MakerDAO, ETH, Uni, algo, VET, basically every token or relevant blockchain). The fact you can vote on improvements makes it a million times more decentralised than a fixed never changing system like bitcoin

Premining: this is only a problem if the only value of your token is its fabricated rarity. I can see how a bitcoin maxi would think this is a problem 😂

Low security and attack angles: bitcoin is one of the most centrelized systems, having 53% of its mining power in a single Chinese controlled pool. The fact that the mining of bitcoin will only get more complex and require more money investment will only further centrelize it to the few who can mine it",2021-05-01 17:49:58

Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam! Quick one for the ETHosphere timeline update this week as it’s a holiday weekend for me here in the UK. Taking some time out to relax, and of course watching the price spike like the rest of you degens. The summary of this week is that we don’t have much new, but we do have much more confidence in the Merge and the London upgrade is still on track. I think the market is reacting to something…

**The Merge**

~ On Friday, the first Merge devnet was activated at the Rayonism hackathon. Four Eth2/consensus layer clients (Teku, Prysm, Lighthouse, and Nimbus) achieved various levels of interoperability with three Eth1/execution layer clients (Besu, Nethermind and Geth). Things are looking good for testing so far.

~ It looks like there **will** be an effort made to test sharding and withdrawals, although u/vbuterin [points out](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/n1cpbh/tutorial_for_ethereum_merge_testnet/gwc6nmd/) that this test is for the post-transition state of the Merge only - the transition itself is a separate, hopefully simpler, beast that will be informed by the learnings we get from Rayonism. 

~ All told this is incredibly bullish. 2021 Merge launch ambition is looking more likely as a result of this, in my view.

**London**

~ Still on track for 14 July. We should find out the specific block numbers for test/mainnet next week.

~ EIP-3529, for reducing gas refunds, is the new EIP-3403. 3529 [will be included](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1388193584726233091) in London.

~ The difficulty bomb EIP, 3238, needs to be re-written to accommodate the change to bring it forward to Dec 2021. Thus 3238 will not be in London, but its eventual replacement will be.

~ EIP-3541 [is also being considered](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/307) for inclusion in London. If included, 3540 should follow in Shanghai. If not, it might be Cancun which is gonna be a while. To be discussed at [the next ACD](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/309)!

~ Due to these EIP updates, the [Baikal devnet has been launched](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md), replacing the Aleut devnet. We hardy knew ye!

**Other bits**

~ Rocketpool - The current (finale?) beta has now concluded! A new more permanent Rocketpool testnet will launch on the Prater testnet in May. This is effectively the mainnet release candidate for Rocketpool and will include updates off the back of the audit recommendations. I feel like we say this every week, but, mainnet edges closer! Am still picking June until they tell me otherwise.

~ Uniswap v3 lands this week, Wednesday! Remember that it’s not planned to launch on Optimism L2 - that is still to come. All eyes…

~ And those are the main timeline updates. Not much change in the L2 landscape this week afaik, but some weeks are like that!

what would be more interesting perhaps useful is a dai tied to value of a basket of currencies, like SDR proposal by the IMF (Pegged with: U.S. dollar, euro, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, and pound sterling)

this would add more complexity to price oracles and for maintaining the peg in the market as arborators would find it harder to know the exact value of a multi currency stablecoin.

TonberryHS,"A “stablecoin” is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price.

**Tether**

Tether, or USDT (-0.01%), is one of the oldest stablecoins, launched in 2014, and is the most popular to this day. It’s currently one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies overall by market capitalization.

The primary use case for USDT is moving money between exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities when the price of cryptocurrencies differs on two exchanges; traders can make money on this discrepancy. But it has found other applications: Chinese importers stationed in Russia have also used USDT to send millions of dollars worth of value across the border, bypassing strict capital controls in China.

Tether Ltd., the company that issues USDT, is embroiled in a legal battle with the New York Attorney General concerning providing financial documents that would illuminate its financial relationship with the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.

**USD Coin**

Launched in 2018, USD Coin is a stablecoin managed jointly by the cryptocurrency firms Circle and Coinbase through the Centre consortium.

Like tether, USD Coin is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.

**Dai**

Running on the MakerDAO protocol, dai is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in 2015, dai (-0.01%) is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by ether (ETH, +16.85%), the token behind Ethereum.

Unlike other stablecoins, MakerDAO intends for dai to be decentralized, meaning there’s no central authority trusted with control of the system. Rather, Ethereum smart contracts – which encode rules that can’t be changed – have this job instead.

There are still problems with this innovative model, however; for example, if the smart contracts underpinning MakerDAO don’t work exactly as anticipated. Indeed, they were gamed earlier this year, leading to losses of $8 million.

**Diem**

Diem (formerly known as Libra) is a stablecoin in the works, originally conceived by the powerful, worldwide social media platform Facebook. While libra hasn’t launched, it’s had more psychological impact than any other stablecoin. **I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because fuck facebook.**

Governments, notably China’s, are now exploring their own crypto-inspired digital currencies, in part because they’re worried Diem would be a competitive threat since Facebook is a multinational company with billions of users from across the globe.

Initially, the Diem Association, the consortium set up by Facebook, said Diem would be backed by a “basket” of currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the euro. But due to global regulatory concerns, the association has since backed off from its ambitious original vision. Instead, it is now planning to focus on developing multiple stablecoins, each backed by a separate national currency.

Its first stablecoin, the Diem dollar, is expected to launch in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few drawbacks to stablecoins to keep in mind. Because of the way stablecoins are typically set up, they have different pain points than other cryptocurrencies.

Crypto publication The Capital, for instance, argues that while stablecoins are called “stable,” they are only as stable as the asset that the stablecoin is tied to. Traditionally, the price of the dollar is very stable, but if that were to change, any fluctuations in the value of the dollar would be reflected in the stablecoin.

If the reserves are stored with a bank or some other third party, another vulnerability is counterparty risk. This boils down to the question: Does the entity really have the collateral it claims to have? This has been a question frequently posed to Tether, for instance, without clear answers. Tether has yet to provide a full open audit of its reserves.

Many stablecoin issuers don’t provide transparency about where their reserves are held, which can help a user determine how risky the stablecoin is to invest in. Knowing where their money is held, users can see if a stablecoin is operating without a license in the region where the reserves are held. If the stablecoin operators don’t have a license, a regulator could potentially freeze the stablecoin’s underlying funds, for instance.

Further, it’s possible the reserves backing a stablecoin could turn out to be insufficient to redeem every unit, potentially shaking confidence in the coin.

Cryptocurrencies were created to replace intermediary companies that are typically trusted with a user’s money. By their nature, intermediaries have control over that money; for example, they are typically able to stop a transaction from occurring. Some stablecoins add the ability to stop transactions back into the mix.",2021-05-04 07:44:44

Pasttuesday,"A lot of people invested in eth since 2017 have some sort of CDP or Collateralized debt position open.

This is the power of ethereum, you can create ""smart contracts"" on the internet. These are decentralized and persistent. Once the controller of the smart contract has given up the power, these things can run on their own into infinity. This is why people buying NFTs for millions of dollars feel safe doing it. They trust that Ethereum and the NFT smart contract will stay there, even if the creators disappear.

What is a smart contract? It is code that can also be the owner of money. You can send your money into it and it can do different things with it - put it into a pool with other participants and draw a lottery for example. Or take your money and earn interest.

A collateralized debt position on makerdao is one such smart contract. The rules are: Put in value (eth or some other token) and withdraw dai (a cryptocurrency always worth 1 US dollar). You can take out as much money as you want, as long as your collateral is 150 percent higher than your debt. 

You can do whatever you want with your dai. Those who are bullish on eth, many times take that dai and buy more eth with it. Some take it and pay off real life expenses as they want to stay exposed to eth and don't want to sell. If eth value goes up, sell less eth to retrieve the amount of dai you owe, and pay off your loan.

There are many many more use cases, many of which are not in traditional finance. In addition, you can build one on top of another without permission. Many other smart contracts build off the makerdao platform as dollar denominated currencies are needed a lot of the time.

ApoIIoCreed,"&gt; If ethereum crashes and the collateral has to be liquidated, then that value is absorbed into Maker.

Ether's price crashing is not good for Maker and is far and away the #1 risk to Maker. Liquidations are not intended to make profit, it's simply the protocol allowing 3rd parties to purchase the collateralized ETH in the hopes of breaking even. And if ETH flash-crashes faster than the MakerDAO oracle updates (I believe this is once per an hour still), then the protocol could still be underwater even after liquidations. In this case, the protocol actually mints new MKR, diluting holders, in order to sell it for DAI on the open market. 

****

Just look at Black Thursday in March 2020 to see how bad ETH price crashes could impact MKR. The network was so clogged, that people were scooping up ETH at extreme discounts. MKR had to be minted and sold on the open market to make up the difference. In a single day, MKR had to mint more tokens than they had sold up to that point. This is why the total supply of MKR temporarily increased past the 1 Million initial supply.",2021-05-05 00:21:31
ApoIIoCreed,"&gt; If you guys can’t understand how at times Maker will capture the value in ether (or whatever is staked as collateral) when crypto tanks (as it does on occasion in case y’all forgot) ... then it’s not worth the discussion

No, this actually really needs to be discussed with you because it seems that you have a completely backwards understanding of what vault liquidation means to MKR. You say this twice in this thread, and it does not make sense.

Liquidations do not mean that ""the collateral is absorbed into Maker"". Liquidations are far and away the biggest risk to Maker and vaults are constructed to reflect that. That is why the stability fee is higher for vaults with lower minimum collateralization ratios -- more risk to MakerDAO means that the token holders are demanding higher fees to do so.",2021-05-05 00:28:45

r-2-eth-2,"****

&gt; Because rETH is ETH, but it's an ETH derivative that outpaces ETH supply growth, by capturing ETH staking rewards. Deposit rETH into MakerDAO. If Rocket Pool has built its code correctly, then rETH should be an extremely favorable collateral type in every DeFi application that also accepts ETH. If you allow ETH collateral, wouldn't you also be interested in a staked ETH derivative asset? Controlling for contract risk, then rETH should actually have favorable risk parameters versus ETH, because of how it's designed to naturally outpace ETH. We should expect some sort of tokenized staked ETH asset like rETH to be added as a collateral to MakerDAO, which means we can borrow DAI against our staked ETH! Collateral = ETH. Your collateral is ETH. Not just ETH, but a derivative of ETH that captures ETH staking issuance and ETH MEV fees.

In all seriousness, if you want to work for MakerDAO, just start hanging around in the chat and the forums and contributing where you can. If you're consistently able to provide value, at some point someone will try to hire you for something.

The great thing about the forum is you can get paid for participation through an initiative called [SourceCred](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/what-is-sourcecred-and-how-do-i-opt-in/3913). So even in the meantime you can be earning DAI to compensate you for your time.",2021-05-06 08:47:34
azdre,"The ""average person"" would most likely never even know they're engaging with a blockchain application.

In the hypothetical ""ETH blockchain Uber app kills Uber the company"" future, the entire experience would feel no different from what it is now (or at least not worse). The whole process would play out essentially the same way, the key difference being Uber the company isn't taking a cut of your payment to the driver for their ""services"" - ideally the driver gets the full payment and any ""fees"" would be simply the cost of the transaction on the network (which in this hypothetical future would be minimal).

The level of exposure to the underlying tech of the application stack would be entirely up to the developers and market conditions. 

Vitalik's point is that blockchain \[Ethereum\] allows for all the custodial efforts Uber adds to the equation to be automated via smart-contracting on the blockchain effectively rendering them useless in the grand scheme of things. Aside from being able to call Uber and talk to an employee, there isn't really anything about their product that can't be ported over to a blockchain solution.

Why pay Uber for this service when you can use the ""ETH Uber"" alternative that offers cheaper rides or the guarantee 100% of your payment goes to the driver and not some private company?

The ""how"" will be left up to the free market. A blockchain ""Uber"" alternative could very easily be developed by a private company and monetized, but it could also be developed by the Ethereum community and offered for ""free."" The point of the quote is that it's **possible** and that's what's so exciting about Ethereum and blockchain in general - it's opening up potential alternatives in nearly every existing industry and we're already seeing new industry emerge from the crypto space itself.

I remember back when MakerDAO first popped onto the scene and the ""potential"" it had to disrupt traditional finance. People were saying the same things...""*HOW?...WHY?...It's too confusing!*""

Now we have things like defisaver - something I could only dream of when I opened my first CDP. A blockchain Uber alternative hitting the market at some point would be far from a shock to me lol",2021-05-06 10:20:20
ethacct,"Alchemix keeps your MakerDAO collateral safe while slowly paying back the alUSD loan you took out.  the idea is to pay back your Maker loan with your Alchemix collateral, once it's down paying itself back.

The problem is if the price of ETH crashes before your alUSD loan is paid back, then your rETH from step 2 is going to get liquidated, meaning all you have is whatever is left of the alUSD/USDC you cashed out from alchemix, and your alchemix DAI which won't unlock for another ~3 years.

Government headwinds? Simple FUD from people in the industry who stand to lose. You can't ban crypto any more than you can ban rock and roll. All you need to do is fire up a terminal and connect with the apps.

Volatility? Many assets are volatile. More FUD. Volatility does not equal more risky.

Basecoin. Lol what? No mention of DAI, which is the building block of DeFi. Research MakerDao.

TimbukNine,"Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Your thoughts on how crypto can improve the current situation are pretty much on point. Let's take it a little further and explore the DeFi approach:

What if an ETH whale wanted to buy that house. It seems to me there are several choices here:

**1) Sell their crypto, pay the capital gains and buy the house outright**

This approach would be good if they wanted to diversify away from crypto into property but does mean that they'd miss out on all those sweet gainz. No bank involved because there's no loan so not really relevant to our discussion.

**2) Our bullish whale could mint some DAI using MakerDAO**

This approach would mean locking up a lot of ETH to create the DAI and pay taxes/fees. For a $1m house this would be $1.5m worth of ETH as collateral. I'm not sure what the tax position would be on this ""loan"" (any thoughts?). The DAI is sold for USD with some slippage and the USD transferred to a bank account. This is then used to pay for the house outright.

Over time ETH rises and falls and our whale earns more ETH which in turn goes to buy DAI and pay off the loan, thus returning their original ETH.

**3) Our whale could shortcut the DAI and use Alchemix**

This approach would have our whale putting their ETH into Alchemix using $2m for a higher level of collateral. Alchemix then uses Yearn to create an interest bearing investment using the ETH and provides the DAI immediately for spending as in option 2. Over time the interest earned through Yearn pays down the original collateral until all is unlocked.

That's my understanding of the current crypto solutions to this problem. What do you think?",2021-05-06 21:35:00
calcrypto4,"The ATH is 5.22. If you have confidence in MakerDAO, it's reasonable to think we should see similar highs again. At the very least, you can see that despite the increase in USD value, MKR is still stuck in a 1-2 ETH bottom channel, so it's ripe for a real breakout.",2021-05-06 22:36:06

bsc_gateway,"1) DeFi is already the source of lots of trading funds for hedge funds. The funds can hold btc or eth and borrow money to make trades in non-crypto markets.   


2) DeFi -&gt; financing a business has just happened last month. MakerDAO is pioneering a way for business owners to collateralize and finance business properties. The property is placed into a legal trust which will follow instructions from the blockchain. If a property falls into default, the protocol can issue a liquidation order. Most real estate loans are overcollateralized anyway.  Since the first one happened last month, there's only upside on this market.

greencycles,"Side note, what's your opinion on DAI from MakerDAO?",2021-05-07 04:53:30
The_Roaring_Fork,"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations: An early use case unearthed by Ethereum developers, decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are blockchain-based organizations that operate without central authorities. They are governed by rules coded in software and administrative decisions are voted upon by a community of stakeholders. DAOs were one of the first innovations tested on Ethereum and remain influential today. While the hack of the pioneering Ethereum-based DAO in 2016 was a watershed moment in blockchain history, DAOs remain open-source and community-governed. Today, several DAOs, including MolochDAO and MetaCartel, operate in a similar fashion to the original DAO, pooling user funds to offer grants to Ethereum entrepreneurs. 

Token Launches: Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are token sales that function similarly to the traditional initial public offering (IPO). Ethereum-enabled startup fundraising played a huge role in the growth of blockchain and crypto throughout 2017 and 2018. While Ethereum’s use of crowdfunding to bolster its protocol’s development in 2014 was novel, token launches exploded during what is known as the ICO boom. This increase in funding for crypto startups presented a paradigm shift in the way innovative startups raise funds. 

ICOs garnered significant mainstream attention for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency space, but not all positive. Amidst the frenzy, some ICOs were not well conceived, a few were outright scams, while others were unable to achieve their goals — less than half of ICOs survived four months after their initial token sale. However, many projects that raised funds through an ICO are thriving — like prediction market company Augur and privacy-centric web browser Brave. 

Displaying its ability to support the blockchain-industry as a whole, Ethereum is the mechanism by which large blockchain projects launch and raise money. For example, EOS initially launched its token sale on Ethereum before migrating the tokens to its own blockchain. These token launches played a huge role in turning blockchain into a global phenomenon. 

Enterprise Ethereum: Enterprise Ethereum refers to customized software and networks based on Ethereum that are created for private corporations and businesses. These networks are permissioned, meaning enterprise clients retain control over the architecture, the validators, and the users. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) now has more than 200 member organizations including Samsung Group, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Microsoft — all of whom are experimenting with private versions of Ethereum for enterprise purposes. J.P. Morgan and more than 300 banks use a version of Enterprise Ethereum to run an inter-bank payment network. The Covantis initiative, set up by a group of institutions in the commodity industry, uses Enterprise Ethereum to run a post-trade execution platform for agricultural shipping transactions. And, Microsoft and Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) adopted Enterprise Ethereum to build a tracking platform for luxury goods. 

NFTs: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, indivisible, and provably scarce digital assets that are useful in gaming, art, and ensuring the provenance of luxury goods. Hype over NFTs began in late 2017 with the launch of CryptoKitties’ digital cat collectibles, but since then, the applications for the technology have grown rapidly. NFTs have attracted an increasingly mainstream audience to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The NBA, Ubisoft, and LVMH are experimenting with NFTs. 

Stablecoins: Stablecoins are cryptocurrency tokens pegged to another asset, typically a fiat currency. For example, there are stablecoins backed by fiat currencies like USD and commodities like gold, while other stablecoins maintain their value algorithmically. Additionally, some stablecoins are backed by a balanced basket of major cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are used as a reliable store of value in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a hedge against price volatility for crypto traders, and a stable, global currency for people whose local fiat currency is devalued due to economic or political instability. Tether is the oldest and largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Today, many crypto exchanges have their own stablecoin.   

DeFi: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the newest innovation to see an avalanche of use and growth on Ethereum. DeFi platforms are reinventing traditional financial products and services, adding programmable, decentralized, and censorship resistant features to create brand new financial products. For example, DeFi platforms offer peer-to-peer borrowing and lending, interest on crypto holdings, decentralized exchange mechanisms, stablecoins, and composable features that maximize passive earning opportunities. Popular DeFi platforms include Compound, MakerDAO, and Aave. In 2020, the total value locked in DeFi platforms eclipsed $4 billion. ",2021-05-07 09:48:28

Sure, if eth is the only asset and you're not able to buy DAI through other means.  If we're thinking about it like a traditional loan then hypothetically someone could put their fiat from other income through an exchange to buy DAI and pay it back.

coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Sergey Nazarov, founder of the oracle network Chainlink, thinks the DeFi ecosystem could swell to $1 trillion next year. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is an umbrella term for non-custodial protocols. Popular DeFi projects like AAVE, MakerDAO and Uniswap have led the charge.

Snoo-8719,"\~30% respondents ""feel"" like it is possible a coordinated action on MKR to perturbate the value of DAI. Even if the mechanism is not identified, this possibility may be a factor to deter some users from using DAI. I think this could be alleviated by explaining better the interplay between MR, DAI and the rest of the crypto market ecosystem. In practice, there are many scenarios that could be simulated using multi-agent simulations. The result of the many scenarios could be published and peer reviewed to demonstrate that DAI is resilient to certain scenarios and not resilient to other scenarios. This work could also help MakerDAO foundation to make more informed proposals.",2021-05-08 14:40:55

Neophyte-,"the makerDaO system to mint dai is basically a way to take out a loan against your collateral (crypto)

you do this for reasons like you would any other loan in the classic financial world

- to buy something else investment/speculation e.g. use the dai to buy eth

- take advantage of interest rates differences. you mint dai at a 5.5% stability fee, loan it out on compound for 12% or pay off a debt that has an interest rate higher than 5.5% e.g. credit card at 22%

The difference between loans in the crypto world and real life is that your collateral source in real life can vary greatly e.g. use your house to secure a mortgage. in the case of unsecured loans e.g. personal loan from the bank or a credit card. there is a regulatory / legal framework to protect lenders so that you pay back the money.",2021-05-09 06:58:49
Filibuster69,"A super risky bet is Cargox. Instead of giving you interest, they buy and burn the token like MakerDAO. They are making a digital bill of laden that runs on Ethereum and for every container they process, they buy 10$ worth of CXO tokens from the market, burn 70% and keep 30%. The best part is that their system has been made mandatory by the egypcian government and will be also used by many ports in India. That means that since July for every container that arrives in Egypt, they will be buying 10$ worth of CXO tokens. As CXOs marketcap is very low at the moment, there could be a lot of upside potential on the token caused by a real life use case.",2021-05-09 11:47:21

Karyo_Ten,"Once you've done that you've done the dev part and many companies would love to hire you.

But this is not only about tech, it's also about vision and community and ""tribes"". 

You can't do this alone, so either create your own community or join one or get hired.

There are a couple with charity in mind:

- The UNICEF blockchain division in New York
- The bounties network
- The Commons stack
- The Open Money Initiative
- Gitcoin
- Giveth

As someone who worked in charity before working as a blockchain dev, charities also have tremendous difficulties.
Often donations don't go to the charities mission but are eaten by operation costs. They have transparency concerns. They have retention issues because they don't pay well and political issues because being a charity director is a ego boost when you have another career on the side that pays the bills.
Those might also be interesting problems to solve with blockchain. 

Though I do suggest you work first with an organisation so that you find mentors and understand more of the problem space before considering creating your own team/product.

frank__costello,"I'd break it down to two categories: assets that earn dividends from revenue (usually fees collected by the protocol), and assets that earn dividends through issuance.

Revenue distributed:

* Curve (CRV)
* MakerDAO (MKR) (not direct dividends, instead it's a buy &amp; burn model)
* Yearn (YFI)

Issuance:

* Aave (AAVE)
* Graph Protocol (GRT)

Both (issuance + revenue)

* Synthetix (SNX)

moonbro9000,"I’m invested in Zilliqa so I’m biased but here is some information I’ve posted before about Zilliqa.

Zilliqa has tons of features and partnerships. Sharded blockchain, Peer-reviewed smart contract language designed with security in mind(listed at OOPSLA), multiple dapps in their ecosystem such as Mintable(invested by Mark Cuban), Unstoppable Domains(invested by Tim Draper), HG Exchange (Securities exchange tokenizing other assets), DeFi through Zilswap and other dapps which can be seen here: https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2020.pdf

And more info about Zilswap and other growth to their ecosystem in their latest growth report here: https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2021-Q1.pdf

Zilliqa has an incubation program called ZILHive(https://zilhive.org/), providing grants to have more dapps built on Zilliqa.

Soon, Zilliqa will have another dapp released called Pillar Protocol(https://pillarprotocol.com/), similar to MakerDao on Ethereum.

Another exciting item is Zilliqa will have a bridge between Zilliqa and other blockchains in sometime Q2 so other tokens such as ETH will be available to be wrapped and used on the Zilliqa chain.

Also, they’ve had a recent partnership with Polaris sports which works with some high-profile sports stars like James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Another significant partnership is Xfers which is considered the PayPal of Southeast Asia, and Xfers is partnered with PayPal, Gemini and Coinbase. Zilliqa created a stable coin used on the Zilliqa chain for Xfers. Also, Zilliqa and Xfers performed a pilot test to demonstrate how the XSGD stablecoin can enable the transfer of event risks via Zilliqa blockchain-based smart contracts. Related press release: https://www.xfers.com/sg-blog/xfers-pilots-risk-transfer-applications-with-zilliqa-and-cerchia

In the past, Zilliqa has had a partnership with Mindshare and did some test pilots with PepsiCo for some campaigns. Relevant info here: https://www.mindshareworld.com/news/mindshare-to-launch-first-phase-of-blockchain-pilot-on-the-zilliqa-platform/

https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/05/06/pepsico-and-mindshare-programmatic-blockchain-test-drives-28-efficiency-lift

Also, in the past, Zilliqa has worked with MAS Singapore government to integrate the use of Zilliqa mentioned here: https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/ProjectUbin/Project-Ubin-DvP-on-Distributed-Ledger-Technologies.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=2ADD9093B64A819FCC78D94E68FA008A6CD724FF

Lastly, Zilliqa Capital investment hub for Zilliqa has some pretty impressive members: https://twitter.com/zilliqacapital/status/1369887464161165314?s=20

Some members have a lot of Venture Capitalist experience and one of the members is an ex-VP of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank company.

Hopefully this was helpful and gave you a brief summary into Zilliqa and its potential.",2021-05-10 03:48:06
trees-smoke,"Yeah, basically that's 'Impermanent Loss'

As the price of ETH goes up compared to what it's pooled with it sells the ETH for the other thing.

So as eth goes up in a bull market, if the thing it's paired with doesn't perform even better you'll guaranteed end up with less ETH, it's the mechanics of AMMs.

Amplified if the asset ETH is paired with actually goes down while ETH is on its way up.

Im not the type of guy to go after IDO's/etc.  I've seen some people can do ok, but like you mention with SHO and DAO they can crap out.

jaspassi,"De-fi itself is showing how equity can be raised quickly and cheaply. 

I expect to cex to start listing on ethereum and for companies to have IPO/ICO on ethereum. I’d read that if the coinbase ipo had occurred on ethereum the share price would be much higher.

I expect insurers to start issuing policies for non-crypto assets and have claims processes on-chain for transparency and speed.

Transfer and registry of property sales/ownership to come on chain.

Objects where provenance is important to come on chain (food/luxury brands/live stock/commodities generally?) 

Business accounting - on chain auditing of business finance will be cheaper, quicker and transparent. Helping prevent fraud/better company valuation. There is a significant feeling that current auditing is problematic.

Ticket sales and the like to be completed and issued via NFT.

I expect ETF and derivatives and other financial instruments to listed and be available to investors on chain.  This will make then more efficient to run, better returns for all involved and far more accessible. It’s would. In theory allow access to a world wide equity market rather that being limited to your local stock exchange.

Ownership and repayment of financial products - e.g. car finance and other lease purchases. 

Loans generally. Mostly collateralised in de-fi against existing assets that allow funds to be released for spending and investing - MakerDAO - growth of collaterised asset growing faster than borrowings. 

Self-repaying loans - see Alchemix.

Yield farming of growth assets - e.g. rETH once rocket pool launches.

Once scaling is resolved it will be difficult for anything with a process, that involves interaction with third parties no to be on chain. Maybe that’s hopium, but if ethereum is genuinely the layer 0 solution of Web 3.0, with everything built on top or symbiotically linked, there is a lot of room to grow.

At the moment it’s early adopters, developers and degens. C 1% of world population with ethereum addresses. Where will we be at 10% or 50% or 80%.",2021-05-10 14:59:13

Pickinanameainteasy,"I know I am too. I tried MakerDAO but the gas fees were absurd for just a small loan of DAI. I've been looking into Polygon which is a sidechain I believe. You bridge your ETH from the mainnet to polygon for a pretty big gas fee but then once you do that you can do defi transactions for much lower gas. If you've ever used Lightning network on bitcoin its kind of like that. However, there aren't too many defi apps on polygon right now but there are some, like i think Aave is on polygon.

I've also been looking into dracula protocol that looks really interesting but again gas fees.

Use this site to gauge gas ([https://www.gasnow.org/](https://www.gasnow.org/)). Like right now gas is unbeliveable like higher than i've ever seen. 50 is supposed to be average, 20 is good, anything over 100 is really high and its like 300 right now which is crazy.",2021-05-10 21:31:03

Coldsnap,"Hello Eth-fam! This is this week’s ETHosphere Timeline update where I state many of the big things upcoming in Ethereum in one big consolidated list. Sorry for repost - I f'd up and linked to c0intelegraph. Many thanks u/zk_snacks! 

~The big news this week was **[the launch of Uniswap v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/)!** Always good to see a big update like this deliver on time. The launch wasn’t painless and the fees are still eye-watering, but it’s out in the wild now with $500m TVL as of today - hope you’ve all got your tight ranges set appropriately and that you were rewarded with rare [sparkly phalluses](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1390034790653599746). That just leaves one big unanswered question… Optimism on v3 wen? Official update is that there’s no definitive date yet. Grumble.

~Speaking of optimistic rollups, [OKEx announced itself](https://www.okex.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/360060706511) as the first major centralised exchange to **enable direct deposits and withdrawals to its impending layer 2 rollups integration with Arbitrum**. This is great because it means users will be able to bypass expensive fees on the L1 and trade immediately on L2. L2 bridges to other dapps will only enhance this, until we have a whole ecosystem of L2 dapps to choose from. Now, we still don’t know when Arbitrum is going to launch (it’s on the timeline for May) but its mainnet release candidate is already up on the Kovan testnet - it’s got to be soon. Offchain Labs, please!

~To round up dapp updates, decentralised staking pool solution **Rocketpool announced a subsequent round of security audits that will kick off on 17 May**. This is off the back of initial audits findings to ensure those findings have been properly implemented. Audits on top of audits? Maybe evenmoar audits needed! Timeline-wise, this probably pushes back the mainnet release to July, although June feels possible if things move quickly. This, I’m sure, is frustrating for those who had originally hoped the project would launch in March, but the team have been steadfast in their resolve to not launch until security auditing is fully completed and findings implemented. Stay strong early adopters, your time will come!

Protocol updates:

~ **The Merge: The Rayonism hackathon enters its final week this week.** A good summary of the work to date [is here](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Rayonism). This week the aim will be to get a less transient merge testnet in place off the back of learnings from last week’s successful test. Still looking good, and discussions around the post-London feature fork (Shanghai) will be enlightened by the results of Rayonism.

~ **London / EIP-1559:** Still on track for 14 July, the [Baikal devnet](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md) is running. Proposed block numbers and testnet fork dates [are public](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245). A [new call](https://youtu.be/qce2M4ot8ls) to discuss operational readiness for the upgrade has started. This seeks to align all stakeholders across the various related projects (eg tooling, libraries) to ensure nothing is missed ahead of the upgrade. A [handy tracker](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/london.md#ecosystem-readiness-checklist) exists! Additionally, there were a few technical improvements/fixes proposed for the 1559 spec which Tim Beiko [covers here](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1390706275722227713).

~ **Altair: The summer Eth2 upgrade, is progressing in parallel.** [Latest update from the client teams is that July](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210508#Altair), or possibly early August, is the current launch ambition. This is consistent with the previous update.

Super!

**THE TIMELINE** 

~ Ethereum protocol upgrades / hardforks in **bold**.

nikola_j,"&gt;Has anyone done this before using Defi Saver? Any insights, tips. and/or  recommendations would be helpful. Is it really as simple as entering  the new ETH address and hitting transfer? 

Hundreds of people and indeed it is that simple.

I guess people think this is something custom we made, but it actually just uses the transfer function that exists in MakerDAO, but isn't exposed to users anywhere in Oasis for whatever reason.

The only thing worth noting is that you cannot transfer a CDP/Vault to a smart contract wallet (e.g. to a Gnosis Safe, Argent, etc) and the target destination has to be an EOA. The app will stop you if you try to, anyway.",2021-05-11 00:18:56

nikola_j,"Besides MakerDAO making changes, other apps and parts of the ecosystem have made improvements, too.

On our end, at DeFi Saver, Black Friday was the last liquidations event, and even then the reason some of the automated CDPs/Vaults went under was because of system [design limitations](https://medium.com/defi-saver/black-thursday-at-defi-saver-3c35ea6cd0d0) at the moment.

Currently, there's 294k ETH and a bunch of other assets totalling over $1.2b that are automated and protected against liquidation at DeFi Saver. The Automation system had no issues protecting all positions in any recent crashes, like that one in late February, for example, the one with the very memorable 1500+ Gwei gas prices.

Additionally, there are some other options out there that aim to provide more stability to Maker in massive price swings. For example, there's also B.Protocol, which uses an alternative  liquidations engine powered by a dedicated group of liquidators, where liquidations happen instantly (as they do in Liquidations 2.0 in MakerDAO, too) and half of the profits from the auction goes back to users of B.Protocol.

Overall, I would definitely agree with u/LongForWisdom's hint that the protocol and the whole ecosystem is much readier for large market swings than it was back then.",2021-05-11 01:49:44
nikola_j,"That's pretty odd, was this specifically under [https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/) or in the portfolio page?

On MakerDAO (Oasis) you can borrow against ETH at a reasonable rate (3.5-5% depending on the collateralization rate).   In this case you are putting up a deflationary asset (ETH) and borrowing an inflationary asset (DAI).  You move your DAI to a centralized exchange and sell it for USD.  While the loan is out, your USD loses value as the Feds printing press prints more, and ETH gains value, increasing your collateralization rate.  

Alchemix has a new type of loan that pays itself off over time, because they put your collateral to work in DeFi.  Currently supports DAI as collateral, but they are adding ETH as collateral later this summer.",2021-05-11 06:07:23

PhiMarHal,"I could use an eli5 myself, but from what I know:

DAI are minted when someone locks crypto assets in a vault. Vaults are overcollateralized compared to the amount of minted DAI, and if the dollar value of that collateral falls too low, that collateral can be liquidated.

The peg is maintained by the MakerDAO governance, adjusting parameters like debt ceiling, interest rate and others to keep Dai as close to the dollar as possible. 

MKR holders get a cut of the fees (vault fees are paid in MKR, and that MKR is burned), but in exchange they're lenders of last resort, through dilution. For example, the protocol minted 20k MKR in March 2020 after a flash crash combined with extreme gas prices triggering liquidations exploited by bots winning collateral auctions for free. AFAIK this was a one time event, and the introduction of more collateral types should lessen the risk of this happening again.",2021-05-12 00:05:13
iamiamwhoami,"There are non volatile cryptos. But I'm skeptical there will ever be a decentralized crypto that controls inflation as well as the Fed. So far the one that comes closest is MakerDAO, but that relies on similar market mechanisms as the Fed does to control USD. The difference is those market mechanisms are enforced via smart contracts as opposed to a central decision making body. They heavily rely on the assumption that the incentives of the people that participate in that market are in line with the dynamics that control inflation/volatility. This works more often than not, but there are market failures and are open to malicious attacks, which there most definitely will be if doing so means massively hurting the US economy.",2021-05-12 02:24:09

If a majority of the community votes to increase the cap then it can be done, but that comes back to democratic control without a single political entity making unilateral decisions.",2021-05-12 02:31:15

cryptOwOcurrency,"&gt; Then, Cardano blockchain will support Solidity so that the same smart contracts can be ported to manage those new tokens.

Cardano will support Solidity only on the KEVM sidechain according to the current roadmap. How would a smart contract system, like for example MakerDAO or Compound, be able to work with its smart contract logic split between Ethereum and Cardano's KEVM sidechain?

&gt; The smart contracts on Etherium will continue to exist but won’t manage the new tokens, so liquidity can move over and then behave in the same manner as before.

Sorry if I am reading your comment wrong, but are you talking about a token that is centrally managed/minted/burned by two separate canonical contracts, one on Ethereum and one on Cardano's KEVM sidechain? Otherwise there will always be one contract that mints, backs, and burns tokens, and that contract will have to live in one place - Ethereum, Cardano KEVM or Cardano proper - and only its tokens will be portable across chains  due to the bridge, but not its token logic.

&gt; Because rETH is ETH, but it's an ETH derivative that outpaces ETH supply growth, by capturing ETH staking rewards. Deposit rETH into MakerDAO. If Rocket Pool has built its code correctly, then rETH should be an extremely favorable collateral type in every DeFi application that also accepts ETH. If you allow ETH collateral, wouldn't you also be interested in a staked ETH derivative asset? Controlling for contract risk, then rETH should actually have favorable risk parameters versus ETH, because of how it's designed to naturally outpace ETH. We should expect some sort of tokenized staked ETH asset like rETH to be added as a collateral to MakerDAO, which means we can borrow DAI against our staked ETH! Collateral = ETH. Your collateral is ETH. Not just ETH, but a derivative of ETH that captures ETH staking issuance and ETH MEV fees.

professorswamp,"I could see dai becoming universal currency for transacting, Its what Telsa should be accepting as payment not bitcoin or dogecoin. There are already dai debit cards available in some places. Seems like it’s mostly used now for interacting with DApps and speculative, leveraged crypto currency 'investments'.   
Risks I see are   
\-Eth 2 changes – if successful these should be hugely beneficial to dai and makerdao but they still carry risk – by changing aspects of the Ethereum blockchain   
\-being overthrown by a competitor decentralised stablecoin (this reducing as adoption increases)   
\-regulators   
\-market crash  
\-I'm also looking to understand more how the interest rates are set and varied, it’s by a voting system for MKR token holders, you would think they would find a way to do it algorithmically.  
  
  
Another concern I have is vault owners, minting dai that don't particularly understand what they are signing up, will lose their collateral and effect the reputation of makerdao and dai, increase the risks of regulations (responsible lending laws and all this type of thing).   
  
Essentially minting Dai is a pawnshop for ether and other crypto, at a variable interest rate with no repayment terms where the interest rolls over into the loan amount and they liquidate your collateral assets if the value drop below threshold, keep 113% and give you back any change.",2021-05-14 19:08:31

Here’s a write up I’ve posted before which might give you more information on Zilliqa

Zilliqa has tons of features and partnerships. Sharded blockchain, Peer-reviewed smart contract language designed with security in mind(listed at OOPSLA), multiple dapps in their ecosystem such as Mintable(invested by Mark Cuban), Unstoppable Domains(invested by Tim Draper), HG Exchange (Securities exchange tokenizing other assets), DeFi through Zilswap and other dapps which can be seen here: https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2020.pdf

And more info about Zilswap and other growth to their ecosystem in their latest growth report here: https://docs.zilliqa.com/ecosystem-growth-report-2021-Q1.pdf

Zilliqa has an incubation program called ZILHive(https://zilhive.org/), providing grants to have more dapps built on Zilliqa.

Soon, Zilliqa will have another dapp released called Pillar Protocol(https://pillarprotocol.com/), similar to MakerDao on Ethereum.

Another exciting item is Zilliqa will have a bridge between Zilliqa and other blockchains in sometime Q2 so other tokens such as ETH will be available to be wrapped and used on the Zilliqa chain.

Also, they’ve had a recent partnership with Polaris sports which works with some high-profile sports stars like James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Another significant partnership is Xfers which is considered the PayPal of Southeast Asia, and Xfers is partnered with PayPal, Gemini and Coinbase. Zilliqa created a stable coin used on the Zilliqa chain for Xfers. Also, Zilliqa and Xfers performed a pilot test to demonstrate how the XSGD stablecoin can enable the transfer of event risks via Zilliqa blockchain-based smart contracts.

I am trying to evaluate the prospective value of the coin. Conventional approaches such as determining a P/E ratio at present are incredibly difficult as they are in beta, and any sort of prospective earnings I might imagine are at the mercy of a multitude of moving parts. 

Secondly, there is an inaccuracy displayed on CMC regarding total and circulating supply; and in their white paper, I cannot see mention of tokenomics.

MorganZero,"The most macro-meta-bullish thing I see about DeFi, is that the smart contracts still function during a bear market. The code is already written, it’s there.

Sure, nobody is going to be happy if 90% of their portfolio is wiped out on the way down to Goblin Town, but my point is, shit like Alchemix still works. If you wanna take 20k and throw it into ALCX, you’re still getting that 10k loan at zero risk of liquidation. You can still use the money legos. Some of the yield won’t be as attractive during a bear, but the tools are still there to use. The actual spot price of ETH is irrelevant when it comes to using the DeFi tools.

Edit: I’ve heard MakerDAO might be in bad shape during a bear, but it was just chatter. I haven’t done the DD on that. Can anyone more knowledgeable than me explain why a bear market could seriously hurt DAI?",2021-05-15 16:14:32
FaceDeer,"Yes, but with a major caveat.

Back when the ETC/ETH split happened there weren't any major smart contracts running on Ethereum yet, especially not smart contracts that held value external to the blockchain itself. So when the chain forked it was a simple enough matter for the market to divide the value of the chain's tokens up between them.

Nowadays there's a bunch of DeFi contracts on Ethereum, wrapped tokens and side chains and NFTs and such, which cannot be ""split"" between the chains. The MakerDAO on one of the chains will have full value, the other MakerDAO will have zero. An NFT representing something off-chain (such as a tweet or a painting) cannot be valid on both chains, only one will be recognized. And since these things all interact with each other it's likely that they'll all wind up going with the same fork, leaving the other fork a wasteland.

So even though a fork of Ethereum 2.0 will be *technically* easy and secure, it's going to be a massive challenge to get it accepted. And if it were accepted it'd probably mean the death of the *other* chain due to losing most of its ecosystem, so there'll still just be one viable chain afterward.

It's regrettable, I liked that a blockchain could simply fission when there were irreconcilable differences between subgroups of its users. But that's just the way things are and I can't see a way to make it not like that without losing a ton of the advances Ethereum has made over the years in the process.",2021-05-15 16:21:17
FaceDeer,"Why did ETC fork pre-merge? Due to an irreconcilable philosophical difference between two groups of the blockchain's users. Such a difference could arise post-merge as well.

Unfortunately even though a split would be more easily technically feasible in Ethereum 2.0 there would be other forces that made it harder, I mention those in more detail in the other comment I posted in this thread. Basically, stuff like MakerDAO or NFTs can't split between the forks - it's all or nothing.",2021-05-15 16:24:33

McBeaster,"Depends if ETH 2.0 succeeds or not. Polkadot and ATOM aim to tie everything together, but DOT has an easier avenue to value accrual than ATOM does. Cardano and BNB maybe, longshots would be Solana or Algorand if they are that much faster and cheaper than everything else and everyone starts building on them. The Defi bluechips like MakerDAO, Aave, Terra et al have a shot as well:
  
There's like $130 billion total value locked in DeFi right now. In the next 5 years, what do you expect that number to be? It's easier to make projections for specific projects in the context of the overall market. For example, MakerDAO has ~15 billion TVL and a market cap of ~5 billion. To get to $500 billion, it would need 1.5 trillion locked and a total DeFi market cap of ~13 trillion. These numbers will change relative to each other too.  
  
ThorChain has a shot if it becomes *the* place to earn yield on BTC and Eth, rather then the centralized options available now. $1 dollar in liquidity locked in ThorChain requires $3 of RUNE, so it could get there.

Billions of MKR will need to be printed to cover the shortfall assuming the MKR on this non-supported fork is worth anything after a situation like that. I just don't see how the DAO will be able to survive such a catastrophic event.

NFTs are perhaps a clearer example. If I've got an NFT that represents the Mona Lisa, the actual physical Mona Lisa sitting in the Louvre right now, and the Ethereum blockchain forks, can I sell one of my copies of the Mona Lisa NFT and keep the other? What happens when two people bearing Mona Lisa NFTs show up to claim their painting? The Louvre can only give it to one of us, so only one of the NFTs can be valid.",2021-05-16 01:43:50

Tax wise, absolutely has to be carefully thought about as usual. I see most validators overcolaterazing with earned rpl, aside from outright converting.

Being a 2nd mover when ETH's network effect leads were already in place since **late 2016** puts it at a special kind of disadvantage as most institutional investors and financiers are inherently conservative in outlook when it comes to adoption of new architecture and will look to use what's already demonstrably working.

Neophyte-,"they are completely different. but firstly there is a difference between doing blockchain dev and a smart contract dev. 

blockchain dev is making changes to the protocol itself e.g. implementing segwit in bitcoin or an EIP in ethereum. this requires advanced knowledge of blockchain, cryptography and a deep understanding of how the particular blockchain works. a very steep learning curve.

As for smart contracts, bitcoin / eth both have them. you dont hear about smart contracts in bitcoin but they are there, just not very interesting or powerful with what you can do. smart contract dev is much easier to pick up. 

bitcoin uses the script language in their smart contracts, a stack based language thats not turing complete (no loops), contracts are limited in the opcodes available and space in a transaction. the contracts are used for things like timelocks used in LN and more im not aware of, but its boring stuff.

ethereum is a turing complete blockchain (can solve a problem any other computer can solve) it uses solidity or viper (python based). id go with solidity if you want to start since there are many more examples. with smart contracts on ethereum, the world is your oyster in what you can do, but most compute / memory access heavy code is going to be expensive to operate. when you execute smart contracts in ethereum every step in the code costs GAS. with gas prices now, even interacting with an ERC20 token to send a token is at time of this writing 22$ usd, a few days ago it was over 100$. 

a more complex example makerdao to open a vault, you are looking at probably 150$ at gas prices or more.

if youre looking for a good course id suggest, this is what the ethdev sub recommended to me.

https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/

if you have a programming background its not hard to pick up. iff you dont have a programming background id probably start off doing centralised dev (for lack of a better term) and learn python (one of the easiest langagues to learn)

worth mentioning that with smart contract dev, you need to have a good understanding of data structures to not waste gas and in general have a good understanding of fundamental programming constructs that apply across all langauges",2021-05-17 03:42:58

michaeldnorman,"These are great questions. Keep learning and don't be afraid to ask. Here are some answers that may be helpful:  


1. A deployed contract is indeed immutable. But Proxy Contracts allow the contract owner to upgrade their contracts to a new version. This allows for bug fixes. Many contracts use this mechanism in order to update their contracts.
2. They can do this if they have built in a mechanism to do so. For example, imagine a line of code that checks the contract storage for a flag, and based on the answer, revert any attempts to trade the token. Then, if they are the owner, they can call a function to set that flag to stop trading for a short period of time, and call the function to clear it later.
3. Unfortunately, I don’t know how CEX’s are implemented. Maybe someone else can help.
4. Yes, it’s possible to write pretty much any computable logic into a contract. This capability really brings out the power of smart contracts.
5. Time-based functions are difficult to implement because time can’t be trusted on chain. However, you can use an off-chain oracle to provide a time for time-based functions.
6. Sure, as long as the cap can be computed on chain or oracle’d in.
7. I don’t know if it’s documented in a central place, because there are so many different potentials, and folks are inventing new ways every day. But check out how some popular approaches work like MakerDAO and others.
8. There are likely several, but it’s hard to say which ones you should join. What I’ve done is read up on one of the tokens that I’m interested in learning more about, and that leads to further research, etc. Google searches can be fine – just never give out your seed to any person or company. There are a lot of scams out there.
9. I’d recommend reading the source. Any contract that’s worth anything has the source code out there.
10. You’re right that security is the key component here. If the system can be gamed, it will be.

Keep learning! There are tons of resources out there, and i’d encourage you to write your own contract to really understand it well.",2021-05-17 10:19:59
mayurdotca,"OK a few things for me to investigate + more questions + comments

To investigate...

1. Proxy contracts
2. Oracles.. super interesting and something I want to find out more about
3. MakerDAO - I have heard of DAOs. .. but not this..

Questions for you:

1. Your answer to #2..flags to stop/start trading.. jeezzuss...that seems like something I should absolutely look for in contracts - either via rugscreen, tokensniffer or other means. Has this ever been the source of an exploit or rug pull?
2. Related to #4, where do the contract ""innovators"" hang out? Has anyone ever tried this? Where do I go and discuss/debate some of these ideas?
3. How do I tip you for the help? Or otherwise appreciate? 
4. Interested in working together possibly? See my upcoming project(s) at wedevcrypto dot com.. i'm the founder. Small team on TG for now.. me and a few others so far..

Comments..

1. Related to #8 - Whats a seed? .. lol.. just kidding.. been through crypto in 2016.. so seen this one coming a mile away.. most wallets today make it very clear.. people just don't read instructions anymore. Thanks though.

Happy to see your answer to #4, #6

SETUBANCO,"En eso ya se esta trabajando en el mundo DeFi, la tokenizacion de acciones como el desarrollo de sintéticos, esto ya existe pasa que esta en una etapa experimental como todo el ecosistema crypto, creo que este año y el siguiente va ser el boom de las DeFi mas que un alt seasson va ser un DeFi seasson, pero creo que el secreto va estar en conocer bien el activo al cual se va entrar y tener conocimiento del ecosistema.

uno de los desafíos de DeFi es la descentralización total que es algo que se esta desarrollando el problema es que no son %100 desentralizadas y estaremos invirtiendo en productos que alguien crea pero que no estan regulados y que no tienen garantía alguna. 

Las DeFi usan MakerDAO y los contratos inteligente de etherum por ende cualquier fallo en su programación o mal intencionada programación puede derivar el una perdida de la inversión o una estafa.  pero son cuestiones que con el tiempo se van a ir arreglando. 

Con respecto a la coldwallet no por el momento no se pueden guardar dado a que el mecanismo de liquidez y de replicación del índice se da gracias al staking. 

yo diría que esto recién empieza todavía falta que los DEX integren la capa 2 para poder invertir en DeFi como si fueran acciones tradicionales. pero seguimos aprendiendo del ecosistema..",2021-05-17 22:48:53
r-2-eth-2,"**Ethereum poster child MakerDAO's annual revenue breaks above $200 million**

&gt; The total projected annual revenue of lending platform MakerDAO, Ethereum's decentralized finance ""Poster child,"" has exceeded $200 million over the past weekend, according to analytics website MarketBurn. By comparison, its average annual revenue amounted to just around $19 million on January 1-an increase of nearly 1,000% in just around 4.5 months. Out of the cumulative DeFi TVL that amounted to just over $74 at press time, 17%-or $12.62 billion-was locked on MakerDAO. Per MarketBurn's data, the lion's share of Maker's revenue comes, unsurprisingly, from so-called ""Stability fees."" Per the current estimates, the platform is generating nearly $2.7 billion a year via its Ethereum-A collateral vault-that's roughly $150 million with a flat annual stability fee of 5.5%. Collateral vaults containing Wrapped Bitcoin and Chainlink tokens as well as ETH-B and ETH-C vaults and other fees are currently bringing Maker another $46 million per year on average.

Matic and Aave are Ethereum (Aave is a defi protocol, Matic (now Polygon btw) is an Ethereum layer 2 protocol for scaling, depending on Ethereum L1).

1 there’s nothing else you can do with the tokens of the other chains. There’s no defi.

3 staking ETH will now ‘only’ provide issuance and not yet transaction fees (this will happen after ‘the merge’ which is scheduled for Q4 this year).

ethereumflow,"Subjective. Does cryptokitties really need to be kept as secure as MakerDAO? Should they be paying the same in fees for that security? 

There are trade-offs in everything with this space. Some say proof of stake is more centralized, some remember that even BTC had a small premine and had to start somewhere and the ETH also had a premine and presale. Fair start? Okay, sure. Again, subjective to opinions. 

Proof of stake is proven that it is reliable and secure while also being more efficient and far more scalable. 

There will never be a one chain world but instead will be a multi-chain future. Some networks will require more security than others and some won't need much. Some networks will be permissioned and closed-source while some will be open-source and permissionless. This is where application specific blockchains come into the picture.

There is no consensus for proof of stake more trusted, proven and secure than Tendermint; used by more proof of stake blockchains than any other consensus engine. Over $115 billion is secured by Tendermint chains not including Binance and Matic. Tendermint is Byzantine fault tolerant designed to be as secure as Nakamoto consensus without the trade-off of poor performance and high energy consumption. 

Proof of stake is the future. It is far more usable, far less wasteful and more interactive. Why hodl when you can passively earn while helping to secure a network?

MinimalGravitas,"&gt;Here is my understanding. Bob has Bitcoins. Bob wants fiat. Bob wants to avoid taxes and/or giving up his Bitcoins. Bob fails at math.

&gt;Bob puts his Bitcoins into a 2 of 3 multisig transaction. Bob has one signature, the lender has one signature, an entity they call the ""neutral third party"" has the third.

Obviously that would be a bad arrangement, but how is that related to DeFi, you've just described a completely centralized system.

In the lending platforms I know about (MakerDao and AAVE) the middleman is a smart contract that anyone can check on GitHub for flaws/scams/whatever-malicious-code and the arbitration is done through a governance token that anyone can hold and use. Users can review proposals as they come up and decide if they want to vote for the change or not.

There is also no multisig wallet you can get your funds stuck in, at any time you can pay back your loan and retrieve your collateral, no one can collude to stop you or whatever. Similarly, there is no way that the developers could access the funds that have been deposited to hand them over to the government, the code that the smart contract holding the funds uses is running on the blockchain and you can verify that there is no backdoor or anything before deciding to use it. The worst the government could do would be to shut down the front facing website, but users could still interact with the smart contract over the network, it would just be less coinvent to do so.

With regard to Bob losing his job, there is no time limit to how long the loans I've seen can run, if Bob got another job and wanted to get his coins back by paying the loan 8 years later they would still be there waiting.

I don't want to sound like I'm completely disagreeing with you. Your point about price fluctuations is correct and represents a real risk with any kind of loan where a crypto with fluctuating value is used as collateral for a different one or a stablecoin. All investing carries risk. It's worth noting that even in this situation you will not have lost everything, you've still got whatever you borrowed. As an example... if you deposit 1 bitcoin when the price is $100k, you borrow $30k of USDC. The price of bitcoin then crashes and when the value of your deposit reaches the liquidation threshold your bitcoin is gone for good. The liquidation threshold for bitcoin on AAVE is 75%, so if the price drops to $40k you get wiped out... but you don't lose the $30k of USDC (or the flat if that's what you spent it on), so you're down $70k of portfolio value. If you had just held the bitcoin the price drop would have meant you lost $60k of portfolio value.

It's completely true that some people will get themselves in trouble, but I think that is due mostly to using stuff without understanding what they are doing, and that's as true in the legacy financial system as it is in crypto. Too many people spread hype and bullshit, presenting DeFi tools as if they are magic, 'get rich with this one weird trick', which I'm sure we both agree is one of the biggest problems in this space. On the other hand I don't think that providing false information and explaining stuff incorrectly to scare people away from things you don't think they should try is the solution either. Accurate information gives people the tools to understand and evaluate risk fairly. I would advocate every day that people should never invest in something they don't understand, never use a DeFi protocol until you can explain the maths of how it works. We can't get to that level of knowledge though if people are spreading false information.",2021-05-20 03:00:00

hubadl,"In my opionen, the whole crypto space was about dezentralization and power to the people. (Tether,XRP, BNB all centralized, also Binance and Tether are closely related and a little bit shady xD)

Doge is a meme,i have nothing against it but that people invest in it that much is crazy.

ADA seems like a nice project yes, but lets be honest, its so much speculation.
It is marketed as the ethereum killer, but there are not even smart contracts yet. There is no real functionality except staking. I know its coming, but it is not there and people pump it like crazy. (Please correct me if im wrong)

ETH has many years of development and a big ecosystem. (NFTs, Uniswap, Chainlink, Aave, DAOs (MakerDAO - dezentralized bank super nice :D), etc.). The Ökosystem is crazy cool and you should test some of the defi services that are available. Super cool i think :) (I was really really impressed when i tried everything out)

I dont know that much about DOT, i think one of their goals is they want to make blockchains interoperable?! I dont have any DOT, i know to less about it.

BCH is for me a very idealistic project. In my believe its true to the early ideal of electronic cash for the world. Also i really like that there are multiple dev teams which work together for the common ideal of peer to peer cash (which could end very badly also).
I know people maybe dont want to hear that here, but i think BCH is a very high risk investement. You need to overcome states and the whole finance sector if you want to be p2p cash for the world.
Also i think bch has to overcome BTC which, lets be hones, is a big brand nowadays.

ICP is just another blockchain with a massive marketing hype machinery.
Their marketing is full of buzzwords....
But i am honest i am not that into ICP, so maybe someone can tell me what smart contracts are running on ICP and what can i do with it. Why is it better than ethereum for example? (Im always sceptical of chains that suddenly pop into top 10 marketcap, with a marketing machinery like they have)

But yeah im honest a have idealistic views on the topic.
If you want to make money maybe XRP (bank coin), BNB are not so bad choices.",2021-05-20 21:56:25

ChrolloBaby,"The Ethereum foundation website has a great guide to Ethereum development, and the solidity docs is what you would typically use to learn solidity -&gt; https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/

There are other tutorials aimed at introducing people to solidity Dev like crypto zombies. I think coding is fun and encourage anyone who’s interested to learn. I will say that it’s better to learn some fundamentals of programming before jumping into solidity - not that you won’t understand it, but you’re more likely to have a deeper understanding of it which would prevent misconceptions when learning solidity. If you’d like to ensure that you don’t get tricked by projects, but you don’t want to go through the effort of learning, then it might be good to stick with projects that have a reputable background with these considerations in mind. See what the project is doing and what it supposed to be for. If it’s a get rich quick scheme then it probably is a scam. If it sounds too good to be true, then it’s probably a scam. If the people talking about sound like they’re trying to sell you something like the brokers in wolf of Wall Street, then it’s probably a scam. On the flip, projects like MakerDAO are an example of something that provides (and not just promises, but actually provides) real utility and value that can be described in simple terms ex. MakerDAO allows users to take loans against assets like ETH. You might want to buy the Maker token so that you can vote for decisions that control MakerDAO like the interest on loans, or the savings rate when lending, or to participate in auctions that allow you to sell it for DAI (a stable coin pegged to USD) when there’s a surplus.

Same thing with others like ChainLink, a company that provides oracle services to smart contracts. 

Whether or not you decide to learn contract dev, being able to articulate the good or service a token is providing, as well as having conversations with people in the community behind it who’s goals aren’t just to get more people to buy it, is a good way to see if a project is likely a scam or not.",2021-05-20 22:47:33
halfdayallday123,"It’s an up front condition of doing business. If you want to take a loan in Dai, you’ve got to make sure your collateral is at or above 150% otherwise it will get liquidated and you’ll pay the penalty. Borrowers know this up front and have a chance to add collateral when their original collateral tanks in price and goes under 150%. If they can’t pony up the additional funds to get back to 150% then it gets liquidated. There’s no conflict of interest. MakerDao is in the business of lending and that is a profitable business. The lending rates are very low but the collateral requirements are very high. I consider this a secure, honest system that nobody is forced to participate in. I’m not trying to take loans out in the MakerDao system I’m trying to get rich holding Maker coins. I want to retire early.",2021-05-20 23:20:34

spookygunz,You don’t necessarily  lose all your coins.  For instance if you had 20 ETH at $3000 and got liquidated for $15000 and ETH was $1000.   You would owe $15000+$1950 (13% fee).  That would mean you were left 3.05 ETH.  The fee is for all trouble MakerDao has to do with auction.,2021-05-21 09:08:29

SkillDuel,"If a compromise had ever happened on Kovan (which it hasn't), it would be very easy to immediately identify the nefarious actors.

Kovan blocks are mined every 4 seconds. If the timestamps were ever to indicate that a compromise had occurred, that would immediately be publicized, and the reputation of Kovan (and of the Kovan Authorities) would be destroyed.

Since that has not happened in the entire 4 years that Kovan has run without a hitch, I would have much more confidence in Kovan, then some of the other technologies that are promoted on this subreddit.

The Kovan Authorities include MakerDAO and Etherscan. I don't think those entities would jeopardize their reputation by attempting to hack a simple Roulette game that is on Github.

I am not suggesting that you buy a billion dollars of MILLI. I am suggesting that you buy $100 worth, and use it instead of an ETH Mainnet token for your dApps, since the ETH Mainnet charges exorbitant transaction fees. The Uniswap v3 fee is currently $35.",2021-05-22 02:46:23
AusIV,"There are several concerns here though.

While the Kovan authorities are reputable, they signed up to manage a testnet, not a secure system. Who knows how they're securing the keys to their Kovan validators? I seriously doubt it's at the same level they would if they had intended to be securing serious value. If there were an attack on MILLIs, they'd probably claim their keys were compromised, and they might even be telling the truth.

And even if they've done a great job securing their keys and have the best of intentions for not abusing anyone, they're still subject to the laws of their jurisdictions, and it's not like their identities aren't knowable to regulators. What happens if  some government regulator knocks on the MakerDAO foundation's door and says ""Hey, by signing Kovan blocks with Milli Roulette transactions in it, you've been running an illegal gambling operation. We need you to do X to avoid criminal charges.""

None of these have been major concerns for a testnet with no appreciable value on it, so the fact that it hasn't happened in the past doesn't mean it couldn't happen if people start transacting on Kovan with real value.",2021-05-22 05:38:28
Datasurfer11,"A little story in patience...

Crypto has taught me a lot about blockchain, tech, finance, and myself. I followed the price of BTC since around 2014ish and was curious about it but never had the $ to invest, so when the time came to invest, I knew exactly what I wanted. Per mere coincidence I came across an article about ETH in 2016 with a little interactive tool that let you build smart contracts. I thought “woah that’s cool, surely BTC can do that (or they are working on it),” only to find BTC could not. Then I became obsessed with learning about Ethereum, started with the white papers, some Vitalik interviews, and ended with MakerDao, Augur and a Eth2.0 roadmap. 

Something clicked. This is what blockchain is about, decentralization and bringing some power/visibility back to the people. 

I went all in on ETH in 2017 at the top of the bull market, wasn’t a lot, but relative to me it was almost everything. Shortly after the price dropped and I was down a lot. I decided price was low and I should open a CDP (Vault) in MakerDao since I though the price would go up. Made the mistake of putting almost all my Eth into the CDP and paid the price. I was aggressively taking loans out to myself to buy more Eth and then adding back into the CDP (thought I was a genius). One day in late 2018  Eth just starts dropping to $ amounts I never though possible( or planned for). Being over leveraged and not having cash on hand to back up my CDP I was liquidated and my heart was broken. 

Being liquidated was the best thing to happen to me. Sure it sucked at the time and I may have been slightly depressed for a day or two, but it taught be valuable lessons: 

 1. Don’t trade more then you can afford to loss
2.	if you do trade on a margin make sure you have the liquidity to back it up in full
3.	don’t be emotionally connected to your investment 

Since then I’ve still been DCA’ing and look at Eth differently. It’s a tool, it has an awesome and diverse utility, use it to invest, collect NFT, yieldfarm, stake, and to help yourself and others. As another Defi summer approaches practice caution and be smart with your money. As they used to say
 “came to get rich, stayed for the Tech!” 

Lastly this community has been great. I have spent a lot of time on here reading and observing but felt I needed to share my story and start contributing more. Cant tell you guys how many times coming to this thread has helped me.

Thank you to the moderators and everyone in this community, can’t wait to see us at the top!

Gregarious_Larch,"For invention, protocol, and theory, you would probably want to start with the [bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper) or the more current [ethereum yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). Most projects have a document like this you can look at. Also most healthy projects are under active development so you can check their github or whatever for more details.

As far as investor backing is concerned, I'd say generally it happens one of three ways:

* Projects are useful, gain support, and then later tokenize for various reasons (the graph)
* The project starts with a token for some reason or another (makerdao) and the value is in the function of the project
* The currency appeals to people enough (usually because of a specific behavior) that they start buying and using it (bitcoin, monero)

These aren't mutually exclusive. For example, ether might appeal to people as a currency while ethereum appeals to them as a distributed computing project.

Also some coins are [basic templates with no engineering, theory, or invention involved that get backing (as in fiat investment) via meme fads and tiktok influencers](https://goto.etherscan.com/address/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce#code) but assumedly that's not what you're talking about.",2021-05-23 09:05:05

What happens if suddenly everyone defaults on their cryptocurrency loans?:  “When we lend crypto assets to generate yield, we have an extremely thorough risk management and credit analysis process. We only primarily lend to large, well-capitalized, institutional borrowers, or to counter-parties willing to post collateral and provide the ability to margin call them on a 24/7 basis.”  

“What that means is, if we are lending $1M worth of BTC to Firm XYZ, Firm XYZ collateralizes the loan (typically ~120%) by giving us ~$1.2M USD. If the loan were to then enter margin call and the borrower was unable to provide additional collateral (default), we would use their USD collateral to buy crypto.”",2021-05-23 11:58:16

richardsaganIII,"one of the appeals of mkr is that it counterbalances dai - there is a burn system in place so as the system generates revenues from open valuts and liquidation penalties - it buys back maker from the market and burns it from circulation - it also has a low supply cap of around 1 million tokens.

The maker community encourages people to use the token strictly for voting or delegating (if thats a thing in the mkr community, not sure of this). I am pretty sure they dont want to encourage too much defi use cases other then market making because they typically want to prevent a governance attack (think if an address borrowed a huge supply of MKR from AAVE then used that to vote on certain proposals) - anyways, alot of people like MKR for these reasons and I do too. I tend to watch the ratio for MKR/ETH - to me its the same idea of following the ratio between BTC/ETH. MKR also acts as a guard against the dai peg

Other than voting - i just keep the token in my wallet - but the way it counterbalances multicollateral dai is pretty cool.

SlugThugtorious,"Taken from a comment on that article that says it better than I could:

“Here’s a summary of this article:
Interpret the word “contract” only in the classical legal sense and ignore dApps and decentralized protocols. Note that decentralized smart contracts are less flexible than legal contracts that have humans interpreting/enforcing them. Pretend this is a drawback of contracts in layer 1.
Assert that people will enter into contracts on Lightning Network in the future instead of using the existing legal system (but don’t explain WHY they’d ever do that). Point out that lightning network settles on the blockchain only in the case of dispute. Pretend this solves the inflexibility issue mentioned earlier (but again don’t explain how in any way). Don’t mention that Ethereum also has Raiden &amp; payment channels that can do the same thing.
&lt;/end summary&gt;
Bitcoin could never implement protocols like Compound &amp; MakerDAO without introducing trust assumptions that defeat the whole purpose of decentralization.”",2021-05-24 04:02:30
salientecho,"&gt; To your point, though, the token is not the business. It's not the thing that generates value. It's the thing that is used as the fuel for things that generate value.

anything used to generate value will gain derivative value, and crypto ecosystems have substantial moats—reimplementation &amp; maintenance of a dapp (distributed application) on a different blockchain is a substantial undertaking.

and they *may* be the business or the thing that generates value. tokens could be imbued with any kind of functionality the developers can implement:

- the token may *actually* be the business: used for governance in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) tokens grant permissions for various functions, and votes on proposals and protocol changes.

- pools of tokens may be staked to ensure that protocol stability / security, verifying new blocks of transactions. those that come to concensus are rewarded with block rewards, those that do not (attacking or corrupt nodes) will have their stake slashed. 


- they can send the owner other tokens as a kind of dividend; MakerDAO will issue new mintings of stablecoin Dai to Maker holders.

- they may represent debt obligations; tokens issued to creditors are a transparent &amp; fungible accounting of equity. this is particularly useful for vendors &amp; customers of the issuer: they may exchange tokens among themselves, redeem them in lieu of fiat for issuer goods / services. at any time the total equity / dilution can be audited by investors. often, holding or spending tokens may convey discounts on the issuer's goods / services.


&gt; So what is stopping the devs from pushing out a new feature that accepts other coins or fiat?

on-ramps to fiat and other coins reduces friction, thereby increasing value of the native token. this is a sign of ecosystem maturity.

it's not possible to run a protocol on another form of gas; the native token and the application are as inextricable as a public company and their stock ticker.

what can be done is ""wrapping"" wherein coin A can be sent to a designated address on coin A blockchain, and a smart contract on coin B will mint a ""wrapped"" version of A. the wrapped token is then an A-backed token that can be burned / redeemed at any time for the original asset, but now can be used in anything protocol B is capable of. the wrapping function will often have its own token that it will require as an incidental fee for the cross-chain exchange.

e.g., Bitcoin doesn't natively support smart contracts, so Ren wraps Bitcoin, and then it can be used like any token on Ethereum.",2021-05-24 05:25:46

It does makes sense as Ether is a ""lingua franca"" between tons of applications and use cases in a single ecosystem.  Not that is necessarily has to be, but it makes sense as such.  I think the strongest example of this is MakerDAO.  When it started you collateralized Ether to create SAI.  This is 100% treating Ether as a store of value to get a more useful day-to-day stable value transaction coin.  BCH can totally do this as well but the ecosystem needs to catch up to ethereum's maturity.  I used to worry about Ether's price as it seemed like the end goal was just to be gas for other better projects.  But there is also value in the underpinning monetary value that makes things like Maker work.  


I would argue that Ether is a better store of value than BTC because it creates its own relevance instead of being dependent on the grown up table noticing what a special boy it has been all this time.  That is also one of the reasons I think BCH has more long term relevance than BTC.  I think the biggest thing BTC has going for it long term is the desire in most people that their money is easy to understand.",2021-05-24 22:03:05

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE &amp; AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

MerkleChainsaw,"I'm pretty new to MakerDAO myself so I'd recommend reading this sub's Wiki. It has some great info.

The shortest answer I can give is:

DAI is the product. It's always worth $1, and its the only stablecoin that's both decentralized and collateralized. You can use it to transfer value, create leverage by minting it, earn interest in a decentralized savings account, and other uses.

MKR is similar to stock shares and doesn't have utility on its own. It receives excess fee revenue from the system but it also takes on the most risk and can have its value wiped out (through dilution) if the system has major shortfalls.",2021-05-26 23:22:36
Pickinanameainteasy,"I don't know about all defi platforms but AFAIK with a lot of platforms like makerdao for example, you are overcollaterizing the loan. So for example, you put in $1000 of ETH and lock it in a smart contract. You are ""loaned"" $200 of DAI which you can do with as you please. However, you won't get your $1000 of ETH back until you pay back the $200 of DAI (obviously, it won't be denominated in USD but ETH and DAI respectively). 

This is crypto, in many cases the buck stops at you. No one in defi is gonna run a credit check on you, but the smart contract is set up in such a way that if you royally fuck up then your original collateral is forfeit and can be used to give more loans.",2021-05-27 02:44:53

Most of these require you to stake some of their tokens though to get whitelisted before you buy them. If you hate to do this you can try IEOs which are Initial Exchange Offerings, where exchanges sell a coin before they are listed. If you are trying to do pre sales in project's website they will more likely release only small amount of tokens to you at the time of listing and then release small amounts each month until your coins are fully in your wallet.

It becomes xShiba. You earn interest on each transaction performed on the site and you’ll earn Bones. Bones has a fixed supply of 250,000,000 and will be the bigger long term investment opportunity, all the way up until they’ve minted the whole 250mill. Because they’ll keep 66% of Shiba staked, it’ll allow Shiba to rise rapidly.  Once Shiba reaches $1, it will become the stable coin for ShibaSwap and remain at $1 forever after. Bones will be the crypto to have after that but, everyone investing in Shiba now, and holding, will be the short term winners. If you do a close read you’ll see they have a setup extremely similar to Maker and MakerDao. There’s also reason to believe Bones will be like yearn.finance coin (which is worth more than Bitcoin at the moment).

CrushHazard,"I think one of the issues is that you think of them as currencies when in reality they are definitely assets but not necessarily currencies. 

One of the most intriguing models out there is MakerDAO. It’s actually two tokens: one is called DAI, which currently (but not necessarily forever) tracks to USD. DAI is the currency used to make the financial transactions — the connection to our world, so to speak. The other is MKR, which is the currency used to pay the “oracles” (human beings who review and confirm the financial transactions). 

In a way, you can see DAI as the “currency” and MKR as the equity investment in the idea. 

Think of this scenario: you want to sell your house. You could do it the traditional way, paying 2% to a broker. But you have heard of a way to sell your home and pay transaction fees of $1,000 instead of $10,000. The website has stellar reviews. You go for it. 

The transaction is filled out in a form and converted into a “smart contract”. Before, during and after escrow of “oracles” review the transaction for accuracy in the same way an escrow agent would. The buyer’s money is converted into DAI,a portion of that DAI is converted into MKR which is used to pay the oracles for their trouble, the remainder gets converted back into dollars before reaching your bank account, and as with any escrowed transaction, the buyer ends up with the deed. 

Everything happens the same way a regular real estate transaction does except that instead of one person certifying the transaction, hundreds do. It’s well known that any time you move away from what people are used to (especially for financial transactions) it needs to be much safer. I think this meets that requirement. 

The value of crypto is not all that different from the value of online stock trading, automated car building or streaming over video rentals. More convenient, more efficient, less middlemen, and cheaper. 

It’s the natural progression of things. You could argue that traditional banks will compete with crypto, but I don’t see that happening. Crypto is as lean as it gets. It’s impossible to undercut it. You can only market against it, which is what we see from the banks now, even as they invest in it.",2021-05-27 15:19:37

&gt; MakerDAO's collateralization ratio stays around ~250%, the price of Ether sits idle at ~$150 for the remainder of the year, and the liquid supply is ~108M ETH. In addition, for the sake of simplicity for our projections, we assume that Ether makes up 100% of the collateralized assets for Dai. Given the current climate with Argentina's financial system, let's say Dai is widely successful and captures 51% of the Argentine M1 supply, resulting in a circulating supply of 13.58B DAI. Assuming the above collateralization ratio and the current price of ETH at ~$150, the MakerDAO system would need 226.4M ETH locked in order to supply the 13.58B Dai. Lastly, to bring the required ETH locked into the ballpark of today's consumption rate, let's say ~3.7% of total bandwidth, the price of ETH would have to surpass $250,000 with total trustless economic bandwidth reaching $27T. That's a 1,665x increase from today's ~$16.2B market cap.

MaltoonYezi,"Decentralized Finance. It heavily focuses on blockchain.  


I won't go don't to specifics, but the most prominent case of DeFi business usage is decentralized crypto exchanges. Although it is not limited only to the extent of Cryptocurrency exchanges.  


Simply put. There are 2 types of cryptocurrency exchanges.  
1. Centralized exchange (CeFi) - All the orders are being placed and managed through a central exchange, whom you trust to give you the crypto, and store your funds (if you don't transfer your crypto to your wallet). Common examples of CeFi exchanges are Binance and Coinbase  


2. Decentralized exchange (DeFi) - There is no exchange, but rather a system of smart contracts hosted on a blockchain network. Only the users and smart contracts (programmed algorithms) are being involved in executing (the so-called swaps- which are simply orders that allow you to exchange crypto with someone else). No other 3rd party involved.  
  
The DeFi technology is a pretty recent one and is currently in rapid development right now. The earliest signs of DeFi trace back to 2013, when Vitalik Buterin published a paper called ""F next-generation smart contract &amp; decentralized application platform"".  (not counting the 2009's bitcoin, because in this case, DeFi serves as a subset of blockchain technology as a whole rather than a separate technology).   


How, can you play DeFi hype?  
  
I found only one potential DeFi play that could be considered. It is that Argo Blockchain founders to launching DeFi IPO on Aquis Stock Exchange, but I didn't do much research on this one  
  
It is probably too early to tell who is going to IPO, and what are the major plays in the industry
