BigFinance_Guy,"I am uncertain how the curriculum has changed for '22 but the four topics you've covered were the four most difficult in my opinion. If derivatives is causing you as much trouble as it was for me, I advise watching MM's reading video on the topic. It provided a lot of clarity for me. The other three topics took a couple extra pass throughs, and a lot of extra time to make sure I understood the material and questions. 

Equity is *very* straight forward, despite the breadth of material covered. PM can be confusing, but once you understand the limitations in ways questions can be asked, I think it's less daunting. Economics is confusing but when I focused on material by reading (rather than economics as a whole) it became more transparent. AI is easy - there were only two calculation intensive readings with concepts relatively simple to grasp (except for industry REIT table). Corporate finance was pretty calculation intensive with some easy to follow concepts. 

Keep in mind all of this commentary is my sole opinion. You're very far ahead of the curve (in my opinion) having covered the four more difficult sections with over 7 months to go. Good luck!",2021-07-01 19:52:44

ptchinster,"&gt; Every day I work with families who are stuck in the poverty trap with basically no way out.

I have tangentle experiences with this, and i am looking for volunteer opportunities to help educate people on finances and accounting. Sadly, i dont have a series 7 or 63 or any of those, finance is more of a hobby for me, and we have strict laws on giving financial advice here in the US. Ive heard people tell me ""im in debt to the IRS. So what? All those tech giants are in debt too!"". A business owner legit did not understand why Google might issue low yield bonds to grow their business and have cash on hand, vs owing the IRS money because your accountant fucked up your payroll. That is the state of financial education in this country.

&gt; but for argument's sake, how should someone go about gaining new ones when the price of education is so ridiculous?

I forget where but also ITT i commented about what we need to do. Education is high for a few reasons - get the government out of it, make colleges cosign loans. Not everybody needs a 4 year degree, trade schools are fantastic. Google is trying to condense 4 year computer science degrees into &lt;1 year bootcamps that teach what you need to know. Theres lots of things we can do here.

When i worked at the grocery time, i was also in school. In school, there were people there who worked full time jobs, had kids, AND showed up for class. You can do it - it just takes work. Get rid of needless spending - phones, cable, subscription services, people spend way too much on them. Learn to live within your means. Society forgot how to do that recently.

&gt; The whole roommate argument is crazy, and the solution is out of the hands of people like you and I - we need to build affordable housing

If you are suggesting the government should be building housing, im 100% against that. As for private developers, i would happily invest in a complex, but i am going to have a high bar for entry - i dont want just anybody to move in and squat. Id also do it in a state where squatters dont have rights - squatting laws in places like CA are batshit insane, and discourage homeowners. Additional risk to the owners means higher costs for the renters.

&gt; ""because you're too poor to buy food"" isn't a good reason to have to have a garden

Its not just that. Its because its healthier for your body, its healthier for the environment (if you provide 10% of your own food thats all food that doesnt need to be shipped and trucked around the country burning gas). It takes stess off of the supply chain, reduces our dependence on foreign goods (chinese slave labor).

&gt; Also, there's a learning curve - what should I do if I lose half my garden due to pests, weather, etc.?

Yes, living can require work. You wont be an expert in 1 season. Better to start now. Our society has also lost these skills and it will take a while to rebuild them.

&gt; keep the masses from moving up through the ranks

Up what ranks? Im sorry if your goal isnt ""be more self reliable, have land to protect and live on, and have a peaceful life"". People who want to live in a condo in NYC with 50 people within 100ft of you, people above, below, to the right and left of you, arent living how humans should be. Let their problems manifest to themself - they will have higher rates of mental health issues, have to pay more in taxes, contribute to global warming more, they are the burden of society.

akill33,"Great question and honestly that argument is the thinnest for me too. For larger installs they often need to upgrade meters and transformers (so power can flow both ways). Also they liked to have a remote controllable switch to disconnect the asset if need be. 

Arguably a distributed resource should alleviate transmission and distribution congestion, but its not necessarily true if we want the utility to be the power provider of last resort. A couple years ago I did try looking into how much of an issue this is and what I found is the biggest cause of solar curtailment was not over production, but rather congestion in the system. Basically we sometimes turn off solar because we cant get those kWh to where we need to. 

Under NEM 2.0 the IOU's reviewed each and every interconnection agreement and often delayed projects to do interconnection studies around these points (especially when project size was larger than 1 MW). I do hope that if the avoided cost math takes this into account, they get rid of that. Nothing worse than being a salesperson having to explain to a customer we don't know when we can install because PG&amp;E wants to do a study. 

I do agree on your view of the duck curve though. Right now a good fit for solar is if you have the real estate for it and can afford the upfront cost (or pass the credit worthiness test to get it financed). I do see how it can be perceived as wrong that customers that can afford this pass on these hidden costs to the customers that cant afford/finance distributed resources. 

On the other hand, those early adopter companies took on risk with the technology when it was more expensive and less common and enabled the scale that drove cost reduction to get us where we are today. 

Like I said, its incredibly nuanced and complex but fascinating and important to our decarbonization efforts.",2021-07-02 05:47:16

&gt; Three reasons why Curve DAO Token is attracting the attention of analysts include attractive yields offered to tokenholders who participate in staking, competition for CRV deposits on multiple decentralized finance platforms and healthy earnings for the Curve protocol as a whole despite the market downturn. The root source of analysts' bullish point of view comes from CRV's attractive yield when staking the token on the Curve platform as well as other DeFi protocols. Users who opt to stake their tokens directly on Curve Finance are offered an average APY of 21% and are given vote-escrowed CRV in exchange, which allows participation in governance votes that take place on the protocol.

MachineTeaching,"&gt;What (if they exist) are the more rigorous economic definitions of a buyer's and a seller's market? How are they quantified? Does it have to do with equilibrium of supply and demand, where there is a shift in the demand- or supply curve (or alternatively quantities demanded or supplied)? Or does it have to do with ""extra"" market forces, meaning bargaining power that takes the situation away from equilibrium?

""Buyer's/seller's market"" is really not a term economists use a lot. Or at all. There is no ""official"", more precise definition as far as I am aware. It's more of a loose term used colloquially, maybe by finance people as well, but economists generally would use entirely different terms.

Most of the time I'd say ""excess supply/demand"" is more appropriate terminology.

&gt;What does this mean for the labor market? How does one ""count"" supply and demand? Does one count the number of workers versus the number of jobs? The number of workers versus the number of employers? The number of hours demanded versus the number of hours supplied?

If we go by the excess supply/demand definition, that's not really sufficient.

One might be inclined to think that a monopoly would constitute a seller's market because the seller has the advantage. But that's not correct.

Excess supply/demand is a disequilibrium between the goods demanded and supplied. A monopoly however leads to a shift in the supply curve.

It's this for monopoly:

https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/256/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-11-at-10.03.48-PM.png

And this for the excess demand:

https://www.ezyeducation.co.uk/images/Lexicon_Images/ED.jpg

A monopoly produces less and charges a higher price than a perfectly competitive market. Excess demand happens because it takes time for markets to find a new equilibrium.

Anyway, to get back on track, for a labor market, you would look at the number of jobs that exists, and the number of people looking for these jobs. It's a market for labor, not a market for *employers*, the number of employers doesn't matter, the number of jobs does.

What are the implications of that? Well, if there is ""too much"" labor, the price of labor will go down, if there's too little, the price will go up, until you reach a new equilibrium where demand=supply.",2021-07-02 17:28:19
erichkeane,"FWIW, if you wanted to still get the tax 'credit' money, you could have leased the car.

okaydredre,"It's a balancing act. On the one hand, yes. That would be intuitive. On the other, defi is relatively new and the first movers win overall. Look at what this ecosystem is right now:

YDLY is first to market on Algorand. Nipping on their heels is Algodex, Algomint and Folks.Finance all coming in months. Not all fighting for the exact same market share, but there's a good chance one or none of them survive after 5-10 years.

Compound this with having to catch up to Aave, Compound and Curve. Right now, ETH fees are pricing out casual users. Defi on Algorand right now looks great because of low fees. But if ETH2 hits and fees mostly disappear? 

And then there's the Cardano network. Smart contracts go live in the next few months. MELD finance just started their ISO on the first and will be live by end of year. Liqwid Finance and so many more launching Q1 of 2022.

Is there room for all of them? I honestly don't know. But those who crank it out while correctly and effectively choosing which fires to ignore and which to put out will win out.

PROB40Airborne,"Agree. Nothing wrong with buying a nice car at all! 

Get the A3, great. Spec the exact car you want, then just find a 12 month *identical* copy of that with 15/20k miles and pay 30-40% less for it. 

Other than the number plate there is absolutely no difference. It’s not even that you’re getting a newer model. They’re *identical*. It’ll be valeted before you buy it and probably have the same ribbon on the bonnet, it’s the same. If you’re worried about what the neighbours will think you can always stick a gash personalised plate on it. 

No Audi is going to break in a big way in the first five years if it’s serviced properly and not hammered. 

Coming to sell, your 5 year car will probably get 85-90% of the value of the 4 year old car with 15/20K less miles on it. The curve really does flatten after the first few years. 

As to the comparison, all depends on what deals your credit allows you to get, dealer discounts etc. Servicing packs are effectively insurance products. You’re hoping it breaks a lot and they cover it all, they’re assuming it won’t. The house always wins overall so, on average, it’s a bad product. Peace of mind can’t be valued though.

But, she wanted me to be ahead of the curve should something happen to the old car.  PLUS, she was pregnant when we bought the car, so we now had younger drivers to take it over.

I decided what I wanted.  It was not available anywhere in the states.  I found a dealer who would bring it from overseas (where the brand is manufactured) without a contract.  Once it was here, I confirmed the price, and wife and I drove up to the dealership.  Low and behold, what we hadn't settled was that I was intending to pay cash (well, write a check).

So I almost walked away, but decided, yeah, I can do this.  I was told the minimum that I could finance and get the incentive, and then I confirmed that I could pay off the entire amount whenever I wanted without extra fees or anything.

* Or lets say your BBEG sets up a ""philanthropic and humanitarian project"" to uplift a group of people. But to make the project financially solvent the BBEG permits the imprisonment of workers who do not produce enough. NPCs might provide testimonials like this:

 *We were always in the forest to find the rubber vines, to go without food, and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens. Then we starved ... When we failed and our rubber was short, the soldiers came to our towns and killed us. Many were shot, some had their ears cut off; others were tied up with ropes round their necks and taken away.*

  The punishment for failure to meet quotes is set to death. And to prove that quotas are enforced the BBEG decrees that any shortfall in quotas must be made up for by a proportional number of hands of those executed.

First of all, the people who post asking for advice generally fall into two categories:

1. They've fallen so deep into debt that no amount of advice from armchair financial advisors is going to help them.
2. They are well off people who have an interest in gaming personal finance.

C'mon, what do you think that 1 Billion loan was for? AI, and CAP EX to print! Do you really think they will repay it, like any other company that got those covid loans? Nobody is repaying that shit if they were under 1 million. Fact. Maybe under 100K will be recalled, if I listen to the street. I don't think they will repay that loan. Pro Bono is a bad analogy, but then who knows? The 1 Billion investment to donate 25 Million services to Moderna, gosh, I have to think that is is going to print.

My feet have been on the ground in this sector for a long time. Started with 5 person teams from different disciplines asking how to fix mega toxic battery acid dump grounds like Super Fund sites in the 1990s. Now, Ginkgo has an app for for that. Apollonia! People are naive to think that there are not twenty teams lined up on five continents of young entrepreneurs waiting for Ginkgo to print their molecules. 500 in 2025 in a understated joke. How have they (Ginkgo) done this? They worked a decade ago to help form the free bio bricks and create the global competitions to seek out talent everywhere. They started, and coalesced as a group, by winning the i-Gem competition with their founder team. That was in the investor presentation. We as r/spacs recently donated 2k to i-gem! 

Yes, they will not only realize, globally, their potential, but it will be ethical and they will help recruit talent to America. Yet, they will also be printing overseas as a transnational. Their goal is to provide a dome of biosecurity on the entire planet. They see their work as eradicating all infectious disease and providing a security dome like that of Israel, for infection, globally, for every infection that exists. In this current historical moment, that is the only approach to biosecurity. Isn't it amazing to think that we will have an atmospheric dome around the planet free of infectious disease? Of course, it is the Marshall plan of American Biosecurity, but I don't think most everyday folks will mind, or comprehend it. 

The part that goes unspoken in this, is they only projected 50million as a one time line item for this year in their valuation. Think about that. There is no more in that number going forward as per SEC regs.  They are undersold, to be sure. The biosecurity will print, alone.",2021-07-06 02:04:47

SnooPickles8744,"I don’t have strict test prep advice, but I wanted to share my insights on / relate to some of the points you made. 

For context, I’ll be taking the LSAT for the first time in August. I don’t feel great about my score right now, so I think I’ll retest in October. 

I have a lot of anxiety and frustration about the test too. I also am a really good student. I have a 3.9 GPA and I’m finishing college in only three years while working and being in the honors program. I’m not saying that to brag or whatnot. I’m saying it to tell you that there are other people out here who are smart and capable and still cannot fully wrap their minds around this test. You are not dumb, not alone, and not lesser than.

I’m a finance major and I don’t know anyone else at my University taking this test, which is why I often reference this subreddit for advice and insight and things like that. However, I personally feel this subreddit can be hard to look at sometimes because it seems all the top scorers really stand out, which is great for them, but not realistic. There are very few posts like yours, even though I feel the majority of people feel the same way as you.

If it helps to have a new perspective on it, my sister took the MCAT last June. We were talking a few weeks ago about what the MCAT Reddit was like because I brought this LSAT Reddit up and discussed how everyone seems to be getting almost effortless perfect scores. She said she too often felt overwhelmed by the advice, scores, etc., shared on that MCAT Reddit. She felt she wasn’t “up there” with all of them, even after she got her final score back. This fall, she will be attending a top medical school in a major metropolitan area with a 3% acceptance rate. So, don’t compare yourself too much to the people on here. For starters, you never know what is true and false, and you also don’t know who the whole person is behind those scores. There are some things and traits you have that will make you a great attorney that a 180 perfect scorer will never have. For example, you can look up specific law school admissions reports and see hundreds of instances where a 170+ scorer was denied entry and a 165 or less walked in with a scholarship in hand. This is across the board at almost every single school. Of course a high score matters and a huge portion of admissions, but who you are also matters. You have a set combination of characteristics and strengths, outside of this test, that others will never have. Don’t count those out during this process. 

Coming into college, somehow I was able to get a huge increase on my ACT score and I thought the LSAT would be the same, but as you know, it’s not. It’s a completely different ball game. Unlike the ACT (or SAT), at least for me, this is something I’m experiencing alone, without my classmates to compare myself to. What is nice about a test like the ACT is it generally compares you to a huge amount of people you know and are in class with everyday. Assuming you’re a good student, for most of your life, you were probably towards the top 20% of those people, maybe not always by nature alone, but it was always possible to work towards that. At least that’s how I feel and I feel like we are at a similar academic level based on what you said. However, the LSAT compares you to some of the smartest kids in college. In that sense, hitting the top 20% is much more difficult. It sounds bad, but in a sense, having those kids on the ACT who I knew I would always run circles around, even in my sleep, somehow made me feel much better about the entire process and lessened my anxiety. Sometimes while practicing the LSAT, I feel I have become those kids. It can be hard not to have a huge group around you while doing this, where you see the low, middle, and high. Instead, this forum, mostly only offers the high range of test takers. But, you have to remember that the low and middle is still there.  

Also, what I can tell you is that even if you are sincerely the least competent person taking this, which I’m sure you are not, you are far ahead of most people, who will not take this test. Just attempting this test is something you should be proud of. We all have different lives. Some people are philosophy majors, or have other prior knowledge that can be practically applied to this test. The sole fact you make the time, have the diligence and character to study for this, take it, feel disappointed in yourself, and get back up again is commendable. Getting back up again —That is something many people can’t do after living their whole lives on this Earth.

I don’t have great advice for a gap year. From reading this forum, I know a lot of people push for a gap year if they don’t get their desired results at first. From a financial standpoint, I would try to avoid a gap year, especially if you are on your parents insurance and will be getting a full time job if you take a gap year. Sometimes you can fall off the insurance since you are working full time and once you get back to school full time it will be very difficult to get back on their insurance plan (I’m talking about mostly health insurance). Sometimes people take a gap year to save up for school though or if you’re not on your parents insurance, it could be more practical. But, graduating early and having one more year as full work as an attorney will be incredibly valuable. This is just a personal opinion, but I think a lot of people take a gap year in hopes of getting into a better school, but end up at the same school (or comparable) they would’ve gotten into anyways and now they have a wasted year under their belt. For me, the test deadline is good because it pressures you to get ready by X date and study hard. Taking a gap year to relax and study here and there will probably bring you the same results as just getting in and getting done, if that makes sense. But, only you know you, and again, everyone has a different situation. Some people have huge struggles that pop up that force them into taking a gap year, etc. If you feel a gap year would be most beneficial, then go for it. You just can’t cheat yourself and take a year to half ass it. Take the full year and really push it. Although, at the end of the day, it will be the same amount of work. However, if you do end up taking the year, again, everyone is different, don’t feel bad about doing what is best for you. 

Next time you feel frustrated, take a step back and remember that it’s a steep learning curve. It doesn’t mean you’re never gonna get there. 

At the end of the day, no matter what your final score is, what is meant for you and your future career as a lawyer, and even beyond that, will not pass you by. Put in the work and keep your head up. Things will inevitably work out if you just keep giving it your best. 

I hope you feel better and know you’re not alone in feeling like this. It’s a hard test but you are talented and bright and it doesn’t define you and cannot fully encapsulate who you are. It’s just a little roadblock and we’ll get over it eventually if we just keep going.",2021-07-06 05:23:13
dhslax88,"It’s quite fascinating to see within my own friend and family group how this type of collective education can spread - some see this whole thing as a farce, while others are quite eager to actually listen, learn, and understand what is happening right in front of all of us.

There are those who have dedicated themselves to these fields and I generally defer to them, as the “system” is in place and should be working as intended, especially with governmental oversight. With finance, it seems that greed has overcome logic, the government cannot pivot adequately or effectively, and the system is no longer working as originally intended.

SiimplStudio,"I really appreciate your kind words on my approach to smart investing.

I'll level with you - I'm in my early 30's (still consider myself millenial), so i'm ALL about new ways of digesting information that I can rely on, that I know will educate me, and that I can easily integrate as a part of my daily routine.

I don't over-think the process and I try not to take any of it too literally. Rather, I just take snippets of information from different sources to add to my ever-increasing pool of knowledge on the broad topic of wealth.

KNOWLEDGE:

**Podcast:** Equity Mates - Love these guys, a couple of level-headed aussies talking with some great guest speakers and delving deep into a big range of topics - pick and choose the ones that interest you. I go for morning / afternoon walks most days, and just pop a 45 min podcast in my ear while i'm out getting fresh air.

**Youtube**: So many to recommend, but many of them are WAY too opinionated and guide you into one direction (their direction). I prefer a much broader approach, and so I almost exclusively watch ""Wealth Within"". 2 Stock market educators who offer diplomas etc in investing / finance. They go live every Monday and Tuesday night (approx 20-30 mins on Monday nights &amp; approx 60 mins on Tues). They cover the hot topic of the day for about 50% of the show, and spend the remaining 50% of the show answering questions that their followers e-mail them every week (you can message them your question about anything ASX, as long as you are subscribed... they have answered MANY of mine over the years). I love these guys - and it is SUCH a great resource tool to learn about the general market, picking stocks, reading trend lines, understanding fundamentals etc etc etc. The one thing to note is that they always talk about 'buy, hold, sell' signals etc, so they are definitely more traders, buying low, selling high - I am a buy and hold investor, so I have (close to) 0 intention to sell out of my listings for 5-10+ years. Keep this in mind when listening to them, as they are more active investors.

For allocating risk to your portfolio, I would simply ask you ""What would it take for you to sell your stock""? If you stock goes down 5% in a week, would you sell? 7% in a day? 10% in a week? 30% in a month? 

I am not in a stock that I don't whole-heartedly want to be behind. So if a share drops 30-40% in a month or two, i understand that it will bounce back, and I will stick it out. My girlfriend on the other hand is having heart-attacks on the few stocks i've recommended to her, because she's currently -15-20% on it (stocks currently in a market correction).

To keep things as simple as I can - If you don't want to lose sleep at night, and you want your wealth to accumulate over time (over time being the ABSOLUTE KEY - think 10-40 years, not 1-4), then my advice would honestly be as simple as picking 1 low, 1 medium and 1 high risk ETF, and put 33% in each.

If you like the approach above, but you LOVE one sector in particular (tech for me), then you could STILL diversify and spread your risk, and know that you'll be just fine. Example of this for a tech-lover could be:

NDQ - Top 100 Tech (US)

ASIA - Top Tech ASIA (exl. Japan)

ATEC - Top 100 Aussie Tech

That way, you are fully diversified globally across a sector you firmly believe to have attractive returns, you aren't relying on one market to do all the heavy lifting, you are a little more in the medium-risk / medium-reward territory, but you should see more generous returns, as they should outperform the market in the short / medium / long term.

Riskier than that? Pick 2-3 ETF's in sectors that you love (again for me it's tech, for you it may be something else...) to make up 50-70% of your portfolio, and use the remaining 30% to buy some individual stocks that you either have a good understanding of, or that you know currently have great buy opportunities and hold for the long term.

And if you do make a mistake, don't beat yourself up about it. That mistake SHOULD (if your fundamental plan that you put into place now) not punish you too hard, as it should only make up a relatively small part of your portfolio.

Sell the stock, take the loss on the chin as a learning curve, use the remaining money to re-invest wisely (if it is a smaller loss, feel free to re-invest into an individual stock, if it was a bigger loss... maybe that money is better invested into your ETF to avoid the mistake from happening again).

  
Hope there's some logic in here for you to digest :) 

Everyones journey is very individual, so I don't want to sway you to my way. It may be the complete wrong way to go, but it has worked for me, it has given me great returns, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my investing experience so far.

bandersnatching,"The author is a professional Conservative propagandist. His intention here is to ridicule and undermine the credibility of Carney, the Trudeau government, the LPC and Liberals in general. He does this for money, and Sunmedia are pleased to post whatever he and other Conservative political operators have to say. Not that they pay him; it serves as an advertorial to ensure he picks-up lucrative Conservative contracts in the coming election, and, in the unlikely event of Conservative victory, a plum post in the new government.

The target audience is the 30% Conservative base, who appreciate their fundamentally anti-intellectual sentiments being reinforced. That the author's description of Carney's credentials, and those of other Liberals, makes plain what comparative light-weights are the members of the Conservative opposition, doesn't bother them a bit, even if they noticed.  They don't appear to like their politicians to be smarter than they believe themselves to be.

The author paints Carney as a political neophyte, and therefore a fool to have such aspirations. This is of  course incorrect. After a successful career as a senior leader in the Finance Department, he moves to lead the Bank of Canada, and then the Bank of England. These are fundamentally political roles.

Whether he can immediately stand-up to the vitriolic attacks of Conservative politicians and propagandists, while staying on message, remains to seen. There will no doubt be a learning curve for him, as there is for all new MPs.

Exchanges &amp; lending venues offer rewards (liquidity farming) to incentivize liquidity providers (uniswap did this, sushiswap, pancakeswap and quickswap currently do it) as they depend on them.

Farms take advantage of that and resell these rewards to compound the LP of the depositor &amp; help them earn more rewards. In addition many farms issue their own tokens to incentivize depositors even further.",2021-07-06 23:54:30

ColdPorridge,"If maxing your pay potential is really what you’re after (and you have some willingness to relocate), I think pursuing roles at FAANG or NYC finance could be an appropriate career strategy. I would take it in phases though. 

First, try to get that jump from your current salary. If you’re in the US, you’re currently underpaid, and you can certainly get a 50-100% raise no problem at any number of places. If you want to build good skills and use the latest tools, shoot for tech companies. The (former) unicorns (AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, Square, Affirm, Robinhood, etc) are great places to learn the latest best practices, and have excellent compensation (often as good or better than FAANG). These can be as competitive as FAANG to get into, but also some can be less so, depending on the role.

If you’re unable to land something FAANG or a unicorn, I would focus on old tech (Adobe, Oracle, Cisco, etc). They can definitely be behind the curve on modernity, but some teams are cutting edge, and in general they will have more modern practices than large non-tech companies. Other good options are smaller startups, but these can be a total shit show, and in general are high stress but can be good environments to grow in if you’re fine with startup culture (i.e. bro culture).

In general, when looking for jobs, you’ll want to have an honest back and forth with the hiring manager about your skills (both your value add and what you don’t have experience with) and what they’re looking for. You don’t need to have experience with every tech to be hired into a role using it, so don’t stress to much about what you don’t know. 

Also I find it more useful to spear fish for jobs than cast a net. LinkedIn is your friend, and a tried and true method is leveraging your personal network for referrals, and in the absence of this, cold messaging people at your target company (advice here would be to not come off desperate or directly ask about roles in the first message, play it cool cucumber). Target a smaller number of jobs and try to get in via recruiter/referral. In general, if you’re applying to a job before you’ve spoken to someone internally about that specific role, you are doing it wrong (or at least inefficiently).",2021-07-07 20:45:49

Joseph20102011,"1.) Filipino English language teachers are only good at speaking the language in a bookish way that many of them couldn't even hold casual day-to-day conversations with native English language speakers from white Anglophone countries. Much of the English language expressions written in textbooks are not even spoken by native speakers, thus the English language proficiency of most Filipinos cannot achieve a near-native fluency level at a minimum because we rely on obsolete textbooks on how to speak English.

2.) Mandarin has a notoriously higher steeping learning curve that it basically impossible to achieve conversational-level fluency level unless one moves out of the country and live in China, so let's give other foreign language options like Spanish to students who don't like to undergo grueling rote memorization-driven language acquisition that Mandarin demands.

3.) No more further explanation.

4.) It is time to streamline government budgetary priorities that it has to reduce its interference to sectors that the private sector can efficiently do more than the government like education because the public school system is a mess as it relies on public funding through taxes that is too susceptible to corruption by unscrupulous education bureaucrats. Better for the government to abdicate a bit some responsibilities on the public school system like allowing private individuals or corporations to finance public elementary or secondary schools from their own pockets, instead of relying on taxpayers' money.

5.) Generalist teachers (BSED graduates) still dominate in public secondary schools who some of them also teach subjects that are not related to their education baccalaureate degree they finished (out-of-field teaching).",2021-07-09 09:25:08

Extraportion,"Cheers SCfan. As I said elsewhere, we have around 1GW of contracted PV capacity and, as you can probably imagine, we forecast seasonal, 14 day, 7 day and day ahead delivery pretty extensively. You are absolutely right that even on commercial scales with decent geographic distribution you can have days with very little export. 

Again, I think you’ve nailed it with the overcapacity point. People don’t seem to understand that as you cannot (easily) store power it is much more impacted than supply and demand than other commodities. When you have an oversupply of one particular technology the capacity factors drop to basically zero. E.g. you are curtailing so much that you’re almost never exporting. When you do export the price you will achieve in the market will be negligible. You can actually see this happening already in California with what is affectionately known as “the duck curve”, because the intraday price curve looks a bit like a duck. Prices fall in the middle of the day and then pick up around the shoulder periods (when the sun rises and sets). 

Just_one_last_thing is right that the LCOE is outrageously low on PV, but it still has to achieve some margin to make the investment case worthwhile. If the capacity factor is &lt;1% then you’re not going to be exporting enough to recoup your investment and you won’t secure finance.",2021-07-10 09:01:58

MinimalGravitas,"I see people recommending the Nexo, Blockfi, Celsius here all the time, but few people explain the risk of using these centralized platforms. You need to trust them with your coins and tokens but they don't have the same level of regulation and safeguards that you would get at a traditional bank. The advantage over banks is that they can offer higher interest by operating with crypto currencies and it is fair to point out that they have one advantage over DeFi platforms in that they are simple to use and don't require any investment of learning or responsibility for private keys and ownership of wallets on the part of the user... however all you're really doing is giving money to an unknown person and trusting them to make you money, conceptually it's no different to using the legacy financial world, which presumably most people who got interested in crypto are trying to avoid.

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, it means you are not giving your coins and tokens to a company but rather you interact with smart contracts and dApps which run on a blockchain. This means that everything is transparent (you can look at the blockchain and the code that's being run to validate it). The disadvantage is that you have to take responsibility for your own investments, you have to learn how they work and control your own wallets and keys. An example of a DeFi platform would be Curve: https://curve.fi/ which as you can see is not so user friendly and doesn't have an expensive corporate website, but you are able to review the code that controls your finances (https://github.com/curvefi/) and can check the maths to understand exactly how it works (https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf). This is a completely different way to make money with your money, which avoids having to trust someone to do it for you. It's still risky, because if you fail to understand something before investing then the protocol can fail, you might get 'rug pulled' or you might lose your keys... however at least you have a fair opportunity to avoid the risks, rather than just picking a random company to 

A comparison might be between using taxis and learning to drive. You can call a taxi every time you want to get somewhere, but you are trusting the driver to be well intentioned and competent. Or you can learn to drive yourself, which is probably more dangerous for the first few times as you figure out how the process works, but ultimately you'll end up better off and can feel secure that you are the person responsible for your own journeys.


TLDR: There are reasons to use DeFi over centralized platforms like Nexo, however temptingly corporate and user friendly it appears.",2021-07-11 03:54:13
Western_Helicopter_6,Sure thing - there are a lot of rewards going on using the Matic network. Even Curve has a stablecoin pool (with tether...) that pays around 11% apy - and you can even take that LP token and deposit it into Beefy finance or Pickle finance to earn around 15% APY.,2021-07-11 06:54:51
BlackHarbourTRPG,"There's a political-economic ecosphere that dominates in offshore jurisdictions in which the government and native population rent-seek off their legal framework by importing international finance institutions onto their soil.

The politicians know this, the companies know this, most of the population aren't conscious of it on a day to day basis beyond a vague awareness that a lot of economic activity in their country is those big finance companies and hey, isn't it easy to get a decent job in our country when you're born here, even if you're feckless.

I think that what's going on here, whatever the claims made by the companies about security, is that they don't want to get ahead of the curve in adapting to a new technological environment which might upset the above political-economic arrangement. Certainly not for the sake of the mere convenience of a few interchangeable employees.",2021-07-11 19:09:10

KingZiptie,"&gt; In competitive, or potentially competitive, peer polity situations the option to collapse to a lower level of complexity is an invitation to be dominated by some other member of the cluster. To the extent that such domination is to be avoided, invest­ment in organizational complexity must be maintained at a level comparable to one's competitors, even if marginal returns become unfavorable. Complexity must be main­tained regardless of cost. -- Joseph Tainter, *The Collapse of Complex Societies*

Our infrastructure and general systems were built on high marginal returns on complexity, high levels of EROEI, and ultimately the ""loot"" America ended up with post-WW2 (hence bretton woods, etc).

As our system has gotten more and more complicated, marginal returns on complexity have declined. The only way (realistically) to address this problem is to increase energy subsidies... but our EROEI rates are actually declining instead. 

As a consequence the complex society must choose where to invest its EROEI abundance in terms of maintaining (or growing) complexity, engage in empire, etc. As America's windfall ran out and Europe began trading the dollar for gold, America closed the gold window, turned the USD fiat, and then Kissinger weaponized the dollar again by negotiating the rise of the petrodollar. Shortly thereafter Carter would start neoliberalism in motion (while timidly trying to avoid its necessity by using the Malaise speech), and Reagan would in turn deploy it in a full-blown fashion (as every US admin has ever since).

Neofeudalism/neoconservatism/neoliberalism is the empire's conquering mechanism. It spread and ruthlessly conquered Western and third world nations via corporate/finance/fancy-lad-institutional means, the petrodollar, and was protected from those who resisted by its ""muscle""... the US military and CIA. 

As diminishing marginal returns and falling EROEI continue to get worse, even that isn't enough. First, all empires go through ""Foucault's Boomerang"" if given the chance (not taken over by an external enemy first)- this is where the imperial mechanisms are turned inwards on the empire itself. Second, hypernormalization sets in where absurd destructive and ultimately unsustainable paradigms are maintained and accepted as normal. Finally as marginal returns on complexity and EROEI declines, the system must choose to *cannibalize* the parts it doesn't ""need"" in order to afford the parts that it does need. This is colloquially called the ""cannibalization of the peasantry/serf"" phase of empire. We are here now. Many mechanisms are used- neoliberal paywalls extract every cent they can, housing is turned into a means of slavery (too expensive to own- all renting), social stratification of goods intensifies, infrastructure declines in what Chris Hedges calls ""sacrifice zones"" (poor infrastructure decays while richie infrastructures are maintained or expanded), social safety nets are underfunded or non-existent, certain high value but low supply goods are rationed (e.g. US healthcare where poors are basically threatened with financial ruin for using it... while richies have the best insurances, plenty of money to burn, and thus always access to care), etc etc etc.

Even a sense of community- which the OP astutely notices as declining- is being cannibalized. The true horror of our modern process is that it is *disassociated* in terms of how it cannibalizes. Disassociative structures morally launder wealth as it moves upwards, and a Portfolio of Rationalizations (neoliberal/neoconservative dogma, modern economics, etc) exists to absolve any richie beneficiary of this process. 

The world is *abstracted* to the richies via these disassociative structures, and thus they see only numbers and metrics etc that tell them a story completely disconnected from what we see and feel. 

This process is something we can innately *feel* happening *in the form of paywalls being erected in front of every social interaction.* As everything becomes too expensive we can afford only the means to survive and the *appearance* of ""everything is fine"" (home, car, etc etc). Just as the nation's government is a thin visage of bullshit which pretends to value liberty, justice, democracy, etc but which does none of those things, so too do we ""pretend"" because we cannot afford to ""really do""- case in point: excessive video gaming (which I've done plenty of so im not being snobby here). This all sounds familiar doesn't it? *Hypernormalization* again: believing in fiction, and normalizing absurd fictions as reality. 

Many people can only *pretend* to care, and thus no real investment towards social structures which support community is made. 

We really have one of a few options: 1) continue along the curve of decreasing marginal returns on complexity until fracture/war resorts the order or millions/billions die, 2) find new energy subsidies sufficient to continue generating complexity (a higher EROEI than fossil fuels... good luck) while also using this energy to scrub CO2 and export toxicity (hahahaha good luck again), 3) embrace a system which uses significantly less resources, abandons the maintenance of unnecessary complexity (thus increasing marginal returns on complexity), and balances power moreso between the rich and the poor (the rich will burn the world down to avoid this), or 4) realize we are fucked.",2021-07-12 03:58:22
PWNWTFBBQ,"I completely understand your point. Many people have said the same thing about hesitancy to accept what I wrote as truth. I like the saying, ""2 data points make a line but 3 makes a trend."" It is also using this thinking as to why I did a within population comparison. While there are 2 populations of curves, there are a shit ton of candlesticks within each curve.

The 90 day timeframe currently is speculative because we need a 3rd series to determine its accuracy. However, for the two populations of curves, within them their candlesticks show almost the same day to day behavior. The probability of each day have the same behavior in some invisible trend to happen randomly is so fucking low.

Since this has been such a common response made in my previous posts, I'm going to stress the craziness of the candlestick and hopefully calculate the probability of something like this ever occurring. The 90 day time frame was merely an observation that I was hoping a finance person would chime in to explain why that was occurring.

Grocery, development in neglected east OKC getting widespread attention with documentary, and a book.
PAIGE DILLARD, OKLAHOMAN
In the middle of the east side of Oklahoma City, along the main street of the local African American community, a success story is rising against all odds and is attracting national attention as a possible model for overcoming decades of discrimination and systemic racism. 


It took a few years to get built, but EastPoint at NE 23 and Rhode Island is complete and home to a dream list of tenants for any neglected neighborhood.  

The project started with redevelopment of a boarded-up former truck stop and a decision by Centennial Health, formerly known as Oklahoma City Clinic, to anchor EastPoint with its headquarters and healthcare center. Next door, area residents are enjoying a non-profit grocery operated by Homeland and featuring fresh produce from a nearby farm operated by Restore OKC.

The EastPoint development at the 1700 block of NE 23 St. is a success story drawing national attention.
CHRIS LANDSBERGER/THE OKLAHOMAN
The second phase of development tackled a worn-down retail strip across the street from the clinic and grocery. The transformed center is now home to a fitness center, bar, bookstore, optometrist and offices with a pizzeria and coffee shop to open soon. 

And in a unique twist aimed at preventing outside gentrification, the Black-owned businesses opening in the retail strip are each offered an opportunity to include an equity stake in the building as part of their leases. 

A national panel of judges with the Urban Land Institute toured the development in June. A documentary about EastPoint created by Stout Media and the project’s architects at Gardner Studio won the grand prize from the American Institute of Architects’ annual national film challenge. 

Seth Levine and Elizabeth MacBride also made the trek to NE 23 as they researched their book “The New Builders: Face to Face with the TRUE Future of Business.” The authors say EastPoint was one of their first focuses as they sought to chronicle the diversity of minority entrepreneurs starting businesses at a rate that outpaces any other entrepreneurial group in the country.

BRYAN TERRY/THE OKLAHOMAN
“EastPoint is quite innovative,” Levine said. “It solves problems of outside developers coming into neighborhoods who are well-intentioned but end up building projects that force residents out of their neighborhoods.” 

MacBride said they were intrigued at the array of challenges overcome by the EastPoint team, starting with the legacy of discriminatory investment and lending for both developers and business owners like Emmanuel Sosanya, who now operates a fitness gym there.

“There is a ton of big money in the world to help communities like on the east side, but not a lot of people who can figure out how to put that together,” MacBride said. “How do you fund a fitness gym in EastPoint? What he needs is a form of finance that helps him build wealth in his company. But what he needs is $5,000 to $12,000. There are banks that want to loan millions, but not at the amount he needs.”

Faded community 
Sandino Thompson grew up in northeast Oklahoma City. His parents, Wayne and Melba Thompson, were civic leaders on the east side with a long list of efforts to improve healthcare and improve prospects for Black youth. His grandmother, Daisy Mitchell, helped establish the Mary Mahoney Center. 

“My grandmother’s house is around the corner,” Thompson said. “I grew up spending time here during the summers, so I’m very familiar with 23rd Street.” 

The area faded over time, he said. 

“When we were growing up, I’d be here in the summer and I’d walk on 23rd Street to go to the stores, walk to the grocery and different businesses,” Thompson said. “By the time I was in high school this wasn’t a place where you would walk anywhere on 23rd. It wasn’t that place anymore.” 

But hope endured. Thompson grew up in a family of activists, his parents always pushing for change and improvement. He was familiar with the starts and stops to rekindle the community and bring back economic development.

A lot of the discussions took place at the Ralph Ellison Library at NE 23 and Martin Luther King Avenue. 

“Whenever there were events like that, how we could get things going and see revitalization in this part of town, they would be held at the library,” Thompson said. “There are a lot of people I knew who owned property that fell into disrepair. They didn’t know what to do with it, and often they didn’t have the means to follow through with the ideas they had.” 

Interstate 235 is the dividing line between east and west Oklahoma City. And while NE 23 was stagnating, a different story was taking place along NW 23 where similarly neglected commercial buildings were coming back to life with restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. 

The Pivot Project, a group started by David Wanzer, Jonathan Dodson and Ben Sellers (who has since left the partnership), was building a track record of successfully redeveloping older properties, including the iconic Tower Theatre and an adjoining strip of abandoned storefronts. 

Thompson got to know Dodson, a former banker, as the pair served on the Bricktown Design Review Committee. The pair started talking about dreams of bringing similar development to NE 23. The Oklahoma City Clinic was looking to leave its long-time home at the Oklahoma Health Center and rebrand itself as Centennial Health Clinic. 

Thompson, joining with the Pivot Project, did a deal with Centennial Health to move its headquarters and operate its clinic in the former Cleary’s Service Station at 1720 NE 23. 

“The assumption was if we have the capital, a development group that has an inclusive approach to development, and we have local community partners and leaders involved, this should be pretty easy,” Thompson said. “We have an anchor tenant; we know what this looks like and we know what we’re facing.”

Overcoming history 
The development team hoped they had all the ingredients to attract financing. They had the support of the mayor and council and were in communication with community leaders. Two dozen banks declined to finance EastPoint. 

“We would tell them the location, and they would say, ‘Oh, well, we really haven’t loaned money on that side of town,’ ‘We haven’t really done things on that side of town,’ ‘We don’t have comps,’ ‘We’re not sure about appraisals.'” 

After decades of redlining and flight of capital, how could the east side provide comps, which help banks track property values and lending patterns? These bankers weren’t necessarily racist, Thompson said, but he believes it all comes back to the systemic racism that plagues Black communities throughout the country. 

“Despite having the guys who brought the Tower Theatre back, the guys celebrated around town for pulling off some tricky developments, challenging developments that they made work and have success, to have them at the table, and the full-on support of our council person, and community leaders, we couldn’t get financing,” Thompson said. “We couldn’t get a bank to spend a lot of time with us.” 

White flight hit the east side in the 1950s and 1960s as the African American community battled for civil rights and an end to Jim Crow. The GI Bill and federal housing programs started after World War II were not equitably applied, Thompson said. 

“Sometimes the laws were explicitly meant to discourage Black homeownership and particularly in primarily white communities,” Thompson said. “As some of that began to change, you had white flight to the suburbs and this became a community and corridor for the African American community.” 

The city quit investing in the east side; streets and sidewalks crumbled and neighborhoods were not protected from encroaching industrial properties. Black families invested in the community began to see diminishing returns, Thompson said. 

The community lost voices to advocate for its well-being. ",2021-07-12 17:22:07

norcaltraveler,"Every class is subjected to the Haas Curve so there are no GPA boosters at Haas. Especially not among the core classes which are curved to a 3.4 (electives are curved to a 3.6). 

I'd say this really depends on your background and what you think your strengths are. If you have a good background in economics then UGBA 101A or B would be a good idea. Both are significantly less quantitative than their counterparts in the Econ department (Econ 100A/B) and I found UGBA 101B to be a breeze compared to Econ 100A. If you have some prior knowledge in accounting or finance then UGBA 102A or UGBA 103, respectively. Especially if you're decently good at math, UGBA 103 would be a good choice since that's really the only quantitative Haas class that uses anything beyond arithmetic. I took UGBA 104 with Andy Shogan and found it to be pretty clear and fair in terms of material and grading. If you've worked with Excel and/or have some basic knowledge of data science it would be a good choice. My highest core course grade was in UGBA 105 with Dana Carney. The midterm and final were all multiple choice, so if you're good at memorizing concepts/definitions then this would be a good course for you to take. UGBA 100 and 106 vary wildly based on the professor but generally involve quite a bit of public speaking so if you're good at presentations and don't mind group work then consider those. UGBA 107 is taught by Alan Ross every semester unless something has changed. Much of your grade is based on a semester-long research paper which, in my opinion, had very unclear and inconsistent grading. So I would personally avoid 107 your first semester. 

I wish I could give you a more concrete answer but I really think this depends on you and your background. But hopefully this helps and let me know if I can provide any more info! And congrats on getting into Haas :)",2021-07-14 04:27:56

cheesetouchbobby,"Ok, I will fall off of the wage gap thought experiment and attempt to give you one that is a bit more neutral and not solely relying on progressive talking points. And I will also try to explain further what I mean by “it’s part”, and attempt to be neutral there also, so you don't necessarily have to rely or heavy dwell on progressive solutions to answer.   
Let's say there's a public school that takes an annual field trip to the zoo. And at the end of the day the kids take a pop quiz about the animals they saw that goes towards their biology grade and the trip itself costs $40 dollars to go. Now there's an one important problem that may arise within the grade system for students that couldn't go due their parents not having extra income to pay for it. This could lead to a grade disparity between students living in lower income households vs  higher income households.  
 Now should the school do “its part” in adjusting the variables surrounding field trips in order to close this gap in grading disparity or should they disregard these efforts on the basis that some kids don’t have the opportunities like education? “Its part” put simply, could be a wide array of solutions with different types of combination but with their goals being to minimize this disparity in grades in relation to field trips. A few of the solutions being, changing when the field trip is held so that it is outside the grading period, remove the pop quiz or grading curve associated with said quiz, or implementing solutions that may help finance poorer students or all students so that income is less of a factor, like a annual bake sale :). Should the school do “its part” in adjusting or removing the system in the pursuit of fairness or should it not on, the basis that other kids do not have access to school?",2021-07-15 04:08:01

I actually prefer my honors classes to the regular classes because the teachers tend to be more lax and curve better. The disadvantage is definitely the commitment but it is something that you can put on your resume as it looks good and I’m not sure that Baruch does deans list anymore. 

If you’re into finance, look into zicklin honors. You have to take 5 classes that are very progressive and based on real life experiences for those in finance.

Malokium,"I saw your comment on GT about feeling bad that you aren’t landing anything and yet you here younger guys in the library talking about their $45/hr internships. I have a 2.6 GPA and had a 10% hit rate (which is huge) on converting cold-email resume sends to one of those $45/hr finance internships. If you said you’ve sent out 250 applications and aren’t receiving anything back are these just random applications on LinkedIn you quick fill out and send the same resume over to all of them? If so I can see why you aren’t hitting as hard as you could. Your resume shows great experience in an engineering field with some solid skills AND your business experience shows you’re an ambitious self starter willing to take risks to start a business. You have the skills but I think you’re missing some key things:

Delete your other school and keep GT only. You’re super old you said you’re a 4th year but graduating in 2023. Take off 2020-2023 and put class of 2023. You don’t want these companies already assuming the reason you’re taking longer is because of indecision in your major or not succeeding in academic prereqs. Next change skills to skills and interests and put some of your interests that make you stand out and you can form personable connections with your interview. I had cooking as one of mine and 5 minutes that could’ve been used to ask about yield curve convexity and options theory turned into 5 minutes of discussing my favorite cuisine and food recommendations I had for atlanta. Not only did I make a personal connection that made my interview stick out, but I didn’t get asked an additional amount of technicals that could’ve shown weakness (granted anything I got asked I hit out of the park so maybe they just assumed I knew everything and wanted to talk about my cooking). Lastly, the way you should now approach jobs instead of shotgunning you’re resume to 250 companies applying online, go to LinkedIn and start looking for recruiters and their emails and send over an email (Theres templates online for cold emailing resume drops) and if you get a response apply online, or maybe you’ll be lucky and they’ll forward your resume over.

Tldr: be more interesting, take off your second school and turn GT into class of 2023 (this is probably the biggest, approach your recruiting season differently. If you’re filling out 250 applications you’re putting in a ton of time just redoing things, how about fill out 20 applications in which for each of them you: Reach out prior to applying to one of the recruiters or current employees via email (use one of those apps where you can find employee email on LinkedIn), tailor your resume to the position (if you’re applying for a start up emphasize your own business start up and risk management you took challenges you overcame etc - do this in a cover letter or part of the cold email), and assuming you do all this and can finally get interviews im hopeful that you understand interviews are about technichals sure but mainly about making an impact and being memorable - which is why you need interests or club involvement.",2021-07-15 07:13:32

ShapeShift, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, is running an airdrop that will see it distribute tokens and governance rights to its userbase.

##

“To align with the ethos of decentralized finance, [we have] begun dissolving our corporate structure, evolving into a community-owned and governed crypto platform,” ShapeShift wrote in a statement.

ShapeShift claims that its airdrop is the largest in history, as FOX tokens will be dropped to more than one million addresses. 60% of the token supply has been allocated to ShapeShift users.

##

Additional tokens have been allocated to users of other DeFi platforms, including those who hold tokens for Gitcoin, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Yearn, Aave, Alchemix, 1inch, Curve, Balancer, and 0x. KeepKey wallet users are also eligible for the airdrop.

Crypto investors can connect their wallet on this web page (https://fox.shapeshift.com/airdrop) to find out if they are eligible for ShapeShift’s airdrop.

lazy_moogle,"The first million takes a lot longer than the second million. The 3rd million seems to be coming even faster than the 2nd. I hope this remains on an exponential curve! Trying to save up 5 mil before I do a big purchase of a faerie xwee morphing potion or desert Aisha morphing potion (not sure which I want first!)

For anyone curious how I did it:

Battledome: I mostly fought chia clown until about a week ago when I finally had trained my BD pet enough to beat jetsam ace everytime. Chia clown dropped lots of codestones for me and the occasional chocolate ice cream. Jetsam ace has been dropping the occasional nerkmid and a good amount of codestones. For a while I was saving the tan codestones for training and selling everything else, but now that I can 1 shot the ace I am selling everything of value. I keep the food that I get from the battledome to feed my pets instead of using the neolodge, and donate any junk items.

Faerieland employment agency: I only take jobs that are a base reward of 5000np+, and only if the price difference bt completing the job and the reward is at least 1000np. Some days I make 10k, some days 20k. It all depends on what jobs are available. Last night I had a single job net me 8k, some days the only jobs I find worth while will only net 2k.

Stonks: I have only cashed out on one stock, with 2000 shares bought at 15 and sold at 60. That got me 90k profit. I have 450k invested in the stock market, and intend to only cash out at 60 for each stock. It takes a while, but in the long term it always pays off.

Restocking: I do occasional restocking, mostly at the food shop or the smoothie store. Sometimes I will do the neopian central petpet store or the clothing shop. In general my advice is always search on SW (or SSW if you have it) to see if you can get a good profit before buying. Faerie quest items sell quickly. Get familiar with what sells for a profit and sells within a decent timeframe in any shop you decide to restock. This takes some time.

Food club: I only recently started playing food club. I have played 5 times and on my betting page it says I have made a profit of 125k so far. I follow the food club bets threads in the sub and choose one of the talented bettors suggestions each day. I was playing only 2000np on each bet, but since my last few plays were quite successful I raised it to 4000np.

Dailies: I do a good amount of the dailies on jellyneo's dailies. Trudy's is an absolute must, as is forgotten shore and the Magical blue grundo plushie. Those three dailies have given me the most return out of any of them. Obviously do the other free ones because it costs you nothing but if you only have time for a handful a day I'd say don't miss the aforementioned three. Especially Trudy's!!

And that's about it !!

I will say that I probably would already be to 3 mil by now if I hadn't spent 450k on an origami pb to use my premium perk for my alien Aisha. I impulsively did that when I only had 550k in the bank even after telling myself that I'd wait til 1 mil. An alien Aisha has been one of my top dreamies ever since I was a kid though so I couldn't resist!!

 I would not recommend this route though. Definitely smarter to follow the ""don't buy 1 of it until you could buy 3 of it"" rule of finance. Of course I understand if the impulse gets the better of you, but it's much easier to make more money when you have more money.

Also: the only other things I have bought were some inexpensive petpets for my pets (petpets were bt 1k-20k) battledome gear for my BD pet and Dubloons/codestones for training. Every other NP has gone into the bank, stonks, restocking, food club or the occasional wheel of excitement spin.


I hope this helps someone who is new or just getting make into the game rack up some NP!! 😊",2021-07-15 14:59:48

Kings-Of-Spades,"I've used a few, audited a few when I worked in PA. I used to audit a few insurance companies and mutuals. Most of them used Guidewire for adjudication of claims (not sure if you have any adjudication or just franchising), and had a separate system for their accounting. Data would feed from guidewire into their system on a regular basis.

Used myself:

\- Syspro. Ease of use: steeper learning curve. Like: geared towards manufacturing business and comes with plenty of add-on packages. Dislike: Bad account management, steep learning curve, easy to bastardize and spend a bunch of money on to fix.

\- QBO. Ease of use: takes one brain cell to operate. Like: Cloud based, easy/user friendly, good support team. Dislike: Rigid in what it cannot offer you, missing features to help automate, no access to back-end data

Limited experience:

\- Banner. Ease of use: Pretty decent, very specialized for post-secondary. Like: modules are very beneficial for the operations side of the business (student acct mgmt). Dislike: Banner Finance has very limited options and its challenging to navigate.

\- Lone Wolf. Ease of use: Manageable. Specialized for brokerages (real estate, but can draw some parallels).",2021-07-16 01:44:26

Every weekday morning, Mexico’s president holds a rambling televised celebration of his supposed successes: a news conference with special guests, video clips, and slick graphics that often has the air of a variety show. Until mid-January one of the favored features was a giant graphic that showcased Mexico’s undisputed progress as the first Latin American nation to vaccinate its citizens against Covid-19. Then the data turned bad. Pfizer Inc., at the time Mexico’s only supplier of Covid shots, halved, then completely stopped, deliveries. Vaccinations remained unchanged for almost a month; deaths surged. The vaccine tracker got yanked from the show.

Mexican viewers didn’t know it from watching President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s daily discourse, but Mexico was becoming one of the world’s deadliest Covid hot spots. The government’s alternate version of reality included an undercounting of cases and deaths, something it belatedly acknowledged in March when it announced that Covid-related deaths were far higher than the official count, which stood at about 234,000 as of July 5. More expansive estimates can be derived from excess deaths, the epidemiological term for increased mortality compared with an average year. In one such analysis, the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics &amp; Evaluation places Mexico’s Covid deaths at about 540,000.

During his morning broadcast on Jan. 18, López Obrador swerved around an uncomfortable truth: Pfizer had just shunted Mexico to the back of the line for limited supplies while it closed a plant in Belgium for upgrades. He spun a different tale: that he was altruistically acceding to a (nonexistent) request by the United Nations to give up shots so Pfizer could boost production to supply poorer nations “that don’t have the economic possibility to buy vaccines.” AMLO, as the president is known, claimed that he approved the Pfizer cut because “it would be unjust and inhumane and contradictory” not to. “We have to walk together, be supportive,” he said. On his YouTube channel, the news conference was titled “Redistribution of Covid-19 vaccines is an act of solidarity.”

What was actually happening was entirely out of Mexico’s hands. Yes, Pfizer’s retooling of its Belgian factory would eventually lead to greater global supply. But in the short term, the company made decisions about where it would send its vials and where it wouldn’t. It chose to make cuts in Latin America and Europe while sending millions of shots to Israel. The difference was that Israel had just signed a data-sharing deal with Pfizer, which would flood the country with its vaccine to test its real-world effectiveness—good for science and, of course, Pfizer.

The methods of estimating Covid’s true death toll vary, but study after study show Mexico among the world’s hardest-hit countries. For average monthly excess deaths during the pandemic, Mexico is third, behind Ecuador and Peru, according to a Bloomberg analysis of figures collected by Our World in Data. (As of July 6, Mexico has about 54% more deaths on average than over the previous five years; Ecuador is at 67% and Peru at 136%.) In other published tallies, Mexico has ranked third or fourth in the world for total excess deaths. The president’s office and the health ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment about the government’s handling of the pandemic.

Last winter the carnage in Mexico City was palpable. Black smoke billowed around the clock from overwhelmed cemetery crematoriums. Funereal bottlenecks forced families to take the remains of their loved ones to other parts of the country for timely disposal. In hospitals the bodies were backlogged on gurneys and in autopsy rooms. It took until May for Mexico’s hospitalizations to drop to 13% of capacity, from 90% in January, and the positivity rate, once the world’s highest at roughly 50%, to fall to 17%.

“Many patients didn’t have a chance to even make it to a hospital or wound up in a hospital that wasn’t prepared,” says Francisco Moreno, head of internal medicine at Centro Médico ABC, one of Mexico’s most prestigious private medical institutions. “What I saw was a total collapse of the health system.”

And yet, to the world and even some Mexicans, it’s almost as if it never happened. If you didn’t know that an extraordinary number of people had perished only months ago, it would be easy to see just another sunny summer on the horizon, with bustling boulevards and packed beaches. Some of this collective amnesia is due in part to the actions AMLO never took: While Europe is publicly wrestling with how to reopen to foreign tourism, Mexico never closed air travel from any countries or required any testing or quarantines from visitors. But the forgetting doesn’t mean it didn’t happen—or can’t happen again, soon.Mexico’s first mistake, and probably its biggest, was its coronavirus testing plan. As part of its initial pandemic response in March 2020, AMLO’s government didn’t offer tests unless a patient had symptoms. The method’s power to obscure was the envy of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. “I want to do what Mexico does. They don’t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you’re vomiting,” Trump groused to top aides last summer, the New York Times reported.

Mexico’s strategy, which has never officially changed, both failed to keep the virus’s spread in check and meant the country’s death toll escaped wide notice. When researchers tried to put together more accurate numbers, the government erected barriers. Some researchers had been able to cobble together a rough count of excess deaths in Mexico City based on death certificates, having noticed they were sequentially numbered. The idea was, if you know the latest number on the certificates, you know how many are dead. In March the authorities thwarted that workaround: The certificates were no longer searchable by number, only by name. There are no longer independently available statistics on excess mortality.

Mexico’s second big mistake was AMLO’s refusal to raise debt to pay for fiscal stimulus or aid to the poor, as the leaders of most major economies did. This reflected the economic quirks of the president himself, who’s never possessed a credit card in his name. The son of fabric shop owners from the state of Tabasco, AMLO has shunned luxuries and refused to fly on the presidential Boeing 787 Dreamliner—he’s been trying to sell it from his first day in office. His political philosophy was shaped by the disastrous debt default of 1982, which brought inflation to 115%, and the Tequila Crisis of 1994, which produced a sudden devaluation of the peso and a recession.

His government’s spending commitments for Covid relief amount to about 0.7% of gross domestic product—less than a third of the average for other developing countries in the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund says. And those programs have largely been microloans to small businesses. While other countries essentially paid workers to stay home and supported companies so they could preserve jobs, Mexico’s policies had the effect of keeping people in circulation to earn a living.

Arturo Herrera, AMLO’s outgoing finance minister, argues that the administration saved Mexico from weakened public finances that would have had worse repercussions down the road, leading to cuts in social services. Had Mexico spent like Canada or Germany did on Covid stimulus, he said in a February interview with Bloomberg News, the additional debt would have exceeded all government funding for public universities and high schools. AMLO has also argued that his government inherited a broken hospital system and had to expand its capacity in a short time period to handle the health crisis, which is where it focused much of its attention, rather than on testing.

Throughout the first wave, in the spring and summer of 2020, Hugo López-Gatell, the nation’s virus czar, kept saying Mexico was beating back the outbreak, though it wasn’t. “The epidemic is slowing down,” he declared in a May 5, 2020, news conference. “We’ve flattened the curve.” When confronted with data showing the curve was in fact continuing to go up, he said what he really meant was the slope would have been steeper if it weren’t for the social distancing policies he’d implemented. When a second wave of infections hit Mexico City toward the end of 2020, he and the mayor resisted ordering a shutdown, even as the city’s hospitals overflowed with patients. In January the government denied that the capital’s hospitals were full. Yet Bloomberg News found that paramedics had to drive their ambulances around through the night to find scarce unoccupied beds.

The midnight searches for beds were among the worst tales the city’s doctors, nurses, and paramedics described during the height of the second wave. One patient waited 11 hours in an ambulance, running through several oxygen tanks, until a bed was available. A medic drove a patient six hours to Aguascalientes state, northwest of Mexico City, to find a bed. A hospital ran out of the medication it used to sedate patients being fitted with ventilators.",2021-07-16 02:14:20

MaskUser_Aoi,"Great question, and I'm happy to chime in on this one as well.

Its value proposition is improving, but I'll start with what it does right now.

**Long-term community is weighted into the voting structure.** Similar to Curve Finance or a few other crypto projects, **the voting strength your $MASK tokens endow you with actually increases over time.** Specifics on this are not announced yet. Some are on the **Town Hall #1 reddit post**. It's sort of a ""Proof of Balance"" or ""Proof of Holding"" via multiple wallet balance Snapshots. We want a balance of large investors, long term community, and core team slowly handing the reigns over to the community for a robust governance structure.

**DAO Governance:** Voting on community proposals; 40% of $MASK supply is allocated to Foundation fund and the DAO community decides what happens to that money. So it's a lot of money to control in the future. Governance isn't unique but the token allocation is.

**Airdrop eligibility:** First airdrop was extremely generous-- 50 $MASK per holder when the token price was $20-$30 each, more for plugin users... up to 250 $MASK for some.

**ITO Participation**

**ITO Partnership Benefits:** O3 is doing an airdrop for participants. Other ITO projects are being encouraged to provide Mask community with yield farming, airdrops, discounts, etc. Depends on the project and their preferences.

**ITO Projects will be required to hold $MASK to launch** on our platform. This is also in the **Town Hall #1**.

Community proposals and core team ideas will bring more value to the token. It launched in February. It's July now. ;)

Two overviews of the token incl. allocations, vesting, MaskDAO.

saturnascend33,"YOu do not suffer IL in stable/stable pairs. Think of it like this. They make money two ways. You want DAI but have USDC. So you trade USDC for DAI and that little .xx% fee goes to the LP providers. Since Curve has the lowest slippage and a large TVL it is a good option (better than UNISWAP for example). 
Second if DAI is trading at 1.02 and someone has USDC which is at 1.00 in the 100k range. For arbitrage sake, they can swap USDC for DAI and instantly make 2% by swapping the DAI on a centralized or different exchange for a different token, all the while paying less than a percent in fees and hopefully when gwei is low. This can be a simple way of making under 2k instantly of course you have to have some serious $$$ to begin with.

If you have say 5k USDC making this small arbitrage play to DAI for 2% is not worth it. You are essentially working in a group to make your little money help someone make more money in return for a fraction of that money.

People over look crv because it is so down down (97% from ath) but the thing is, if you check defi pulse it is practically as big as uniswap in terms of fees and volume, and yearn finance and convex both pretty much depend on curve.

A smart play would be earn as much crv as possible and bring it down to layer 1 to lock it in and earn as much as possible. 

I hate to say it but CRV and SUSHI are probably the two most over looked coins out there.  SNX is a serious play when they can really figure out layer 2.

As for the MATIC token I would instantly convert to ETH, WBTC&lt; USDC or DAI. but the rewards are nice on polygon for the time being.",2021-07-18 12:04:12

I decided to play around on Polygon because of the low gas fees, YF tends to have a rather steep learning curve. I learned some lessons, and want to spread my funds on different platforms. Before losing too much on gas fees I decided it was better to gather some information.

edit: formatting  


The US is a funny country. We have so many financial regulators that we sometimes wind up without proper financial regulation. Cryptocurrencies represent the latest example.

The trade in bitcoin and its brethren has grown too big to be ignored — and yet that is what has happened. No official public data exist on prices, volume or volatility. No single authority regulates crypto exchanges. No one can be certain investors are being properly protected.

Even folks in the libertarian crypto world are wondering when the federal government will step in. Mike Novogratz, a fund manager who has helped lead the charge into the asset class, told CNBC there would be “relief” in the market once rules of the road were set and suggested Congress give the job to Gary Gensler, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.“When Gary finally addresses it, it will be good,” Novogratz said of his fellow Goldman Sachs alumnus. “He would love to regulate all the crypto. He doesn’t have the mandate.”

It all amounts to a particularly American regulatory failure. Waiting for Gensler to get his hands on all the crypto has turned into the Wall Street equivalent of waiting for Godot.

The underlying difficulty is that US financial regulation is fragmented. There are multiple federal banking and market authorities, with overlapping jurisdictions, plus state regulatory systems. As Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, put it in his annual letter to shareholders: “There is no one real authority that can co-ordinate all the moving parts and bridge differences.”

In the long run, this is not entirely a bad thing. Checks and balances are as American as apple pie or junk bonds; having so many regulators serves as protection against any one of them messing up.

But this system has its weaknesses. New products that are neither fish nor fowl in a regulatory sense can fall through the cracks. Crypto is hard to regulate because it is hard to define. While true believers call cryptos currencies, US regulators view them differently. Bitcoin, for instance, has been deemed a commodity. Other cryptos are seen as securities.

This resulting confusion helps explain why neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is directly regulating crypto exchanges such as Coinbase. No one has given them the job — a source of frustration for the regulators.

Congress, in its fashion, is on the case. Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator, wrote to Gensler this month to ask whether the SEC “has the proper authority to close existing gaps in regulation that leave investors and consumers vulnerable to dangers in this highly opaque and volatile market”.

Gensler’s response, due by July 28, will undoubtedly be persuasive. But whether it will prod legislators to act quickly is another matter. If history is any guide, Congress will wait for things to fall apart before deciding how they should have been put together in the first place.

The resulting impasse is exacerbating anxieties that regulators are falling further behind the curve. The crypto craze reminds many Wall Street veterans of the unregulated rise of credit default swaps in years leading to the financial crisis. Like crypto, CDS were hard to characterise, being a form of insurance that was not regulated as such, and were seen by their advocates as being too cool to be overseen by mere bureaucrats.

“It took a crisis to focus our attention on products like CDS,” said Sarah Hammer, managing director of the Stevens Center for Innovation in Finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “In some ways, crypto is more challenging than derivatives because it falls into many different regulatory laps.”

The irony for participants in the crypto markets is that they might be better off if a cop like Gensler was already on the beat. The various parties could get to know each other and reach some sort of an accommodation. It could even be a relief, as Novogratz said.

Now, the best way for regulators to get a handle on the crypto markets may be to come out swinging, using their general enforcement powers to set things straight. The SEC has already brought scores of crypto cases. Dan Berkovitz, CFTC commissioner, recently raised doubts about the legality of any derivatives deals taking place on decentralised finance, or “defi”, programs that use blockchain technology to cut out intermediaries.

It could get very interesting. I find myself reminded of that moment in the film All About Eve when Bette Davis turns to her guests and presents her forecast for the evening to come. “Fasten your seat belts,” she tells them, “it’s going to be a bumpy night.”",2021-07-18 14:42:29

Re: SK GROUP Deal getting finalized — I believe the timeline is sometime in Q3-2021 for a formal Joint Venture to get announced.  The Asian Market has very large scaling growth potential.  Anticipating to see news before the end of Q3-2021.

One major Data Center Operator has publicly stated their intention to build 50 to 100 New Data Centers per year! —&gt; It would be fantastic for PLUG POWER to provide the Stationary Backup Power for them! ... This would equate to a “pedestal” size (largest size customer) for PLUG POWER.  Should be announced by the end of Q3-2021. 

Lots of bullish catalysts ahead —&gt; PLUG POWER is Leading the Charge Worldwide! 🌎

Very, very few companies have the large scaling growth potential of $PLUG.  And, I agree —&gt; It wouldn’t surprise me to start seeing more “double-digit” moves higher like the move up on January 7th when the $PLUG share price closed higher by 35.11%.  

The title of my Original Post here referenced the Gross Margin Expansion.  Investors have been waiting to hear this news for a long time!  NOW we see it happening!  Bullish!  This fundamental strengthening has not gone unnoticed by the investment community.  Note:  This was accomplished via the acquisition of GINER ELX using $PLUG shares as part of the payment.  Therefore, the FUD being pushed out about the shelving of additional shares is unfounded in my honest opinion.  Frankly, I want PLUG POWER to be “aggressive” to capture market share as fast as possible — and using the $PLUG shares wisely is part of the growth strategy —&gt; growth via acquisition.  Again, look at the “booming” Electrolyzer business — which is a result of the GINER ELX acquisition.  

My original investment thesis in 2013:  Invest heavily in $PLUG because it’s an Energy Company with large scaling growth potential in multiple markets spread out across multiple industries worldwide! 🌎 —&gt; I want to see “aggressive” growth.  

I remember CEO Andy Marsh saying back in 2013 on a Conference Call, and I will paraphrase:  “PLUG POWER will only enter into New Markets which have large scaling growth potential.” —&gt; Folks, I like CEO Andy Marsh’s “GO BIG“ mindset — which is why I have not sold 1 share — only added shares!  

At this time, PLUG POWER is financially stronger than it’s been since I first invested in 2013.  

And, the strategic growth initiatives including the Gigafactory &amp; LGH2 Plant Network will vertically integrate PLUG POWER —&gt; morphing this company into one of the Largest Energy Companies in the USA! 🇺🇸 ... The renewable energy cost curve (Cost inputs to generate LGH2 Fuel) is getting lower &amp; lower every year as more renewable energies come online.  Can you all imagine the exponential growth potential when Liquid Green Hydrogen Fuel is LOWER than the cost of diesel? —&gt; Huge Upside in $PLUG 📈

jmellyn,"Untrue. It's easy to get into law school (because there are too many of them) but law school IS hard. I say this as someone who has always been Type A. Gifted classes, best high schools and colleges, graduating with honors, everyone always expecting me to ace everything, assuming academics are ""easy"" for me, etc. 

Is the material extraordinarily hard? Not for most people. I've always said that the material we learn in law school is not difficult for anyone capable of doing reasonably well in undergrad. It is not engineering and it does NOT require engagement with the level of theory you are exposed to in some PhD programs (though you can certainly find that if you seek it out or are at the right school). It's not the material, it's the environment. Law school is hands down the most toxic academic environment I have ever been in. I have been in many challenging environments including other graduate degree programs. 

Compared to the vast majority of graduate/professional degree programs, law school is extremely intense. The amount of reading, learning a new form of writing, intense competition for grades because of the curve (recall that as difficult as it is - more difficult than law school because of how much they have to memorize - med school is usually pass/fail), jockeying for resume boosters and prestige markers like law review and clerkships is out of control (understandably, given how few law jobs there are that justify law school's price tag). Studying for law school finals during 1L was one of the most intense experiences of my life. My non-law school graduate degree exams do not compare. All so you have the pleasure of studying for the bar exam (an absolute nightmare experience).

Yes, there are people who successfully avoid the most toxic and intense parts and still manage to be successful - hats off to them, but I think most people have to make a choice between sanity and the type of success they envisioned when they started law school. I didn't have any visions of the type of success law students are competing for (big law, clerking, etc.) when I started and I still got sucked in. It's really hard not to.

This guy is supposedly a finance person? I took classes in business school. Yeah, economics is tough but overall, studying finance is not that intense and they've watered down those programs over the years. Anyone who thinks law school is especially easy hasn't been around enough other grad/professional programs. These days an undergrad degree is a high school diploma and a graduate degree is what an undergrad degree used to be. Many graduate degree programs are complete cake walks. Law school is not that.",2021-07-21 08:46:30
minimuminfeasibility,"I think I was unclear. For CS, UIUC is clearly better. For econ, Chicago is clearly better. For business at the undergrad level... it's unclear. If you do econ with the business econ focus at Chicago, the real strength is the econ courses -- because the business courses are totally plain. If you are doing CS and econ, I would say it depends on whether you stress the CS or the econ more.

However, if you really wanted to do CS and business (finance/accounting/marketing), you could probably get more out of UIUC because it has more than plain courses at an undergrad level and AP credits could let you reach the topics courses that are actually useful. Is the base of Chicago econ courses better than taking useful advanced topics classes in finance? Maybe not. It's not like you're going to be estimating a Cobb-Douglas production function at an asset manager, but you might be optimizing a fixed income portfolio to hedge curve risks.

Chicago sends more people into finance, but that's largely driven by MBA and graduate students.  Remember: Chicago has more grad students than undergrads.  Also, even incoming investment banking analysts now want to learn to code.",2021-07-21 14:11:06

SquizzOC,"So I'm going to offer some information on this just because I'm literally going through this process with our organization now.  

This is not as easy as ""I have 10 items and we need this"". Typically this is where you take the heads of each dept., get them on the phone with a few vendors of choice and allow them to ask any and all questions. There are things that finance does, you have no clue on, just like there are things the warehouse does, that you have no clue on and a short list like this just won't cut it. You can get a list, but you really need everyone to be engrained in the decision making process.  

It was a massive learning curve when I started the task for us (Outside my sales role, which is about 50% of what I do, I'm the PM and Administrator for our ERP, Salesforce, Lead Generation tools and ecommerce platform.)  

First, there are no cheap routes.  
Second, there are no cheap routes.  
Third, Netsuite and Salesforce are the best solutions I found out there.  



If you want your ERP to be integrated natively with Salesforce, Financial Force is the only way to go. However this isn't a best practice and usually isn't advised from everything I have been told or read, we are most likely going this route, but only because everything we do is built around Salesforce natively.  

Netsuite is our next runner up simply because they were a top tier product that we could either bring someone in internally to really manage/tweak/customize or have our choice of 100 different firms to do the work for us.  

Both of these solutions do the short list of requirements you have, but every basic ERP solution I took a look at did this as well. Odoo looked great at first, but we found that with the cost of customization and needing to check every little box for every little function, it wasn't as cheap as it appeared. Sage was another one that could have worked for us, but with the workflow abilities in Salesforce and us being a Sales organization primarily, FinancialForce is still looking like the clear winner. It's so easy to customize, that even I, a salesperson can do it. (After the heavy lifting is clearly done by the pro's lol).

jtdolla911,"To answer your question, yes. If you lock CRV, you get rewarded in the form of Curve 3 pool tokens. These can then be staked into curve for yield plus a small amount of additional CRV tokens.

All of that requires a few gas fees and your rewards will depend on the size of the investment, as far as whether it's worth the gas or not.

There are other ways to utilize CRV tokens for locking.  You can lock them on Yearn Finance, StakeDao, or Convex Finance.  All offer varying strategies and I would recommend any and all of them. If you have enough to split your investment among them, it would be a great way to diversify exposure to Curve and their partners while mitigating risk and earning additional reward tokens.

If you are bullish on Curve and want to grow your stack, you could also deposit into the lending protocol Aave, which provides an interest rate about 12% currently. This would probably be a good short term play until the rates drop.",2021-07-22 09:57:57
VividAd399,"I'm no experienced pro, myself -- having started late, myself -- but I'd like to offer you my 2 cents...

My 1st attempt at trading was via M1 Finance, and I started in late February...

I lost my a$$ -- but I learned a few things...

But it wasn't until my 2nd attempt --  through a DIFFERENT brokerage -- that the mistakes I had made during my previous experience became more clear to me...

That 2nd brokerage is Webull, and IMHO there is NO COMPARISON...!!

I recommend you look on YouTube and check out some basic reviews and trading tutorials using Webull, simply to see what kind of depth of information it offers as a platform...

So, what did I learn...?

Well, through the data that Webull's charts provided, I learned that I jumped into my 1st trading experience at a very unfavorable point in the market when the VAST majority of stocks were at their peaks (which is why I lost my a$$)...

Anyhow, for what it's worth you're not alone in this... There is definitely a learning curve, at times it seems like everyone is a guru but you, and there are some good weeks and some bad ones...

But the most important thing is that you do your own research and make your own decisions, and being able to CONVENIENTLY have ready access to the DATA made ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD...!! 

I cannot overstate this...!!

So, IMHO you should do yourself a BIG favor and download the Webull App after you read this comment...

Remember: if there's anything in life that you WANT to make happen bad enough, you WILL latch onto it, you WILL learn the things that you need to know to become successful, and you WILL make whatever that thing is happen... 
  There are people much less intelligent than you who are doing whatever that thing is, and with a sincere approach, YOU can damn-sure do it, too (probably even better lol)...!!

Full Respect,

Doing so will give YOU a couple free stocks...... AND it will ALSO give ME SOME FREE STOCKS, TOO...!! 😀

PSS:  Oh yeah.... In case you were curious how I've done with my 2nd trading attempt (after having switched to Webull)....
So far, I've put in ~$2,000.00 since late March, and I'm sitting at ~$3,180.ish...
Also, since this is what I chose to do with MY stimulus money, I've been trading the way I want to: MOSTLY high-volatility penny stocks (other people will strongly disagree with me, but it's MY CHOICE..... and so far it's paid off)...
I study my charts
 (1 week/1 month/3 months, but NOT counting anything before March), I pick a good (relatively low) entry point in a stock that has swung significantly above the current price AT LEAST TWICE in the past 3 months (at least 20% or higher), and I try my DAMNDEST not to sell out too low (with Webull you can even set a ""trailing stop"" sell order with a few cents gap, if you don't have time to watch the price)....

McKoijion,"Low pay? For years, Amazon literally paid double or more compared to other similar jobs. They were one of the first businesses to pay $15 an hour, and even that was a huge step down compared to the performance based stock compensation they paid out previously.

They are demanding, cutthroat, and fire the lowest performing workers with the same efficiency as a corporate law firm or investment bank. But that's the tradeoff. The most productive workers there made significantly more than they would have in any similar job, while the lowest performers were fired. 

This is a big reason why so many former workers are filled with grievances while the current employees vote against unionization. If you could do 60 units of work in 45 min, you could take a 15 min break. If you could only do 60 units of work in 60 minutes, you might try peeing in a bottle to keep up before you were ultimately let go.

Is this harsh? It depends on where you fit in. In most jobs, the best performing workers get paid the same as the lowest performing ones. There is less incentive to be good at your job. At the best paying jobs including medicine, law, finance, sports, acting, etc. the best performers make far more money while the lowest performers are fired. Amazon just applied this model to regular jobs too. And if it's unfair to fire a poor performer, it's even more unfair to retain that poor performer without even giving a chance to someone who might be better at that task. That's the person who most losses when there's corruption, nepotism, bureaucracy, etc. rather than a meritocracy.

PuffPuffFayeFaye,"I want to agree (and have said things like this myself) but the sad truth is that people don’t “learn” most of what they are “taught”.  We put people through thousands of hours of math that they don’t retain, literacy analysis that they don’t apply, science classes that they might enjoy in the moment but ultimately teach trivia rather than actual scientific principles.  People celebrate their ignorance and find comfort in their lack of agency.  Mandatory finance will be as beneficial as mandatory pool classes.  People who *want* to know and be better prepared than their peers will find a way or at least learn from their mistakes.

Not to be pessimistic but there will always be a bell curve and some people will always be in the wrong half of it.  

And, though I am a capitalist sycophant who is about to sound a bit like a socialist, all the financial literacy in the world won’t help the absurd policy-driven inflation in currency, education, and housing that essentially means that good financial literacy is “don’t even play the game”.

ViperThreat,"&gt;Not sure if you are a local business owner, I suspect not.

Your suspicions are partially incorrect. Technically my mother owns the business, but I've been taking more and more of a leadership role after discovering that she was paying nearly 48% in taxes last year. Even my mild understanding of finance and tax law was enough to drop that significantly, and it became clear that while she knew her operations inside and out, she needed somebody to step in with the higher level strategy stuff, which is basically me right now.

Most recently, I implemented a policy that gives all tenured employees a stake in the company on top of their standard wages and benefits. Sure my mother and I may lose money in the long run, but our employees are now fiercly loyal, and take much more pride in their work knowing that they get a piece of the pie when the business does well, and won't be out on their ass if/when we close the doors.  They don't see their job as a 9-5 anymore, and it was a huge stress reliever for many of our employees.  The company next to us just sold out and closed their doors, leaving about 20 employees with no income, and not even so much as a severance check.  Comparatively, our employees know that if such a thing happens in the future, they stand to make 5 or 6 digits on the deal.

&gt; For example, local construction and trade jobs have been aggressively hiring more unskilled labor than ever before due to shortages in skilled labor. These jobs pay more, and obviously reduces the number of folks available to do unskilled jobs in the food service industry like dishwashers, servers, and busing. 

I strongly disagree with this. I have many friends who work in the construction industry, including those who own their own businesses with numerous employees. They aren't replacing skilled laborers with unskilled laborers (legit, they can't - they have laws and standards that require professionals - they can't for example hire some highschool kid off the street to wire or plumb a 6 bedroom home), and their margins aren't much better than my own. Beyond that, the idea that any sort of labor is ""unskilled"" is a bit of a myth.  Working on a construction site requires quite a bit of knowledge on OSHA safety, not to mention an understanding of tools, materials, and basic construction practices. The same can be said for most all other careers, including the food services industry. There's always a learning curve, and what they learn is skill.

&gt;  I've had some back and forth with folks on here that say its a myth that prices go up if labor increases. That might be true for huge corporate franchised organizations, but it is far from true for your average local small business owner. 

Again, it's about the margin you're operating on. I don't disagree with you at all here, but the point is that most small businesses can't afford full time accountants who can nickel &amp; dime every single aspect of their tax policy, nor can they afford the time or money to invest in local politics. Larger companies simply have more padding to work with, and more resources at hand. Simply helping my mother out for 10-15 hours each week was enough to cut her costs significantly, not to mention a huge tax break that she never knew she could get - she was so busy handling things that she never had the time to research or educate herself on the topic.

&gt;  The last thing you deserve is someone going on Yelp and demonize you for not agreeing with some political talking point that is dramatized by the media or weaponized by a political party.

""Deserve"" is relative. Putting in effort doesn't entitle you to be free of criticisms. Not all of those criticisms are valid, but at the end of the day when you are running a business, you better have the expectation that you will not please everybody, and hopefully have the wisdom in how to keep your head down and avoid becoming a target for public ridicule.  Posting a sign implying that everybody is lazy and living on government handouts isn't a great PR move, especially in an economy where the pay gaps are expanding beyond sustainability. Blaming people for a systemic issue is a sure-fire way of making yourself a public enemy.

&gt; Be kind and tolerant and accept that its OK to disagree as were all grown ups.

This is also a misnomer.  There are certainly topics that it's fair to have disagreements over, but when people's livlihoods are at stake, it's not as simple as that. For example, we shouldn't be kind or tolerant to racists or pedophiles, and in the eyes of most people who are facing a catastrophic economy, saying that we should be ""tolerant and kind"" about opinions is a slap in the face to people who can't afford a place to live. 

The problem here isn't lazy workers or sheisty employers who don't want to pay a fair wage (although this can often be a contributing factor). The real problem is an economy that is rigged against small businesses and low/middle income populations, and a political system that makes these 2 groups think that eachother is the problem.",2021-07-24 07:35:13
nottheotherone4,"The learning curve is higher in commission sales. Meaning you might struggle to make the equivalent of the $40k annual salary early on. On the other hand once you develop a rhythm you have the opportunity to make much more, where the salaried position will pay the same static amount. 

In the kitchen manager position the opportunity is to learn and make he job easier to manage and perform well enough to assume more roles for additional money or to leverage your skills and apply for bigger positions at bigger restaurants. In the commission sales position it is a similar path. You could go into management, finance, service…or move to a higher volume dealership. 

Both careers have long abusive hours so you aren’t winning one way or another. You will meet more people in different careers in the sales position. I know many scar salespeople who struck up conversations with customers that later led to job opportunities in other fields, no so much with a kitchen manager. 

Both jobs are hard and failure can lead to instant termination…so not a lot of job security either way if you are not a performer. I would focus on the work environment for each and see what you think fits you the best.",2021-07-24 08:15:21

asymmetricloss,"No, you´re highly likely not. Hanging around r/AskStatistics and asking reasonable questions about stuff you´re not sure about would likely suggest you´re at the higher end of the bell curve. I guess it´s not technically wrong to call it ensemble modelling. However, that type of term tends to be used as an umbrella term for aggregating predictions in machine learning. Forecast combinations have been a very researched area during the last 50 years and the main contributors are probably econometricians and statisticians with an interest in economics/finance. There are a lot of these researchers that have been frustrated with how ""people"" re-label forecast combinations as ensemble modelling and ignoring previous research on the topic and acting like they found something new. So it´s not entirely wrong to say ensemble modelling. However, it´s probably more accurate to acknowledge the problem as forecast combinations. However, in the end, these are just words so who gives a shit lol. :)

Also, I think you have misunderstood Bates-Granger weighting. It goes as follows: 1. You compute the mean squared forecast error (MSFE) (either in-sample or out-sample). 2. You take the reciprocal of the MSFE. 3. You divide the reciprocal of each MSFE  with the sum of the MSFEs such that you have weights that are between 0 and 1, and sum to unity. Thus, you give forecasts with higher error (as measured by MSFE) lower weight. This usually works well for several reasons, it is somewhat robust in finite samples and tends to hit the sweet spot when it comes to the bias-variance trade-off.

Yeah sure, there are several other ways. However, simple ways often perform better than more complicated ways due to difficulties in estimating the statistical properties of forecast errors. You should check out ""Handbok of economic forecasting Vol1"" of Timmermann and Graham.  It has a really good chapter on it.",2021-07-24 19:26:45

TechboyUK,"I haven't written an article on DeFi yet, but basically:

DeFi = Decentralised Finance. It's where you and others have control in a collaborative way, without a centralised body being in control.

Some pros:

* It's more secure (as you have full control of your assets i.e. the private keys to your wallet)
* Far less chance of manipulation, theft, etc.

Some cons:

* It's a bit more complicated to use
* Some changes take longer to be implemented because they need a majority vote

I maximise my CRO by:

I auto-buy CRO every month.

Since it is the ""producer,"" Algorand has the prerogative of increasing supply to make up for demand when demand increases, at least until the supply is exhausted.  But make no mistake, increasing supply to make up for demand changes the supply curve just as accumulating and holding by individuals and institutions does.

Algorand's mission should be to keep the price as low as possible, as long as possible, while at the same time, allowing for increases so investors get a reasonable return for their investment and do not themselves liquidate their positions.

uglahsD,"Other ""real estate investors"" will insist you keep it, however there is a very sharp learning curve for RE investment that most don't ever realize. 

I could go into a very long list of potential pitfalls, headaches, and disasters of becoming a landlord, but the real concern is, are you financially stable enough to never have to worry about making full monthly payments on both properties? This is on top of other necessary expenses (healthcare, food, bills, insurance, dependant care, etc etc etc).

Not asking you to tell me how rich you think you are; just suggesting food for thought. Not only should you be able to comfortably pay the mortgage, taxes, and insurance on both places even if you were to lose your job(s), you should also have a total of at least 6 months of all of your combined expenses in savings, AND have a very substantial emergency fund in place. 

I've known too many ""investors"" who live paycheck to paycheck, praying nothing goes wrong while they slowly whittle down their mortgages. I've seen many with 6-figure tax liens on their properties.

Stupidstar,"&gt; Wasn't Occupy also saying things like ""don't report crimes, including sexual assault, to the police""? Sounds a lot like BLM.

Brought in by the proto-Wokesters if I recall, but yeah, there was ironically an epidemic of sexual assault that they tried to solve in ways other than going to the police, like a women's-only tent. Also runaway theft.

&gt; And the whole concept of ""rich people bad"" sounds pretty Woke to begin with.

Definitely when it's people railing at the rich for being rich, but I think it had more to do with corporate influence on politics, and how the One Percent had orders of magnitude more wealth than even the top 10% of society.

The ""corporate influence on politics"" is particularly relevant since Occupy happened in the wake of the Great Recession and people had watched the government bail out the big banks. Occupy happened in 2011, and in 2010 the Supreme Court had struck down sections of the bipartisan McCain-Feingold Act that reformed campaign finance, particularly in regards to what corporations are allowed to do. I recall that people on both sides of the aisle were upset about that ruling and worried it would allow companies to essentially put politicians in their pocket.

Regarding the wealth inequality bit, I remember there was an infographic video demonstrating the difference between what people *thought* the wealth distribution looked like in America compared to what it actually was. People thought there was a much more gradual incline between the rich and the poor, and that allowed for upward mobility. The curve is actually much steeper than that.",2021-07-29 13:33:57

Highly competitive, people are extremely likely to backstab you for their own gain, embodying the old ""Greedy is good"" philosophy to the max. 

Extremely Stressful, partially because of the above, partially because training is hilariously bad for new joiners, the learning curve is more like a learning cliff.

Permanent Teamwork, imagine a job where you spend 90% of your waking hours with the same group of people, in an open office (Bullpen is the stupidest thing, my goddamn manager with 17 years experience in the industry sits next to me.)  to foster collaboration. Now imagine that I hate everyone.

Not even mentioning the commute because it's horrendous if  you don't live in an expensive apartment near your workplace, thereby negating one of the biggest advantages to the job (paychecks)",2021-07-29 18:21:27
jcanotorr,"When you deposit on AAVE you recieve aTokens with equivalent value to your deposit. While this aTokens remain in your wallet, you'll continually earn interest. If you deposit this aTokens in Curve, you'd stop earning interest on AAVE and start earning interest on Curve. Not only that, but since you no longer have those aTokens in your wallet, they will no longer be available as collateral in case you wanted to try and borrow.

You could also deposit your funds, if supported, directly to Curve. Just like in the other casem the funds won't be available as collateral since you won't have the aTokens.

Keep in mind that Curve does include the pool's APR to calculate their own, but I don't know the specifics of this. So in theory Curve would allow for a greater APY overall.

I personally use auto compounders (like Beefy Finance) so I don't have to check everyday to increase my yield.",2021-07-29 23:14:39
yakimawashington,"If you're not planning on grad school, I'd 100% recommend engineering for job outlook and income. Which engineering you choose is 100% up to you, but since you already have the gen chem and o chem out of the way, chemical might be the most efficient route to go. You'll still probably need 3 years anyways since most engineering programs are at *least* three years long from the time you take your first engineering course, but the first of those three years will likely just be a class or two, so you'll have some free time for the first year. If I were in your shoes, I'd consider the following options for that free time while you're doing your first year of only a couple chem e courses:

1) Also start taking the first year of courses of one other engineering discipline. Since you already have physics, math, chem etc out of the way, this should also only be a couple of courses at a time. Going this route will allow you to try chemical and another type of engineering so that you can decide for sure whether you prefer chemical engineering vs another engineering. Chemical might seem like the obvious choice, but most people who switch from chem to chem e will tell you they are very different. If you decide to keep chem e, you will likely have come close to finishing a minor in a different engineering discipline as well, which will be something to add to your resume.

2) Do undergraduate research or a co-op/internship (part time if necessary). You have a great GPA and 2 years of biochem, so you shouldn't have too hard of a time landing one of these opportunities. Prioritize looking for engineering experience.

3) Commit to a minor. If you choose this route, I'd personally recommend computer science or finance. Be ready to work if you choose computer science because there is a steep learning curve if it's your first exposure to programming, but it will open a lot of opportunities when it comes to applying for work/internships down the road, and may even help in your future chem e courses if they require programming (it helped me significantly). Finance is good because a lot of engineering in the private sector is money-driven, and being well-versed in finance can make you an asset to a company you may want to move up in. You'll also help yourself by being finance-savvy (I wish I did this, personally).

That's my advice from someone who did something similar to you. My GPA wasn't nearly as great as yours, but I still managed to land two engineering summer internships before graduating, so you should be in a great spot. What I had going for me was extensive work history (completely unrelated to engineering, but it showed I am capable of being a reliable employee), computer science minor (including C++, algorithm design/analysis, and data structures coursework on my resume looked good), and I'm fairly personable as well. You have a great GPA, so that should help you get your foot in the door, but I've found most companies looking for engineering interns don't care as much about GPA as I thought they would. They mostly care about a good resume, good skills, good work ethic, and good personality. My first internship never even looked at my transcript. My second one had me send it to HR *after* I received my offer letter just to prove I'm studying chemical engineering. They know most engineers who are accepted into their major are already well-enough educated. They find the other things I listed above to be better indicators of how good an engineer you'll be. I actually just finished my second interview for a Tesla internship this week (first was with HR, second was with an engineer). They still haven't seen my transcript and have yet to ask about my grades since they already saw my experience. About to follow up with them tomorrow for an update.

But don't do what a lot of engineering students mistakenly do and go ""why aren't I getting any internships?? I applied to Google, Tesla, Amazon, Space X, Boeing, and not one of them called me back! Is Elon busy or something??"" Sure, go ahead and apply to those, but also apply to other more niche or ""less sexy"" ones too such as mining, waste (nuclear, water etc.), and other local/state ones. Focus on getting *any* first internship on your resume, then your next one will be a lot easier to get. My first engineering internships were ones my classmates never even considered applying for, and now they managed to get me at least considered by Tesla (fingers crossed I get the spot lol)  Either way, FOLLOW UP REGULARLY with any one you apply to until you get a solid yes or no answer.


Anyways, there's a wall of info for you lol. I know it's a bit more than you asked for, but I felt obligated to give you my 2 cents since your situation is nearly identical to what mine was when I made the switch (biochem major, realized I need a masters/PhD just to have a job outlook and salary close to engineering, switched just before reaching upper level courses).",2021-07-30 03:10:16
theasianinvestor95,"Made a switch from Audit to Deal Advisory M&amp;A Valuation at one of the Big 4.

\&gt; Interview process was a 3 step process. First interview was a case study handed to me (involves financial analysis and valuation of a company). No financial modelling needed.

\&gt; Hours varies depends on the projects coming in. Post pandemic, transaction market has been so HOT that we're squeezed. Been working 5-7 days for the past few months. But that being said, we do have periods where the volume of projects coming in are not as high and we'll only have a valuation job on hand. I would call that ""off peak"" in audit. 

\&gt; The type of work is definitely more interesting than audit. In audit, you are usually so focused on finishing documentation fast and rushing for insane timelines. Not that the timelines in valuations are great but the learning curve here and what you get out of an engagement is definitely much better. You have to connect the dots between what's happening within the industry of the target, the economy and also the financials of your target company. 

\&gt; Alot of other tools used apart from Excel. Alot of powerpoint, Power BI, VBA and Tableau used. 

\&gt; Encouraged to take CFA which will take a lot of your time off the weekends. 

\&gt; Pay is slightly better. Abt 1-2k higher than audit a month but still shit when compared to the market. 

\&gt; Exit Opps : We usually go into VC,PE firms, Corporate Finance, FP&amp;A or Corporate Strategy roles.",2021-07-30 08:52:44
vansterdam_city,"I personally just look at Yahoo Finance statistics and Macrotrends historical data for quick and dirty. You can glean a lot of info if you've got experience comparing companies this way.

I and did a bunch of DCF in the past, but the thing about DCF with equities is the uncertainty in your model growth rates is very high. Small changes in expectations can wildly change the price target. It provides a false sense of security due to **precision** but lacks **accuracy**.

That's why I like Damodaran's statistical DCF that uses monte-carlo (I think) to simulate the range of 1000s of outcomes and provide a bell curve distribution of prices. But fking shit ton of work and still vulnerable to bad assumptions in the model.

But anyways, I didn't actually have any luck outperforming the index with DCF. The picks I've outperformed with are based on other factors, mainly behavioral finance (exploiting human greed and fear to find value (oversold) or momentum opportunties).",2021-07-30 11:57:30
okmeow007,"Thanks for the detailed information. Much appreciated!!!

I checked out the beefy finance and my coins showed up and was able to deposit them straight into the Curve finance tri pool, which I found interesting and wasn't sure what it meant. It's Earning more than on curve by 10% so will wait till I can claim rewards then move them over.",2021-07-30 12:06:38

Comfortable_Style_78,"The reality is that most jobs straight out of uni feel a lot like this - I went straight into a finance job out of a STEM degree and I didn’t feel like I had a clue what was going on. Very steep learning curve and it felt like if I messed up etc it’s the end of the world.

From here, you’ll slowly become a lot more confident which will help and also you’ll just become used to the fear of something going wrong and you likely would not spend the rest of your career feeling as you do now. 

If you enjoy the work you’re doing that’s a lot better than most people. I wouldn’t consider making an entire career decision based upon 2 weeks of work - 4 months will pass quickly. I can also assure you that the glow of a prestigious degree wears off quite quickly.",2021-07-30 15:12:27
