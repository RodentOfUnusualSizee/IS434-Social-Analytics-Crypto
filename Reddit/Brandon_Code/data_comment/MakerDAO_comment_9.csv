Giel-GoodGhosting,"If the community wants this, we can definitely launch such a pool yes. So far we haven't received much requests for it. We initially started with DAI because back in June this gave the best interest rates and we do like the (mostly) decentralized approach of MakerDAO.

At this moment, we can do stablecoin pools with: USDT, USDC, DAI.  
And we can do volatile pools with MATIC, WETH, WBTC and AAVE.  
Hopefully in the near future also a pool using GHST ;)",2021-09-01 21:16:45
pewpewtehpew,"If ANY of you are even considering taking  profits I would consider using something like MakerDAO instead.  It allows you to basically ""take profits"" but not actually sell and miss out on any gains in the future, AND, it's not a taxable event. :)",2021-09-01 22:08:21
upscaleHipster,"Most MKR was bought with ETH (or, indirectly, DAI from ETH locked in CDPs). Those are the pairs with the most liquidy across exchanges. To see 1 MKR dropping under 1 ETH represents a huge failure for MakerDAO. There were plenty of times when this ratio was 5x in Maker‚Äôs favor. Every MKR holder lost those potential gains by exchanging their ETH.",2021-09-01 22:31:07
LudicrousOracle,"MakerDAO has failed hugely. While ETH continues to deliver new improvements and upgrades MakerDAO has little to show for being one of the oldest defi projects. Not only that, but they constantly keep diverting fees away from MKR holders and paying themselves exorbitant amounts of money (30mm+$). They keep doing everything they can to delay or reduce the burn function and constantly look to take funds from the surplus buffer. The surplus buffer was meant to bail out bad risk, but instead it's being used to pay whoever they want. The corruption in the system is evident. You would be wise to sell your MKR for ETH if you haven't already. Keep in mind that MKR has 1/100 of the supply of ethereum, it should be 100x the price but its not due to the failures of MakerDAO to deliver value.",2021-09-02 00:55:08
LeagueGreedy,"Or Nexo!
Also consider converting it to RenBTC and taking a loan out through MakerDao",2021-09-02 02:02:53
4rch3r,"&gt; Not only that, but they constantly keep diverting fees away from MKR holders and paying themselves exorbitant amounts of money (30mm+$).

Whaaaa??  You do realize MakerDAO is a weighted democracy in that the holders are voting for what will help MKR the most in the long run.  There's no one entity that is ""paying itself"" money.

&gt; They keep doing everything they can to delay or reduce the burn 

I think the current thinking is that it's a bull market (read potentially overbought) so we should collect as much DAI as possible now so that we can burn tokens when they're cheaper.  In the long run this should hopefully burn up MORE MKR at the cost of not burning now.  If you don't agree I highly recommend participating in https://forum.makerdao.com

&gt; MKR has 1/100 of the supply of ethereum, it should be 100x the price

Why should MKR have the same market cap as ETH?  It's just a piece of the ETH ecosystem in terms of value so it definitely makes sense to be less in terms of total market cap.  That's almost like saying Pixar should be worth the same as Disney in terms of market cap (which is impossible because pixar is just a subsidiary of Disney).",2021-09-02 08:18:29
roadydick,Maybe you can get a MakerDAO loan,2021-09-02 14:21:55
lomosaur,"There are some CeFi and DeFi collateralized loan options out there, might be worth checking out borrowing on things like Celsius, BlockFi, Nexo, MakerDAO, Aave..",2021-09-02 14:42:58
MoneyPowerNexis,"&gt; In the absence of legal tender law I have no issue with a system like that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What do you mean by that? Don't we have those laws?

MakerDAO would be a pretty close approximation of a currency system that lends currency into existence. It is not benefitting from legal tender law, you are not able to force any one to accept it for the payment of all debts public or private and it has no special status as a currency for paying taxes with. It is just a private currency with its own rules that you can either use or not use and because no one is coerced to use it none is forced to take a loss if it fails or suffer a loss of value if it inflates. But I have that opinion more generally: if any corporation or individual wants to make a currency of any kind so long as they are also not benefitting from special government treatment and not committing fraud. Even if the currency is a bad product if it is marketed honestly I have no issue with its existence although I might tell people it is a bad investment.

In addition to that I think there should be no legal tender law.  I probably wont get my way on that one in my lifetime so I am stuck talking about hypotheticals or periods in history before central banking like under the gold standard where free banking was a thing in most western countries. 

&gt;Can you give one example of this round about exploitation, so I know better what you mean?

One big issue is the transfer of wealth to people who get access to new money before other people. They get to spend the money before the value of the money is bid down. [Seigniorage can be used as a tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage#Seigniorage_as_a_tax). Another issue is the information asymmetry between central and member banks and everyone else. These institutions know ahead of time if interest rates will be high or low to an extent because they set interest rates to an extent. That information puts them at an incredible advantage in the markets, by them I mean insiders. Also being able to decide where in an economy credit is extended is open to abuse. Not only can banks pick and choose sectors of the economy to inflate, the central bank has no way of being punished for creating bubbles whether that is through incompetence or insider greed. 


 &gt;Kind of dystopian to me. Wouldn't people fear to experiment?

Its not a binary switch. If wealth was less concentrated towards the creators of money then experimentation would just shift outward in my opinion and while I do think it would be less wasteful and more targeted I dont think gambling would stop. If anything more asymmetric bets could happen since more people would have the resources to make diverse investments (and again just because that might happen more doesn't mean people cant still pool resources) The important thing to me is that wealth is not coercively concentrated in the first place after that people can make their own decisions on what to invest in as they do now but more so.",2021-09-02 16:49:13
helloeddy83,You don‚Äôt like the idea of using MakerDAO to get DAI?,2021-09-02 17:05:01
dynamyt3,"most people would stake over leveraging. i personally 3x leveraged long my entire stack of eth 30 from 3150. now i have 39 ish eth. I plan to 3x long my whole stack around the time of the merge, because there will be a further shock in eth supply because of the reduced issuance. i wouldn‚Äôt use more than 2x leverage if you‚Äôve never used it before, since you have to be better with your entry/and exit points the more leverage you use.

ArcadesOfAntiquity,I'm fine calling MakerDAO one of the originals. I think I remember reading it was based on some other system from another chain though. Anyway. MakerDAO is pretty much as original defi as it gets on the Ethereum chain.,2021-09-04 16:04:55

CrazybutSolid,"I thought of a strategy to materialize gains without paying taxes in the US and keep the exposure. Please help me find the flaws in my plan:

1) Deposit 10 ETH in [OAsis.app](https://OAsis.app)

2) Borrow at today's rate 10k DAI

3) Exchange 10k DAI for 10k USD

4) Profit.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gather (https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/) I should not pay taxes at all since technically I have not made any gains

I never intend to pay the loan. Three scenarios:

* ETH goes up: I take out more DAI and repeat steps above. Still not taxable right?
* ETH goes down: MakerDao liquidates part of my ETH to pay back my debt, I should pay taxes, but normally I won't since ETH's value is lower than when I bought it
* My debt catches up with the minimum collateral %: MakerDAO liquidates. If ETH went down, no taxes. If ETH went up, I do have to pay taxes, but ETH had gone up so I can probably afford it without sweating it

What am I missing?

The only ""catastrophe"" is if crypto goes down 80% like it does every X years. I would lose a lot of my crypto, but I have materialized gains in my bank account/somewhere else and there I can reinvest again if I think it will come back up.",2021-09-04 22:31:53

0xM4K1,"It depends where you live (everywhere has different regulations) ... I've been bouncing the idea around of opening a collateralized debt position with MakerDAO.  Essentially if you wanted to cash out 5,000 you could open up a CDP with say: 15,000 worth of collateral. Then you mint 5,000 DAI, sell it for fiat and now you have $5000ish.  If the price goes up you can rebuy it at that price, if it goes down and is below the over collateralization ratio it would get liquidated and you would have to pay a fee (13% I think).

I'm in a similar boat as you, held through the 2017/2018 crash, the only reason I am considering this is because since I found smart contracts in 2017 I've been a big fan of the technology and I still am!",2021-09-05 23:55:03

I was extremely worried that something would go wrong, but when the tx got confirmed, and I could see the sweet ETH in my address on Etherscan, a sense of inner peace came over me. And I've lived in peace ever since. Definitely never doing that again!

BuyETHorDAI,"I think people vastly underestimate how quickly development happens. All of these things you're talking about didn't even exist in 2017. There wasn't a Uniswap, there wasn't MakerDAO, there wasn't Aave, etc. 

I used to tell people in the early days that the first applications we're going to be low throughput, high value transactions and the first dapps we're going to be defi because it's the ""easiest"" in the sense that Ethereum is fundamentally an economic layer. The other low throughput, high value use case is NFTs. 

I think it was pretty clear (at least to me) back then that Ethereum scaling was a journey, not a race. Today we have so many other applications, and yes, they are almost exclusively for well off people. If you can afford to throw 10k on Ethereum and play around even if you lose it all, then you're what Ethereum is made for today. It's not malicious, or designed this way, it's just the nature of blockchains, and scaling and decentralization.

We have all of these fancy new tools and assets that have never existed before, and everyone wants to use them. Unfortunately, not everyone can right now. It's like the internet. Computers we're expensive, internet was expensive, setting up infrastructure was expensive. Imagine people saying ""Why can't I stream Netflix!?"" in 1992. It's because it takes time. Plenty still needs to happen in terms of everything before we can onboard the entire planet.

To put things in perspective, this is the process for MakerDAO: transfer CDP to DSA, claim INST, transfer CDP to dsproxy (+ optionally swap INST to whichever chosen token).

But for a Compound or Aave position it would involve multiple flash loans and likely multiple token transfers to-and fro. The CDP transfer uses as much gas as one token transfer, basically, so really a lot simpler process.

Karyo_Ten,"&gt; You're trying to ask a non coder to explain in code how you are wrong on a logical level. It's not my fault you are looking in the wrong place. There are plenty of sources, I just linked the first I found that was addressing this issue, I didn't write the clickbait title. Is it your only argument? Claiming mine have no foundation when I'm giving you material to look into?

May I remind you which sub you are on?

&gt; Serious &amp; Technical Discussion of CryptoCurrency/Blockchain Technology

I'm asking on a technical sub to have code, paper or a technical article. What you linked does not address your issue, it's just faith-based.

&gt; Clearly you're having stackoverflow withdrawal symptoms...

And you're still trying to discredit me using personal attacks.

&gt; What was promised is going to be delivered. But huge work on the blockchain development side of code doesn't mean coding on the side of smart contracts will take no efforts. Cardano uses a different architecture that requires for an optimal use of its advantages to master design patterns we haven't clearly identified yet because decentralized networks are a new industry that is merely being born at this time.

That would be fine if you didn't pretend at the same time that solutions exist without giving any direction even to your own dev ecosystem and investors.

&gt; So far most blockchains like Ethereum and centered around defi have taken a stance that fast transactions at low cost fees is the most important but that's very narrow minded around finances and it's a mindset that was designed for a different kind of programming than the one that will unleash the real potential of decentralization. Think back when developers had never heard of OOP yet or multiple core CPUs with multiple threads each.

So what kind of programming is Cardano designed for? Slow transactions and high fees?

&gt; Programs now are designed to run around a client, and sometimes with a server replying to the client or connecting multiple clients. Decentralization in essence is a headless entity that shouldn't be designed around a server architecture or really any central entity, even client side, that's the job of the dapp to provide an UI. The blockchain itself is there to save and communicate data, and smart contracts are there to link specific behaviors/rules between the blockchain and the users/wallets, and in the case of a centrally controlled dapp, them too. But the data on the blockchain itself is immutable and provable so it shouldn't be used as a processing power playground but as a data transcriber. 1tps for each wallet address is perfectly acceptable, just stop saving your temp variables on the blockchain lul. the computing power can be done on the dApp client side and upload everything in one packet. that's much more efficient and leaves the blockchain do what it was intended to do. I'm sorry but the defi space is a virtual pollution dump as far as electricity consumption and useless data transmission that saturates the blockchain just because it can take advantage of it. In the eventuality a project needed absolutely a fast blockchain and couldn't work around that they have alternatives other than Cardano, and Cardano is even capable of incorporating other blockchains and tokens in its smart contracts as a side/para chain. In fact it would be king for that use, a global cross chain DEX fully in the hands of decentralized governance.

All I see is the same narrative shift similar to Bitcoin from digital money to digital gold. If Cardano wants to power multiple parachains it needs to have decent throughput at the base layer.
Contrary to what you are saying, Ethereum is not pursuing extra high TPS at the base layers, the future is rollups, aka what you call packing multiple transactions and publishing the results on layer 1. However for transactions worth millions, it is worth it to have the full security of L1.

&gt; In fact it would be king for that use, a global cross chain DEX fully in the hands of decentralized governance.

What characteristics of Cardano makes it better than Cosmos or Polkadot or Ethereum for that purpose especially given it's smart contract limitations?

&gt; Right now it is mainly something in the reach of the smartest and most serious/determined devs because it is still an unknown world to explore.

So you agree that currently there is no solution published?

&gt; Ethereum and TPS blockchains have a linear architecture that is very inefficient when grasping the real potential of what decentralization means. 

What's the real potential of decentralization according to you?

&gt; Especially when decentralized governance is at the core of its architecture, and it is meant to retain value over time. It's not just a blockchain that is meant to be had fun with, used and abused until the next best chain comes up. This isn't Ethereum. 

Please, I appreciate discussing technical merits, there is no need for social jerking here.

&gt; But I kinda became disinterested in 2015 when defi became an ape zoo.

The only DeFi project in 2015 was MakerDAO and being an ape required you to wrap ETH (WETH) then pool ETH (pETH) then get SAI (the Single collateral version before DAI existed).",2021-09-13 01:23:46

TeutonicTitan,"Sorry but I disagree completely on this being fundamental analysis based on some points mentioned below.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Other factors that may contribute to the potential MATIC price drop are:  
&gt;  
&gt;The release of Ethereum 2.0  
The growth of other layer-1 smart contract platforms like Solana, Avalanche, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;People use layer-2 solutions like Polygon because it has low fees and is fast.  
Why should they continue using it when Ethereum itself offers equally low fees and fast transactions, and other layer-1 blockchains even does a far better job?  
&gt;  
&gt;Without developing some new and unique selling points (USP), I don‚Äôt see Layer-2 protocols like Polygon surviving the smart contract chains war that‚Äôs coming in 2022 and beyond.

Let me inform you a bit. Ethereum today is miles ahead of it's competitors in terms of innovation. Have a look at EIP 1559, it's one of the best applications of modern day game theory being applied at scale that eliminates the inherent problems of PoS and PoW that happen when the nodes start competing or transaction fees over block rewards when the latter being to decline. You want to look at innovation, it's not coming out of any other shit chain like Solana or Avax or Fantom. Not to mention Ethereum is the most proven robust and decentralized chain today which is only improving. From how I see it, smart contract wars are already over.

Addressing ETH 2.0, I don't know  how misinformed you are, but the affect on gas prices will be negligible. Vitalik envisions users not interacting with L1 all together, so anything that we will interact with will be an L2 rollup, and zero knowledge proofs being the top contender here. Polygon has taken a very pragmatic approach going business first and nurturing this defi ecosystem that exists today.

Please stop looking at polygon through the myopic lens of Polygon PoS chain, the token isn't only this, this chain will be forwarding gasless NFT minting as well as gaming. It's funding over a billion dollars in zk research, the first cross chain governance is being tested in Aave polygon market, cross chain farming on Polydex, and so much more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

USPs you ask? There is a reason we are targeting a niche as a cross-evm scalability aggregator:

* Avail - Data availability solutions for EVMs that plan on being L2s.
* Cross EVM SDK.
* Polygon-Hermez, their very own zkrollup chain.
* Governance - PolygonDAO with major DeFi bluechips.

Polygon won't survive smart contract wars? We are just getting started!! We have the highest rate of adoption in terms of daily active wallets, openSEA NFT users, Ernst and Young just integrated us, D&amp;G had NFT mints, MakerDAO has polygon valuts live,I could go on and on.

Your concerns with 34.5% supply are in no way reflective on the price, AVAX has more to be dumped, ALGO has more to be dumped, LINK has more to be dumped,  ADA has 30% to be released. It's a baseless argument, even when they are considering moving these funds to DAO and actively attracting users through projects and promoting innovation via the remaining tokens.

""Because I‚Äôm looking for coins that will give me a 5x to 10x or more within a year and I don‚Äôt see MATIC doing that (yet).""

SwagtimusPrime,"You can use Polygon or Arbitrum to buy the token there. Problem solved. Polygon already has CEX support meaning you can deposit your funds straight from an exchange and circumvent L1 fees entirely, and Coinbase Huobi and OKEx have already announced the same for Arbitrum.

A token swap on Polygon is fractions of a cent, on Arbitrum around $1.50 - $2.

Why is it more expensive on Arbitrum? Several reasons. It's a beta release with many more optimizations down the road that will cut down fees, the capacity is throttled to make sure everything works alright - in the future, as this limit is lifted, the more people that use Arbitrum the cheaper the fees will become because fees are split among all users transacting there.

Rollups in particular are still in early stages, but we finally have two EVM-compatible general purpose rollups with Arbitrum and Optimism. Ethereum-aligned dapps (most of them) will deploy there and CEXs will support them so you can avoid L1 fees completely.

zk rollups will be even more efficient, and data sharding will scale rollups to 100,000 tps at a minimum - all without sacrificing decentralization.

Ethereum has changed its roadmap from execution sharding to data sharding, and that means a focus on rollups, because they are much easier to pull off than execution sharding while at the same time being much more scalable and secure.

You can certainly criticize this because it's still early, but the potential is undeniable with $2.3B TVL in Arbitrum right now and big dapps like Curve, Balancer, Uniswap v3, Chainlink, MakerDAO, and more already live and usable.

But to say the gas fees aren't fixed is dishonest - they are fixed, you just need to use rollups. Ethereum L1 will long-term only serve as the ultra-secure and decentralized settlement layer to settle rollup proofs. Rollups is where all the activity is going to be.",2021-09-16 03:35:04

nikola_j,"&gt;But it's nice for Maker/Oasis to offer this functionality ""natively"".

I'm glad you put ""natively"" into quotes, since it's really the same thing in either case. These are both apps that allow people to use the exact same MakerDAO protocol, with additional features built on top of it. Both apps have custom code on top of the Maker protocol to handle these multi-step actions, etc etc.

But I understand where that ""native"" idea comes from for Oasis. It's been the default Maker app for years, though it's now a completely separate team with the Foundation dissolved, albeit still paid by the DAO afaik.

Kinda wish Maker did something like Liquity and highlighted all available Maker management apps (Oasis, DFS, Zerion, Furucombo, Instadapp...) more equally, rather than sticking to this one default app approach.

MerkleChainsaw,"Some very simple points that might be worth bringing up:

1. Virtually everyone in the Ethereum and MakerDAO community agrees that fees are currently too high for small users. Solutions are coming, but developers want to ensure they are as democratized and secure as possible without giving power to any single entity or taking shortcuts. This takes time, and other projects lowering fees through quicker fixes like delegating transactions will be worse for small users in the long run. There's no quick fix to lower fees without hurting users in the long run.
2. Effective regulation could focus on the on and off ramps between cryptocurrencies and USD and consumer education. Fees themselves are market based, so trying to regulate fees is equivalent to regulating the price of a stock. More important is making sure that consumers are educated to the risks they undergo when engaging in markets - and centralized exchanges are in a position to provide those disclosures and education.
3. I think it's important to discuss the relationship between DeFi and TradFi. This new tech can supplement and expand traditional financial markets and present opportunities like increased transparency, more than it presents a threat to Wall Street.
4. Within a few months Ethereum's energy usage should drop over 99%, so transferring value via DAI or other tokens is extremely environmentally friendly compared to transferring BTC.

Good luck!",2021-09-18 00:03:15
BankXio,"I can't make forward statements.  However, let's think through it.  You mint the stablecoin with ETH and the BankX token with pays interest.  You would then have the stablecoin to buy more collateral to mint more stable earning more interest.  Our system is partially collateralized and partially algorithmic where you are NOT liquidated like MakerDAO.  More times you go through the 'buy collateral, mint stable', the interest rate increases.  Regular webinars/AMA's where we go through it. ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dyor)",2021-09-18 01:11:04

DamonAndTheSea,"Regulatory pressure in the US is mounting right now and I expect this to continue.  This will not, in my opinion, lead to some type of 'bank run' on existing CeFi exchanges in the US but rather move along in some piecemeal fashion. 

The US is now paying attention to crypto in a way that we didn't see in prior cycles and this is being forced by total market cap and growing interest in the space.  

Any heavy handed moves on the part of the SEC will be destructive and drive innovation out of the US which would be a net negative.   This whole process is likely to be bumpy and slow as crypto and traditional finance meet one another. 

The risk with CeFi is simply solvency of the custodian and then solvency of the assets staked for yield.   I don't think the larger players like BlockFi, Gemini and Celsius get rug pulled with legislation, but it's certainly possible that new legislation changes how derivative stable token assets are treated in the US. 

As others have pointed out, this stuff is global .. and so projects like Nexo in Switzerland are not compelled along US laws.  A step further would be decentralized yield ala MakerDAO and DAI which move further outside of controls around a central custodian. 

DeFi isn't going away .. but the US government will impose boundaries around this as it grows. This is not a bad thing.  Clarity around rules will allow more capital to flow into the system as it removes risks around ambiguity.",2021-09-18 10:50:55

Separate-Habit5838,"I can see why you'd think that. Frankly, I don't think Reddit comments have the ability to swing the multi-million dollar BUNNY market; there's just not enough people reading. 

I'm expressing my frustration with the immature behavior in crypto in general. I believe in crypto as a long term force of change in the financial industry, but people criticize me, saying it's a huge bubble, and everyone is just looking for a greater fool. 

It's annoying, because there's truth to their words. Every single person in the red on BUNNY is looking for it to spike so they can get their money back. It has nothing to do with the long term (I'm talking years here) value of the project. 

It's a great example of a project that had an enormous amount of irrational investment in it, and I've come back to gloat. Call it a character flaw. 

I bought BUNNY when I knew it was hype fueled. I knew about their sketchy behavior with the time locks and deleting the telegram, so I knew it wasn't a long term investment for me. I intended to capitalize on the hype, and sell to a greater fool. 

When they allowed a SECOND flash loan attack (seriously? They didn't get on a 24/7 code binge to flash-proof their stuff? When millions are at stake?), I knew the hype was over. Somehow, the BUNNY price hadn't been badly affected yet, and I sold. I made money. 

The people sitting with bags badly in the red now are the people we sold to. Hopefully, these people learn. 

Yes, there are many people with red bags hoping for it to pump, but ask yourself this: how many people that don't own BUNNY are looking at this project and thinking: ""wow, what a safe, well-audited project that is severely under-valued! They have brought something innovative to the space that has gone un-noticed! I'm going to make a large purchase for the first time!"". 

No one. No one is thinking that. You know how I know? Because the price is still falling. I hope that the uneducated ""gambling"" forces in crypto start to learn that there's no such thing as free money. ""High APY"" is not a reason to invest in something. They are literally producing a synthetic asset that people are buying on hype with the hope that it will be the ""next big thing"". There are tons of new devs in the space, because they know EVERY new token will have a huge spike when it comes out, putting millions of dollars in their pockets. It takes minimal effort to enter, because they can fork everything (like BUNNY...). That's why the devs are under-equipped to handle things like flash-loan proofing: they've forked the back end to all this stuff. 

I just want people to get smarter. Ethereum is a much better example of what a stable economy looks like. ""BuT tHe ApY iSn't GoOd..."" Yeah, that's the point. You think people are going to PAY you to borrow money (referring to projects like Venus here)? That should sound patently unsustainable on its face, or you just don't understand economics. Why would someone just give away value for nothing in return? You get POSITIVE apy for borrowing several assets of Venus. Compare that the MakerDAO, which is sane, where borrowing everything costs you money. 

It's a bubble. It's the perfect example of a bubble. Hopefully, when it pops for good, crypto will still stand as a viable long-term option for changing society. It definitely won't be any thanks to the gamblers.",2021-09-20 02:59:47

Some coins are supposedly backed 1:1 with the fiat they are linked to, but it turns out they are not and they use complicated financial instruments as securities instead. These ‚Äòfully collateralised‚Äô projects are also centralised which raises concerns of trust and security (the opposite of decentralised cryptocurrencies). The main culprit (see comments) is Tether USDT which is mored in controversy since its inception. 

The other projects are decentralised and either have only a percentage of collateral or no collateral at all, backing them up. They use algorithms and software protocols maintaining their stability. These are vulnerable to hacks and attacks and if anything goes wrong there is less or nothing supporting them. However, MakerDAO (DAI) has been operating since 2015 and has suffered numerous attacks and come out relatively unscathed. I personally trust DAI above all the others.",2021-09-20 16:56:31

Sure-Juggernaut4781,"‚ùìQuestion of the Week‚ùì
A ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù is a new class of cryptocurrencies that attempts to offer price stability. They are backed by a reserve asset and often peg their market value to some external reference like a fiat currency such as the US dollar. Since fiat currencies are pegged to an underlying asset, such as gold which acts as collateral, their valuations remain free from wild swings.

Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both worlds‚Äîthe instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies, and the volatility-free stable valuations of fiat currencies. They also act as a global currency but are not tied to a central bank. Two examples of stablecoins on the market today are: MakerDao (DAI) and Tether (USDT).

Robin_Hood_Jr,"You pointed out a few things that I think are lacking a lot of meaningful context. To your credit, I don't think we do a good a job of educating newer participants in the Maker community of the intricacies of the Maker Protocol, it's quite complex as you've probably realized by now.

**Malicious Governance**

Your main seems to be that you're concerned a coalition of MKR holders could take over governance, and use their votes to enrich themselves. This could be through trying to steal the collateral, minting unbacked Dai, or creating Core Units w/ inflated salaries.

So I think the missing piece here is that there is a Governance Delay before governance actions execute (48 hours), as well as a timebox for when things can execute (M-F US working hours). There is also a module called the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) which bypasses the governance delay. The Emergency Shutdown Module ensures that a minority of MKR token holders can shut down the system and everyone gets settled. Every Dai holder can redeem for $1 worth of collateral, and vault owners have their debt deducted from their collateral and can claim their remaining collateral. In the event of a malicious governance vote   the Emergency Shutdown Module gets triggered before any harm can be done to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Delegation**

You also mentioned that MKR speculators overtime cannot orchestrate meaningful governance voting coalitions. We recently released a governance delegation mechanism which you can see on the Governance Portal here: [https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates?network=mainnet) . This allows anyone to delegate their MKR votes to another individual or group. You can even split your delegated votes to different delegates if you so please. One of our VCs a16z, the crypto arm of Andressenn Horowitz,\[ recently published an article\](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/) detailing their delegation allocation which comprises of top Universities like Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, Penn, and UCLA among others as well as various other crypto based orgs and non-profits.

Anyone can apply to be a delegate listed on that page, but unless you've been in the Maker or greater crypto community for some time and generated a reputation for being knowledgeable about protocols and active in protocol governance, it's unlikely anyone would delegate meaningful amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Transparency**

&gt;There is zero transparency for whether the Maker Dao is truly decentralized, therefore I think the system will eventually collapse and other stable coins will dominate it.

On the contrary, I think MakerDAO is actually the MOST transparently stablecoin. You can \[verify the reserves backing Dai in real-time 24/7\](https://daistats.com/) and know that the data is 100% legitimate because it's coming directly from the blockchain. Other stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and PAX don't show you their reserves at all, or give very infrequent, very abstract details of their reserve holdings backing their stablecoins. 

With respect to Core Units there is \[completely visibility of every transaction from the DAO to the Core Units\](https://makerburn.com/#/expenses/accounting) which detail the amounts, which Core Unit the funds were sent to, as well as the transaction hash. These transactions perfectly align with the allocated budgets that Maker Governance approved which are also completely transparent. To my knowledge, very few DAOs even come close to the level of transparency we exhibit in this regard. As for salaries, I think if you do some more research you'll find they very much line up with expected salaries in the crypto industry. As a fun experiment, try adding the word \`solidity\` to your LinkedIn profile and watch recruiter messages flood in promising similar compensation. Personal anecdote, it's currently almost impossible to hire developers, because everyone is too busy flipping NFTs for multiples of their monthly salary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scaling**

&gt;Additionally, there are serious scaling issues as the availability of the stable coin is limited by demand for leveraged Ethereum or other assets that may be allowed to be used as collateral in the vault.

Multi-Collateral Dai allows the use many different types of assets to generate Dai, not just Ethereum. This includes other stablecoins like USDC as well as recent introduction of Real World Assets which are uncorrelated with crypto market sentiment. The introduction of Real World Assets into the protocol utilizes a \[novel legal structure which protects the interest of the DAO every step of the way.\]([https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-walkthrough-of-the-6s-capital-trust-structure/8594](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-walkthrough-of-the-6s-capital-trust-structure/8594)). While it's still very early, their introduction enables deals with TradFi institutions to be done which have the potential to generate hundreds of millions of Dai each.",2021-09-21 14:17:18

sfcpfc,"Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but if following the same deploy pattern, couldn't MakerDAO deploy an arbitrary smart contract on address ` 0x1CC7e8e35e67a3227f30F8caA001Ee896D0749eE` on Arbitrum?

According to this [StackOverflow Post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-ethereum-contract-computed),

&gt; The address for an Ethereum contract is deterministically computed from the address of its creator (sender) and how many transactions the creator has sent (nonce). The sender and nonce are RLP encoded and then hashed with Keccak-256.

So on Mainnet, contract [0x1CC7e8e35e67a3227f30F8caA001Ee896D0749eE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1cc7e8e35e67a3227f30f8caa001ee896d0749ee) was deployed by contract [0xA26e15C895EFc0616177B7c1e7270A4C7D51C997](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa26e15c895efc0616177b7c1e7270a4c7d51c997) which in turn was deployed by EOA [0xdB33dFD3D61308C33C63209845DaD3e6bfb2c674](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb33dfd3d61308c33c63209845dad3e6bfb2c674).

So, if on Arbitrum EOA `0xdB33dFD3D61308C33C63209845DaD3e6bfb2c674` manages to deploy a ""deployer contract"" at address `0xa26e15c895efc0616177b7c1e7270a4c7d51c997` and that deployer contract manages to deploy a ""returner contract"" at address `0x1cc7e8e35e67a3227f30f8caa001ee896d0749ee`, could the funds be recovered?

What I don't know is what happens if a recently deployed smart contract has pre-existing funds, does it get to access them?

If all of that is correct, recovery may be possible with the help of the holder of the keys for `0xdB33dFD3D61308C33C63209845DaD3e6bfb2c674`. But please don't get your hopes up, it'd be great if a more experienced Ethereum developer could correct me as I'm not sure that everything I said is correct.",2021-09-23 15:49:01
jumnhy,"DAI is the OG stablecoin.

In terms of stability and the risk of coming off peg, DAI is overcollateralized, backed by a large basket of various coins at this point.

The risk would be that during a crash, the value of collateral falls so fast that liquidations (buying out debt for DAI) don't keep up with the overall devaluation in the asset value. Theoretically, if a position becomes under collateralized, the collateral gets auctioned off for DAI. That decreases the overall volume of DAI out there, and in theory keeps the remaining DAI worth approximately $1 each.

Of course, for that to function, the auctions have to collect DAI that is worth at least as much as collateral, and that requires the price oracle that gives MakerDAO the value of the collateral to be functioning right, and auctions need to stay competitive so that they collect sufficient DAI.

During the Black Thursday crash in March 2020, there were issues with the liquidation auctions failing to take bids appropriately, and a substantial portion of collateral was liquidated for winning bids that didn't reflect market value, even zero bids.

All that sounds pretty scary, but here's the kicker: even during that catastrophic crash, DAI was only off peg by about 8% as a result. Substantial changes have been made to both the oracles for asset pricing and to the auction process as a whole, so such an occurrence would be highly unlikely at this point.

Pretty resilient, if you ask me.

 Unlike a CBDC, there's no blacklist, you can transfer DAI as you like. Of course, regulatory risk is there, insofar as you could see DAI being restricted for on/off-ramps like exchanges when converting to fiat. That's the lever that regulators can use; simply transferring value between individuals is a LOT harder to stop.

So yeah, get yourself some DAI.",2021-09-24 00:43:50
jumnhy,"A good chunk of DAI is collateralized with USDC, absolutely. And there are risks with that, both centralization related. A.) Circle pulls a Tether and doesn't retain assets to collateralize their USDC, and B.) Blacklisting/asset freezing.

In part the purpose of that is to help prop up the peg--the peg security module is just a USDC vault that doesn't charge interest and let's you swap DAI for USDC. 

However, in part due to blacklisting risk, Maker is opting to use fungibly-tokenized Uniswap-
V3 USDC-DAI LPTs (via Gelato) to replace their PSM. 

Blacklisted entity would be the pool, not MakerDAO, so no USDC in or out of the pool.

FaceDeer,"Yeah, zero's perhaps jumping the gun - there'll no doubt be speculators willing to vacuum up tokens at fire sale prices for the sake of the wild gamble that something may give them value again. But I suspect for a token like USDC where there's an authority that can say ""we will never redeem tokens on that chain, only tokens on this chain"" it'll drive the price of the non-redeemable tokens down very quickly indeed.

This will have knock-on effects. MakerDAO, for example, has a lot of collateral in the form of stablecoins like USDC. The version of MakerDAO that's on the chain where those crash in value will also crash. MKR holders may well say ""screw it, we're only supporting the chain where we don't have a giant flaming pile of wreckage to clean up"" and shut down MakerDAO over there. Even if they don't, the oracles that MakerDAO relies on will be chain-specific so they'll have to pick which chain to follow as well, further messing things up.

I suspect that we won't ever see another contentious split like ETC as a result of this. On the plus side, that may mean that the devs won't *risk* contentious changes like the TheDAO refund again.

108record,"# USDC - the better Tether

USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin that is pegged to the price of the US dollar - so 1 USDC = $1. [It operates like this:](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/USD_Coin)

1. A user sends US dollars to the coin issuer's bank account.
2. The issuer uses a USD Coin smart contract to create the equivalent amount of USD Coin.
3. The newly minted USD Coins are sent to the user and the substituted US dollars are held in a reserve.

It was launched on September 26, 2018, in collaboration between Circle and Coinbase, and is an alternative to other USD backed cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) or TrueUSD (TUSD). [Bringing US dollars on the blockchain allows moving them anywhere in the world within minutes, and brings much-needed stability to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it opens up new opportunities for trading, lending, risk-hedging and more.](https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/)

&amp;#x200B;

# Pros

**Very reliable leadership team &amp; founders**

* USD Coin is [developed by the Centre Consortium](https://www.centre.io/usdc), a partnership between Circle and Coinbase. The technology and governing framework are developed by Centre, while Circle and Coinbase were the first commercial issuers of USDC.
   * Circle is an [official Money Transmitter](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/us-licenses), which makes the company an open financial book, connoting that all USDC tokens are regulated, transparent and verifiable.
   * Additionally, Circle is one of the only crypto companies [backed by Goldman Sachs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-backed-circle-goes-live-with-currency-linked-stablecoin-and-anyone-can-issue-it-2018-09-26), a renowned investment bank.
   * Coinbase, the other 'half' of the Consortium, is the world's second biggest crypto exchange with billions of dollars in daily volume, so it is highly unlikely that they will perpetrate a stablecoin scam.
   * Moreover, Coinbase stock is already on the market while [Circle plans to go public via a SPAC](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/) \- which incentivizes them to keep running the USDC project lest their stock prices plummet.
* Meanwhile, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the world, has only 13 employees and is the [most valuable company on a per-employee basis in the entire world](https://cryptowhale.medium.com/the-tether-scandal-the-biggest-threat-to-the-crypto-ecosystem-23a169003205).
   * This is similar to the Madoff Ponzi scheme of the early 2000s, in which he robbed $65 billion of investors' money.
* Thus, USDC is the largest trustworthy stablecoin in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reserves are safe and are audited every month**

* A top 5 accounting firm, Grant Thornton, releases audits of Circle's reserves every month. Its [August report](https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/2021%20Circle%20Examination%20Report%20August%202021%20Final.pdf?hsLang=en) revealed that:
   * There were no discrepancies in the market cap of USDC and the value of Circle's reserves.
   * The reserves themselves consisted of 92% cash &amp; cash equivalents, 1% corporate bonds, 5% USD denominated Certificates of Deposits, and 2% commercial paper.
* [In a crisis, there‚Äôs a strong chance that Circle would be able to meet significant USDC redemptions, if not instantly, then within a short timeframe. Putting it another way, if regulators bring in rules about the quality of assets that need to back stablecoins, it‚Äôs likely that USDC assets would easily comply.](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/circle-publishes-details-of-usdc-stablecoin-asset-backing/) And that can‚Äôt be said for Tether by a wide margin. 
* The degree of transparency and quality of Circle's assets is significantly superior compared to USDT, where the asset backing raised concerns at the [Boston Federal Reserve](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2021/official-monetary-and-financial-institutions-forum-fed-week-financial-stability-session.aspx) and [Fitch](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/fitch-flags-stablecoin-risks-to-short-term-credit-markets/). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Plenty of native uses as opposed to USDT**

* Coinbase offers [no fees when spending USDC](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/) using the well-known Coinbase Card.
   * This incentivizes Coinbase users to utilise USDC to spend, rather than other cryptocurrencies.
* [VISA recently became the first major payments to allow the settlement of transactions in USDC.](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17821.html)
   * While this doesn't benefit consumers as of now, it allows crypto-holding companies such as [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and Tesla to natively transact USDC on VISA, eliminating the need to convert their crypto to fiat.
* Compare this to Tether, whose only 'partner company', Bitfinex, is actually the entity that controls USDT itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Available on a variety of blockchains**

* [USDC is powered by an ERC-20 smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain and is also supported on other blockchains (Algorand, Solana, Tron, Stellar).](https://swissborg.com/blog/usdc-vs-usdt) It is an open-source project, which makes it a transparent and verifiable stablecoin on the blockchain. 
* In addition, in the next few months [Circle is planning to add USDC to 9 more blockchains](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains/), including Avalanche, Celo, Flow, Hedera, Kava, Nervos, Polkadot, Stacks, and Tezos.
   * This will put it significantly ahead of USDT, which only supports 7 blockchains as of now.
* Each network has its own perks and flaws, all of which comprehensively make USDC more useful than it ever was.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can be staked for yields**

* [By staking USDC, you can earn](https://www.blockfer.com/earn-interest/stablecoin-interest-calculator/):
   * 8.6% APY on BlockFi
   * 8% APY on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)
   * 11.55% on Celsius Network
   * Native earnings if you hold it on Coinbase
   * ... and many more options
* On another note, you can also utilise USDC to mitigate liquidity risk by using it as collateral for DAI in MakerDAO.
* However, nearly all stablecoins can be staked for yields, some more than others.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, USDC is undoubtedly a better stablecoin than Tether, and its multitude of uses justifies its $30 billion marketcap.",2021-09-25 06:53:33

For examples:

Rollback of 185 billion bitcoins:

Ethereum forked when the DAO was hacked, essentially making the hacked funds unspendable:

The poly hack you mentioned, Binance and other exchanges also agreed to freeze not just USDT but all of the stolen funds ( thats probably why they eventually got returned)

Bitcoin, and most other cryptos also give anyone operating a node the option to blacklist individual addresses, that means if there is a large enough agreement between controlling parties (say all the large exchanges) addresses from BTC or pretty much any other blockchain can be blacklisted:

nikola_j,"&gt; Is there a way to check how much I would've been eligible for?

The airdrop was available for Maker, Compound and Aave cdp holders that had any balances in their positions at the time of their snapshot, which was mid-June.

If you had a Maker CDP open at the time, you can still load up in [https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/](https://app.defisaver.com/makerdao/) (no need to connect wallet, just enter address/ens for monitoring) and the INST button should show up in the topbar of the dashboard. When you click that it should show the amount.

nikola_j,"&gt;As I understand it each CDP has a DSProxy linked to it

It's actually the other way around. [Here's](https://imgur.com/mc7HrX2) a silly paint.exe illustration I did to explain the relations.

A [DSProxy](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy) is a smart contract that is created and owned by your EOA (your account that you have loaded up in your MetaMask or Ledger or whichever wallet interface) and your DSProxy then holds any number of Maker Vaults on it. Effectively, it's being used as a smart contract wallet, with your EOA being the only owner and manager.

The DSProxy was first popularised [by MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/devtools/working-with-dsproxy/working-with-dsproxy.md) and later adopted by other major protocols such as Balancer and Reflexer, but also by us at DeFi Saver, where we use it to keep positions in any number of integrated protocols. Note that your one DSProxy holds all of those positions.

But the cool thing about the DSProxy is that it also enables additional authorisations to be made on it, which is how DFS Automation is made possible. The smart contracts [audit](https://medium.com/defi-saver/defi-saver-automation-security-audit-summary-a883d4fde1b) briefly explains it.

Finally, to answer your question about transactions showing up on Etherscan - you'll need to switch to the ""Internal Txns"" tab and also turn on ""Advanced view"" so all transactions executed through your DSProxy show up. Here's one random example illustrating where you will find those: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0x251c36771e862d77651ae47cac5ce6d425610576/advanced#internaltx)

Alternatively, you can also find the list of all (manual and automated) adjustments made to Maker vaults using [https://defiexplore.com/](https://defiexplore.com/). There's also a CSV export option at the bottom of any CDP's history page there.",2021-09-28 02:08:43

lanceparkerusa,"Sure.  During DeFI summer (2020) people were minting DAI (MakerDAO) with ETH, then using DAI to buy more ETH to mint more DAI.  With crypto collateralized stablecoins, you can use the stablecoin you just minted to buy more collateral to mint the stablecoin effectively leveraging up your position in that specific crypto.",2021-09-28 06:07:11
downonly,"The whole idea of ""Minting Dai"" which is like synthetic dollars might be dangerously close to actually minting dollars as a bank would when they make a loan. Regular hard-money lenders(often individuals or investment companies) do not mint dollars for their loan unless they are a banking institution and have gone through the needed regulation ect. The biggest headwind right now I think is regulatory as everything is in uncharted territory.

They pool multiple properties together like a MBS(mortgage-backed security) then tokenize it and MakerDao mints the DAI for it.

himomitsme,"The part that you are missing is that the ETH is sold for DAI that is used to pay your debt.

I think that MakerDAO actually liquidates your entire collateral, unlike Compound which only liquidates a portion (but I'm actually not too sure, haven't used it myself). But assuming it did and continuing your example, if your collateral dropped to 1450 USD in value, they would need to liquidate 100 USD to pay off 100 DAI of your debt, leaving you with 900 DAI debt and 1350 USD worth of ETH collateral, with a collateral ratio of 150%.",2021-09-28 22:15:34

GumBeat007,"Jumping in on this because I have a quick question and can't remember what the outcome of this was years ago. 

First, I had no idea that the DAI withdrawn from a CDP wasn't taxable! Thankyou, this changes everything for me and I'm looking into making a CDP right now. I've been in ETH since 2016 and gave up on using most defi because of taxes. 

That out of the way. If a CDP is liquidated due to low collateral ratio how much of the liquidated CDP is settled back to its creator? I ask, because the documentation I'm seeing says that after the debt is covered and fees are covered the remainder is settled back to the creator of the CDP. But I remember some people got 100% liquidated during a flash crash in the market 2 or so years ago. Is this something that has been fixed since in the MakerDao protocol, or is this risk still present? 

I'm not saying I expect to get 90% of the CDP back or anything but there's a big difference between something and nothing lol. Again thankyou! I should have done more research myself but oh well better now than never.",2021-09-29 18:25:42

Sargos,"&gt;I remember some people got 100% liquidated during a flash crash in the market 2 or so years ago. Is this something that has been fixed since in the MakerDao protocol, or is this risk still present? 

This was March of 2020 during the Covid black swan and was a combination of abnormally high gas prices for the time and the immaturity of the Keeper ecosystem which are bots that bid on liquidated CDPs. Gas prices skyrocketed which caused a lot of Keeper bots to cease functioning as they were poorly coded and since everything was so new there were only a handful of Keepers in the first place which meant at one point only ONE Keeper was active and was submitting $0 bids for CDPs and winning. The Maker protocol itself actually worked great and weathered the storm. Keepers immediately fixed their bots and the community quickly built scripts so that anyone could run a Keeper to prevent this from happening again.

If another black swan happened the system should function normally as there's a robust system of Keepers now so you'd only lose 13% during a liquidation.",2021-09-29 20:34:05
