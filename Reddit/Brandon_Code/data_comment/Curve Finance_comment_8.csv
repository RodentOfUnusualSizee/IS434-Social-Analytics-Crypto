Jawls19881,"Don’t think of this in terms of “freeing up equity”. 

If you’ve got a perfectly good 12k car, why would you be looking to buy another car in a years time, going back to being a 2 car household? Either you need/want 2 cars, or you don’t. If you need 2 cars, little point getting rid of yours now. If you don’t, no point buying another in a year. 

From a personal finance perspective, you want to be on the relatively low points of the depreciation curve for as long as possible (consistent with a hassle factor / old car factor that you can live with). The car you have now is known to you, it’s presumably been looked after, and so on. If you buy another car, then you’re taking a punt on an unknown. 

It makes sense from a personal finance perspective to get a new (to you) car only if:

1. You’re buying something cheaper. Eg. Chop in a 13k A Class, buy a 7k Skoda. This would be the closest you get to a “releasing equity” angle but really you’re just buying something cheaper or

2. Your current car is so much of a banger that it impedes your work or is otherwise a massive inconvenience. 

Of course, you don’t have to think about these things only from a PF angle. If you like cars, you like cars. But then it’s discretionary luxury spending.",2021-08-02 01:00:49

BBrendanBB,"Good suggestions in this thread, I'll go with mine from safest to most degen. Note, they're all Polygon / fantom. I am not on Terra at the moment but it seems good.

Safest: 

\-Curve polygon. Around 13% 

\-Kyber polygon (dmm exchange. Still around 30 days left to their liquidity mining program) Around 14-15%

\-Curve on ftm. fUSDT pool currently earns 20%+

Sligthly degen: DFYN. you can get 30%+ on stables pairs. But, the rewards are vested over 6 months and the abitliy of the token to maintain its value over time is still to be proven

SlyTrout,"Leasing is usually the most expansive way to get a car and less transparent than financing. I highly recommend financing over leasing. I agree with u/BouncyEgg on focusing on getting the best price for the car you want. Most car salespeople will try to keep the conversation in terms of monthly payment. You should only discuss the price of the car.

Since cars, especially new ones, depreciate rapidly, be mindful of that when considering your down payment and loan terms. Be sure to stay ahead of the depreciation curve so you are never upside down on your car. A good thumb rule for this, and to make sure it is not too much of a drain on your finances is to put at least 20% down, finance for no more than three years, and keep the payments less than 8% of your gross income.",2021-08-02 14:17:33

SikhSoldiers,"I'm just going to give you the steps, if you want to understand where the yield is actually coming from that you're getting, it gets complicated bc finance (has to do with the demand for stablecoins so that other people can take leverage positions).

1. buy ETH on the polygon network (cheapest to use)
2. trade that ETH for USDC
3. deposit the USDC into curve finance for an equal split of USDC-USDT-DAI\*
4. optional: Take the token you recieve representing your share of USDC-USDT-DAI and deposit it with pickle finance.
5. when you feel like it, withdraw all your stablecoins, send them to coinbase, and wire the funds back to your bank account

What you're doing here is providing liquidity between the three stablecoins and earning rewards for doing so. Providing liquidity is essentially acting as the market maker in traditional finance. By locking your USD for this you get a percent of the fees the exchange (curve) earns. By using curve on the matic network you earn Matic token rewards that you can sell for extra yield. By using pickle you earn Pickle rewards that you can also sell.",2021-08-03 05:32:42

Booyakasha89,"What I can say is that:

* It will indeed give you a leg up in recruitment if you are from an Oxbridge-equivalent university vs. run-of-the-mill local uni student 
* It is way easier to score well and get First Class Honours in the UK due to the lack of a bell curve. If you do not get at least 2nd Upper (which should be an ease for most Singaporeans) you should be ashamed of yourself for wasting your money. 
* It is thus easier to stand out from the pack (i.e. top student from elite foreign uni) vs. a local uni student where you will need to slog like a dog to get First Class Honours etc.
* It is definitely not impossible for local uni students to get into high paying finance jobs, but they probably have to work harder + hustle / network to get them
* Let's say you took the local uni route and got into the high paying finance job that you were targeting: beyond this your career trajectory would largely depend on your own performance / luck - the school you came from should not matter so much anymore.  

Ultimately you will have to judge which route is worth it - all the best!",2021-08-03 22:20:56
nightsky2020,"The real goal of the lockdowns is to enable a globalist putsch colloquially refered to as 'the great reset'. The same people forcing this rapid globalism on us are the clique of plutocrats and pedophiles that were associated with Epstein\\Wexler and related pedocrats.

The following is information about the 'great reset'.

They began having their propagandists whisper these terms in our ears even before the first 2 weeks to slow the curve were up. We have seen elderly well-connected plutocrats like Nancy Pelosi ignore the lockdowns.

the lockdowns are a psychological warfare attack. This is the only way to make sense of them. From a health policy point of view makes no sense. From an economic POV makes no sense unless you understand how global finance works post-LIBOR fixing revelations and the 2008 bailouts.

Covid = globalist psyop.

nautilus555,"JavaScript isn't in the same category as C/C++. JavaScript is an event-driven scripting language that performs a lot of things synchronously. C/C++ is, unless told otherwise, not event driven and is synchronous. I wouldn't recommend making a library in C/C++ straight away either - there's a steep learning curve for C/C++ coming from other languages. Maybe take a look at Java? It is far more approachable and is definitely easier to create and integrate libraries. Java is probably a better option for finance/accounting given that you will be dealing with non-integer numbers a lot (which can be difficult with C/C++ if you have to convert between strings and numbers as you would do often in an accounting/finance library).",2021-08-04 08:03:58

\------------------------------------------------------------

One of the myths blown apart in the global financial crisis and now the COVID-19 pandemic is that governments that own the printing press need taxpayers to finance their spending.  
  
Again, the familiar strains of “Who will pay for this?” or better still, “We are burdening our children,” have arisen as the federal government has been called upon to help get us through this crisis.

These calls ignore the basic fact that governments don’t need taxes to spend. Unlike the rest of us they spend first, tax later, because they can create money that they need never repay.  
  
When the government spends it puts dollars in people’s pockets and creates activity. This in turn should create activity, confidence and most importantly employment. If there is excess capacity in the economy they need not drain all the money back through taxes. They need only drain enough to make sure inflation is kept under control.  
  
The net result, or budget position, is merely an accounting outcome in the search for low inflation and full employment.  
  
If the government runs a deficit there are then two choices. The usual choice is to drain the money back by issuing Treasury bonds so that money spent is all accounted for by taxes and bond issuance. However, the government through the Reserve Bank of Australia can leave the money out there, monetising the debt, by simply having the central bank buy the bonds. Even more efficient would be direct financing, but for now it seems a bridge too far.  
  
Do you need evidence of this simple fact? Well, since the start of 2020, in those bushfire-ravaged, pre-pandemic days that seem so long ago, the government – via the Australian Office of Financial Management – has issued an extra $250 billion of Treasury bonds. The RBA has bought $180 billion. Better still, the RBA is likely to buy at least another $130 billion of bonds by June next year, more than matching the AOFM’s issuance. No private investors required. The government is quite rightly financing itself.

For governance reasons the RBA is at pains to draw a distinction between its actions and those of state and federal governments, but they are effectively all the same body: our government, trying to achieve the same goal of full employment.  
  
So, what happens when these bonds held by the RBA mature? Well, that all depends on whether the economy is booming. If the economy is booming, and capacity constraints are causing an inflation problem, then government should be draining money from the system. This means a healthy surplus for the government which can be used to repay the RBA. Intra-government accounting assets and liabilities can be deleted.  
  
If the economy still has excess capacity and inflation is not a problem, then the RBA should simply roll its bond holdings. If you want an example of how it all looks down the track, the Bank of Japan owns half of all Japanese government bonds. Put another way, the Bank of Japan has printed money to pay for half of the net activity by the Japanese government, rather than hitting up taxpayers. And the result? An inflation rate still barely above zero.  
  
So why haven’t we done this all along? Well, it is not new. The US did it during World War II, instituting yield curve control at 2.5 per cent for Treasury bonds and 0.375 per cent for Treasury bills in 1942, even as inflation pushed up to double digits at the peak of the war. Some form of control remained in place for a decade. However, by the 1980s the combination of high inflation and free-market thinking meant central banks, not governments, became the controllers of economic cycles.  
  
Governments were told to get out of the way of the efficient private sector and balance their budgets. Armed with independence, central banks would use monetary policy levers to let the private sector flourish.  
  
Unfortunately, despite the compelling narrative the private sector proved even more incapable of controlling cycles. As Chuck Prince, chief executive of Citi, the US bank, said in 2007, “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing”.

Then, after the GFC, central banks were overly concerned about inflation despite animal spirits being crushed by the crisis. Tony Abbott was busy plying the line of repaying Labor’s debt.  
  
Now the cat is out of the bag let’s hope the RBA and the government don’t put it back in. The needs of the Australian economy remain high, both short and long term. The government has the means and capability of attacking them. Inflation is not about to run away. Government deficits and debt matter far less than most of us had been led to believe.  
  
Investors need to recognise that big government is here to stay. Whether it is tackling healthcare, subsidising environmental initiatives or making sure Australians who want to work have a job, we are entering a new era.  
  
Margaret Thatcher may have said “there is no such thing as society” but environmental and health crises remind us there is. We have now given our governments permission to be far more active and the ability to pay for it is there. Even as many of us remain locked down there is good reason to be optimistic about our future.",2021-08-04 09:04:12
mbtoffees,"Look into yield farming. Can earn 30-40% apy farming on mirror protocol (with exposure to stocks like Tesla), or 30% on mercurial finance on stables coins, or about the same on curve polygon.

lamdacore-2020,"I have done both kinds of designs in my experience. There was a time that people considered doing L3 up to the edge as it solved so many L2 problems like STP convergence, storm control, etc. But it introduced a whole set of new problems i.e. now you had to do some good routing design and the choice of protocols was a must. Secondly, troubleshooting a defective host i.e. you would first have to determine where the host is with respect to their IP (look up route table and trace to an edge rack) then you would look at the MAC table to pin point the exact port i.e. a two step process. You can improve on that with time and good documentation and design....but we all know that quickly goes out the window once you need to make so many changes that you cant keep the documentation up to date.  
  
L2 has matured a lot and now you get stacked switches, port-channelling via MLAG and with high bandwidth transceivers almost eliminates the problems of the past. Yes, STP still runs but there are no loops thanks to these technologies. The other benefit is that it makes things plug and play and makes it easy for network admins to maintain their networks.  
  
However, there are places where you must be religious in terms of network design and choosing the correct topology e.g. datacentres and the emergence of IaaS which requires plenty of scalability and rapid expansion. In such places, L2 can scale as rapidly. Instead, L3 provides much better scalability and L2 traffic is maintained using newer technologies like VXLAN.  
  
So, my advise is, do not turn your production network into a CCIE lab because you will be in a world of hurt when things go bad. If you can stick to L2, continue on. And now to answer your questions:  
  
1 - I dont think they do because they are meant to perform end host switching. However, I am not too across virtual switches but my experience is that they are almost always configured as L2 switches. The pinned NICs simply perform VLAN tagging and trunk to an upstream physical switch.  
  
2 - If you stick with L2, you probably just need to make minor changes, you get proper stackable switches and the core is in an MLAG configuration and you have multiple SFPs, then you will find the configuration to be a lot more simple and no need for L3. If it is L3, then yes, it is more than just getting switching and/or routing design. You will need to make sure all your interconnects have an IP address as well. You will need to apply more routing controls.  
  
3 - If you go down the path of L3 per access layer, then the VLAN scope is limited to that closet only. This means floor one may have VLANs 10, 20, and 30 and assigned to the Marketing department. Then on Floor two, you can re-use the same VLANs but assigned to another L3 subnet and then given entirely to another team like Finance. However, imagine the confusion where the re-use of VLANs is the same and you mix up VLAN 10 of Marketing with VLAN 10 or Finance. You will overcome that at some point but it will be high learning curve for the new engineer. The L3 access switch is now default gateway of all host connecting to their respective VLANs in the specific closet.  
  
4- Nope, every link will now need to have its own unique subnet for routing purposes. You will have to choose between routing protocols. If you choose OSPF, you may want to regrain from creating a single Area 0 (backbone) network. Your core can be your backbone and each floor distribution will be a particular area. OR the core and distribution can be a single Area 0 and each access layer can be its own unique area. So many design options here. The effort will be significant but if it is worth it then go for it. If it simply because you like to do it...that is not really a good enough reason. As you transition, there is a high chance of making mistakes some of which can be critical.  
  
5 - No, firewalls have the capability of zoning. You simply create the appropriate zones and configure the rules. One zone may be your internal network and then things like guest and iot etc can be their own zones. Then there will be a zone for DMZ or internet etc. You simply block them accordingly. However, this is old school security, what you would do, ideally, is use something like a NAC that does dynamic VLAN assignment irrespective of where the host is on your network. Different NAC solution provide additional layers of Layer 2 security and traffic gets blocked before even reaching the firewall. In one environment, the corporate network used 10.0.0.0/8 but guest and IoT were given 192.168.0.0/24 which were routed directly to the internet gateway. We suppressed this route from ever being learned on the OSPF network.",2021-08-04 15:10:05

Thelonius_Dunk,"Good question. Microsoft Office has such a stranglehold on corporate business culture its hard to break away from it. Even if a new product is developed, it'd be tough for it to infiltrate the corporate world. Keep in mind, even if you successfully implemented a new spreadsheet software at your company,  you still have vendors, customers, and govt  regulation agencies to deal with. Guess what they all use?.......Excel. Maybe you could influence them to switch over to the new program but that'll be tough.  Maybe Google Sheets might be the future? They're following in Microsofts footsteps by creating an ecosystem to pair with it by making their own PowerPoint and Word.

The other issue is that Excel is a low learning curve ""sandbox"" software that's sort of a jack of all trades. Python or other languages are better at heavy calculations, Minitab is better at statistical analysis, and MS Access is better at database management.

samdachemist,"You can lend out stable coins, that is crypto pegged to the dollar, both on centralized exchanges for 5-10% returns and on decentralized protocols for 10%+.  

Coinbase gives 4% interest on USDC (us dollar coin).  BlockFi gives 7.5% on USDT (us dollar tether) and USDC on up to 50k for each theoretically giving you a savings account earning 7.5%.  

[See this article for information on Coinbase.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/05/how-risky-is-coinbases-4-interest-rate-on-usd-coin/)

When it comes to DeFi (decentralized finance) individuals can take the place of large financial institutions both in P2P lending and as market makers on decentralized exchanges.  Individuals provide liquidity and capture the fees that a market maker would otherwise get.  Different market pairings give different incentives increasing and decreasing what fees liquidity providers get.  

Curve is a DeFi protocol that allows someone to provide liquidity solely for stable coins.  You ""stake"" stable coins in a pool of 3-4 stables and earn a return on the pool \~10%.  

People provide liquidity for curve because it gives higher return than anything else for stables and you own your keys instead of relying on a centralized exchange to hold them.  People use curve as an exchange because the fees are lower than other exchanges and because curve is decentralized you own your keys while doing the exchanging.  

Why do people exchange stables?  Because there are arbitrage opportunities with crypto and sometimes different stables paired with a coin like wETH or wBTC will earn wildly different amounts for their liquidity providers. 

This is probably super confusing.  I'm more into crypto than most people I know and i don't fully understand the intricacies of DeFi.  You can always head over to r/defi and read more there.",2021-08-05 03:13:41

awhhh,"It’s really not as a leftist trying to create freedom via post scarcity in the open source and arguably the biggest advocates for freedom on the internet that even includes piracy. 

They’re all right to some extent, but they’re missing a massive component to freedom and that’s free thought. Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook have people regurgitating *rhetoric* that’s usually cultivated in some think tank that has every desire to narrow speech into it arena to dominate it. It’s these people who creating the rules that Zizek is talking about, and that’s where I take problem. 

At times I’m personally not called a leftist, because abandoned the idea of equality. It doesn’t exist in economics, and never will socially. Because everything exists in scarcity, our time, resources, access to those resources, and so on. It will always revert to a utopian idea that can’t and won’t exist. The only liberty is to me is liberty that can be *more accessible* to everyone regardless of race, social standings, and political ideology. The post scarcitists, and anyone the believes socialism in a demand economy, take this on, and we’re by far the most successful ideological framework given that the entire planets economy is built on the back of our contribution. 

Lowkey tried to point out that ideas will die, but let them die naturally then. He wants to hate on Zuck and Dorsey, while also ally with them when it’s convenient. Zizek is right, there’s rules, but they’re mostly made by the platforms that create scarcity for the sake of profit. But the problem is the monopolies are extinguishing rules now by even banning them from hardware like Apple App Store, or even Amazon AWS. These companies benefit from our contributions, but choose to gatekeep the end product from use. 

The problem I have with all 3 of them is they will always have to create a bigger dystopian world with cherry picked evil than it is. Where lowkey is the worst because there’s an actual want for power over another ideology by enforcement. The point at which that left bothers me is through the rhetoric they create for righteous grandstanding that is no different than the right wing authoritarians. The rhetoric evades nuance, and the left is now becoming extremely guilty of this. Most leftist I know will generalize whole systems as capitalist or socialist to create black and white or good and evil in a unified way that matches the rights god complex. For example two people in finance might talk about how monetary policy is setup to hurt people or benefit them, instead of jumping into a nuanced but highly important issue like fractional reserves vs yield curve control, they’ll label the entire system as evil and cherry-pick fancy sounding points. 

Ok, so I’ve lost the point a bit, but there’s a problem that those three doesn’t see I’m the very irony of how they’re perpetuating this nonsense. I would say Zizek least of all, because he’s more so making observations and saying that’s probably why it’s like that, where the other two are making assertions.",2021-08-07 08:09:08

la102,"OPINION:  
  
It is becoming clear that the economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been overdone.  
  
As a result of massive fiscal expansion and the loosest monetary policy in living memory, the country is awash in both borrowed and printed money. And our unusually constrained economy can't expand fast enough to absorb all that cash. We are overheating.  
  
Inflation is already running at an annual rate of 3.3 per cent; and most price growth has happened in the last six months. If the second half of this year runs like the first, we are heading to 4 per cent plus inflation by the end of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

Unemployment is at 4 per cent which normally would be considered unambiguously good news. But this time round it is more evidence of severe capacity constraints.  
Because of our largely closed borders, plus a government which is philosophically determined to keep skilled workers out under almost any circumstances, our workforce is growing at nothing like it has in the past. Add a bit of demand-side growth, and businesses, hospitals and the like quickly run out of people to hire.  
The rapid re-emergence of inflationary pressures seems to have surprised many people, including the Reserve Bank Governor. As late as the end of May, the Bank was telling everyone it would maintain its current stimulatory settings in order to meet its policy goals.

&amp;#x200B;

That's despite many people, including this writer, warning as far back as February that inflation was likely re-emerging. The Governor is supposed to be ahead of the curve, not behind it.  
No reasonable person could be too critical of the initial pandemic response by either Grant Robertson or Adrian Orr. With the country plunged into level 4 lockdown, fiscal support for suddenly curtailed businesses was crucial. And dropping interest rates and releasing more cash was a sensible macro-economic response. The main problem has been the period since Christmas.  
The Governor and his Monetary Policy Committee have stuck to their ""least regrets"" expansionary policies all year, despite clear signals they needed to be cut back to limit inflation and soaring house prices.

&amp;#x200B;

It was only three weeks ago that they bowed to the obvious and announced the end of large-scale bond purchases (what we know as quantitative easing). Inexplicably they still haven't stopped lending printed money to the banks at tiny interest rates to ""keep borrowing costs down"" at the same time.  
All this means interest rate rises are now going to have to be sharper and greater than they would have been if the brakes had been tapped a few months ago. The big banks are pricing an increase of up to 1.5 per cent over the next 18 months. If that happens, it's going to hurt borrowers, especially people with large mortgages.  
You must have some sympathy for those who entered the housing market in the last year or so. One of the deliberate effects of ultra-low interest rates is to boost asset prices, so people who own those assets feel wealthier and spend more than they otherwise would. It also means first-home buyers take on more debt to get into a house which costs significantly more than it otherwise would.  
Then, once they are in the house, interest rates are going to hike up because inflation and house prices have gone up too much. Those unfortunate first home buyers will get whacked both ways.  
But it's not just the Reserve Bank Governor who should be questioned over the timing of his decisions. The Finance Minister is taking a far too passive approach to the country's changing economic circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Only this week he was in the media washing his hands of our pending interest rate hikes, along the lines of ""we do what we do and the bank will do what it does"". Not so fast.  
His first problem is that the Government has just kept on spending, despite strong signs the economy is recovering. And the quality of that spending has dropped dramatically in the last nine months.  
It's one thing to support people's livelihoods during a government-imposed set of public health restrictions. It's an entirely different thing to spend a bunch of borrowed cash you've put aside for future possible lockdowns on all sorts of ""nice to haves"" that have nothing to do with the pandemic.  
This year's Budget was a doozy, with $20 billion in extra spending over four years, despite it being clear by Budget Day we are having a better pandemic economically than most other countries.  
That's pump-priming on a grand scale; which in turn stokes inflation and the need for interest rate increases. The more the Finance Minister spends, the more the Governor will have to take away the proverbial punch bowl.  
The Finance Minister's other problem is the negative impact the government's wider policies are having on both inflation and economic capacity. The Government is at least partially culpable for the increase in electricity costs, wage inflation (through its big hikes to the minimum wage and increased leave entitlements), and our impossibly restrictive labour market. All these make the Reserve Bank Governor's job harder, and New Zealand an outlier in the inflation stakes amongst developed countries.  
Belatedly, and possibly with the help of a poll or two, the Government is showing signs of waking up to its simultaneous strangling and overheating of the New Zealand economy.  
This week we are told RSE workers from Covid-free pacific islands won't have to quarantine any more; that the totemically wasteful Auckland bike bridge is probably toast; and the Government is, possibly, maybe, going to take some steps to improve the ability of businesses to get crucial workers through the mess that is MIQ. But it is all incredibly late.  
These steps and other corrective actions could have been taken months ago; and the spending on the bike bridge along with a stack of other low priority items could have been nixed before they were announced.  
There are plenty of things that are not of the Government's or Reserve Bank's making that are helping boost inflation. They have no control over Opec, or Joe Biden's profligate spending in the US, or indeed the world's logistics logjam.  
But they can see them all happening, and alter their own response accordingly.  
That would be a true ""least regrets policy"". Unfortunately it looks more like we've had a ""set and forget"" policy, and borrowers are about to feel the sharp end of that.

SecondAccount404,"# Article text

&gt;The U.K. has set one of the most ambitious carbon emission-reduction targets among major economies, making the country a case study in how climate goals call for big shifts in policy, the economy and technology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Britain is one of several heavy polluters including the U.S., China and the European Union to have unveiled emission plans in the run-up to the United Nations climate conference in Scotland this fall. Fires in North America and in Russia’s northeast, flooding in Europe and China and a severe drought in Brazil have injected additional urgency into diplomatic efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a bid to establish the U.K.’s environmental bona fides ahead of the conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. President Biden, meanwhile, aims to halve U.S. emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. China is targeting a peak in emissions by 2030.  
&gt;  
&gt;How Britain fares, having already made deeper cuts than other G-20 economies, will offer the U.S. and other countries clues about the steps needed. Emissions in the U.K. fell by 40% from 1990 through 2019, largely because it pivoted away from coal and toward renewable sources of energy in the electricity industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further reductions would likely bring tough changes in areas including transportation, housing and industry, according to energy executives, bankers and investors. Companies are paying attention: Firms from major oil companies such as BP BP 0.87% PLC to auto makers such as Tesla Inc. TSLA -2.17% are vying to make money from the U.K.’s transition.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. government is committed to meeting its targets and will publish a plan for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 before the U.N. conference, a spokesman said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the five things the U.K. is focused on: Electricity Generation  
&gt;  
&gt;Cleaning up power generation is key because climate plans in the U.K. and elsewhere depend on electrifying swaths of the economy, including transportation and some energy-intensive industrial processes. The U.K. has made quicker progress on this than most other major economies: Wind power alone provided about 25% of electricity in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next step, according to the Climate Change Committee—a panel of external advisers that guides and reports on the government’s efforts to get to net zero—is to generate electricity from entirely low-carbon sources by 2035. That will require billions of dollars to finance offshore-wind farms in particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fierce competition is under way to dominate the offshore-wind market, pitting early movers such as Denmark’s Ørsted AS ORSTED 0.63% , Norway’s Equinor AS EQNR 1.74% A and U.K. utility SSE SSEZY 1.09% PLC against newer entrants including BP. “Electricity’s definitely the place to be,” SSE Chief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said. Power Storage and Transmission  
&gt;  
&gt;Switching to a power system dominated by renewables at a time of rising power demand will test the reliability of electricity supplies and the stability of the grid.  
&gt;  
&gt;The wind doesn’t always blow, so storing electricity will be crucial, said Robert Gross, a professor of energy policy and technology at Imperial College London. Some of the technology needed to do this, such as pumping water uphill with electricity before releasing it to drive a turbine, has been in use for decades. Other technologies, such as batteries or green hydrogen, are still being developed or remain commercially unviable on an industrial scale.  
&gt;  
&gt;More offshore electrical connections need to be built each year than have been constructed in any year ever, said Nicola Shaw, U.K. president at National Grid PLC. Transportation  
&gt;  
&gt;Cars and other forms of surface transportation are now the biggest source of emissions in the U.K. The country must quickly convert its fleet to run on electricity, according to the government’s advisers.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far this year, fully electric cars have accounted for just 8.1% of the market. Vehicles made by Tesla, Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -0.09% and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC are the most popular.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. would also need to expand its network of public charging points by more than 10 times by 2030. Buildings  
&gt;  
&gt;Another source of emissions that the U.K. has largely failed to plug comes from buildings. Reducing these will depend on insulation and draft-proofing, and on moving from natural-gas boilers to alternative sources of heat.  
&gt;  
&gt;The need to re-equip millions of homes could be a moneymaker for utilities such as Centrica CPYYY 1.33% PLC, investors say. Mortgage lenders such as NatWest Group NWG 2.04% PLC are looking to see if they can offer financial incentives to make homes more efficient. Carbon Capture and Hydrogen  
&gt;  
&gt;Hitting the U.K.’s longer-run target of net-zero emissions by 2050 would involve cleaning up sectors such as manufacturing and construction. Doing so would partly rely on less-established technologies such as using hydrogen to fire furnaces and kilns, and on capturing and storing carbon. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you think the U.K. will reach its climate goals? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.  
&gt;  
&gt;One big company pinning its hopes on carbon capture is Drax Group DRXGY 39.14% PLC, which produces about 6% of the U.K.’s electricity. In June, Drax struck a deal to use Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Group’s carbon-capture solvent at its power plant in Yorkshire, which has been converted to run on wood pellets instead of coal.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. doesn’t yet have all the policies in place to eliminate emissions from the power system, said Drax Chief Executive Will Gardiner. “But there’s still time to get the curve to the right place,” he said.",2021-08-09 07:09:07

DaddyDelts,"I just switched to Mac after spending my entire college and working experience on a PC. I have the whole apple ecosystem (iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, etc.).

While I like many of the features of macOS such as the text messaging, shared clipboard and side car.  I have found the switch very challenging. 

I would consider myself a power user of excel and other programs where I extensively and almost exclusively used shortcut keys. Losing those has made my workflow much slower, I love the gestures on Mac, but it has taken a lot of getting used to.

Finder is no match for file explorer. And as above posters have said many apps are made for Mac as a second thought rather than a primary focus. It may be my experience but it also seems my 16gb of ram on Mac is less than my 16gb of ram on PC. That may just be my experience with the apps I use not being optimized for Mac as well.

I found that I needed to install parallels (well bootcamp + parallels) to get much of my work done.

I am in finance though, so most of my work requires Microsoft products. The fact that windows can be run on Mac, but not vice versa is what ultimately got me to stick with my MBP. If I was in design, programming, or other creative spaces I think I would love the more artsy feel of MacOS more. 

I know that for me, prior to Mac the only PC on the market I thought were worth getting were the dell xps and the Razerblade stealth as they both come in the 13 or 15” formats. Not sure if that’s still the case.

**2. in depth city council governance &amp; oversight knowledge** \- I currently train other city councils and boards on best practices in governance, oversight, process and building consensus. I deliver the city council 101 mandatory courses.  
**3. I am a lawyer and have been a chief risk officer** \- I understand the intricacies of risk management and legal issues. When those come before Council (and they will every time), I will ask the important questions and will have understood what I've read to be able to get the right information and help convey it - I will also know what's missing and where the gaps are  
**4. I worked in the energy industry from both a profit side and an environmental protection side** \- I understand the climate change issues and environmental concerns - I can immediately dive into files like Blatchford and GHG emissions, understanding how to make practical and future-focussed change  
**5. I've worked with marginalized individuals in my paid and volunteer roles** \- I have experienced using a women's shelter for safety, losing my home, and being poor. I have lived in ""core"" neighbourhoods. I know what it's like to have a disability and to care for those with disabilities. I will not disregard the voices of those who need me most. I will actively seek them out so that they are heard along with all Edmontonians - and I will push for truly inclusive culture change. I have created NFP orgs for vulnerable people and supported diversity, anti-racism, inclusion, accessibility and change.  
**6. I have worked in the policing environment in Edmonton** and already have a deep understanding of the challenges and successes. I am already trying to change systemic issues through creation of the Coalition of Canadian Police Reform. I support systemic change, but I do not support defunding (that's not how finance works and not how you make real change).  
**7. I do tons of pro bono legal work for marginalized communities, people and organizations.** I believe in giving back and I know the power of personal communication, accountability and transparency. I teach it. I will deliver a personal scorecard on a quarterly basis to account for how I am doing against the outcomes I promised and that are important to my Ward and to Edmontonians.  
**8. I am an ethics investigator.** I investigate breaches of Codes of Conduct. I will not put up with that on my watch and I know where changes need to be made.

**9. I have a practical, common sense approach that has been informed by diverse life experiences.**

**10. I live in and operate businesses in my own ward.**",2021-08-10 05:49:45
mbtoffees,"Also the safe route, which everyone seems to recommend here is just to buy ETFs and Max out your super.

Frankly, I'm 100% in crypto. Every pay check I get I move to a yield farm where I earn 30-40% on USD, never going to get that from your bank. There's a bit of a learning curve but at the end of the day the risk is quite low. Some of these systems have billions of dollars in them, so they are quite obviously trusted by people. Again though, they're new so they're still maturing. In time the reward rates will lower as they are adopted, but these models are innovative and are likely to be used by banks in the future. If banks don't adopt these systems, they'll mostly be made redundant.

pegasi_admin,"First off, congratulations and well done on completing your degree.

I wouldn’t worry that you’re perhaps feeling unprepared and perhaps a bit overwhelmed. Making the change from student to practitioner is tough. One important thing to remember is that your more experienced colleagues were in your exact situation once, feeling what you’re feeling, and if they can do it – so can you.

Regarding your first concern (specialisation): most translators I know professionally and personally (myself included) didn’t actually have a specialisation when they started their careers. So, the path they’ve had to take to specialise is: get a broad range of experience (in various fields) to begin with in the first few years, work out which of the major fields they enjoy translating in (e.g. finance), then drill down to specialise in a specific niche area a few years down the line (e.g. fintech).

Secondly, regarding CAT tools: I believe this is one shortcoming of translation programs, that they don’t actually give students many insights into the day-to-day tools that translators might use. I do generally feel, though, that they’re best learned on the job, so I don’t think you need to worry about not having any experience as yet. The likes of YouTube’s sure to have tutorials for various tools. You’ve already mentioned OmegaT (which, unfortunately, I can’t advise on, having never used it myself), but CaféTran Espresso is also free (albeit within certain limitations). CTE is certainly more [affordable](https://www.cafetran.com/get-cafetran/) than Trados and memoQ, although do also bear in mind that both Trados and memoQ both offer 30-day free trials, and with memoQ agencies can also grant you a licence to work on their projects once the trial version has expired.

Regarding useful glossaries and dictionaries, I’m not sure I’m best placed to advise on useful ones, not working with Spanish myself, but one thing I would advise is reading around extensively in whatever field you choose. Google is your friend here – good research skills are one of the hallmarks of a competent translator, along with a passion for and mastery of the chosen languages, and good writing skills.

It will take time, but I do believe you’ll get there in the end. The initial learning curve and startup process can be tough (especially if you’re launching your freelance career straight out of university), but get through the first year or two and you’ll find it gets so much easier from then on. The first couple of years are the hardest; persist and you’ll reap the rewards. All the best, buddy.",2021-08-10 10:49:07
drKRB,"Sorry for your loss.

I do not claim to be an expert, but have studied investing and personal finance extensively and teach in a related field. 

Not financial advice, but if it were my money I would take $5,000 - $10,000 and put it in a bank account that you can use over the next year or two to help with life expenses. This will help lightened the load of everyday life for the short term. 

Next I would take the balance (Approximately $40,000) and seek out a professional investment advisor to help prepare a portfolio for you that will make life easier in retirement. Please prepare for it now because you will be so glad you did. It may seem far away, but 10 to 15 years can slip by and then you’re half way to retirement and then feel behind. With that kind of money and a long time line, it can double many times: 40 becomes 80, to 160, to 320, to $640,000. Compound interest and time is your friend. 

Additionally, I would consider a 5-10% allocation to Bitcoin with the rest going into mutual funds that invest in known companies (Think: apple, Amazon, Facebook, google, Starbucks, etc.). Bitcoin has a steep learning curve, but it’s worth learning about. Google: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin. Do some research.

pmuens,"To learn Smart Contract and dApp development you can check out the CryptoDevHub Wiki's ""Getting Started"" guide: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/blockchain-development-tutorial

It teaches you everything you need to know to get from complete beginner to proficient Smart Contract engineer.

The Wiki also has a DeFi page with lots of resources you can browse through: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/defi

In terms of DeFi codebases I'd recommend that you read the code of a project you're already familiar with. That way you know what to expect. Good codebases IMHO are the Curve one (written in Vyper and well documented), Harvest strategies and yearn strategies:
- https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract
- https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest-strategy
- https://github.com/yearn/yearn-protocol

For the yearn case there's also a useful repo which walks through the architecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwZk-IaMRs It's a little bit ""outdated"" but still worthwhile to watch IMHO (you only need to watch the 1st half).

When diving in you can start with the test cases as they simulate real-world interactions with the contracts.

If you're looking for tutorials on how to integrate with existing DeFi projects you should check out the ""Smart Contract Programmer"" YouTube Channel: https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/ethereum-virtual-machine-media#smart-contract-programmer There's a dedicated playlist which shows you how you can e.g. do flash loans or integrate with Compound and Aave.

There's also the ""Money Legos"" project you should check out (especially their docs): https://cryptodevhub.io/wiki/defi#money-legos

I would often run through the prior day's topics in the shower in the morning, study during downtime at work, then study more when I got home. 

If I didn't understand a topic I would write about the topic, do some out of material research, and get to where I could explain it to a friend who is not a finance professional. 

The level 3 material can be a lot of fun at times. If you are hitting a section that drags on, try to find some enjoyment in it. It will make your studies much easier.

C0SMICLUX,"i think it may be doable but it may be very painful at times. i’d only do this if you aren’t planning on working and won’t be heavily involved in extracurriculars. people have done similar schedules before but not sure at what cost. like for example if getting all As is important then i’d probably stick to 16 units instead

the 201/270 combo can be pretty rough depending on who you have, so i /would/ advise against 20 units with those courses, although from my experience 307, 302, and 312 (i took that course out of the 3) are not too hard. but it just might get tough during midterm season and especially by the end of the semester as you have finals and your group project for 201, which could bite you in the ass especially if you don’t pace it well. 270 is a VERY important course and it would be good if you have a good grasp on algorithms. BUT, i do know people have done 20 units with 201/270/407 or the like, so it’s not IMPOSSIBLE.

for your second semester i feel like your mileage can vary. definitely way more manageable than the first but also depends on how strong you are with finance concepts (it wasn’t too hard for me but i’ve heard some conflicting levels of difficulty). 304 is just a trash class which might tank your gpa with its curve, and the GE-C+G i took was LING 115, which was really, really easy, and depending on your CS elective, it could just feel like a more work heavy 16 unit semester. HOWEVER, i’ve heard varying things about 310 and while i have not taken that specific class yet i’ve heard it’s pretty annoying and can be a time sink sometimes.

so tldr: depending on a lot of things like how confident you are with the subject of your classes, etc. your mileage may vary. honestly if you really want to stick with your schedule, you can just see how you feel before the add/drop deadline, but be aware of how it may feel during finals vs. the first few weeks. people have done 20 units in CS before so i know it’s not impossible but may come at a cost of grades, sleep, or social life if you struggle with certain classes/topics. just don’t overwhelm yourself with classes! just bc it’s doable or not impossible doesn’t mean you should always do it. definitely better to take it a bit easy than to have it topple down on you at rough parts of the semester. obviously i don’t know you so i don’t know what your bandwidth is/your limit so i’m just speaking from a realistic perspective. if you know your limits and this is where they are, great, but also don’t forget about junior year recruiting which is… pretty time consuming 🥶",2021-08-12 00:58:30

MateBeatsTea,"&gt;That's a case of the government completely fucking up with knee jerk policy and nothing related to the relative costs of nuclear and wind/solar.

The relative cost of wind/solar to nuclear a decade ago where way worse than today, let alone 20 years ago when the EEG kicked in. So a lot of that money went into feed-in-tariffs (subsidies) to finance early adoption, and that's also why there will be a lot of inertia in terms of running costs for the German grid in the coming years, as a lot of generation has landed 20-year guaranteed tariffs during the last decade when average costs for new capacity were much larger.

Renewable enthusiasts will roll their eyes and tell you that those costs were justified, because they sent the solar and wind industry down the learning curve path whose results we are seeing today with much lower LCOEs. And I partially agree, but the point remains that Germany could have chosen the nuclear path and have cleaned up its grids for a similar total bill and probably for much less, while restarting the nuclear industry in Europe with a dozen EPRs.

# For borrowing and lending

1. **AAVE:** With over 2 billion dollars on stored value, AAVe is probably the most used and well known DeFi dapp on both Polygon and Ethereum, can be used to lend and borrow multiple tokens (wBTC, wETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, AAVE, MATIC), while earning interest.

3. SushiSwap Kashi Lending
4. C.R.E.A.M Finance

# Yield-Aggregators

1. **Adamant Finance**: Adamant is a yield optimizer platform that provides users with an easy and safe way to automatically compound their tokens. Adamant currently has over 150 valuts where users can deposit their LP tokens, which are then automatically compounded into more LP tokens.
2. Beefy Finance
3. Polycat
4. Autofarm

# Exchanges

1. **QuickSwap**: Next-gen Layer 2 DEX. Trade at lightning-fast speeds with near-zero gas fees.
2. SushiSwap
3. 1Inch

# Liquidity Pools

1. **Curve Finance**: Curve is an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum (like Uniswap) designed for: extremely efficient stablecoin trading low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.
2. Quickswap
3. SushiSwap
4. Balancer

# Porfolio Tracker

1. **DeBank**: DeBank is a multichain portfolio tracker that allows you keep track of your own and other peoples portfolios across multiple networks
2. Zapper

# NFT + Gaming

1. **Decentraland**: Decentraland is a virtual game world run by its users. Every piece of land and every item in the virtual land is a non-fungible token. Some of them sell for thousands of dollars.
2. Decentral.games
3. Aavegotchi
4. Cometh

# Bridges

1. **Polygon Bridge:** The Polygon Bridge is the main bridge between the Ethereum network and the Polygon network. Allows user on the Ethereum network to lock their tokens in a contract which then mints an equivalent amount on the Polygon network. (all fees, regardless of the bridge direction, are paid in ETH from the Ethereum network)

collywallydooda,"Lots of strategies but if you want to keep it simple you can borrow USDC then deposit it into the stable pool on polygon Curve, usually upwards of 10% interest. Many other options available like stable pools on beefy finance with higher returns.

I stick to borrowing USDC, USDT borrows tend to randomly skyrocket in interest rates to 10-20+%. Also try calculating what market value of your coin would see you liquidated and set some price alerts with your favourite app to give you warning. To do this check the ""liquidation threshold"" for your deposited coin, lets use BTC as an example, which is 75%. If the value of what you've borrowed reaches more than 75% of your deposited BTC value then you might be liquidated.

I'll use some extra old BTC values to keep it easy :)

BTC value: $1200
Deposit: 1 BTC
Borrowed: $750
Liquidation threshold: 75%

You have $1200 deposited, the liquidation threshold is 75% of what you've deposited making it $900. If you've borrowed more than your liquidation amount then you'll be liquidated, but you're ok for now because you've only borrowed $750, giving you $150 spare. However, if the BTC value drops to $1000, with the liquidation threshold at 75% that would mean your limit is $750, your current amount borrowed. At this point you'd be up for liquidation.

In this instance you might want to set an alert if the BTC price drops to say, $1100? Depends how much risk you are ok with, the main point is to give yourself enough time to withdraw some of what you've borrowed from where you've deposited it to pay back some of the loan and avoid liquidation.

repawel,"I recommend the same: Lido Finance, and then (when it finally arrives) Rocket Pool.

**I don't recommend any custodial staking. Like for example Binance which has some legal problems currently, so I'm happy I don't have any money frozen in this company.**

Currently Lido seems the best for me. They give you stETH tokens back which you can trade. You can increase your profits by locking stETH and ETH on Curve to earn LDO on incentivized pool (there are also CRV incentives and trading fees, but they are currently not very profitable). You can later sell LDO for ETH, stake it, put into the pool and so on.

There is a very attractive Yearn Finance's Vault ""crvSTETH"" which automates all of this, and makes you pay low gas fees. If you have 1 ETH, then gas fees would kill you if you want to do it manually.

ReverendBlue,"Great post! Thanks for doing the dirty work of outreach to the ""normies"".

So few people understand crypto, even most of us here who are ostensibly way ahead of the curve.  Like 99% of topics out there, people will form a snap judgement about it and then go ahead and block out new information that threatens their perspective.  

Even where there's a true killer app for crypto, it will take a long time to onboard the vast majority of people.  The fact of the matter is that most people, even if they are horribly dissatisfied with the legacy financial system, don't have the imagination to see the world any differently to how they currently see it, or how they've learned that it functions.

In some ways it's the same with climate change; people are starting to acknowledge it as a reality, but can't imagine what its consequences will be, nor how they should act now in order to protect themselves from it.

Crypto is a little different because it's a combination of technology and finance, both subjects that people find threatening in their complexity and inscrutability, but also because people don't see the legacy financial system as a real threat to humanity (despite all the signs).

Like climate change though, people will acknowledge crypto when they are forced to, and let's be honest, they will most likely be forced into using it when CBDCs become mainstream.  This is where the real battle will begin; when CBDCs and 'corpo coins' become totally mainstream, open-source decentralised projects will be a way for people to meaningfully opt out of the legacy financial system.",2021-08-16 10:09:33
baazaa,"It's conceivable a central bank would struggle to control inflation through only this channel as it can hardly start asking for the UBI cheques back. I'd keep open market operations as a mechanism at the same time.

&gt; It seems that by having all money stem from loans issued by central banks at preferable rates to private banks, money is perversely injected into one specific sector of the economy, finance, and thus inflation controls would tend to benefit that sector and only drive consumer demand through loans from banks which seems fundamentally predatory.

There are two types of central bankers.

The first has a mental model which is just, I kid you not, mv=pq. As such they think your suggestion is identical to QE, because all they care about is the quantity of money. Then when the velocity of money plummets because they've pumped cash into banks which are already sitting on a trillion dollars of excess reserves, they just throw up their hands and say they've tried anything. 

The second sort is is what is vulgarly called a supply-sider. They still persist under the delusion that a drop in the interest rate stimulates business loans by dropping the hurdle ROI. And QE can achieve the same by flattening the yield curve. This is of course nonsense, companies often maintain a hurdle rate of like 10% regardless of what the yield curve is doing. Typically cutting interest rates works by stimulating home loans which ultimately increases the money circulating in the real economy, which might cause increased investment but doesn't 'fund' it, which is how you probably imagine it works but the central bankers haven't yet cottoned on.

If you talk to either type about consumer demand you'll just get blank stares, neither of them think it matters or means anything.",2021-08-16 19:57:01

gravis1982,"You need to get into defi my man.  

People are making 20 to 50% per year on Conservative strategies just by collecting fees and liquidity pools, for years now. Look into yearn vaults or curve stable coin pools.  

You think this is ridiculous because Banks don't let normal people participate in this kind of stuff. 

In defi, really smart people have designed extremely complicated strategies that you can join with $10 if you want in 10 minutes from your phone you don't need to ask anyone about anything or wait in line or sign any paperwork or wait for days to get your money back, it just happens, in seconds.


Nexo (which is not defi) gives you 12% on stable coins if you hold 10% of your account balance in nexo coin. And nexo coin it's essentially owning part of the company because you have to own it in order to get good rates.  The value of nexo for example continues to go up. It's almost like owning a share in the company but they would never say that.  Where these really good rewards come from , is lending. Instead of the bank keeping all the income from lending out their money, the system is more decentralized and spreads these profits among the actual users instead of a central entity. Interest rates are also higher because they want your money so they have to give you Great rates. Unlike banks which don't need your money, they just need your equity to leverage it in the market. They have no reason to give you a high interest rate.

World of decentralized finance, or centralized cryptocurrency landing, is slowly but surely starting to mirror the strategies and traditional finance, but it just looks different and sounds different, and CNN tells you it's scary, but there's some very legitimate stuff going on in these money markets if you do your research.  With billions of dollars invested. It's up to you not to pick one that's going to steal your money, and honestly with a few days of reading it's not hard to find the safe havens.",2021-08-17 05:51:08

He's now leaving. Who's the new money bags man to balance off all the spending urges in the long term? I don't think Denise is the one, or some of the older ones on the board.

missquentin,"2 main applications in defi right now.  DEX and lending.

DEX allows users pool assets into a liquidity pool and make markets.  Lending is self explanatory (worth mentioning that all lending that I know of is done with collateral, such that the collateral gets sold if the price drops, so there is not risk of the borrower just stealing funds).

Each project is different and you really need to deep dive into each one and decide a fair price for the token if you want to ""invest"" in defi.  You can always just ape into something if that's what you want.  Many have governance tokens, some have tokens that earn you interest, some have ways for you to use your tokens to earn more money.

What you can also do other than ""invest"" in defi is just use it.  You can lend eth on a lending platform and earn eth, or you can provide liquidity for btc on a DEX and earn BTC.

You really need to go through the docs of a couple projects to understand what they do.  Once you have a frame of reference, you can say ""oh this one is like X but they do Y"".

Some projects you could do a deep dive on:

UniSwap
SushiSwap
QuickSwap
Bancor
Maker DAO
Compound
Curve

pr0nh0li0,"&gt;as NRV is providing real utility and we need this on Eth

Hmm I would argue we pretty much already do via Curve/Saddle/Uniswap v3 or one of the dozens of other well optimized stable pools on Ethereum.

[Per Nerve's announcement post](https://nervefinance.medium.com/introducing-nerve-finance-the-first-stableswap-amm-on-binance-smart-chain-e9e659cf6dad), it is a modified fork of Saddle, which in of itself was a modified fork of Curve:

&gt;Much of our StableSwap AMM implementation was based on Saddle’s Solidity contracts, which was originally based on Curve’s Vyper contracts. Saddle’s contracts were audited here. This does not mean that our contracts were audited, as they were slightly modified. Exercise caution.

Not to say those modifications can't make a difference, but I'm failing exactly how Nerve would add significantly more value to the quality/low slippage pools we already have. What exactly makes it stand out from some of the other quality stable pools?",2021-08-17 22:02:24
HelpfulDudeWhoHelps,"I’m going to tell you the truth however unpopular it might be. You don’t have enough money to go to market. To get in front of potential customers you need resources. Essentially skills and labor plus a budget for expenses like ad buys. 

You have some choices.

You can hire someone with the skills to do the labor or;
You can learn everything yourself and use your own labor.

Neither of these things can be done with $1,000. The learning curve for digital marketing is steep and takes years to master. (If anyone really masters it at all since it constantly changes). 

Now, there are plenty of people who will take your $1,000 and blow smoke up your ass about how they are going to rock your sales. They will take what they can for as long as they can and they know they won’t be able to move the needle. So they start looking for your replacement right away because it’s just a matter of time before you figure out you are getting screwed. (Called a churn and burn model). 

I’m willing to bet you invested a lot of money on your shop. Planers, sanders, joiners, table saws, clamps, dust collection, compressed air, on and on. 

Let’s do a mind experiment. 

Let’s say you said “I need to rip all this wood so I need a table saw but I only have $500. Would you be able to make that work? A commercial grade table saw costs thousands. You MIGHT be able to find a saw of some kind for your budget but it would be a pile of shit and a few months down the road, you will he right back where you started except $500 lighter in the wallet. (Like hiring that intern to handle social media). 

I’m not saying you can’t bootstrap this but you will need to spend your days on Facebook. You can’t make too many cutting boards if you are on Facebook all day. 

Businesses need capital. For facilities, equipment, management, labor for production, sales and marketing. 

I don’t know why so many people make investments in machinery and inventory and the like but see marketing as an afterthought. 

Until you find some money, you will piss away any budget you might have because you can’t get enough momentum to cross the threshold for ROI. 

Nobody will tell you this because they want your $1000. Think about it. You approach a social media dude and say “I want to do social media and I have $1000”  How many will push back and say “We can do some low level things for you but you likely won’t see an ROI.” And how many will say “Great idea sir! We can absolutely help you with that. Let me write it up and we can start Monday!”

So what to do? 

1. Invest in a marketing plan with someone who knows what they are doing and has a demonstrable track record of success.
2. Set your budget based on the cost of acquisition and lifetime value of your customer (I can help you figure this out in fifteen minutes)
3. Know what and when your break even point is on your marketing spend. And time to ROI.
4. Finance your marketing execution with metrics and milestones and stick with it. 
5. Test and test some more. As you execute and hater data your plan might change

Think of marketing like a giant flywheel. Your wheel is stationary right now. To get it moving will take a lot more energy (resources) now as opposed to when the flywheel has momentum. Then it will require much less energy.

You have it backwards. Your wheel won’t move.

stkw,"I've been trying to figure this out for the past 2 weeks as well. I think the best answer can be found here (though I haven't proved that this works yet): https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5231649-a-guide-to-curve-finance. Below is my breakdown of what it means.

There are two layers on Curve:

1. Depositing your ETH or stETH for crvSTETH.
1. Staking your crvSTETH in Curve Gauge or Yearn Vault.



**1. Depositing your ETH or stETH for crvSTETH.**  

Depositing your ETH or stETH for crvSTETH should give you 50% of your staking rewareds (50% because half of the pool is non-staked ETH and the other half is staked stETH). With APR on Lido being 5% right now, then 50% is 2.5%. 

The part I don't understand for this is how do we get the rewards for this. Normally, your stETH balance will gradually grow as it rebases everyday. In this case, does crvSTETH increase (I don't think so) or does the ETH to crvSTETH ratio change over time (currently at 1 Curve steth LP token = 1.019961 ETH, found here when you deposit: https://curve.fi/steth/deposit)



**2. Staking your crvSTETH in Curve Gauge or Yearn Vault.**  

Curve Gauge and Yearn vault should be similar in that they both require the staking of your crvSTETH. The biggest difference will probably be in fees, which I haven't dug into yet.

Curve Gauge is very straight forward. You'll earn steCRV and LDO. You withdraw the steCRV and LDO and you can do whatever you want with it. Without doing any additional staking, your crvSTETH should stay the same amount.

Yearn is essentially the same thing, except it will automatically trade steCRV and LDO and re-stake it for you and the result is that the amount of your crvSTETH will gradually increase. When you withdraw, you just withdraw a larger amount of crvSTETH.

So in conclusion, if everything is correct, you should make Yearn Vault APY + ~50% of Lido's ETH staking rewards.",2021-08-18 13:14:15

Sometimes car financing is very cheap.

However, that said, I would never finance a car. Home mortgage is fine (within reason) but a car is a risky asset both from a depreciation standpoint and from actual RISK. Someone hits your car and there goes a certain percentage of value you will never get back. Buy in cash, drive until it's bottomed out the depreciation curve and as long as it's viable.",2021-08-18 17:53:12
FX-Macrome,"A rule of thumb I like to stick by is being less than 1% of strategy frequency volume. For example, if I have a strategy trading hourly, my universe is restricted to those assets which have hourly volume of 100 \* my position size.

Only you know the urgency of your positions, e.g. do you mind having orders on the book in between intervals or do you need to be filled near instantly? Over a time horizon? etc. This will determine what execution strategy you use.

Examples for daily turnover might be over the VWAP curve (more traditional finance), DCA orders, iceberg orders (a special option in binance)... everyone here is focussed on finding alpha, but imo thats the easy part. Execution strategies make or breaks a trading strategy and is likely more important. If you come across any books, let me know.

mister_ghost,"So what's the appropriate response to this?

It seems like free money, and I've read here enough to recognize that MMT is a low status belief for losers, and that it doesn't have much acceptance among mainstream economists (i.e. you don't see many 'otherwise normal' economists saying it's a pretty good idea), but I don't have a clear understanding of what exactly is wrong with it. Part of that is down to the fact that it's hard to get a clear sense of what the hell MMT is - the difficulty in pinning it down is captured quite nicely [here](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2019/03/examining-mmt-model-in-detail.html). However if I'm being honest, any counterarguments to MMT that I read mostly go over my head.

&gt; Perhaps MMT is not model-based (""IS-LM with a near-vertical IS curve"") and not idea-based (""Functional Finance"") so that it can be guru-based.

But here we have a pretty accessible video trying to make the case for MMT, and I don't know exactly what the accessible response/debunking would be. My general understanding of the case against MMT is roughly that you can't eat money. Increasing the amount of money you have to spend on stuff doesn't magically make there be more stuff. But I do't know how well that transposes onto this video.

Things I could think of that might be flaws in the video include:

* The situation presented - that there are a bunch of problems and the government doesn't have enough money to fix them - is inaccurate. Either it isn't a plausible situation, or it doesn't represent the current situation well.

* Printing the money to repair a road would somehow not lead to the road being repaired.

* Taxes don't lower inflation, or at least they can't be used to arbitrarily lower the inflation caused by money printing.

* Taxes do lower inflation, but automatically tethering tax levels to inflation wouldn't work for some reason, or there are dramatic side effects to using taxes in this manner.

* There are downsides which are not mentioned in the video.

* The video doesn't actually represent a different way of doing things, it's just a different way of looking at how we currently do things.

So where does the video go off the rails? What is the anti-MMT elevator pitch?",2021-08-19 04:47:36

Right now it's nearly impossible to both be decentralized and follow the regulations required to be directly connected to banks. I think the biggest hurdle is getting people to understand how to use wallets and get funds from fiat into whatever network the apps are on. Once you've done that, a lot of the complexity can be abstracted away behind the scenes with simple interfaces.

I've recently discovered Terra, and the few apps that they have on there seem to be pretty simple and clean. But I don't know how I'd explain to a normie how to get their funds in and out of Terra.

OpeningCultural287,"One place to start could be Angellist's Startup Salary calculator. See if you can find similar roles on there, it's transparent about salary and equity stakes in open startup roles. Easiest way for super early stage is to negotiate for a certain percentage of the company (0.5%, 0.25%, whatever is reasonable).

I worked in Finance at startups and we fielded questions all the time from candidates like what was your latest valuation, how many shares are outstanding, or what was the price per share of your latest round. If you can get figure out the price per share of the latest round, you can apply that same amount to the number of shares they're offering to come up with an implied value of the equity. Then you could also 10x that value but apply a 40% haircut for dilution and say 'if this takes off, this is what my equity could be worth in 8-10 years'

And finally before people jump on me...I know early stage equity is HIGHLY risky. The odds of a huge payoff are incredibly low. But these are some of thought exercises people all over startup land run in their head to assess the risk/reward tradeoff of taking a startup role. Because very few people go to a startup simply because it 'looks fun', most are there because 1) they're passionate about the problem trying to be solved and 2) the risk/reward curve",2021-08-20 03:02:32
Liwet_SJNC,"Whilst technology tends to be fairly winner take all, your own example of phones brings up the pretty obvious point that iOS and Android are currently competing in that space. As for manufacturers, there are... Several. Nokia might be dead, but it is hardly the only company in that space.

As for ETH dying... BTC and USDT are a lot worse than ETH in most ways, and yet are doing fine. First mover in the crypto space is huge. Eth can get by for a long time on just 'being ETH'

On trading... Well first off the S&amp;P is an index, this is more like being in an individual stock. If you're into finance at all you should know that 'diversify' is pretty basic advice.

And secondly, efficient markets random-walk. That's why cats can outperform professionals in picking stock, and why trading is generally just a good way to pay bonus fees. It might move you around on the risk curve a bit, too. But that's usually not a good thing for people who don't know what they're doing.

Crypto is *not* that efficient yet, though. That's why arbitrage is routinely possible in crypto, where it tends to be quite hard to find in the stock market.

I hold SOL, and think it is better tech than ETH currently. I also think expecting a steady rise with no corrections is foolish, and could easily damage the coin long-term.",2021-08-20 08:25:14
glaci0us,"TRADITIONAL STOCK OWNERSHIP BENEFITS  
  
\-Ownership in the company  
  
\-Voting Rights  
  
\-Participation in economic growth and dividends of the company  
  
Fantastic right? Except large institutional players, venture capitalists and high net-worth individuals have advantages through asymmetric information and early access to investments through early stage funding/investing (VC) or taking part in IPOs. This means that transformational levels of returns are reserved only for the wealthy.  
  
WHY OWNING CRYPTOCURRENCY WILL GENERATE SUPERIOR RETURNS FOR MILLENNIALS AND GEN-Z  
  
Millennials and Gen-Z are operating on a 30-40 year investment time horizon and this time horizon allows these groups to be more risk-tolerant. The following outlines how investing in cryptocurrencies combines the best of growth, value and dividend investing to generate superior long term returns.  
  
Cryptographic protocols incentivize the appropriate use-cases by rewarding users with the native currency  
  
\^\^This allows protocols to be bootstrapped from a very small project to $Billions+ in market cap over a 3-10 year period. As of this writing there are 92 crypto currencies with $1B or larger market caps.  
  
\^\^This means protocols have less reliance on VC and early-stage funding  
  
  
  
Critically, less reliance on VC funding creates opportunity for higher returns as smaller investors can get in earlier  
  
\^\^The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency means the number of people with access to and the ability to buy crypto is exponentially larger than your typical purchase of a publicly traded stock which requires access to a broker, KYC (Know-Your-Customer) documentation, and a funded bank account.  
  
\^\^Occasionally protocols will “air-drop” the native currency meaning they will deposit tokens directly into a user’s wallet - typically those users who were early adopters  
  
\^\^\^\^With air-drops like the ones Audius and Uniswap did, there is an even larger incentive to get in at an earlier stage, front-loading the technology adoption curve and expediting the growth of the protocol  
  
  
  
The ability to see on-chain the number of “whale” wallets holding the currency reduces the risk of being dumped on by larger investors – every transaction is viewable on a public blockchain and the largest protocols make their vesting and lockup periods known pre-launch  
  
  
  
Tokens can be staked to earn rewards (interest)  
  
\^\^This simultaneously helps secure the network while generating a return which is often (much) larger than typical stock dividends and significantly larger than bank-offered rates, many of which hover in the .01% - .1% range currently in the US. Dividends are often in the 1.5%-2.5% range.  
  
  
  
Through DeFi (decentralized-finance) protocols, long term holders can earn yields far superior to typical bank-offered yields. The most well-known projects currently offer 5-10% APR’s but for the truly risk-loving it’s easy to find 100-300% APR’s  
  
  
  
\*\*TLDR\*\*  
  
Investing in crypto offers the upside potential similar to investing in seed or pre-seed funding stages while also being able to earn sizeable dividends/interest on investments from day one through staking and Defi. Anyone with a 30-40 year investment horizon, mainly Millennials and Gen-Z, now has better access to this asymmetric return profile through cryptocurrency investing. This paradigm shift opens the doors to transformational wealth creation in the long-run for retail investors.",2021-08-20 09:45:23
icecream_tuesdae,"Ah gotcha, I totally understand!! It really is a major transition, both supporting a CEO for the first time and also moving into the tech industry where the learning curve is steep. 

No doubt you'll do great. I'm willing to bet your background and general knowledge in finance will be super helpful in the accounting part of your job, and the fact you're being asked to do multiple roles tells me he may not need a whole ton of personalized support just yet, which will give you some time to learn about him and what he really needs from you.

Sphener,"I am planning to apply for terminal MS programs in Math/Applied Math. I graduated in Engineering Physics with a minor in Applied Math and am currently working in quantitative finance in a math-heavy role, so I'm fairly certain I can handle the courses in Applied Math. Pure math however I am not so sure. I took an abstract algebra course as part of my minor and really loved it, which is essentially the main reason why I am feeling brave enough to apply to math (non-applied) programs. But I have no background in analysis apart from two months of complex analysis in a physics course, and I'm worried that in such programs I will be far behind the curve if most entrants are from a math undergrad.

Always-_-Late,"Ok a lot of people here will tell you just don’t buy anything or the bare minimum. For me I set goals on what my net worth must be before I buys something “luxurious”. One caveat I’d like to ad to this is most of my luxury purchases arnt clothes or fancy dinners or anything that will instantly deprecate or be worth nothing. Here’s how it went for me

10k net worth - buy my mom a cheap $1,000 ca-r-
50k net worth - $2,000 vacation to Puerto Rico 
100k net worth - first luxury watch (it’s actually increased 30% in value since purchase)-
250k net worth - an affordable sports car sub 30k purchased at or near the bottom of its depreciation curve. My passive income pays 2x the car payment. NOT A NEW CAR-
500k - 5k family vacation -
1mil - new car same deal but under 80k-
5mil - pay off my moms house-
10mil - buy my dream home (under 800k)-
50mil - stop working on my income streams and let the systems I’ve established continue on their own.-

Keep in mind that I love cars and watches, these are both hobbies and I also know enough about both of them that I always purchase at or below market value and don’t finance anything that’s interest rate is higher than inflation and that I can’t pay for in cash. Some people may have a problem with this but I find it extremely motivational and keeps me from making small pointless purchases.

Fwiw using this method in the last 2 years I’ve increased my income from 3,000 gross a month to 20k gross a month, purchased my first rental property and set up an additional stream of income on top of my job and rental to help pay for these goals. Went from a net worth of 5k at 22 years old to 250k in at 24 , blessed my family and myself and have things to show for it, while living well below my means. There’s no point in living if you don’t enjoy the moment. I died and needed to be resuscitated earlier this year and learned that the hard way. But that’s another story.",2021-08-20 14:01:26

rememberdigg2004,"I don’t think you’ll get any arguments from anyone in this sub about new cars not being worthwhile, at least not financially. You are absolutely correct in the vast majority of cases.

It’s not due to VAT, though. It’s just down to depreciation - you lose a load of money in the first few years of new car ownership, and then less money the following years. So buying used you join that curve further down the line and thus “lose less”.

New cars offer massive profits to dealers because there is limited competition. Used cars, however, are in a bigger, more transparent, publicly driven market (autotrader et al) and thus offer reduced profits. As such, finance packages on used cars will be much higher interest rates to try and improve profits for dealers.

It’s not unusual to find 0% finance options on new cars (outside of COVID). An absolute no-brainer if you’re set on buying a new car. Whereas rates of 6.9% or even 8.9% are common on used cars. I have only ever seen 0% on used maybe once or twice prior to COVID from entry-level manufacturers - Ford and Volvo from memory.

CrustyRat,"Liquid staking - have your cake (staking eth and earning eth rewards) and eat it (use it in defi to earn yield normally in other tokens). Bang eth or steth into the eth/steth curve LP and deposit into curve or convex to earn LDO, CRV, CVX, eth and staked eth.

Or perhaps you want to expand exposure to a different chain? Swap steth for bETH on anchor protocol and get paid ANC to take out debt!

decisions4me,"This sort of BS is so demeaning. It’s as if charts and trading is just used by people who look at lines going up and down the screen and think it’s some sort of casino and these people like the idea of a mouse click or two outperforming the work of 5 carpenters. And many traders fail at outperforming  the market long term anyway.  So trading is seen as a silly activity inexperienced stupid and lazy people partake in who don’t know what finance is about or how it effects the world and the economy. Trading is seen as exploitative since it is just about buying something in hopes that someone else will buy it for more, that very day. It’s seen as exploiting large hedge funds that rebalance investments based on actual logic. (Such as medical college applications for healthcare sector seasonality, or aluminum extraction and rubber effecting vehicles, or oil surveying company profits hinting at future oil supply) And many traders might not care at all what their actions do to the world around them, they like clicking their mice to make more money in the span of a few hours than 10 carpenters and farmers combined  over a whole day

The lines MEAN something. It’s a logical statement. It is a statement that as time goes buy, the lowest agreed to price is continuously higher, which signifies increased demand. Or lower. It’s just reflection of either multiple parties or a single party purchasing or selling. It could be based on numerous reasons. But it’s connected with actual resources. It’s connected with increased societal productivity. 

It’s like people forget about the logic underpinning the price of certain assets, and everything is just a line or a curve. It’s ridiculous. Technical analysis without logic is wrong. 

People interested in financial markets need to learn  about investment science, financial mathematics, system conceptual design, system architecting, system modeling, management of complex systems, systems engineering, applied analysis for model based systems engineering, 

People need to understand the anatomy of a dynamic system, and how solution and fitness landscapes work. And agent adaptation and density dependent solution spaces. 

First off, the definition of resources/money.

Money as in contracted, widely-recognized individualized localized symbolized units of quality/value resources backed by (Federal Reserve) confidence in the policy decisions of the federal government to raise the average quality of life.

Money is simply a representation of the recognized resources (in units of value) within society.

Businesses/Companies are institutions that exist primarily to capture value. This is done by acquiring and utilizing resources efficiently to maintain a continuous competitive advantage. This is essentially the practice of activity coordination for resource generation and capture through decision making, Or in other words. Business management is a decision making science related to coordination and resource and value generation and capture.

Ownership (cut into small pieces) of these institutions allows
for votes that provide a right to profits and also choice of leadership. 

finance is about the dedication/delegation/assignment of resources in society to incentivize certain activities towards their most profitable outcomes.

investors participate in a fair, orderly, and efficient market, and facilitate capital market formation.

Projecting lines without logic IS astrology. It’s ridiculous and demanding. 

Rising Demand in certain industries MEANS something, and it’s different if it’s intraday or weekly. 

This post is the equivalent of posting Astrology stuff in astronomy.

It’s not ethical, it’s demeaning, and it’s wrong. And it gives new people a wrong idea of what financial markets are about. 

Rapid re-allocation of resources helps society create more total resources. If Finance as an industry can produce 1% more resources  through efficient resource allocation. every four months, that is 36 times more growth in 80 years than without.

80 years is a long time, but 36X more assets developed is good. 

It’s why the Soviet Union fell. The Soviet Union delegated resources to projects and organizations every ten years. While they could achieve larger projects more quickly than the US, the USSR fell, eventually.

If the resources devoted to organizations and institutions can be rebalanced in half a year due to trends and changes, then that’s an optimization.

People need to stop portraying finance, and retail, as astrology and gambling.",2021-08-22 01:22:31

useless_weirdo,"Source: Early adopted ASC842 at my previous company and going through the adoption at my current company. Both adoptions while the company was private. 

Since you mentioned your company is private. You have two options - 1) pay a third party to develop a synthetic borrowing rate. 2) Use the risk free rate.  See ASC 842-20-30-3

1) This option was used at my previous company. Yes, it was more costly, but the benefit was we got a more accurate yield curve to represent our business. This also produced higher rates than the risk free rates which would help in our lease classification testing (PV of minimum lease payments &gt; or &lt; 90% of FV. Keep in mind there is no longer a bright line for this test but 90% from ASC 840 is still acceptable). Also remember, guidance states the rate is secured by the assets underlying the lease. 
2) using this option at my current company. Reason being - much smaller lease portfolio and made more sense for a company our size. Very easy to implement and no additional cost. Current leases are not at risk of being classified as a finance lease. 

Hope that helps. Surpassingly I found the KMPG guide to ASC842 the most helpful as a implementation guide. EY FRD for technical reference.",2021-08-22 06:19:03

RogerMexico,"US trade with China impacts inflation in two ways: (1) lower consumer goods prices and (2) trade imbalances driving down bond yields.

(1) **Lower Prices:** We all intuitively know that prices at Walmart are so low because almost all of their products are made in China. What consumers don't necessarily see is how much of the economy depends on Chinese goods. Healthcare services depend on Chinese manufactured consumables. Cars made in the US and Europe are dependent upon Chinese made parts that are assembled in western countries for tax reasons but still largely produced in Asia or Mexico. New and renovated homes depend on Chinese-made windows, doors, kitchen appliances, bathroom hardware and more. The list goes on...

(2) **Bond yields:** the US had a $338B trade in goods deficit with China over the past 12 months, the highest over any 12 month period in US history. This ""transitory"" supply-side shock is what has caused the recent spike in prices. However, the thing is that when a Chinese company sells a product in USD, they need to convert it to RMB to pay their workers and finance their capital expenditures and other expenses. When the entire economy is demanding RMB and selling USD, that drives down the cost of the dollar while increasing the cost of the RMB, which is bad for exports. To counteract this, the PBOC has bought US Treasury Bonds to the tune of $1.1T. This has kept long-dated treasury yields low and the yield curve flat. While you might be asking yourself, why don't lower rates mean higher inflation? The reason is because the steepness of the yield curve is what drives inflation as that means that banks are able to borrow at a lower rate and lend at a higher rate. If the yield curve is flat, lending is subdued and the economy doesn't overheat.

So what does this all mean? What this means is that we are entirely co-dependent on China. Any reversal of that dependency will turn what is currently talked about as a ""transitory"" effect to a long-term secular trend. And we have the political class of the US on both sides of the aisles talking about China as if it's Nazi Germany. Really doesn't bode well for our relations with our most crucial trading partner.",2021-08-22 09:23:04

Shatter_Hand,"I've written about this previously at length in threads so will provide a long (but fast reading) synopsis here:


If you know your way around DeFi, then you'll know the closest coins to fiat are stablecoins. The problem with stablecoins however, is that the interest rates attached to borrowing them are huge: 9%-15% is an average range on most platforms. 

This messes up an important dynamic, which is me never having to actually sell my crypto. You see, my crypto is either staked, or providing liquidity. That means I'm earning rewards on it at around let's say 6% APY. But if I borrow against it, the stablecoin APY is let's say 10%. That means I'm paying 4% APY. But what if this dynamic was reversed? Suddenly I'm net positive several points on my loan. That's what you can expect with CBDC's, because their interest rates should mirror the Central Bank rate. And if they don't, then I'll opt for a CBDC with the lowest rate, then swap it for my native currency. Central Bank CBDC's will all be forced to compete with one another. Our rate in the US is 0% currently. One reason we can afford to get away with this more so than other countries is because although the Treasury is printing cash like crazy, we're printing far less than  many other countries including our biggest allies. And not only this, but our currency is the world's reserve currency, and we issue bonds in that same currency. 

*But government's will never plug their CBDC's into decentralized finance,* you might hear people say. They'll have no choice. It's like what happened with Batman earlier this year: NFT's boomed and people started minting and selling their own Batman NFT's. These were selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. DC Comics came out publicly condemning it, but there was nothing they could do, so some of these anonymous indie Batman artists were getting famous and continued raking in fortunes. Finally DC Comics did the only thing they could—join the blockchain. They released their own official NFT collection, captured the Batman market, sold them for a fortune, and the faux Batman NFT prices cratered. Same situation with CBDC's. If governments allow a competing government's currency (like China's digital Yuan) to metastasize and gain trust in a rapidly growing system, there will be trouble. China wouldn't have to call it the ""Digital Yuan"" either, they can call it USDxi or whatever the hell they want, and bundle them together to make 1 USD. 

Then there's the issue of consumer banks. Middle-men. I won't go through the process by which money is loaned into existence to chartered banks and their relationship to the Fed and Treasury, you'll have to learn that yourself. But if the US Treasury is plugging digital dollars directly into DeFi and directly to consumers, what purpose do banks actually serve anymore besides adding a step and transaction cost? None at all. Every retail business, car dealer, and debt collector in the country will have terminals or infrastructure that accepts USD CBDC's. I can also say the same fate awaits Mastercard and Visa. So suddenly there's enormous consolidation. Cashapp, Paypal, etcetera, saw the writing on the wall and realized they had no choice but to get ahead of the curve by integrating crypto into their platforms. Every major retailer is in the process of doing so, even if they don't admit to it. 

The final casualty will be stablecoins themselves, which are overpriced centralized custody solutions.

What's left is us, absorbing the entire financial structure, capturing the margins (profits) that once belonged to banks with our permissionless, censorship resistant, deflationary, hard money. 

This is all a few years out, but those that learn DeFi now, will be in an incredibly advantageous position. I also expect the friction (technical difficulty) of using crypto to halve by then too, which is important, because the only thing holding things back are ignorant people, which is how companies like Western Union, and Moneygram are still breathing, even if barely. 

There's more on volatility, and the flattening confidence curve of crypto globally, liquidity, and what to expect in a deflationary (credit crunch) versus inflationary global economy, but I'm going to call it quits for the night.",2021-08-22 17:59:24

Mengerite,"Great post. I've been holding and researching ALGO for a few months now, but I didn't realize it used that much less power even compared to ADA.

I highly recommend anyone interested in ALGO to listen to this [Lex Fridman episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/168-silvio-micali-cryptocurrency-blockchain-algorand/id1434243584?i=1000513007088) with Silvio Micali. Lex asks the questions that most of us have and Silvio gives great answers.

OP, could you talk a little bit more about how Algorand avoids centralization? Silvio talks about the centralization incentives for miners in PoW, but miners aren't validators. We learned in the block size wars that miners cannot dictate changes to the Bitcoin network. In PoS, tokens are votes. If you hold enough, you could vote to give yourself more tokens ([Yearn example](https://www.coindesk.com/yearn-finance-votes-to-inflate-yfi-token-supply-by-20)). By giving yourself more tokens, you get even more votes.

Silvio states often that he is making a big assumption: that if rich people could acquire a dominant share of the tokens that they wouldn't want to destroy their own value. The gaping hole in this logic is state actors, who could absolutely print fiat -&gt; buy ALGO -&gt; destroy the blockchain. Current ALGO market cap is $3 billion. Even considering the supply curve effect on price, the US could easily do this. As the market gap grows, this will admittedly become harder, but printing money is easy enough.

This is my last main concern (and I have it for all PoS chains including ETH 2.0).",2021-08-23 20:29:37

WeAllDeserveKindness,"I'm not qualified to give financial advice, so this isn't that.

You could put the majority of it into a stable pool, which can get you up to ~20% annually if you're willing to use Polygon. If you put 80-85% into that pool, (assuming Polygon doesn't collapse and Beefy doesn't rug,) you've earned back the principal in about a year. That frees up 15-20% for more riskier assets with potential to appreciate faster than USD; I would consider an automated blended strategy eg one of the ETF-like offerings that have come out recently including the [Future of Finance Fund](https://ndxfi.medium.com/are-you-a-futurist-cbd8d2fd5424), [BED Index](https://www.indexcoop.com/bed), or [Balanced Crypto Pie](https://medium.com/piedao/announcing-balanced-crypto-pie-bcp-btc-eth-and-defi-7a2423c5d94e). All of these options are 33% BTC and 33% ETH, with the last 33% allocated to a curated DeFi basket. Curve also has a tricrypto pool with USD as the last 33%, but you have a ton of USD exposure already.

You could also just buy ETH. Less options for yield, but in many people's eyes this is the safest play. Maybe consider some Uniswap v3 positions at multiple ranges to lock in USD profits (eg ETH-USDC at 3500-4000, 4000-4500, etc), but you'd have to track prices closely enough to exit those positions before volatility comes knocking. I would generally avoid pairing USD with crypto in unbounded liquidity pools (Uni v3 is not unbounded).

Numinae,"&gt;Does it matter? the fact is that there was no observable change. But the simple reason is that men and women did not compete much. The only real shift was a massive uptick in childcare, a female dominated profession. And other new positions being created for them.

ORLY? Women didn't just suddenly enter the labor force all at once - or integrate smoothly as many were skeptical a woman could do X job, it was a trickle that slowly eroded PP then it basically became a requirement for a household for both to work. Economics has a lag effect since the economy has ""inertia"" and people shuffle in and out. It can take *years* for a single effect to truly manifest. Also, the effect can be seen in just about every country where women's lib happened.

&amp;#x200B;

The side of the Supply and Demand equation you aren't seeing is that Women were ALREADY creating demand. They just weren't directly paying for goods but buying them using money their husband earned. As in, joint assets. So, demand for existing services and goods was basically the same. Obviously their freedom in purchasing decisions changed *what* they bought but their income but the amount of demand for ""All Stuff"" stayed the same. It existed before and didn't increase proportional to the increase in labor on the market. Therefore, demand stayed the same on a macro level for Goods but supply for labor producing those goods doubled. Simple supply and demand graph. The curve shifted. You're thinking about this like immigrants who add to the labor pool but also bring new demand that didn;t exist before. However, women were already here, already buying stuff. They didn't bring new demand. Maybe different demand but not new demand so, other than a shift in where those purchase were allocated, the total stayed static.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another way to view the issue since you seem to have a problem grasping the concept. As women started entering the workforce while their husbands continued to earn money, they had much more spending money. The first overs got double the money but as more and more women started adding to the household income, eventually it became the norm. That means that EVERYONE started having double the money with the same production (this is a simplified view as technology changes productivity and other factors but, consider this an ""all things being equal and model the people as perfect sphere's with no air drag"" sort of thing). As always happens when everyone suddenly has double the item, it's value decreased; in this case, it's the value of the money and we got inflation. Obviously there was OPEC and other things happening during that time but inflation kicked in right around that time, even in countries where they weren't as dependent on petroleum. This manifested as wages not halving in number but inflation eroding the value of money faster than wages grew. Hence the lag in effect. Not to mention that it takes time for markets to re-price.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Union jobs used to be much more common and in fact represented a majority of total wages. Which is not surprising as they tended to pay more.

Most *jobs* in the US come from small to medium sized businesses. Most *taxes* come from big businesses At least they did until the goverment forced them to close while their big box competitors and Amazon were allowed to stay open so, we don't know the fallout yet but I've seen estimates ranging from 30%-60% of forcefully closed businesses not reopening. We're also seeing what happens when you pump in shit tons of extra money into the economy right now but the effects haven't even begun to manifest fully yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;our broke ass cannot afford a car either. You can just barely buy a beater once in a while.And most middle class people are living paycheck to paycheck, they cannot divert a significant fraction of their income towards buying a beater two rent periods away.

Lol, OK Zoomer. I don't know where you got the idea I by fucking jalopies; I was saying that for a teenager with an iota of motivation and ability, self respect and desire for independence, it's not hard to get a car. I love how you have to think I'm a broke ass loser like you to feel validated. Money is a means to an ends, not an ends in itself to anyone but a miser. That being said, Benz's are overpriced pieces of shit. Unless you want to spend $1k changing the oil. GMC luxury cars are nice though, as are heavy trucks but those are more for work. They're convenient as shit here though and I've had to fix a bunch of cars since I seem to drive trucks most of the time. Time to switch I think.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And most middle class people are living paycheck to paycheck, they cannot divert a significant fraction of their income towards buying a beater two rent periods away.

Then they're not middle class; they're people who have poor financial skills, keeping up with the Jones's, lack the ability to delay gratification or have had some horrible stroke of bad luck. My point wasn't ""oh, just buy a fucking car with money you don't have!"" it was ""Get a job, save your money, don't spend it on frivolous shit and within a relatively short period of time, you can afford at least a functional, if old car."" That means don't buy a fucking $1500 iPhone every time a new one comes out with a different color (better, don't buy apple shit at all) and for the love of god, don't finance it at usurious interest rates! Or a new PlayStation or *whatever* instant gratification trap tickles your vices. Better, start saving in anticipation of getting a car before you can get a license.

&gt;Land and property are tied to generational wealth. Once you have it that is that until you die. The issue is that while these things used to be passed down paternally they are now being hoarded because one generation got unreasonably lucky with having so many historical precedents broken during their childhoods. And now they are just not dying because of healthcare.

Well, sorry you can't wait for your parents to die to get their loot... I guess? God you're fucked up. Probably a commie too given your bullshit rationalizations on how hard work sucks, saving money up sucks, not having it dropped n your lap sucks, etc. This shitty attitude is pervasive amongst Millenials and Zoomers (shamed though I am to be one). Don't worry though, I'm sure someone will ""recognize"" you ""worth"" and make you the CEO of a company you played no part in building! Any day now! Just a matter of time! /s XDXDXD You know, god forbid you pull together what funds you can, save some if you have to and buy a fucking lawnmower or other basic tools, start ""debasing yourself"" with work you can get with that tool, invest your earnings and roll it into a small business and hire and expand as you can. Hell, you can Unionize your employees! I'm sure once you actually are in that position, you'll view them positively....

&gt;Nobody has made new land of source, save for China. But land can become newly available, valuable or developed and young people have been priced out of all of that.

Dude, the point is that the Earth is a finite resource but people are not. Land will only get scarcer. Do what the Boomers you like to blame all your (totally not behaviorally / work ethic derived) problems on did. Buy cheap land at the periphery of a growth zone and wait for growth in the area to reach it. Then you have equity. You can use leverage to develop the property and live there so instead of paying rent you get it as equity or use a *reasonable* loan to develop it and rent it yourself. You think things ho like Step1: Do nothing. Step 2: ???? Step 3: Profit. IRL there are A LOT of bullshit steps between where you are now and a goal. The problem is envious outsiders only see the fruits of labor without seeing all the work and bullshit it took to get there.

LoveLightLibations,"It's not design to convert automatically back to ETH. It literally can't because bETH, at it's core, is really just Staked ETH (stETH) from Lido Finance. Staking ETH, at present, is a one-way street. Once staked, it cannot be unstaked. 

However, because bETH is basically wrapped stETH, you can take advantage for the major benefit of Lido Finance. You can swap bETH back to stETH. At that point, you'll start to collect the staking rewards again. If you don't want staked ETH, you can then swap it back to ETH via Curve finance. Lido Finance is what makes it possible to ""unstake"" ETH via swaps. I suppose you've already figured this out though. 

Honestly, I'm really sorry to hear that you've had a bad experience with the platform. However, I feel as though your complaints are largely self-inflicted. You moved money in without understanding the total costs involved. Once in, you didn't leave your money in long enough to cover your costs. Now that you're out, it's clear you didn't understand the architecture of the system. 

Frankly speaking - it's a good system. Let's say you wanted to do the same thing via AAVE. On AAVE, you deposit ETH and earn 0.42%. You then borrow USDC against the ETH and pay 3.7%. Finally, you deposit the USDC you borrowed and earn 4.87%. You'd net 1.59% on top of your long ETH position. If you did the exact same thing via Anchor on Terra, **you'd net 30.36% plus you're still long on ETH**.",2021-08-24 22:28:07
RollyPollyGiraffe,"&gt;That’s fine as long as the class is curved at the end.

This individual does not curve.  


Even then, the expectation should be communicated upfront as it helps set the appropriate frame of reference for the assessment in question. For example, with your finance prof, I think that's fine since I imagine the following is true:  


1) They identified the exam was for Wharton MBAs, as you state  
2) They identified the intent to curve upfront, I assume  


At that point, the exam is a measure of, ""How well do you stack up to Wharton MBAs?"" which is a different headspace and assessment goal than just, ""Did you meet the necessary learning outcomes for this class?""",2021-08-25 03:20:09
FlatRateForms,"There is one thing I know my friend and it's 'what I know'.... and I understand finance. I'm not talking down to you, but I get tired of giving  a well formed, educated opinion about something that I've lived through more than once, only to get downvoted and told I'm a shill. THEN, I  have someone ask me privately or down the comment chain 'what I think'. 

I am 40 actually (good random guess) and started trading before the .COM bubble when I wasn't old enough to open the account (JTROS account at Ameritrade)... then survived  9/11, then the housing market collapse (that's what I did for a living). I adapted and made money because I was smart enough to look ahead and see what the picture looked like based on the limited pieces I had. Its what I do. Every business I am in stems from me thinking 'where can I fill a need that isn't a need yet' and get ahead of the curve. This is no different.

Ive said for months... and will continue to say until this issue is dead that the federal government will not and cannot let this stock squeeze to $500k. Why? It would cripple every other market and index on the planet. Trillions in lost retirement funds would cause millions of families to suffer... all because some guy named DeepFuckingValue convinced a bunch of Reddit guys this would squeeze and they think they're owed their dues. 

They're not. 

This is a gamble. If you bought at $8.01, you could have sold and made 800%  profit in a few months... that's INSANE! Dont be greedy. Some of us actually sold in June and made a bunch and then bought back in later knowing what was going to happen... and while I hate to even assume what's gong on today will continue... it very well could and I very well would be made right a second time. 

What really bothers me is the sheer number of Redditors that have their lives mapped out based on $500k a share... people have quit their jobs, starting interviewing bankers... you understand how much this is going to suck for them when they can't retire because Reddit mismanaged expectations? It'll suck. Bad. Dont know what else to say man.

In closing let me reiterate... 

The technical aspects required are there for this to squeeze. For 100%. I just dont think the Fed will let it happen and that this will peak less than $1500 but over $500.",2021-08-25 04:21:29

“... Through $180 million liquidity mining incentives, the platform aims to attract projects like SushiSwap to build on their blockchain network.

The smart contracts platform timed the re-release of its bridge for transferring Ethereum ERC-20 tokens to Avalanche ahead of the announcement of mining incentives.

The $600 million DeFi hack on Poly Network and the recent rug pull by the Luna Yield team on the Solana network have negatively impacted user's confidence in liquidity mining pools and DeFi projects. The re-release addresses this issue with enhanced security. 

The latest addition to Avalanche's Rush program, SushiSwap, allows the Avalanche foundation and the project to allocate nearly $7.5 million worth of AVAX and SUSHI tokens to the mining incentives over the next 90 days. 

Interestingly, liquidity mining incentives have become critical when DeFi users have lost funds to rug pulls. Committing their assets to a protocol's liquidity mining pool and earning a reward in return is likely to attract new users to Avalanche.”",2021-08-25 14:41:11

ok_i_am_that_guy,"In a zero-sum game, no matter how much you educate people, there will always be people loosing money.  


For the government, more people being allowed to trade, by lower entry barrier, would mean more STT and other taxes. And yet, there are those doors, that are kept to stop people from trading.  


No one can know if someone can make money or not. But one thing is clear that someone not having enough capital to take deliveries, will most probably be in bad shape, if they loose even a few bets.  


There's a reason why very few long/medium term investors ever jump from the edge of a building, while a lot of traders do.  


There can be exceptions (people with exceptional knowledge and experience, but not much capital), but in general, entry barriers are good at stopping the people who typically fall in the first stage of the dunning-cruger curve.  


I have seen people of my age (25-30) jumping at option/future trading the moment they have enough money to pay for the margin (this was 4-5 years ago, when margins were even lesser). They used to loose badly, and later used to complain that their broker cheated by squaring off their positions (due to lack of margin). Most of these people had just seen some YouTube videos possibly with titles ""Strategy to make fixed monthly income from stock market"" (aka. Options selling)

No one should be trading with all their money, because it's dangerous. We can argue about their right to choice, but then what about drugs? When any government or social institution sees people making really bad choices, they have to add some entry barriers. So that people don't do it in a hurry. Specially, and most importantly, people who don't really have a lot of money. (I know this is a grey area, and it's constantly misused in many other areas)  


And obviously, there are so many places where I hate it as well. I am not allowed to invest in Indian pre-IPO via platforms like Equityzen, unless I am an HNI (or the entry was even higher than HNI limit, not sure). I wanted to invest in so many companies - Zomato, Ola, PayTm, etc, but I couldn't. And the opportunity costs are huge. I find it unfair as well. I have decent (not a lot) knowledge of businesses, and I have a well diversified portfolio. And I was certainly not going to put all my life's savings in a high-risk, illiquid asset. They also had a provision for ""accredited investors"". But I couldn't make into that being a software engineer, no matter my personal investment experience. (had been managing my relative's tiny MF portfolios, even before getting my own first salary. I know, not much to brag about, it was mostly because ""I was good with computers"", and things had started to move online. :D )  


But then, it's also true that if it's allowed, a lot of people will be selling these to unsuspecting people, without telling them the risks &amp; illiquid nature of these instruments. It can happen to an HNI as well, but with few exceptions:  
1. An HNI would generally have a better understanding of finance, or will already have access to CA, CFA, accountants, handling their money.

2. Even if they end up getting their money stuck, they are more probable to have more money, or other income sources, with which they can continue their lives, feed/educate/marry their sons/daughters, and other things. Same can't be said for a primary school teacher, or some other person who ends up putting a lot of money into such investments.

One of my juniors, in a previous job had invested around $1000 dollars in a US-based pre-IPO platform with $100 minimum ticket size, not knowing how illiquid they are. He spent these $1000 (around Rs. 1.5 L ?) out of his total savings of 2 lacs. He happened to have a small emergency later, and we had to jump in to help him. That's when he told all this.  


In an ideal world, everyone would be capable to take sound decisions, and being a strong supporter of individual freedom, it pains me to say this, but it's better to keep people with lesser investible money away from such high risk games.",2021-08-26 23:10:02
Anastariea,"tl;dr the first year is since it's really easy, other years specially 3rd and 4th will fuck you.

Then there's the new SU head who barely managed to secure any decent one. iirc we only had two before the Uni closed due to covid. 

Or at least that's what the SU representatives told me, I don't particularly care

Anyway, the first year in Uni (prep) is easy, so you would have time to party (if there is still parties kek)  and enjoy your time while still getting high grades, sort of the same for the 2nd year (or first after prep)  too though you will have to put a solid amount of effort, just not the ""no social life for high grades"" type.

Then comes the real assholes, year 3 and 4 (2nd and 3rd after prep) where you pick a specialization/major in year 3 and oh boy, the same effort that got you an A in 2nd year will get you a C in third, specially in a major like Finance and accounting.

FlacidPasta,"Unpopular fact:

The ONRRP was never used as collateral for short positions. The primary participants are mostly Money Market Mutual Funds that banks use to get a 5 basis point return on cash sweep accounts. The Fed TGA $1Tn transfer in March aligns perfectly with the sudden spike in ONRRP activity. The banks don't want this excess cash liability so they send it back to the Fed in a riskless overnight swap for placeholder collateral.

This relieves the pressure on the short end of the yield curve, eliminates the liability in the bank's deposits, allows the Fed to pay themselves 5 basis points to supplant the already excessive liquidity risk-free overnight, and puts a hard floor on the Fed policy rate (0% - 0.25%), otherwise known as the effective Fed Funds Rate.

The filing above does not mention ""REVERSE repo"" anywhere. GCF (General Collateral Financing) repo is the repackaging of general collateral (unknown types of both corporate and government bonds of unknown maturities) lent out for CASH. The ONRRP is specifically 3-month Treasury Bills lent out to MMMFs with a strict 60 day weighted-average maturity (WAM) for COLLATERAL. These two are NOT the same. In fact, they're essentially POLAR OPPOSITES.

This is the biggest piece of misinformation floating around across all social media that refuses to get rectified and makes us all look bad.

SpicyGoop,"I know what you’re saying but think of like Loki. I’m thinking more godlike than Godlike you see?

After a certain amount of time your physical perfection would allow you to mold the world around you as you please, through finance, persuasion, or political gain, whatever. There is little any mortal human could do to stop you, and that at least puts you into minor god range. 

I feel that the “far outside the capabilities” bit is also satisfied by the immortality. Being able to accumulate the totality of all the information around you and make the optimal choice for a desired outcome. Surely, with infinite lifetimes you could figure out how to extend your life artificially. Once that happens it becomes an exponential curve of gathering information, and increased gathering time. You are also now introducing more information as you push further into the future, allowing you to bring more and more advanced technology backwards. 

The longer you live, the more time you have to figure out how to live longer. I am sorry about that sentence. 

Sure, it takes a really really really long time, but it makes you conditionally omnipotent within a small area. 

I mean shit there are some gods that live forever but they don’t have any powers and they just tell stories.

Began IT from scratch by reading 3 books in a small bedroom for three months.  Enjoyed a 20 year career at the cutting edge of IT, got married, raised a family and (whilst I still have a mortgage) have a lovely home in London.

Lost my job the day lockdown began and now I’m almost bankrupt.

So, again, retraining in cutting edge tech stuff with online courses building on my experience and started a new company with people I’ve met in the business.

Life is tough kiddo but if you want to succeed then they key is being motivated, hardworking and fearlessly determined in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

That way you can achieve far more than you ever expected and if it doesn’t work out first time, change, adapt and keep going.

Nothing ever happened by doing nothing. Life will always throw curve-balls (excuse the Americanism).

If you want it - go get it.

When you pass,  DM me if you’re not too busy smiling and reviewing a pile of job offers.  If I make and you do then I’d be interested to see if we can work together.

Best of luck to you but go make your own.

If you want a screen that shows things how they were intended to be viewed you need to put in extra work. Most people don't put in that work and don't know. So everything that's properly set up looks ""flat"".

If you were to tell people that how they view something is ""wrong"" they get mad that you tell them what they should be doing, even though they've been subconsciously taught the ""wrong"" way is right. The difference is simply that one was done without them noticing.

The reason is simple: TVs in big stores were sold under bright artificial lighting and big stores unpack the TV and just leave as is. If your TV is brighter and more colourful people deem it as having a better picture and it gets sold.

marco-sharko,"I imagine it's a perfect storm of increased demand and decreased supply. This will inevitably move the price point upwards along the demand curve. Most comments seem to think its all about semi conductor shortages, but I think its about much more that that. 

**Relevant factors;**

1. **Fewer people qualifying for credit on new cars:** 93.3% of new cars bought privately are purchased on finance ([https://www.fla.org.uk/research/motor-finance/](https://www.fla.org.uk/research/motor-finance/)). A lot of people went on furlough in recent years, or had income reductions / loss of earnings due to the pandemic. A high percentage of people with previous car loans have missed payments or had some form of forbearance on their loan payments. Lenders vary their criteria, but many will not treat furlough payments as income (will see them as benefits) and will see missed payments on previous loans as a red flag. This means that fewer people will now qualify for finance for a new car. If you really need a replacement car, this means a large percentage of those people that would ordinarily buy a new car on finance will now have to enter the market for second hand cars, which will drive up demand and hence prices.
2. **Production problems crimping supply:** the chip shortages are well known and publicised, but there are other reasons why producers have had to scale back their numbers. Labour shortages or shift curtailments due to the pandemic are one serious problem that led to reductions in output. Even with full staff on a shift, social distancing and other measures creates huge inefficiencies that mean lower output. Factories were especially hard hit by labour shortages due to notifications. The lower salary of factory workers also makes the limits of furlough (salary cap at £2.5k per month) more attractive, compared to bankers (for example). 
3. **Decreased demand for new cars:** Related to point 1, if there are fewer qualifying buyers for new cars, there is less demand for new cars, so car makers will scale back output by cancelling overtime. 
4. **Recent history in UK was a glut of second hand cars:** We may not have realised it but in the last 10 years, the price of second hand cars was unusually low. The reason for this was the strong growth in consumer credit for new cars at very low interest rates. This created a market where many customer that would normally buy second hand cars realised that they could get a new car for about £250 a month, so they went with new instead of second hand. This had a double impact: it meant that there were fewer buyers for 2nd hand cars (because a higher percentage than usual opted for new) AND it meant that there was a higher than usual number of 36 month old lease disposals hitting the second hand market. 
5. **Reduction in the supply of lease disposals:** related to the point above, the reduction in output of new cars means a reduction of cars coming into the 2nd hand market. The pipeline is crimped. It's not just the 36 month old lease disposals, there is also a significant 'nearly new' 2nd hand market, at less than 12 months old. 
6. **Reduction in the supply of 2nd hand from the rental sector:**  traditionally a busy route for auto makers to launder excess stock into the 2nd hand market, nearly new rental cars (esp from the volume makers like Ford) often ended up in the 2nd hand market at between 6-18 months old. In the past, these cars would sell at really discounted rates, typically 40% off retail at only 12 months old. Most people would not know that they were buying ex rentals, as the only listed owner would be a finance company, so they are indistinguishable from business cars.  The pandemic basically put a stop to travel, so the usual quote of ex-rentals is not hitting the market, which further pushes up prices. 
7. **Reduction in demand from fleets:** many businesses that were frequent buyers of lease cars for their staff simply stopped leasing during the pandemic as they looked to cut costs that were not necessary. No in person meetings means no need for travel, so no need to lease cars. Once they're not leasing, this means that there is less disposal into the 2nd hand market, less supply means higher prices.",2021-08-27 18:32:34
ha1t_i_am_reptar,"So I was guilty of this a few weeks back. I chalked it up to a learning curve for me, and I took down a post that was considered easily answerable.

C-Jen,"Thanks, I've also lived a decade in the UK and now I'm back in the US.

I was part of a US based business that handled travel, so I made contact with clients in China and helped them out in their own language.

If you do decide to reside in China, you'll need to be pragmatic. First, I wouldn't go while COVID is still a travel issue - you'll need to quarantine at the port of entry, and then even if travel within China, you'll need to quarantine again after each leg.

Once you are able to go to China, make sure you understand what your visa category rules and requirements are. I'd recommend that you take a shorter trip first to become familiar with different areas (if you're talking metropolises, then there's generally Beijing and the northeast as a certain way of life, then Shanghai and the Yangzi cities as another way, then inland metropolises like Chengdu, Chongqing, maybe Xi'An further north, and then Guangzhou/Shenzhen/Zhuhai as the Pearl River three cities.

If you don't speak the language, you'll be at a big disadvantage, so you'll need to either plan to travel with somebody who does, or you can take language classes before you go (probably making use of pandemic time).

China's banking and finance systems are not fully integrated with the developed world's, so you wouldn't necessarily be able to just pack a Visa/Mastercard and expect to be able to pay for everything. Check with your local country's banks to see if they have banking treaties with any of China's main banks (Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China, China Communications Bank) and whether you can easily convert your home currency into Chinese currency.

Set up a VPN so that you can access foreign websites outside of the Chinese system ahead of time. Once you get inside the Chinese internet ecosystem, it's hard to get out without one. You'll need to familiarize yourself with the native Chinese apps that replace standard Android/iPhone apps, like Baidu for search and mapping, Didi for Uber, Dazhongdianpin for Yelp like reviews, and so forth.

If you just want to play tourist and don't need to work to support yourself over a long time, then that may be enough. To actually reside there and work there, you really should not even consider this unless you have the backing of a foreign company to help you.

The foreign company can negotiate on your behalf for whatever contract or transactional disputes come up (and the Chinese professional markets tend to be quite cutthroat, so you will encounter people trying to make a fast buck off of your unfamiliarity). In most cities, if you start to live in a non-hotel lodging, you will be expected to notify the local urban officials so they can log your place of residence. (Chinese citizens themselves are subject to a per-city *hukou* residence system which determines their medical, academic, and employment authorizations.)

Be prepared for air quality and water quality that is lower than developed nations (understandably since China is still a developing nation) and a steep learning curve for things like public transport, local groceries, and places to shop for domestic things.

I myself was well compensated for my work there, as my company recognized that I was doing a lot of hard work far from my permanent home. I was also living and working with my fiancee, so I had somebody who loved me and cared about my well being (as well as insulating me against some of the more predatory types of local relationships that you sometimes hear about expats getting drawn into). I do speak and read Chinese, but not fluently (though well enough to negotiate in my field of specialty). I was able to meet with family inside China and back in the US, but it was a tricky balance. I would come back to US friends who had progressed out of their usual social circles and relationships when I'd left them.

Work was hard - since the downside of being sent over by a western organization meant that I was expected to be available to talk with the leadership at odd hours due to the time difference. 

If I were offered another opportunity to go, I would probably take it - but I would again need proper logistical and organizational support. About eight years ago I almost went over, trying to build contacts my own way (""with a briefcase and my business cards and nothing else"") but I have no idea how that would have turned out. I might have been able to use the local cities' US Chambers of Commerce to build my trade networks, but I could just as easily have been scammed, cheated, or wasted my entire time fruitlessly seeking a profitable venture. There are numerous stories even on Reddit of expats who went to China with one particular idea in mind, and found that the reality was a significant drop from expectations, and they're bitter and angry and used up by it all.

China's not a land of open riches and easy opportunity. It's already supporting a massive population and competition among fellow Chinese is cutthroat even as they start their education. If you're going in search of adventure, make sure you define what sort of time frame you're going to be there, and make sure to have an exit strategy.

That being said, the best trips I've ever taken have been inside China. And from about 2016 to 2018 I did a number of trips (Hainan/Sanya, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Xi'An, and that's not counting cities I visited for business meetings) that I still get misty over when I view the photos.

Final note: China is not a nation of immigrants, and its system is not set up with the same regard for welcoming outsiders that you might see in the Americas or parts of Europe, so you'll need to be willing to potentially be seen as an outsider for the duration of your stay there. If you're smart about it, you can find a niche as ""here's a foreign expert"" or ""here's a foreign traveler having the time of his life"", but it will take effort and some time of adjustment.

My first weekend in China involved several speaking engagements and schedule changes, as well as some high-pressure negotiations back and forth. I look Chinese and I can speak it, but by Sunday evening, I was thoroughly culture shocked and disoriented, and on the verge of tears - even in the comfortable luxury of my international hotel room. I suspect I would not have survived without the grounding presence of my fiancee with me.",2021-08-28 04:35:30
ErnestMorrow,"Some other amazing stuff in that book:

(from the introduction)

My heresy is a different, fractal kind of
statistical relationship, a “long memory.” This is a
delicate point to which a full chapter will be
devoted later. For the moment, think about it by
observing that different kinds of price series
exhibit different degrees of memory. Some exhibit
strong memory. Others have weak memory. Why
this should be is not certain; but one can speculate. What a company does today—a merger, a spin-off,
a critical product launch—shapes what the
company will look like a decade hence; in the
same way, its stock-price movements today will
influence movements tomorrow.

Others suggest that the market may take a long time to absorb and
fully price information. When confronted by bad
news, some quick-triggered investors react
immediately while others, with different financial
goals and longer time-horizons, may not react for
another month or year. Whatever the explanation,
we can confirm the phenomenon exists—and it
contradicts the random-walk model.
Second, contrary to orthodoxy, price changes
are very far from following the bell curve. If they
did, you should be able to run any market’s price
records through a computer, analyze the changes,
and watch them fall into the approximate
“normality” assumed by Bachelier’s random walk.
They should cluster about the mean, or average, of
no change. In fact, the bell curve fits reality very
poorly. From 1916 to 2003, the daily index
movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
do not spread out on graph paper like a simple bell
curve. The far edges flare too high: too many big
changes. Theory suggests that over that time, there
should be fifty-eight days when the Dow moved
more than 3.4 percent; in fact, there were 1,001. Theory predicts six days of index swings beyond
4.5 percent; in fact, there were 366. And index
swings of more than 7 percent should come once
every 300,000 years; in fact, the twentieth century
saw forty-eight such days. Truly, a calamitous era
that insists on flaunting all predictions. Or,
perhaps, our assumptions are wrong. 

**Rule V. Market time is relative.** 


There is what one may call a relativity of time
in financial markets. Early on, but mostly when
developing the multifractal model, I came to think
of markets as operating on their own “trading
time”—quite distinct from the linear “clock time”
in which we normally think. This trading time
speeds up the clock in periods of high volatility,
and slows it down in periods of stability.
Mathematically, I can write an equation showing
how one time frame relates to the other and use it
to generate the same kind of jagged price series
that we observe in real life. This is how the
successful forgery shown among the previous
charts was made. It is almost as if dealing rooms
need, besides the standard row of wallclocks
showing the time in Tokyo, London, and New
York, a fourth clock showing “Greenwich Market
Time.”

This last point highlights an important subtext of
this book: Market professionals know far more
than they even realize. Professional traders often
speak of a “fast” market or a “slow” one,
depending on how they judge the volatility at that
moment. They would quickly recognize, and
affirm, the concept of trading time. Likewise, a bit
of market folk-wisdom holds that all charts look
alike: Without the identifying legends, one cannot
tell if a price chart covers eighteen minutes,
eighteen months, or eighteen years. This will be
expressed by saying that markets scale. Even the
financial press scales: There are annual reviews,
quarterly bulletins, monthly newsletters, weekly
magazines, daily newspapers, and tick-by-tick
electronic newswires and Internet services.
Market folklore and anecdote, of course, cannot
confirm the multifractal model; only rigorous
statistical analysis can do that. But the folklore
does signal that the model is on the right track.

The multifractal model also has many
implications for practical finance. As indicated,
portfolio theory needs rethinking; options need revaluing; trading strategies need review. A small
example: “stop-loss” orders are imperfect, to put it
mildly. Many investors or traders leave
instructions to close a position when a price hits a
particular target. But as many have learned to their
grief, when prices are really flying, they typically
whiz past the target so fast that even the most
attentive broker cannot execute the “sell” orders
fast enough. Result: Greater losses, or smaller
profit, than the investor intended. Another
example: the mathematics of this model offers
some potentially new yardsticks to measure
volatility and risk. Instead of the standard
deviations and “betas” of conventional finance,
one can imagine new scales based on two new
variables to be described later in this book: the H
exponent of price dependence, and the α parameter
characterizing volatility. A few fund managers
have experimented with these concepts. They often
call it chaos theory—though strictly speaking, that
is marketing language riding on the coattails of a
popular scientific trend. In reality, the mathematics
is still young, the research barely begun, and reliable applications still distant.

So caveat emptor: This book will not make you
rich. Bookseller: Do not put it on the same shelf
with the “How to Make a Million in the Market”
volumes. If it fits any genre, it is that of popular
science. It explains a new, and important, way of
looking at the world—in this case, the financial
world. It attempts to do so using common English,
with as few formulae and as little mathematical
jargon as possible—or at least, with no jargon
unexplained. That is because I aim to stimulate
broader debate about financial-market modeling. It
is a debate that has, hitherto, been confined to the
rarefied circles of economics-minded
mathematicians, or of mathematically inclined
economists. The underlying mathematics is,
frankly, forbidding—the primary reason why,
when I first began publishing in the 1960s and
1970s, few mainstream economists were inclined
to listen. But the extraordinary tumult and noise of
this fin de siècle market turmoil are opening the
ears of many who previously affected deafness.

Research in this field has far to go. It took more than sixty years after Bachelier’s thesis for
economists to formulate properly the Efficient
Market Hypothesis, and another decade beyond
that for their work to find valuable applications in
the real world of zerocoupons and call options. With fractals, we are only a few short decades
from the origin. But they already illumine some
profound truths of finance and economics. Chief
among these is the paramount importance of risk. We have been mis-measuring risk.
Greater knowledge of a danger permits greater
safety. For centuries, shipbuilders have put care
into the design of their hulls and sails. They know
that, in most cases, the sea is moderate. But they
also know that typhoons arise and hurricanes
happen. They design not just for the 95 percent of
sailing days when the weather is clement, but also
for the other 5 percent, when storms blow and their
skill is tested. The financiers and investors of the
world are, at the moment, like mariners who heed
no weather warnings. This book is such a warning.",2021-08-28 08:57:36
ErnestMorrow,"**But Does It Work?**

Such is the weight of evidence against the
assumptions in the standard model that it is no longer reasonable to ignore entirely. Indeed, forty
years after I started a battle on the subject, most
economists now acknowledge that prices do not
follow the bell curve, and do not move
independently. But for many, after acknowledging
those points, their next comment is: So what?
Independence and normality are, they argue, just
assumptions that help simplify the math of modern
financial theory. What matters are the results. Do
the standard models correctly predict how the
market behaves overall? Can an investor use
Modern Portfolio Theory to build a safe,
profitable investment strategy? Will the Capital
Asset Pricing Model help a financial analyst, or a
corporate finance officer, make the right decision?
If so, then stop arguing about it. This is the so-
called positivist argument, first advanced by
University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman.

Alas, by that measure, too, the standard tools of
financial theory often fail. Economics is a faddish
discipline. In the 1970s, when the CAPM and
Black-Scholes ideas were spreading, the way to
get ahead in economics was to find evidence that they were right. So, evidence was found and
dissent ignored. But in the 1980s, a correction set
in that has continued to this day. Young economists
see Sharpe and his generation as old boys, to be
challenged. Bit by bit, new evidence has been
emerging in academic journals and Wall Street
newsletters that reality is more complicated than
the old-style religion allows.

Recall that, under CAPM, the return an investor
should expect to receive from a stock is just the T-
bill rate, plus some proportion of the stock-
market’s overall performance; that proportion is
the crucial “beta” value, which varies from stock
to stock. Under the orthodox theory, nothing else
should be going on. No need to study the
fundamentals of the company in question. No need
to pump friends on the company’s board for inside
information. Just calculate the beta, check the T-
bill rate in the newspaper, and make a broad
economic forecast about how the stock market
overall will do. End of story.

In fact, the story is a lot longer than that. A string
of what economists euphemistically call “anomalies” have been found—effects that do not
fit or that contradict CAPM:


Anomaly 1: The P/E Efect.
Financial analysts often compare a
stock price to other numbers to help
decide whether it is expensive or
cheap. The most common tool is the
price/earnings ratio: the stock price
divided by the company’s per-share
earnings. Orthodox theory calls that
a waste of time: Only beta, the
degree to which a stock does or
does not move with the rest of the
market, should matter to its price.
P/E should be meaningless. In fact,
several studies have found, stocks
with high P/E ratios tend to perform
worse than stocks with low ratios.
That is, of course, just common
sense: A stock for which you
overpay from the start is less likely
to give you a profit.

Anomaly 2: The Small-Firm-in-
January Efect. Shortly after the
P/E factor was studied, economists
discovered the “January effect”
mentioned earlier: a clear tendency
of the market to rally every January.
Then, a “small-firm effect” was
discovered: Portfolios of small-
company stocks outperformed large
companies by 4.3 percent,
economists found. And, further
study found, a “small-firm-in-
January” effect combining the two
phenomena was even more
pronounced than either on its own.
Again, the orthodox financial theory
wishes these effects away. When a
statistician looks for correlations
between prices and various factors
that could be affecting them, only
the stock-market beta should pop
out as having any importance whatsoever.

Anomaly 3: The Market-to-Book
Efect. Another common financial
ratio used by stock-pickers is
market-to-book: That is, divide the
stock price by the per-share value
that the company’s accountants
report in the financial reports, or
“book.” Surprise: Companies with
low ratios—that is, those that the
stock market values less than does
the company’s accountant—
perform better over time than
companies with high ratios. Of
course, this is nothing more than the
old Wall Street mantra, buy low,
sell high. And again, by the
standard theories, it should not
work.

Many more such anomalies have been reported
in economics journals. But this kind of research came to fruition in an especially influential 1992
paper by Fama and French. They tried to create the
economic equivalent of a double-blind drug trial,
devising tests and controls to prevent any
unintended bias fromslipping into the results. They
looked at the price/earnings effect and the
market/book effect—and found those two factors
alone could account for most of what differentiated
the profitability of one stock from another. Beta
was redundant. It was, Fama and French asserted,
“a shot straight at the heart of the (CAPM) model.”
That phrase has earned their work a shorthand title
among other economists: the beta-is-dead paper.

So much for CAPM. As for Black-Scholes, the
original options-pricing formula is now widely
accepted to be imprecise at best, and misleading at
worst. Finally, an especially lively pastime for
economists these days is to try poking holes in the
grand unified theory of modern finance, the
Efficient Markets Hypothesis that markets are
rational, prices reflect all available information,
and you cannot beat the market. In fact, it appears,
sometimes you can. By 1989, Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investment managers, had
guided Fidelity’s Magellan Fund to beat the market
index in eleven out of thirteen years. The odds of
Lynch accomplishing that by dumb luck, as the
Bachelier model would have it, are slim but not
impossible: About one chance out of 105,
according to one study. But it was not just the
frequency of success that was striking about
Magellan; its magnitude was more unusual. The
fund’s average annual return for the entire period
was 28 percent, compared to 17.5 percent for the
Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index. And for its first
seven years—when it was still a small fund, too
small for any detractors to argue that its size alone
gave it a competitive edge in the marketplace—
Magellan beat the market by an average 25 percent
a year. The odds of that occurring by dumb luck
are less than one in 10,000—“far beyond the
bounds of luck in an efficient market,” concluded
the study’s author, Alan J. Marcus, a Boston
College finance professor.",2021-08-28 09:46:25
ErnestMorrow,"**The Persistence of Error**

Then why, with so much evidence against the
orthodox financial models, do most economists
still teach them, and why do many financiers honor
them? If this were astronomy, the argument would
have ended long ago. Imagine observatories
suddenly finding a new planet where, the standard
theory says, none should be. And then another, and
another and another. Astronomers, after checking
their instruments, would not ignore the data; they
would question their understanding of celestial
mechanics and a new and fruitful episode in
astronomy would dawn. But it does not work that
way in economics, even though the equivalent of
countless new planetary sightings have been
recorded. In part, the profession’s reaction reflects
the nature of finance and statistics; there are few
open-andshut cases when an economist meets a
computer database. Yes, some of the individual
arguments against the standard model are by now
irrefutable: Prices are, indeed, abnormal and dependent. Some other arguments, such as “beta is
dead,” are strong but not bulletproof; millions of
words have gone, in the academic press, to
critique Fama and French’s paper.

And the high priests of modern financial theory
keep moving the target. As each anomaly is
reported, a “fix” is made to accommodate it. When
CAPM first came under attack, academic
economists devised a broader model, called
Arbitrage Pricing Theory. Rather than work with
just one factor, beta, APT incorporates as many
factors as desired: a beta for the market/book
effect, a beta for the price/earnings effect, a beta
for the state of the economy, and a beta for any
other factor that could conceivably affect stock
prices. Likewise, when it became clear that
volatility really does cluster and vary over time
rather than stay fixed as the standard model
expects, economists devised some new
mathematical tools to tweak the model. Those
tools, part of a statistical family called GARCH (a
name only a statistician could love), are now
widely used in currency and options markets.

But such ad hoc fixes are medieval. They work
around, rather than build from and explain, the
contradictory evidence. They are akin to the
countless adjustments that defenders of the old
Ptolemaic cosmology made to accommodate pesky
new astronomical observations. Repeatedly, the
defenders added new features to their ancient
model. They began with planetary “cycles,” then
corrected for the cycles’ inadequacies by adding
“epicycles.” When these proved inadequate, yet
another fix moved the center of the cycles away
fromthe center of the system. In the end, they could
fit all of the anomalous data well enough. As more
data arrived, new fixes could have been added to
“improve” the theory. They satisfied their early
customers, astrologers. But could they lead to
space flight? It took the combined efforts of Brahe,
Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler to devise a
simpler model, of a sun-centered system with
elliptical planetary orbits. The long and well-
documented history of successful sciences includes
many such examples of pyramids of fixes—but
they are viewed as stopgaps.

So again, why does the old order continue?
Habit and convenience. The math is, at bottom,
easy and can be made to look impressive,
inscrutable to all but the rocket scientist. Business
schools around the world keep teaching it. They
have trained thousands of financial officers,
thousands of investment advisers. In fact, as most
of these graduates learn from subsequent
experience, it does not work as advertised; and
they develop myriad ad hoc improvements,
adjustments, and accommodations to get their jobs
done. But still, it gives a comforting impression of
precision and competence.

It is false confidence, of course. The problem
lies at the roots of the standard model, in its
assumption that the best way to think about stock
markets is as a grand game of coin-tossing. If you
are going to use probability to model a financial
market, then you had better use the right kind of
probability. Real markets are wild. Their price
fluctuations can be hair-raising—far greater and
more damaging than the mild variations of
orthodox finance. That means that individual stocks and currencies are riskier than normally
assumed. It means that stock portfolios are being
put together incorrectly; far from managing risk,
they may be magnifying it. It means that some
trading strategies are misguided, and options mis-
priced. Anywhere the bell-curve assumption enters
the financial calculations, an error can come out.

History is replete with ironies. And it is one of
the greatest that the truly wild nature of markets
was re-discovered, at their cost, by two of the
most ardent formulators of orthodox economics,
Scholes and Merton. In 1993, the two Nobel
laureates joined some heavyweight Wall Street
bond traders in the creation of a new hedge fund,
Long-Term Capital Management LP. The partners
collectively contributed $100 million and raised a
war-chest that eventually topped $7 billion. Their
strategy was straightforward. They would scour
the world for occasions when, by their orthodox
valuation formulae, the prices of individual
options appeared to be wrong. They would bet
heavily—with a “leverage” or debt ratio as great
as 50-to-1—on the market’s eventually correcting the mistake. They had at one point twenty-five
Ph.D.’s on the payroll. As Sharpe, an onlooker to
the fund, told the Wall Street Journal, LTCM
“was probably the best academic finance
department in the world.”

But it blew up. After profits of 42.8 percent in
1995 and 40.8 percent in 1996, the fund in 1998 hit
turbulent markets. It had already started straying
fromthe pure academic strategy, taking hyper-risky
bets on the direction of bond prices rather than just
on market “mistakes”—much to the dismay of
Scholes. Then world tensions began mounting, and
bond prices began doing things that the models had
not forecast. The fund started losing money. In
August 1998 the Russian government defaulted on
its bonds, triggering a market meltdown. LTCM
had been one of the biggest Western traders in the
bonds, and was stuck without buyers. Worse,
contrary to the academic predictions, most of the
fund’s other investments started failing, too.
Global markets, far from displaying independent
price changes, were suddenly marching all in the
same direction at once: down. The same with volatility: up. After the fact, some economists
studied the market, and the record they compiled of
the market’s manic state is truly impressive. They
looked at the daily profits and losses of four of the
biggest global banks, as they invested in the
currency markets. To preserve the banks’
anonymity, they aggregated the data into one series.
But the effect is striking, nonetheless. The swings —up and down—at the height of the crisis show
just how wild markets can be.

A wild market. At the height of Russia’s 1998 debt
default, global markets passed through a hurricane.
This diagram, from Medova 2000, shows the
aggregate, daily profits and losses of four of the
world’s biggest banks during that period, as they
tried to cope with bucking foreign exchange
markets.


In the end, several banks reluctantly agreed to
bail out the fund through a $3.625 billion takeover.
That came only at the behest of the Federal
Reserve Board, which was concerned about a
wave of bankruptcies if LTCM went under.
Scholes himself later denied that the option-pricing
models played any but “a minor role” in the
debacle. But some of his partners do not see it
quite that way. John Meriwether, the fund’s prime
mover and the man who may have lost the most,
$150 million, told the Wall Street Journal : “Our
whole approach was fundamentally flawed.” In
launching a new fund in 2000 (Wall Street folk are
nothing if not resilient), he observed: “With
globalization increasing, you’ll see more crises.
Our whole focus is on the extremes now—what’s the worst that can happen to you in any situation—
because we never want to go through that again.”

moabal,"When I meet new prospects I dislike just listing what I do because frankly that is what everyone else does. Also, it depends on the client and scope of relationship.

I usually draw a graph and say something along the lines. ”In a perfect world, your personal wealth curve will grow exponentially if you assume a positive rate of return, periodic contributions, and time. However, there are pressures both good and bad (aka. stuff that happens in life) that pushes down on your ability for that curve to grow.”

A good financial plan factors all of these potential pressures. However, it is often difficult for someone to determine the right action steps, let alone recognize their own financial weaknesses. I specially state that the value propositions are Organization, Accountability, Objectivity, Proactivity, and Education.

Obviously, depends on the client. We have some clients that we have to beg to call us back to do our compliance enforced annual reviews. Others we talk to every month. 

From my observation (just an opinion), people who tend to post questions in this subreddit who are new to finance probably would be better off working with a good professional (obviously you have to find one first!). The people who tend to answers these questions are do it yourselfers. Same thing as those who watch financial entertainment on YouTube etc.

Basically they lock ETH for you but you get stETH. 1 Staked ETH on Lido = 1stETH. And every day they rebase your stETH so as to reflect the value of interest (so let's say you earn 0.1 ETH for staking 1 ETH your stETH becomes 1.1). So you also get more stETH every day you hold it in your wallet. You can sell it whenever you want wherever you want (available on Curve, Uniswap, balancer and many more dexes). 

PSA -  

1. Lido charges 10% fees on the rewards earned.
2. If you sell your stETH remember that you can't claim your locked ETH (this should be obvious but many people don't understand this part).

gmalis1,"Well, you just contradicted one of your statements.

Originally, you said that ""Seems like they made the whole customer population beta testers where there use to be actual beta testers before patches and updates went out messing up everyone’s data.""

Then you said ""Quicken has not been sufficiently beta testing"" (sic). 

So, which is it?  No beta testing or insufficient beta testing?

How do you know how many users have problems?  By looking at this forum or the Quicken Community?  How many Quicken users are there?  You can't answer any of those questions because you have zero clue as to the answers.

People on ANY forum are the ones complaining.  You're not going to see users that are happy with a product flocking to a forum to extol it's virtues and tell everyone how wonderful the product is.

Are there warts with Quicken?  Yep.  I could probably name 20 right now just off the top of my head.  Will those 20 get fixed in the next release?  Or ever?  Who knows?  Maybe they will.   Maybe they won't.  

None of them make the software unusable for me.  I rarely have transaction download issues, but all but one of my banks uses Direct Connect...a more reliable download method than Express Web Connect's screen scraper process.  I avoid the mobile and web apps.  I don't use Quicken's Bill Pay or download my bills via Quicken.  

Now, should all those work?  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I've learned to minimize my problems and avoided some pitfalls that make using Quicken or any other personal finance software frustrating.

Quicken is complex software with a very high learning curve.  It's not Mint, where you just let transactions download, fix some categories and you're done.  Users don't seem to get that.  Maybe because I started using Quicken prior to ANY downloading of transactions and transaction entry was manual entry only,  I have a greater sense of how Quicken should work.  

As to you being an accountant...goodie for you.  First off, learn to write a proper grammatical sentence.  And second, I'm a doctor.  So don't go flashing your credentials at me.  It holds zero weight.  

And finally...anyone who uses ANY product and is unhappy with it should move on to something else that fits their needs better.  The same holds true with Quicken.  Don't like it?  No one is holding a gun to your head to continue using it.",2021-08-30 20:47:09

[Exchange Traded Fund.  They have a low mgmt fee and let you buy into an idea without being stuck on a single stock.  You can get S&amp;P ETFs or Tech ETFs or Finance or Industrials or Semiconductor, etc.  If there's an industry you believe in but aren't sure where to start or want to stay diversified theyre great.  Also seeing some comments about meme stocks, Digital currency, etc.  At the end of the day you need to judge your tolerance for risk.  You're young, it's a good time to make a few risky bets that could pay off, if you have a risk-tolerant mindset.

Same with several others.  But I've lost a lot on others.  I've probably broken even on the WSB stuff but I like to gamble, which is really what that is.  Currenly I have a ton invested in 3x Bull ETFs (QQQ, SPXL, SOXL, etc) which allow me to take big risks on an idea rather than a specific stock.  But... I still hold meme stocks, normal every day stocks (MSFT, AMZN, HPQ, STLD, and a slew of others).  Sold most of my BTC throughout the last 10 years but held onto a handful.  Biggest thing is diversify.  If you gamble, also have a few conservative stocks.  Don't go all tech, etc.  What you've got is a great start, keep it up, in 10 years you'll look back and feel pretty damn good about what you've built.

[Shitty advice from a lot of people. You are young, concentrate on growth stocks. Don't buy these boomer stocks like F, and NOK. They are past their primes.

If you are thinking about dividends, AAPL, and MSFT both pay dividends. These are the leaders in their space and will continue to grow. You have many years ahead of you. Don't worry about the short-term. Unless you need the money to purchase a home then do not pull the money out. If I could've my told my younger self to keep the money invested and not take the short-term profit then I would have a lot more than what I have now. My avg cost on TSLA was $40 until I bought more last year before the s&amp;p addition. FB $25.

[&gt;but it's valuation seems like it already priced in many years of profit in advance and unparalleled growth.  Same for AMZN in 2013. Oh how wrong of an analysis that was. This will be the next FUD to die.. after Q2 killed the ""they're not profitable without regulatory credits"" FUD (that existed despite billions in positive operational cash flow).](/r/stocks/comments/pe5av4/tesla_diluted_share_count_and_ark_research/hawnwo6/)

[&gt;Traditional Auto OEMs I think are likely to find more EV success in their Trucks and SUV lines.  Absolutely.  The delivery market is the worst possible place to break in to the auto industry because of it's focus on fleet purchasers like AMZN, UPS, FDX.  For fleet purchases, the cost benefit of scale and the certainty of performance outweighs the cost benefit of operational improvements and the performance uncertainties that come with that.  So modest / incremental operational improvements can win the game pretty easily, especially if they continue over a long period.](/r/stocks/comments/pdt52s/is_there_any_world_where_rivian_and_lucid_dont/hatqx9c/)
